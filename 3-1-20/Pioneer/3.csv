0,03-1-20,India’s China agenda,"Compared to China, which is assertive and has undertaken innovative developments, India is definitively trailing. Preparation for any eventuality is the way forward to counter its rise

There is no doubt that 2019 has been a special year for China: Lavish events were organised to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In 1949, from the rostrum of the Tiananmen Square, Chairman Mao had announced, “China has arisen.” On October 1, 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping was on the same wavelength as his predecessor when he said, “No force can ever shake the status of China or stop the Chinese people and the nation from marching forward.” On that day, Beijing displayed several futuristic military gadgets.

On December 29, the Global Times listed China’s advanced weaponry. It said, “the year 2019” has been a “year of harvest” for China’s military equipment as the country showcased a “massive selection” of the latest, advanced and powerful weapons that operate on land, sea and air. It is not only in the field of advanced armaments that Beijing has been “doing well” but in this domain, the progress is indicative of an assertive China and of the innovative developments undertaken by Beijing. Comparatively, India is definitively trailing. Even though the communist party’s newspaper observed, “These displays of China’s new weapons showed transparency in the country’s military development” and sent a message to the world that China was determined to “safeguard sovereignty and peace,” the fact remains that China is still preparing itself.

Last week, in the Port of Dalian in Liaoning Province, China launched the country’s 23rd Type 052D and the sixth Type 055 destroyer. Experts said “the ship was one of the world’s largest and most powerful destroyers” and was capable of leading a high sea fleet or becoming the “pillar in an aircraft carrier battle group”, said the Global Times.

A few days earlier, China had officially commissioned its first domestically-built aircraft carrier, the Shandong. The CNN reported, “China has officially commissioned its first domestically-built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, a significant step forward in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambitions for the country to field a world-class Navy.” Xi attended the commissioning ceremony in the southern province of Hainan where the carrier joined the Chinese Navy. In 2019, China launched the highest number of warships in the world: Nine destroyers, one comprehensive supply ship, one comprehensive landing ship, one amphibious assault ship, 12 light frigates with a total displacement of 200,000 tonnes, surpassing the US by far.

The Global Times quoted military experts as saying, “2019 will not be the end of China’s military equipment development. More weapons are expected in 2020 and beyond.” But there is another side to the coin. President Xi has been facing a rough sea at home. The fourth plenary session of the 19th Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee was held in Beijing from October 28 to 31. The members discussed the work report presented by Xi and adopted it “to uphold and improve the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and improve the party’s capacity for law-based governance and law-based exercising of state power.”

The communiqué mentions, the nation is facing “increasing challenges at home and abroad.” The gathering upheld the principle of “one country, two systems,” maintaining lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, and “promoting the peaceful reunification of China.”

Despite the serious difficulties faced by China, India needs to be prepared to respond to its rise. But first, let’s talk about what India should not do. The two-day meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at a resort in October in Mamallapuram was an occasion to talk about “civilisation.” But was it of any help?

As it is, during Nehruvian days, India was fond of this hazy concept. The dictionary thus defines the term as “an act or a process of civilising, as by bringing out of a savage, uneducated, or unrefined state, or of being civilised.” Already, in the 1950s, this great “idea” allowed the Indian leadership to “dream” of lofty principles such as peaceful co-existence, while China was quietly consolidating its presence on the Tibetan plateau and preparing for a war with India.

Today, India should look after its own interests and forget about vague idealistic concepts. It should learn from the Chinese leadership, which has always remained pragmatic and down-to-earth. Unfortunately, when India speaks about its past, it does so to avoid talking about the present. This is what may have happened between India and China during the two-day encounter at Mamallapuram. Though it is not known what went on for two-and-a-half hours during the one-to-one dinner composed of exotic Tamil dishes, very few concrete decisions seem to have been taken. The Indian foreign secretary affirmed that the “K” word was not pronounced. This is regrettable for the occasion was opportune to clarify the Indian position.

One positive outcome from the meeting was the decision to establish a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism “with the objective of achieving enhanced trade and commercial relations, as well as to better balance the trade between the two countries.” This can, hopefully, help rebalance the trade deficit — today in India’s disfavour.

An example of a positive pragmatic policy for India has been the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). A day before the end of the year, the Government finally nominated Gen Bipin Rawat, outgoing Chief of Army Staff, as the first CDS “to drive the desperately-needed integration among the three services.”

But why did we have to wait for one day before the end of Gen Rawat’s tenure to see his name released? There was probably an intense lobbying from the babus to preserve their turf. The history of modern India is a Mahabharata between the progressive forces, which want to change “eternal Bharat”, and the entrenched administration sticking to their privileges.

To win this battle would be the best way to counter China. As Rawat was handing over the baton to Gen MM Naravane, his successor, he was asked a question: Is the Army better prepared today to face the security challenges than when he took over? Gen Rawat replied, “Yes, we are better prepared.”

Preparation for any eventuality is the way forward to counter the rise of China. At the same time, India needs to continue investing in infrastructure, telecommunication systems, roads, airports and border areas while also providing a decent living and empowering frontier populations. In the future, Artificial Intelligence (AI), latest telecommunication means and new technologies should be indigenously developed if India does not want to be left behind. Only then will China respect India and will not be tempted to engage in an adventure like it did in 1962. This is a tough agenda for 2020.

1,03-1-20,Birth-death registration to be on CRS portal from Feb 1: UP CS,"The Uttar Pradesh government has directed all departments concerned with the birth-death registration programme to register 100 per cent births and deaths on the Civil Registration System (CRS) software prepared by the Registrar General of India.

UP Chief Secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari in his directive said that according to the NITI Aayog Health Index Report-2018, birth registration was found to be 60.70 per cent relative to the total annual birth estimate in the state due to which the health index was adversely affected.

He said the NITI Aayog and Union Health Ministry were evaluating the states on the basis of registration done in the CRS.

Tiwari said that after January 31, 2020, the parallel system of birth-death registration through e-district portal and e-city service should be completely closed and the CRS portal should be used by all registration units from February1, 2020.

The chief secretary issued this directive to the principal secretaries of Urban Development and Panchayati Raj departments and all district magistrates through a circular on Thursday.

He said the Panchayati Raj and Urban Development departments should be onboard the CRS portal so that the departments concerned could directly register births and deaths on the CRS portal or through hyperlink.

He said for the use of CRS portal for birth-death registration, the departments concerned had been instructed to make necessary changes in the e-district portal and e-city service portal system.

The chief secretary said that alternative arrangements should also be made for permissible fees while applying for registration through the common service centre.

Tiwari said that all private medical institutions registered with the chief medical officer’s office in all districts of the state would serve as information provider on the CRS software. He added that additional district registrar (birth-death)/chief medical officer of the district concerned should provide them user ID and password for the purpose.

He said that the Panchayati Raj and Urban Development departments should coordinate with chief registrar (birth-death)/director general, Medical and Health Services, Uttar Pradesh and ensure training of officers and employees related to birth-death registration work.

Tiwari said that if for some reason the user ID and password related to the CRS software was not available to the registrars and officers concerned of the registration units located in the district, the department concerned should establish co-ordination with the chief registrar (birth-death) and director general, Medical and Health Services.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/birth-death-registration-to-be-on-crs-portal-from-feb-1--up-cs.html
2,03-1-20,"Congress, oppn parties supporting PFI: Rizvi","Uttar Pradesh Shia Central Waqf Board chairperson Waseem Rizvi accused Congress and other opposition parties of supporting Popular Front of India (PFI), which was responsible for large-scale violence during protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the state.

Alleging that the PFI had links with international terror outfit ISIS, Rizvi said that it was evident that these anti-national forces were misusing madarsas, particularly those situated on the Indo-Nepal border, for executing their nefarious activities.

In a statement issued in Lucknow on Thursday, the Shia Waqf Board chief said that it was unfortunate that such outfits with shady backgrounds were being supported by political parties, including Congress.

“I have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the presence of these anti-national forces in madarsas on Indo-Nepal border during my visit to some waqfs there. After my letter to the PM, I received threatening letters from these outfits and even some clerics, under pressure from these organisations, issued fatwa against me,” he said.

Rizvi said that the intelligence agencies knew about the presence of anti-national forces in madarsas and they were tracking their movement.

“I had also said that if such activities were not stopped, then 50 per cent of the Muslims in the country would develop ISIS mentality in the next 15 years,” he said.

The Shia Waqf Board chairman appealed to all Muslims not to support any anti-national outfit and instead join the country’s development and brotherhood for their uplift.

Meanwhile, the UP government recommended to the Centre that the PFI be banned. The outfit was found to be involved in major violence in the state, particularly in Lucknow, during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The police have already arrested more than 40 PFI activists and sympathisers so far across the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress--oppn-parties-supporting-pfi--rizvi.html
3,03-1-20,Sonbhadra clash: Five cops held responsible for laxity ... asked to deposit 30 days’ salary as fine,"



|

Almost six months after 11 tribals were killed in a land-related clash in Ubha village of Sonbhadra district on July 17 last year, the UP Police held five policemen responsible for the laxity and asked them to deposit a month’s salary as fine.

The brutal attack had also left 21 people injured when village headman Yagya Dutt and his supporters opened fire on a rival group while trying to forcibly occupy 90 bighas of land in Ghorawal area of Sonbhadra.

“The five policemen have been served notices to deposit their 30 days’ salary as fine,” Superintendent of Police of Sonbhadra, Ashish Srivastava, said on Thursday.

“When village head Yagya Dutt tried to forcibly grab the disputed land, Inspector Shiv Kumar Mishra and his predecessor Mool Chand Chauhan did not pay heed to complaints by Gond tribals,” the SP said.

“They handled the matter with a prejudiced approach,” Srivastava said, and added, “Three constables — Kanhaiya Lal, Sudhakar Yadav and Pramod Kumar Singh — did not act as per the rule of law and followed directions of their senior officers. These cops were found ignoring the complaint of locals expressing apprehension of some untoward incident just before the incident took place on July 17.”

Days after the clash, the state government suspended five officials, including a sub-divisional magistrate posted in Ghorawal.

Nearly 30 people were arrested in connection with the violence.

Meanwhile, the Renuka Kumar Committee set up by the Yogi Adityanath government to probe the reasons behind the Sonbhadra massacre, found that government land worth Rs 700 crore was under illegal occupation.

The report, which was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, stated that several Congress leaders and retired bureaucrats also illegally occupied land in the region.

Sources said that the report said that more than 1,000 acres of land was under illegal occupation and 650 acres was occupied by co-operative societies.

The main accused, Yagya Dutt, had brought around 200 supporters on 32 tractors to take possession of 36 acres of disputed land in the area. As their attempt was opposed by the tribals, who were tilling the land, Dutt’s men fired on them indiscriminately. The carnage went on for more than 30 minutes and when the firing stopped, bodies of victims were seen littered on the ground.

While the tribals had been cultivating the land for generations, they lacked ownership titles even though they had been asking for it for decades.

Yagya Dutt claimed that he had purchased the land 10 years ago from a local family. The probe said that in 1955, a large piece of land was transferred to a cooperative society formed by a family as per a government scheme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sonbhadra-clash--five-cops-held-responsible-for-laxity-----asked-to-deposit-30-days----salary-as-fine.html
4,03-1-20,Police submit chargesheet in connection with death of Unnao rape victim,"Within a month of a 23-year-old rape victim being fatally torched by five men in Unnao, the Special Investigation Team submitted a chargesheet in a court, maintaining that there was enough evidence to get the accused punished.

“There is ample proof against the five accused and a chargesheet was prepared based on those evidences and it was submitted in a designated court on Wednesday,” Additional Superintendent of Police Vinod Kumar Pandey, who was heading the SIT, said on Thursday.

The Unnao rape victim, with 90 per cent burns, was intially brought to Syama Prasad Mukherjee Hospital (Civil Hospita) in Lucknow for treatment after being set afire by five men, including two rapists. on December 5.

She was heading to a railway station in Unnao to catch a train to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing in a rape case filed by her when she was set on fire. The same evening, she was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to Safdarjung Hospital for specialised treatment but died due to a cardiac arrest on December 6, 2019.

In her statement to Sub-Divisional Magistrate Dayashankar Pathak, the victim had said that she was attacked when she reached Gaura turn close to her home on way to the railway station. She specifically named Harishankar Trivedi, Ram Kishore Trivedi, Umesh Bajpai, Shivam Trivedi and Shubham Trivedi as the men who set her on fire.

Earlier, the woman had also alleged that Shivam and Shubham Trivedi had abducted and raped her in December, 2018 aftere which a case was registsred, the duo were arrested and the case was being heard in a Rae Bareli court.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-submit-chargesheet-in-connection-with-death-of-unnao-rape-victim.html
5,03-1-20,PGV slams PM over Sec 144 in Varanasi on ‘359 days’,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, saying that he had the ‘gall’ to tell people that they had nothing to fear when Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was imposed in his constituency, Varanasi, on 359 out of 365 days in a year.

The CrPC section empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area.

Taking to Twitter, Priyanka cited a media report which quoted a Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student as saying that in the 365 days of 2019, Section 144 was imposed in PM Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi for 359 days.

“Despite the prohibitory orders being imposed for such a long period in his constituency, the PM has the gall to say that people have nothing to fear?” Priyanka said in her tweet.

Meanwhile, former minister and Congress leader Naseemuddin Siddiqui targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday, alleging that a fake propaganda was being made on Twitter to defame him on communal lines.

“BJP spokesman Sambit Patra and another party leader made claims through Twitter that I had made a statement saying that I was a Muslim first and then an Indian. This is totally false and baseless,” Siddiqui said during a press conference in Lucknow on Thursday.

“Neither was the person making the statement in the video uploaded by Patra me nor was it my voice,” he claimed.

“I have already written to the Director General of Police (DGP) as well as SSP of Lucknow to get a case registered in the matter and get the accused behind the false propaganda against me and my party, arrested,” he said.

Siddiqui demanded an unconditional apology from BJP spokesman Sambit Patra and threatened to sue him in the court if he refused to withdraw the false propaganda on the social media.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pgv-slams-pm-over-sec-144-in-varanasi-on----359-days---.html
6,03-1-20,Mayawati questions Priyanka’s silence on Kota deaths,"Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati hit out at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for visiting Uttar Pradesh cities to meet families of those killed or injured during the anti-CAA protests but not going to Kota in Rajasthan, where 103 infants have died in the last 35 days at JK Lone Hospital.

In a tweet, Mayawati posted, “It is just due to the Congress government’s laxity that such a large number of children died in Kota. The death of 100 children in Rajasthan’s Kota district is very sad and painful. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his government are still insensitive, disinterested and irresponsible, which is highly condemnable.”

The BSP chief questioned the silence of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on the death of infants in Kota district and said she should have met the women who had lost their children in a state where the Congress was in power.

“It is unfortunate that a woman leader like Priyanka is silent on such a serious issue. Would have been better had she met the mothers of the children in Kota, like she did in UP,” she said.

In another tweet, Mayawati alleged that if Priyanka did not go to Kota, it would mean that her visiting UP and meeting the anti-CAA protesters’ families, was a political drama enacted for vested interest and the people of UP should become cautious.

Meanwhile, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that the top priority of his government was to extend best health care services and that the death of infants in Kota should not be politicised.

“I welcome a delegation of Union government to provide better healthcare services in the state. We are ready to take inputs from them. The administration is committed to making Rajasthan ‘nirogi’ (healthy)’ .The media is welcome to report on facts without any pressure,” he tweeted.

Meanwhile, in another tweet, Mayawati said, “The BSP has been opposing the divisive CAA/NRC, while the Congress is trying to derive political mileage. This is extremely unfortunate.”

The BSP chief also reviewed the preparations for the upcoming Delhi assembly elections and held detailed discussions on selection of candidates.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mayawati-questions-priyanka---s-silence-on-kota-deaths.html
7,03-1-20,"Yogi slams Sonia, PGV insensitivity to Kota deaths","Hitting out at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over her silence on the death of infants in a state-run hospital in Kota district of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s office sought to know on Thursday why she was not visiting the families of the infants who died in the Congress-ruled state.

In a series of tweets in Hindi, the CM’s office lashed out at the Congress leader saying: “Rather than engaging in political drama in UP, had Ms Vadra met those poor, affected mothers who lost their children only due to negligence of her party’s government, those families would have got some solace.”

Another tweet said, “She is neither worried about anyone, nor has any sympathy for anybody, instead of public service she is doing politics.”

A third tweet said, “The apathy, insensitivity and irresponsible attitude of the Congress government and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan and silence in this matter is saddening.”

Earlier, a tweet expressed concern over the death of about 100 children in Kota in the last 35 days and said that it was extremely sad and heart-wrenching.

“Mothers losing their children is a blot on any civilised society, human values and sensibilities. It is extremely upsetting that despite being women, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra are not able to understand the grief of the mothers,” the tweet said.

Another tweet said it would have been better had Priyanka met and consoled the aggrieved mothers instead of indulging in politics in UP.

Yogi Adiyanath also slammed the Rajasthan government and tweeted, “The indifference, insensitive, and irresponsible attitude of the Congress government in Rajasthan and of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is sad”.

As many as 103 children have died at JK Lone Hospital in Kota in the last 35 days, inviting severe criticism from the opposition and people.

Ten of the deaths took place within 48 hours between December 23 and 24. The hospital superintendent said that the children died mainly due to low birth weights.

National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also visited the hospital and later served a show-cause notice on the Congress government in the state.

Incidentally, in August, 2017, over 60 children had died at Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur, allegedly due to shortage of oxygen.

The incident had sparked widespread criticism and pediatrician at the hospital, Dr Kafeel Khan, was suspended and put behind bars for nine months only to be cleared of the charges later on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-slams-sonia--pgv-insensitivity-to-kota-deaths.html
8,03-1-20,Integrated efficiency,"The CDS has to overcome many turf wars, the one within services and the other with the bureaucracy

The appointment of Gen Bipin Rawat as Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) is a much-needed first step in military reforms. There can be no doubt about the need for a unified military command in resource-challenged times when warfare is all about technology and smart integrated manoeuvres. In an age of high potency threats and quick scrambles for a reactive strategy, our security apparatus cannot be fragmented but must appear to be working in tandem and as a complete ecosystem. However, the creation of this post is not enough without a sound execution strategy. And going by the delay in setting up the office — the recommendation for CDS was made in 2001 by a Group of Ministers on national security, headed by the then deputy Prime Minister LK Advani — top defence management needs to be a priority. Of course, there are challenges in implementation and a tussle for control implied in an overlap of civilian and defence authorities and procedural duplication. The CDS’ status is equal to that of a Cabinet Secretary. He will be the principal military advisor to the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), the National Security Council (NSC), the Defence Minister and the Home Minister (on internal security in disturbed areas and border management). He must assist the NSC to formulate and review the national security strategy and execute it. And though theoretically, he would still have to work with the Defence Secretary and function with the Ministry of Defence (MoD), this could lay the ground for a territorial war of egos between existing bureaucracy and the military leadership. For the CDS would ultimately reduce the tasks of the MoD and the service headquarters to joint entities. The CDS will need to be a bridge on many counts. First, he has to reconcile the three services, which are perennially caught in a hierarchical war. The fact that the first CDS comes from the Army will always bear on his decisions as either preferential or impartial. Second, there is the tough challenge of professionalising the Defence Ministry and cutting through the red tape, where workable policies mean an inclusion of sector experts, experienced strategists and serving chiefs. If the CDS gets caught up in turf issues, then the whole purpose of his office would be defeated. In the absence of clarity of what he can and cannot do, there will always be speculation about whether he can overreach himself in a civilian structure. The sooner that role is defined, the better it is for operational integrity.

The CDS also needs to be backed up by theatre commands for no unified structure can operate without these. As of now, we have just one theatre command in Andaman & Nicobar islands though three others are already on the drawing board relating to cybersecurity, space and special forces divisions. A time-bound plan must be made as to how many theatre commands are required in our specific scenario. Most importantly, we need to develop our own template than rely on existing ones, simply because we need to rationalise budgets, infrastructure and manpower. Without optimising our resources, no goodwill can be earned on this initiative as we continue to question hikes in defence budgets while compromising spends in social sectors. Besides, the forces may actually need to use some civilian experts on smart management and organisational flows to build efficiencies in the integrated defence architecture. So that transparency is needed. There is also a need to define the CDS’ role as a military advisor to the Nuclear Command Authority. Since operational command will gradually shift to theatre commanders and the CDS, there will be some erosion of power among service chiefs. Obviously, the long-term purpose is about streamlining the forces and that will impact key decisions on manpower, procurement and choice of arms buys and an overhaul of the administrative structure as we know it. While it is true that hybrid wars cannot afford old set-ups, the Government has to make sure there are no misgivings about this new martial command formula. At the same time, multiple and newer threats are real and hovering at our doorstep. India’s first CDS, therefore, has a lot of ground to cover and little time to win trust. The Government has to set firm timelines for this initiative.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/integrated-efficiency-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/integrated-efficiency.html
9,03-1-20,New Year births,"No cheer there as a whopping 30 per cent of our youth aged between 15 to 30 years are neither studying nor working

The first day of the new decade saw the birth of an estimated 400,000 babies around the world with India recording the highest number at 67,385, a whopping 17 per cent of the new births. We managed to leave behind the world’s most populous country China, which welcomed 46,299 newborns the same day. The good news is that according to the UNICEF, child mortality is down in the country and worldwide as in the last 30 years, the number of deaths of children under five fell over 50 per cent. According to a Government report titled Children in India 2018 — A Statistical Appraisal, there has been a significant fall in the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in the country from 46 in 2011 to 34 in 2016. The Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR) has also gone down to approximately 39 for 2016. However, the figures worldwide are not so positive as far as newborns are concerned. In 2018, a whopping 47 per cent babies died in the first month of their birth, which is an increase of seven per cent from 1990. Though each life is a cause to celebrate because of the potential it holds, India, which is already labouring under the burden of overpopulation, hardly has a reason to cheer. As it is the country’s population is expected to exceed that of China’s by 2027. We are projected to add nearly 273 million people to our piece of the planet between 2019 and 2050. This, in a country which is unable to feed its children as is evident by our dismal performance in the Global Hunger Index. India slipped from the 95th rank in 2010 to the 102nd in 2019, behind its neighbours Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan!

Though our burgeoning millions make us an attractive market for most countries, we have a demographic slag to deal with besides distorted development paradigms. The lack of employment opportunities in rural areas has seen a rise in migratory flows to urban areas and by the middle of the century, half of the population will be in cities. This will result in more urban slums, law and order problems and stretch the already thinly spread water, power resources, sanitation facilities and urban infrastructure. The Government is already struggling under a healthcare burden. Despite a huge middle class, a whopping 25 per cent people live on less than Rs 143 a day. India accounts for one in three of the global population living in poverty. Unemployment is at a 45-year high and in the next 20 years, the number of job-seekers or working-age population is expected to go up by more than 200 million. A whopping 30 per cent of the country’s youth aged between 15 to 30 years are neither studying nor working. Till we cannot guarantee a good life to our children, we must hang our heads and apologise to them as they did not ask to be born in this mess that we have created.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-year-births-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/new-year-births.html
10,03-1-20,Do more with less,"Resource efficiency is a key strategy that can transform the linear production-consumption system to one that is circular, thereby preventing wastage and overuse of virgin materials

Economic development and human well-being hinge on the availability of natural resources on affordable terms. India’s ambition of high growth and meeting human aspirations has led to the widespread use of natural resources, many of which are non-renewable and import-dependent. For example, crude oil. In 2018, India imported more than 225 million tonnes of crude oil at a cost of $ 130 billion. India’s demand for fuel and non-fuel resources has been skyrocketing in recent times owing to strong economic growth and technological advancements. Between 1990 and 2017, India’s material consumption increased almost three times from 2.5 billion tonnes to 7.4 billion tonnes.

Continued reliance on virgin materials from within India and outside for driving economic growth will not only have adverse consequences on their future availability and costs but also pose a serious threat to the environment. “Doing more with less”, also known as “resource efficiency”, has emerged as a key strategy that can transform the conventional linear production-consumption system to one that is circular, thereby preventing resource wastage and overuse of virgin materials by industries.

Resource efficiency encompasses a wide variety of technologies, processes, policy and institutional interventions along with the product and service life cycle stages. These typically include mining, design, manufacturing, consumption and end-of-life. Resource efficiency promotes life cycle thinking that helps in identifying opportunities to reduce material/resource footprint along the value chain, thus improving resource productivity and value enhancement. A resource-efficient economy would help, for example, extend product life, develop products that can be kept in circulation to minimise loss of resources, close material loops, reduce landfill dumping, and degenerating resources (incineration of waste) and so on.

The United Nations Development Agenda of 2030 (UN 2016), too, recognises the importance of efficient use of natural resources through SDG-12, i.e. promotion of sustainable consumption and production (SCP). By becoming a signatory to the UNSDG, India has committed to achieving sustainable consumption and production by 2030 by substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, reuse and recycling. India’s commitment towards promoting sustainable consumption and production is reflected through the recent draft of the Resource Efficiency policy prepared by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). The draft of the National Resource Efficiency Policy, 2019, is considered to be a significant step towards the desired transition as it will help identify opportunities and facilitate thinking and support action towards closing resource use loops by establishing links and synergies across existing sectoral and/or resource-specific strategies.

One of the key aspects the policy focusses on is establishing an institutional mechanism that intends to promote inter-ministerial engagement and facilitate exchange of ideas for implementation on resource efficiency. The consequent changes in regulation and policies are expected to generate new economic opportunities and business models, resource-efficient products and services and increase investment and employment.

Transport is a major resource-consuming sector with high environmental impacts. A transition from personalised vehicle ownership to shared facilities can significantly improve resource efficiency in the sector. It has the potential to not only attract economic investments but also create employment opportunities for thousands of Indians.

Sustainable agricultural methods can increase yield, reduce the environmental impact and improve profitability for farmers. Further, labelling and retailing will create a market for these products at the domestic level. Strategies for reduction in food loss during handling and transit will go a long way in meeting increased per capita availability of food. In the urban environment, car-pooling clubs, sharing of building services and office spaces would also lead to saving of resources while the use of innovative building and infrastructure design and resource-efficient inputs can achieve significant energy savings.

Pricing externalities linked to resource extraction and use through taxes can increase the prices of virgin raw materials, thereby generating the economic incentive to use them more efficiently and make the secondary resources more price competitive. Resource efficiency standards are an extremely important enabling factor to promote the use of secondary raw material and products made from them. These standards not only enable identification of resource-efficient products or raw material but also indicate their quality and enhance acceptability.

Higher acceptance will lead to increased demand and generation of economies of scale. However, large-scale awareness generation efforts and demonstration projects will need to be undertaken to change perceptions about products made from waste/secondary raw material. Further, setting up of mandatory targets for recycled content in new products will stimulate and support responsible consumption demands from both consumers and businesses.

Participation, collective action and commitments from all major stakeholders, including industry, policymakers, Government agencies, academic, and civil society organisations comprising non-profit institutions, think tanks, business groups, consumers, technology developers and solution providers are essential. But this will need the support of administrative and management mechanisms for implementation and enforcement of resource efficiency measures. Business models can also be developed to design products to use them for as long as possible, reusing and then remanufacturing them at the end of service life. Further, the creation of financing mechanisms that include meeting the requirement of viability gap funding will make these business models scalable, replicable and will be able to generate larger social, economic and environmental benefits.

Technology could play an important role by enabling application of circular economy principles on a larger scale by improving access to information, management of materials through efficient recovery and recycling, tracking and logistics, transparency and accountability. Good practice guidelines and manuals help in standardisation to the extent possible and in mainstreaming resource efficiency across businesses and their value chains. India’s MSMEs form the backbone of the industrial sector. Due to the paucity of financial and human capital, resource-efficient strategies for MSMEs might remain a distant dream. Although there are schemes for these industries, there is a need to strengthen the existing industrial ecosystem between large and small entities by bringing in more capacity development, process and product development and support green procurement.

State governments and local authorities can focus on their sectoral priorities and design resource-efficient strategies at their level and become leaders in fostering resource efficiency and circular economy at the sub-national level. Given that the Niti Aayog has highlighted the importance of competitive federalism, the focus on State-level resource efficiency strategies will help in the creation of a competitive edge. Circular thinking can be embedded in designing the municipal services provision, integration of circularity principles in procurement processes and related tenders and in setting up the infrastructure of urban industrial symbiosis.

It is important to also emphasise on the need for systems thinking and consider resources from a supply chain perspective, using a life cycle approach. There is a need to tap into the synergised knowledge and expertise of different ministries and departments of the Government and promote holistic consideration and recognition of resource efficiency challenges.

Further, a monitoring process that helps assess the resource use, efficiency of sectors and resources with harmonised metrics and regular publication of results could give resource efficiency a higher profile in India’s economic growth pathway.

11,03-1-20,The empire strikes back,"Volkswagen Group has had a torrid few years in India and across the world thanks to the ‘Dieselgate’ imbroglio. But 2020 is a big year for the carmaker and it starts with luxury brand Audi leading the charge with the Q8 SUV

The first two decades of the 21st century have been kind to Dubai. From a relatively sleepy little town, it is now the symbol of the modern metropolis, and let alone its airport, which is now the greatest international hub in the world. Dubai boasts some of the most stunning architectural marvels in the world, including the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building on the planet. It was in the shadow of this spire that we began our drive of Audi’s latest offering, the new Q8. And we took it to the desert. In fact, there isn’t much desert near the city anymore and the Dubai Desert Conservation Area is a good 90 minutes of fast driving outside the city.

But now, the car. First things first, dispel any notion that the Q8 is larger than the Q7. It is not. In fact, while it shares the platform with the older SUV, it is shorter than the Q7 and sits lower as well. Coupled with its sloping roofline, this is a SUV that puts the “sports” back into the name. It is in a sense, competing with the BMW X6 and Range Rover Sport. When it launches in India on January 15, it will set you back a pretty penny at Rs 1.5 crore.

For that kind of money, you should get a lot. And you do. The Q8 we drove in Dubai was in S-Line specification and our particular car came with beautiful 22-inch wheels, and it must be said that despite such large wheels and thin tyres, particularly on a SUV, on some pretty rough stretches of the road, the Q8 rode masterfully. I would not want to take this car for hardcore off-roading but it can deal with bad roads. Although in India Trim, it will most likely come with 18-inch wheels as standard and possibly 19 and 20-inch wheels are available as an option.

The Q8, however, is not a standard car and Balbir Singh Dhillon, the new honcho at Audi India, tells me that the Q8 will be completely customisable, provide a huge choice of exterior colours with over eight interior colour options with the ability to mix and match wood veneer inlays or even carbon fibre ones. “This car will be driven,” says Dhillon and adds, “And owners who drive themselves will want their cars to say something about them. We give them that option. Of course, there will be a stock car as well.”

Ergo, the Q8 will not be a big seller but Dhillon and the marketing folks at Audi are seriously hoping that the Q8 will not be as rare as the herd of Oryx that we crossed in the desert. The Oryx, an antelope indigenous to the Arabian Peninsula, once common across the Arabia, now survives only in small protected zones. Much like how Audi has been hunted down in the past three years by its German rivals BMW and Mercedes. That’s because the German carmaker and its parent, Volkswagen, are still paying the bill from the fiasco of the Dieselgate crisis, a reminder of which are the approximately half-million Audi and Volkswagen diesel cars parked in lots across the United States which were bought back at immense cost and that is before the huge fines. In fact, Audi’s man at the helm during the crisis was arrested for his role in it.

So it isn’t surprising that the Q8, when it comes to India, will be available with only a petrol engine, much like the recently launched next-generation A6 luxury sedan. The Q8, as far as we know for the time being, will be equipped in 55TFSI trim. While you cannot ask anyone to make sense of how the German manufacturers name their products anymore, what this means is that this three-litre V6 petrol engine will produce 340 horsepower, which, I can assure you, propels the car forward very fast. Of course, there is something else about Dubai that you must know, it is the land of speed cameras and if you exceed the (generous) limits, you can be fined a fair bit. So there was no finding out of how fast the Q8 is but it can go pretty fast. For the time being, this is the peppiest and most fun sporty and large SUV out there. It might be eclipsed by the potential arrival later this year of the RS version of the Q8 which borrows the 600 horsepower motor from the RS6 but that is another story for another time.

Dhillon did admit that there are a class of Audi buyers who love diesel cars and he wanted to assure them that Audi will be bringing in some diesel options later this year. But come April 1, 2020, Audi, alongside other manufacturers including Maruti-Suzuki, will not be selling diesel vehicles in their line-up thanks to the regulation around Bharat Stage 6 emission norms. To be fair, manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and even Hyundai and Kia have said that they will make their diesels available in BS6 but there is a significant price issue to meet BS6 emission norms. Diesel vehicles need all sorts of new filters and even spray the exhaust with something called ‘Ad-Blue’, which in essence is a mixture of water and urea. Audi will most likely bring in a two-litre BS6 compatible diesel later in the year.

But Audi is just the tip of the spear for Volkswagen Group in India for 2020. The company, now under the leadership of Skoda, which frankly it should always have been, is positioning 2020 as a make-or-break year for itself. There are some vital new launches from the Skoda and Volkswagen stable coming later in the year and one hopes that this fresh line-up will help all the brands of the carmakers. Other than Lamborghini and Porsche, whose sales are up (Weak economy? What weak economy?).",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-empire-strikes-back-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-empire-strikes-back.html
12,03-1-20,A stitch in time saves nine,"Communities are strengthened if people are ready to handle any crisis. So disaster-prepared citizens form the foundation of a resilient society

India is no stranger to natural calamities like cyclones, earthquakes and floods, particularly in recent years as the effects of climate change are being felt across the world. Add to these man-made catastrophes like fires, building collapses, industrial and transport accidents and the list of disasters that test the resilience of our communities is indeed a long one. Ideally, our citizens should be prepared to tackle any such mishap but the ground reality is very different as most people in the country don’t know even the basics where it comes to handling disasters.

The need to build our contingency preparedness becomes even more acute when one considers that a nation of India's scale still lacks the optimal level of institutionalised resources across the length and breadth of the country for efficient and effective disaster management. It is also worth noting that a significant number of fatalities occur post-event, during any disaster, due to mismanaged handling of the victims by the first-responders eager to help but who lack the basic knowledge of how to manage crisis situations.

Sometimes even institutional teams can need the help of citizens when they find themselves in a dangerous situation, like the one the Delhi Fire Service personnel found themselves in after a battery factory collapsed in northwest Delhi's Peera Garhi following an explosion due to a fire that broke out early in the morning. Even though 18 people were rescued from the building, one firefighter was killed and 14 others were hurt when the structure collapsed trapping them inside.

This is a gap which some non-profit organisations are filling by equipping our citizens with disaster management and crisis preparedness skills so that they can prevent unnecessary catastrophic situations from flaring up. They want to ensure that citizens are not a liability to the institutional teams if such a disaster does occur but are able to complement them and are able to help reduce the toll a disaster takes on the local population. They want to make our communities ready for all the activities that go behind disaster management.

One such example is a foundation in Maharashtra's earthquake-prone Palghar that targets schoolchildren, resident associations, factories and corporates to build their disaster management and crises response skills. Its founder, Bhupendra Mishra, left his job at the State Government's civil defence organisation to prepare people for a crisis as he had experienced first hand the disastrous results of an industrial accident in his childhood and later in life while helping a railway accident victim. These experiences made him realise the lack of preparedness and awareness about disasters in our communities and motivated him to turn into a social entrepreneur. Now communities are being trained by the foundation in numerous first aids, victim handling, tackling fires, basic rescue operations and evacuation techniques, managing mobs, imparting Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and so on.

This discourse about building disaster management skills in our citizens to make our communities more resilient is picking up globally as well, including in the USA where successive hurricanes have wrought havoc across its south and south-east.

But the idea to talk of this need is not to make our communities excessively worried by colouring disasters as an impending doom or Armageddon but to make the citizens better aware and prepared in case any eventuality ever occurs. Since the resilience of our communities is only strengthened if our citizens are better prepared to handle any crises, it may be safe to opine that disaster-prepared citizens are the foundation of a resilient community.

Ironically, most human resource courses in MBA colleges, especially in India, are yet to imbibe disaster management in their curriculum, despite the fact the eventual growth in the manufacturing sector in fast-growing emerging markets could lead to industrial accidents, which in turn would mean lawsuits. Since prevention is better than cure, building better preparedness of the human resource executives to be deputed at such establishments would not only save the direct costs of the accident, but also the indirect legal costs. That alone is a significant economic opportunity to look at disaster management skills more seriously.

Top-down systematic funding would go a long way to institutionalise the system of disaster management training throughout the country. Currently, only a small handful of Corporate Social Responsibility funds and agencies are funding these efforts of the non-profits in India. This should be scaled up if a paradigm transformation of our citizens' level of preparedness is to be realised. Countries like ours need to relook at how we are building crisis preparedness in our communities. After all, everyone has a role to play during a disaster. However, making ourselves better prepared would go a long way to making our roles more effective and efficient.

13,03-1-20,Fight TB through innovations,"India contributes to 27 per cent of the burden of tuberculosis in the world. However, diligent efforts and constant determination may enable the country to demonstrate leadership in the control of this communicable disease

An alarming number of 2.69 million cases of tuberculosis have been reported in India by the World Health Organisation Report (WHO), 2019. As of now, India contributes to 27 per cent of the global burden of tuberculosis. However, diligent efforts and constant determination may enable the country to demonstrate leadership in the control of this communicable disease. The country, though reeling under an immense population burden, has the potential to achieve tuberculosis elimination through innovations in healthcare technology.

India possesses the capacity to serve as the global centre for innovations focussed on neglected diseases and the current technological advancements that exist are inadequate to bridge gaps in neglected diseases that affect the Indian population. At this juncture, it is important to nurture the innovation ecosystem in India and increase investment in the same. It is imperative to integrate cutting-edge technology and systems in all aspect of healthcare, particularly surveillance and monitoring mechanisms, diagnostic technologies, treatment approaches, preventive and palliative strategies and the systems required to make healthcare available and accessible to all those in need.

The National Strategic Plan 2017-2025 for tuberculosis elimination by the Government endorses innovations and technologies through collaborative efforts by Government bodies and organisations, including civil society organisations and the private sector players.

It is on these lines that the India Health Fund (IHF) was conceptualised to strengthen the health ecosystem by bridging the gap between the laboratory and the market and translating proof-of-concepts into a sustainable impact.

The health fund aims to foster out-of-the-box thinking aimed at eliminating tuberculosis and malaria by 2025 and 2030 respectively, which is aligned with the vision of the Government. In an attempt to serve as a catalyst for change, it provides a platform for innovators to support strategic products and processes that would result in reduction of suffering and deaths occurring due to these infectious diseases.

The IHF recently launched the TB Quest 2019 post a rigorous screening and evaluation process to award novel pathways towards addressing the multiple challenges of tuberculosis that result in huge economic and human costs. One of the awardees were innovators working to address the pressing problem of delayed tuberculosis diagnosis in remote areas using artificial intelligence and deep learning technology for imaging for quick and accurate diagnosis.

Another awardee is working on preventing transmission of tuberculosis from animals to humans with a novel diagnostic kit that uses a combination of native and recombinant antigens to detect bovine tuberculosis. Sputum collection has proven to be time-consuming and inaccurate at times, so to address this problem, another firm created an immune-magnetic cell capture technology that replaces sputum smear microscopy as a method for diagnosing tuberculosis.

For efficient implementation of tuberculosis diagnostics at the district and sub-district level of healthcare delivery, yet another innovator developed a real-time quantitative micro-PCR system with the aim of bringing battery-operated, point-of-care Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing and molecular diagnosis to patients.

The Centre for Health Research and Innovation (CHRI), in partnership with an innovator aims to enable faster diagnosis and treatment initiation of tuberculosis patients through this system, allowing primary healthcare workers to diagnose tuberculosis in primary health settings where microscopy is the sole diagnostic technique available.

Further, a device called Tuberculosis Monitoring Encouragement Adherence Drive that is aimed at improving drug adherence was another path-breaking technology that was recognised and awarded. To ensure a smooth transition from the laboratories to the markets for these technologies, a team of scientists, public health and medical practitioners will guide and mentor the innovators in their journey. Furthermore, the IHF aims to create a platform for these innovators by mobilising resources and building public-private partnerships to initiate innovative solutions, business models and bring a transformative change.

Innovations that combine affordability along with ground-breaking technology should be encouraged and supported to the very last mile. Elimination of tuberculosis from India will be achieved by breaking the silos, forging partnerships, creating novel business models and extending support to innovations curated by young entrepreneurs.

A comprehensive and collaborative platform involving public and private stakeholders can facilitate this process and accelerate the process of elimination of such diseases from India.

14,03-1-20,CM asks officers to implement policies in letter and spirit,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked officials to implement the policies of the government in letter and spirit so that the poor get the benefits of the schemes.

“The government has released budget for all major projects. Now it is the responsibility of officers to implement the policies so that the benefits of all projects reach the targeted people,” Yogi Adityanath said during a review meeting held in Lucknow on Thursday.

Yogi said that all districts had been provided infrastructure development projects which were at various stages. “Speed up the work so that Uttar Pradesh meets the SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) target set by the United Nations,” he said.

“During the review meetings, officials should also check utilisation of budgets released for the 2019-20 fiscal. The monthly review will give seniors a view of the progress of a scheme. Where utilisation is poor, officials should give special focus. Budgetary allocations should be passed in the first week of the month,” the chief minister said.

“The government has worked in all sectors. Farmers are getting good remunerative prices of their produce, the poor have been given free electricity connections, subsidised houses and gas connections. Just monitor that. Nodal officers should get feedback on the progress of projects during field visits and report it to the government,” he said.

Yogi also asked district magistrates and district police chiefs to meet people between 9:30 and 10:30 every morning.

15,03-1-20,Women SPOs get police power in Twin City,"To promote women empowerment and gender-sensitive policing, the Commissionerate police on Thursday formed a team of 246 Special Police Officers (SPOs) involving women from various institutions across the Twin City.

On the occasion of its Raising Day Parade held at the OSAP 7 Battalion Ground here, Commissioner of Police Sudhanshu Sarangi announced appointment of the SPOs, who will have power, privileges and immunities equivalent to other police personnel. They will be engaged for three months in a first phase.

“The women SPOs are directed to create a sense of security among women and girls and the society at large. They will assist police in case of eve-teasing and harassment of women in the Twin City. They will inform police about such incidents for suitable action and provide necessary assistance to the victims as well,” an official said.

On the occasion, as many as 20 police personnel of various ranks were felicitated in 13 categories. Among the 20 cops, Prana Krushna Rout, posted in Bhubaneswar Urban Police District (UPD) was awarded as Best ACP (Territorial) with cash reward of Rs 4,500. Ashok Kumar Panigrahi and Hemanta Kumar Dash, both posted in Bhubaneswar UPD, were adjudged as Best ACP (Armed) and given cash reward of Rs 4,500, each.

While addressing at the event, Commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi announced that the Commissionerate police building would soon be renamed as ‘Police Seva Bhawan’.

He directed that information about schemes must be displayed in every marketing cooperative society. Govind Singh was addressing a seminar on “Contribution of Cooperatives in Agricultural Development” held at Minto Hall.

Managing Director IFFCO Uday Shankar Awasthi said that IFFCO will deliver Nano urea before next Kharif. Its specialty is that it is in liquid form of urea and equivalent to one sack of urea. It will be delivered in bottles. It will be more effective than solid urea and will also cost much less.

He said that upon its arrival, the Government will not have to provide subsidy on urea. He said that IFFCO is also making organic pesticides after organic fertilisers, which will not be harmful for the environment.

Minister Govind Singh said that farmers must adopt animal husbandry and allied activities along with farming so that they can earn substantial profits. He asked IFFCO also to work towards setting up cold storage and setting up food processing industries in the State.

At the workshop, it was informed that to overcome the problem of burning Narvai (Parali), such a decomposer has been developed, by sprinkling which the remnants of the crops will decompose and turn into manure and increase the fertility of the soil.

21,03-1-20,2019 was amazingly eventful for India,"There will be some confusion from hence over the expression twenty-twenty. The fastest cricket had grabbed this name. So, until the year 2020 is past, there shall be some problems because of the alliterative name. People must also know that using the shirt form '20 could spell disaster particularly with cheques as part of date. For instance, the full ‘2.01.2020’ may be written rather than 2.01,'20; or else any crook can turn the year into 2019 or any other figure.

The year 2019 was really historic. India suffered Pulwama massacre; retaliated grandly with Balakot attack; did away with Articles 370 and 35 A. The apex court upset women with a review of the Sabarimala verdict; stunned the world with a highly-balanced Ayodhya judgment and dismissed review petition in only three days. The Modi administration received a lot of flak for the seemingly lopsided Citizen Ammendment Act apart from a violent riotous protest against the National Register of Citizens. Home Minister Amit Shah took revenge against the former incumbent Chidambaram by putting him in jail.

The disturbing developments included the alarmingly slow economic growth resulting in horrific unemployment and dropping Sheikh Abdullah birthday from the list of holidays in Kashmir. Four rape and murder accused guys were killed in a highly-suspect police encounter in Hyderabad.

One of the warmest of all events was the November 9 inauguration of a 4.5-km Kartarpur corridor by PM Modi on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, founder of Sikhism. He flagged off the first batch of over 500 Indian pilgrims visiting the shrine in Pakistan. The sacred corridor may unite India and Pakistan in a geopolitically shrinking world of today. Pakistan is interestingly getting madder as evident by local court awarding former President India-born General Musaraf with a death sentence with a peculiar order for hanging the corpse in public in the event of death of convict before execution of court verdict.

Odisha too had its own historic and memorable events. The 75-meter clearing around the Jagannath Temple has been hailed by pilgrims and tourists from across the world. Until Naveen happened to Odisha, the temple had become infamous for anarchy due to greedy and unruly servitors. The local authorities had never even dared to dislodge high-charging shoe stands run by goons and hoodlums; let alone pull down huge, congestive concrete structures. Puri is fast going to acquire the looks of a uniquely magnificent, world-class heritage site. The 5,000 million-rupee project will be complete before the Car Festival this year.

The makeshift Eco Retreat outfit to last for 45 long days on the Marine Drive road around the river-sea conflux is a wonder by itself as visitors respond excitedly.

What many cynical may not agree to is the fact of a relatively younger IAS officer managing a first-of-its-kind 5T department that oversees development in all domains of progress. Naveen Patnaik, the nonsense chief executive of Odisha, has a unique skill of sniffing out the best performers who are able to figure about his dreams, likes and dislikes. Naveen chose Kathikeyan, a 2000-batch IAS officer, after putting him to rigorous tests to ensure the young guy could really deliver. Karthikeyan has been proving his worth all this while unfailingly.

On the last but one day of 2019, Naveen lost his celebrity brother-in-law Sonny Mehta, often called the ‘best publisher in the world’. Like many Odisha people do not know much about the personal non-political achievements of Naveen, they barely knew Sonny, who had risen to be editor-in-chief of Knopf and the chairman of publishing giant Knopf Doubleday which had taken over the highly reputed Random House as well. Prior to the Knopf appointment, Sonny had made a name creating Pan, one of the earliest paperback imprints in the UK. Born in 1942, ‘Sonny' Ajai Singh Mehta was son of Amrik Singh Mehta, one among the first of Independent India's diplomats. Sonny was educated at the famous Lawrence School Sanawar and Sevenoaks School, UK, where he won an open scholarship to the Cambridge University, acquiring two degrees, in History and English Literature, while also editing the magazine 'Granta’.

It is very interesting toknow that Naveen grew up as a quiet and calm and sensitive child amid his siblings and immediate cousins at Anand Bhawan in Cuttack in the 1940s. Close cousins would say everyone was reporting to the enormously adorable home bully Gita, who was the master second only to father Biju Patnaik. While playing in the garden, if a captured dragonfly succumbed to death, Naveen would break down and insist on a respectable burial to the insect as others would only laugh off the seemingly silly proposal. But Gita would stand by the kid brother firmly. So, Naveen respects Gita as guide and guru even today!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2019-was-amazingly-eventful-for-india.html

24,03-1-20,Gangster’s girlfriend arrested in Cuttack,"Even though mobile jammers and CCTV cameras have been installed in the high-security Choudwar jail, hardened criminals are able to operate their crime syndicates from the prison.

This has come to the fore after the Commissionerate police on Wednesday arrested gangster Mohammad Shakil’s girlfriend. A team of special squad and Dargha Bazar police arrested the woman when she was returning after meeting him in the Choudwar jail.

It is alleged that the woman was operating Sakil’s illegal firearms and extortion racket in the gangster’s absence. Sakil, against whom more than 30 cases are pending at different police stations, is now cooling his heels at Choudwar jail.

The woman’s involvement in Sakil’s crime syndicate is now under scanner. Cuttack DCP Akhileswar Singh said the woman was coordinator of Shakil’s crime syndicate.

“We had registered a case in connection with the extortion threat. Our probe reveals that the woman had provided weapons to some youths who had terrorised the businessman. Our efforts to recover the firearms are underway,” said Singh.

Recently, the cops were left jittery after an extortion video of Sakil went viral on social media, notwithstanding the fact that the gangster is lodged in jail. It was alleged that the extortion video was sent to a Buxi Bazar-based businessman from Choudwar jail on December 14.

In the video, an extortion of Rs 10 lakh was demanded from the businessman. Earlier, four persons including Sakil’s father have been arrested in connection with their links to the gangster’s extortion racket.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gangster---s-girlfriend-arrested-in-cuttack.html

He was accompanied by Chief Secretary of the Chief Abbot of Bhutan Ugyen Tenzin and personal Secretary of the Chief Abbot Pema Dorji. Karma Lhamo, a devout Buddhist, too was present.

They visited the museums at Lalitagiri and Ratnagiri and appreciated the efforts of the Archaeological Survey of India and the Government of Odisha for the upkeep and preservation of these important Buddhist vestiges. The relics that were uncovered at Lalitagiri are now kept in the museum there under proper care and security.

Dorji lauded the efforts of the Government of India in promoting the ancient Buddhist sites and monuments all over the country. He said that proper research should be carried out on the relevance and spread of Buddhism from Odisha and the role of Guru Padmasambava and his origins from Odisha.

Dr Bimalendu Mohanty, who is the vice-president of the Mahabodhi Society of India and an eminent historian, is of the opinion that the growth of Buddhism in Bhutan was first advanced by the great Uddiyana Guru Padmasambava in the 8th century C.E who laid the foundation of one of the most important and unifying forces that has sustained the Bhutanese people and contributed to the evolution of their unique cultural and religious tradition.

Dr Mohanty had validated the origins of Guru Padmasambava being from Odisha in his book written a few years ago.

Anil Dhir, noted heritage expert and a member of INTACH who accompanied the team to the Buddhist Circuit, said the scope of religious and cultural tourism of these sites still remained untapped. If proper awareness and promotion is undertaken, these sites and the other Buddhist sites of the State will draw more than a million tourists annually, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bhutanese-team-visits-state-s-buddhist-sites.html

38,03-1-20,Just Rs 11L in Puri temple hundi on NY day!,"Are Odias poor donors? The question is natural when the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri received only Rs 11,46,650 on the New Year’s Day.

This apart, the temple hundi also received only 2 gram 240 milligram of gold and 11 gram 500 mg of silver from devotees offering prayers to the Trinity on the auspicious first day of the English calendar day.

The amount of donation to the 12th century shrine is said to be meagre because more than six lakh people visited the temple with hope to get the Lord Jagannath’s blessings on the first date of 2020.

The Puri district administration has said lakhs of devotees thronged the temple for which elaborate security arrangements were done on the occasion. If the footfall in the temple will be six lakh, then each devotee paid only Rs 1.91 to the temple while the cost of a small diya is Rs 5 and Rs 10 for a cigarette.

No doubt, the people are spending lots of money through travelling, eating outside in better hotels and shopping as well as roaming in sea beach. However, when it comes to making donation to the temple, they appeared to be reluctant.

The devotees are also spending a lot on pujas and giving “dakshina” to the priests but not to the Lord!

Had each devotee donated Rs 10 only to the temple, the amount would have been Rs 60 lakh. But, that is not happening in Odisha.

It is said that Lord Jagannath has 13 major festivals in 12 months a year, now another has been added to the temple calendar. This is because lakhs throng on the New Years’ Day.

The socio-economic conditions of the people of Odisha have so far changed which is evident from their congregation at the temple. But, they continue to uphold the poor mindset of not making donations, a senior official said.

As Lord Jagannath is considered as the “Patitapaban”, means the Lord who gives salvation to the poor, Dalits and downtrodden, many devotees also carry the impression that there is no harm to avoid donating anything to the temple.

It is greatness of the Lord of the Universe that He gives “mokshya” to all. That does not mean that the devotees will not make donation. While other major temples across the country earn good amount in the donation box, the Lord Jagannath temple continues to remain poor in terms of finance.

Therefore, the experts say the people of Odisha should make a pledge that they should donate something to the Lord while visiting the temple. A large number of tourists from outside Odisha are also included in the about 6 lakh devotees who visited the temple.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/just-rs-11l-in-puri-temple-hundi-on-ny-day-.html
39,03-1-20,Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana implemented,"Till a year ago, the power companies in Madhya Pradesh had a total loan of Rs 37,963 crore and a cumulative loss of about 44,975 crore. In the last one year, the State Government has started making efforts to save the companies facing deteriorating financial condition.

At the same time, the Government has implemented the Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana to provide electricity upto 100 units per unit @ Re one per unit to the common consumers. Apart from this, the Indira Kisan Jyoti Yojana has been implemented and the electricity charge on pumps upto 10 hp for farmers has been reduced from Rs 1,400 to Rs 700 per hp per annum.

The Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana was introduced in the month of February this year. A maximum bill of Rs 100 was being given to eligible domestic consumers of Sambal yojana instead of Rs 200 on monthly consumption upto 100 units and the remaining amount was being borne by the State Government. The Government, while expanding the Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana, separated the scheme from the Sambal yojana.

Now, all domestic consumers whose monthly consumption in meter reading is 150 units in 30 days have also been included in the scheme. The domestic consumers belonging to SC and ST category living below the poverty line are paying only Rs 25 for monthly consumption upto 30 units.

48,03-1-20,"Akali leader murdered, SAD demands CBI enquiry","A Shiromani Akali Dal leader was shot dead by three motorcycle-borne assailants at Umarpura village here, in what the Opposition party claimed was a ""politically-motivated murder"" carried out at the behest of the ruling Congress.

The 50-year-old Gurdeep Singh's killing on Wednesday is a second instance of fatal attacks on SAD leaders in the state since November, when Dalbir Singh Dhilwan was killed in Gurdaspur.

Gurdeep, whose wife is a village head, was killed when he was coming out of a gurdwara after offering prayers, the police said. He was said to be a close associate of senior Akali Dal leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, who alleged the crime was carried out by Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang and demanded a CBI probe.

The police also said they have booked five people including a father-son duo, Nirmal Singh and Harmanjeet Singh, in connection with the killing.

The police said Harmanjeet is wanted in several criminal cases.

Station House Officer (SHO) Tarsem Singh said raids were being conducted at their possible hideouts to nab them.

The police are also examining CCTV footage obtained from nearby areas.

A day after SAD leader and close associate of former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia was gunned down in Amritsar’s Majitha, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday demanded a CBI inquiry into the “political murder” of former Sarpanch Baba Gurdeep Singh.

Alleging that murder was committed by the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang,

SAD leader Majithia said that since Punjab DGP was helpless in taking action against the Minister–Gangster nexus, “the party will hold dharnas as well as approach courts to ensure justice for the victims”.

“The brutal political assassination of Baba Gurdeep Singh is a direct result of threats being issued to me warning of dangerous consequences if I do not stop speaking against the Minister-Gangster nexus.

A message has been sent to me that my close political associates will be targeted if I do not stop speaking for justice for former Akali Sarpanch Dalbir Dhilwan who was also murdered in the same way like Baba Gurdeep Singh,” said Majithia.

Majithia, accompanied with SAD senior leader Daljit Singh Cheema, said that he had already approached Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta seeking action against the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang in November.

“But immediately afterwards, the gangster was given a clean chit by an IG level officer,” he added.

“Recently on December 24, I wrote to Majitha SSP and informed him that my associates were under threat and their safety should be assured but nothing was done despite providing specific information, and subsequently Baba Gurdeep Singh was murdered,” he said.

SAD leaders said that even as the State DGP and the police force was in sleep mode, gangsters were using social media to claim credit for contract killings and Jaggu Bhagwanpuria was sending Happy New Year posts along with AK–47 pictures from jail besides posting selfies along with a gold chain regularly.

The Pavitar Gang, which was on offshoot of the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang, had recently claimed credit for a murder in which they shot a youth for targeting their close friend Harman Bhullar,

he said adding that Harman’s mother had stood for election and lost against Baba Gurdeep Singh’s wife.

“Since the police has admitted that the Pavitar gang was behind Baba Gurdeep Singh’s murder, it is clear who is running this gang and why they are resorting to the killings,” SAD leaders added. Stating that he would not be deterred from his goal of exposing those like Jails Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa “who is patronizing gangsters like Jaggu Bhagwanpuria”, Majithia said: “We will expose this nexus and will not allow the State police to indulge in a clean chit operation as per dictates of the ‘clean chit’ government”.

He said that evidence against the Jail Minister was mounting with an under trial now disclosing that the Gurdaspur Jail Superintendent had openly bragged to him that no action could be taken against him because he had given Rs 60 lakh to Sukhjinder Randhawa for his posting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akali-leader-murdered--sad-demands-cbi-enquiry.html

50,03-1-20,AAP calls upon people to unite against open ‘loot’ by power mafia,"Virtually launching a campaign against the Congress-led Punjab Government over rising power rates in the state, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday exhorted the people of the State to unite against the power mafia openly operating in the state.

AAP’s Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann alleged that high power tariff was an issue of grave concern for a common consumer in the State while those at the helms of affairs were concerned more about the high-powered electricity mafia and private players rather than the common consumers facing the heat of the exorbitant tariff.

Referring to the recent NITI Ayog reports, Mann said that the situation had assumed alarming proportions in Punjab, the biggest contributor to the nation’s food reserves, had slipped to 12th place among 37 states and the Union Territories in the country.

“The people in the State, who are waging a grim battle with fiscal hardships, have been left to shuttle between officers and administration to foot their hefty electricity bills on installments,” said Mann holding the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and SAD president Sukhbir Badal deadly duo for the mess, which was offering protection electricity mafia.

Exhorting people of the State to unite to fight such maverick monarchs, Mann said that AAP-sponsored ‘Bijli Morcha’ was not a mere movement but a mount to reach out every household in the State facing the heat.

“Every small, marginal and other category of consumers are left to face the heat,” he said.

Taking strong exception to the proposed hike in electricity charges by Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (Powercom) by 12 to 14 percent during the year 2020-21, Sangrur MP Mann said that it should mull over reducing the electricity rate instead of hiking it.

Mann said that Powercom was reported to have put across its financial requirement or expenses at Rs 36,150 crore during the current financial year while current electricity fare at Rs 32,700 crore.

“Difference amounting to Rs 3,450 crore would be realized from the common consumer by raising electricity tariff by 12 to 14 percent which would not be tolerated at any cost,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-calls-upon-people-to-unite-against-open----loot----by-power-mafia.html

60,03-1-20,Chandigarh extends ambit of single-use plastic ban,"The UT Administration has imposed a complete ban on industrial packaging of less than 50 microns, single use plastic containers of less than 250 microns used for dairy items and plastic sticks in the union territory of Chandigarh.

The fresh order comes after Administration’s notification issued in September imposing a complete ban on several single-use plastic products. The much-speculated single-use plastic ban has however did not live up to the hype created due to the absence of proper checks and awareness campaigns.

These products will be banned from March 28, 2020 onwards.

“The MCD staff definitely collected more garbage than normal from all the houses, restaurants, garbage bins on the next day of the new year’s eve,” he informed.

The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun’s (MCD) work increases on every celebration as more waste is produced than normal days in the city during festivities and celebrations.

Our staff collected many cake boxes and disposable plates in the morning hours of the first day of the new year. Apart from causing noise and air pollution, crackers generate a lot of waste.

Hence we must think about all these problems we are causing to the environment before bursting crackers,” he said. It is pertinent to mention that people of the city and the government are already fighting a battle in terms of waste generation and segregation.

The Prime minister Narendra Modi presented the award at a programme in Karnataka to Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat the state’s Agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal on Thursday. Two progressive farmers from the state- Kaushalya from Kapkot and Jagmohan Rana from Bhatwadi were also felicitated on the occasion.

Rawat thanked the prime minister for selecting Uttarakhand for the Krishi Karman award, recalling that Modi had given the target of doubling the income of farmers by 2022.

Uttarakhand is working hard to meet the target set by the prime minister, he said. Rawat informed that of the 53.48 lakh hectare area in Uttarakhand, agriculture area comprises about 11.21 per cent. Out of this, about 56 per cent is in the mountainous region while 89 per cent of the farmland is not irrigated and dependent on rain.

In the state, about 92 per cent farmers are small and marginal. Under the guidance of the Government of India and with the efforts of the farmers and the Agriculture department, the state has been able to fulfill its food-grain requirements and become self reliant.

He further said that of the 8.38 lakh beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Nidhi, 6.84 lakh farmers have benefitted so far. About 6.72 lakh farmers have received the first instalment, 6.56 lakh have received the second instalment and six lakh have received the third instalment while 4.34 lakh have received the fourth instalment.

The remaining farmers are also being connected with the scheme for which the selection and registration process is underway. Rawat said that the PM has expected Uttarakhand to be developed as an organic state. For this purpose, the state government has covered the entire mountainous region for fully farming.

Speaking about the traditional agriculture development scheme, he said that in the next two years, about 1.50 lakh hectare area will come under organic certification.

For mechanisation of agriculture, 755 farm machinery banks have been set up so far. The State Government is aiming to establish a farm machinery bank in every Gram Panchayat. A total of 212 projects of 23 departments have been included in the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.

71,03-1-20,Candid Notes,"Late awakening

Ostensibly shocked by the widespread protests in all parts of the country over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the BJP has galvanised its formidable machinery and directed all its leaders to explain the view point of the party to the general public about the provisions of the contentious act. Though this action of the saffron outfit appears justified, it definitely is very delayed. One believes that the party should have taken all the sections of society particularly Muslims into confidence before tabling the bill in the parliament. In the small Himalayan state too, many top guns of the party and government are lined up for the purpose. In Uttarakhand, a considerable population of Bengali Hindus hailing from East Pakistan are residing in Udham Singh Nagar district and their numerical strength makes them a formidable vote bank. The CAA has brought much needed relief and cheers to this section of society. However their demands like Schedule Tribe (ST) status and declaring Bengali as a state language of Uttarakhand are bound to rub the residents of the state the wrong way.

Love-hate relationship

Over indulgence in general functioning of a particular department by a junior minister is bringing sleepless nights to the officials and the employees of the department. In a recent diktat, the live-wire minister has directed that the College Principals would verify the bio-metric attendance details of the staff members, send it to the headquarters and only then their salary would be released. To make things further difficult for both the staff members and students, he has directed that the copies of the attendance registers should be sent to the directorate on a weekly basis. Though these measures appear sensible and innocuous but for those knowing a thing or two about the nifty gritty of the department’s functioning, such decisions are bound to create uneasiness everywhere. In mute tones, both the employees and students have even started cursing the minister for these decisions and are terming him as impractical and naive. Interestingly this very minister was praised effusively when he ensured that the department conducts record number of DPCs for promotions.

Champion Vs Crusader

With the personal intervention of TSR, the protected battle of one-upmanship between a self confessed Champion who brings with him a heady mix of brawny amusement into the politics of the state and a rabble rouser aspiring hard to become leader of downtrodden in the saffron party has come to an end. In a public relation exercise aimed into bringing the two warring leaders into a cuddle held in state capital was deliberately kept a short affair. It is learnt that both were advised to stick to the prepared text and don’t get carried away by the sharp questions of the scribes. Though the exercise concluded as per the plan and has paved the way for re-entry of the Champion into the saffron party, it would be interesting to observe how these two leaders who have publically spewed much venom on each other in recent times, follow the command of the party. Considering the power scenario and socio- political dynamics of the district from where they hail, it would not be a surprise if they shed the imposed silence and take daggers out once again.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes.html
72,03-1-20,"Cong gets belligerent on rail fare, cooking gas price hike","Increase in rail fares and price of cooking gas cylinder has given a tool to the Opposition Congress to beat the Government. In protest against these decisions of the Government, the Uttarakhand Congress has decided to hold State-wide protests.

On Friday, the party would burn effigies of the Government in all district headquarters. In the protest, Member of Parliaments (MPs), former MPs, MLAs, former MLAs, district presidents, district panchayat presidents, office bearers of all frontal organisations and others are expected to take part. The Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, Pritam Singh has termed the price rise as ‘New Year gift’ the Government. He said that the increase in price of cooking gas, hike in rail fare and increased cost of government health service has increased burden on the common man already reeling under price rise.

Singh said that general public is feeling the heat of unrelenting attack of price rise in every sector and the recent increase in prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas has further aggravated the problems. He said that union government has failed miserably on the front of controlling spiraling prices and the general public is now not in position to absorb the effect of increase in prices. The PCC president added that prices of commodities are at their peak during the BJP regime and the general public is bearing the brunt of the price hike. He said that the prices of petrol and diesel are increasing regularly even though the international crude price is going down.

The Congress leader said that the crude prices were around 150 US dollars during the regime of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but the prices of petrol and diesel were kept in control by the then Government. He said that the prices of crude are low now but the Government is regularly increasing prices of petrol and diesel. Singh reminded that the BJP leaders had promised to bring down the prices before the elections but the promises were not fulfilled. On the contrary, the prices have skyrocketed which has hit the general public hard.

Singh added that the increase in price of cooking gas would have a cascading effect on the prices which already are on a very high side and the prices of general commodities would become beyond the reach of general public.

He said that the Congress party would continue to register its protest on the price hike and would burn effigies of Government in all district headquarters on Friday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-gets-belligerent-on-rail-fare--cooking-gas-price-hike.html

77,03-1-20,TSPC’s enhanced activities emanate worry waves to police,"The recent violence of splinter group of naxals the TSPC ( Titiya Sammelan Prastuti Committee) has sent worry waves from two affected districts Latehar and Palamu to Ranchi Police Headquarters, said sources.

TSPC rebels torched 3 vehicles and damaged a good number of vehicles at a railway construction site at Maalhan in Latehar district, which borders with Ranchi.

Similarly TSPC extremists set afire two heavy vehicles one on NH 75 to Lesliganj Road and another one at Munkeri village.

Sources said the three incidents of TSPC led violence occurred in less than four days one before the swearing in ceremony of Hemant Soren and the other two right a day after his being sworn as Chief Minister.

Sources said the timing of the TSPC activities has alarmed police of the State much as to what is so pressing or driving the TSPC to rear its head, which is giving distress signal to the present government and at the same time BJP to chuckle as it will hardly take more days to go out telling people that extremists are once again trying to regain their lost territories after its exit from the governance.

Top police cops are digging into heels to find out the recent rearing of TSPC in two districts and if any war of attrition between TSPC and CPI Maoist is any in the offing.

Sources said TSPC is striking where Maoists have stakes as vehicles torched by TSPC were of construction site and of stone quarry.

ADG police Jharkhand Murari Lal Meena said, “We do not see any chance of TSPC going for any internecine struggle with the Maoist as the Maoists have bigger teeth and bigger machine than the TSPC.”

Meena said this out gone year the two TSPC and the Maoist did not fire at each other but TSPC had the severe beating from the police in Chatra and Latehar districts.

Meena too conceded that it is difficult to find out right now as to what has so maddened the TSPC to go for arson which police would cure them in their own way.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda too is not sure as to how and why this sudden rise of TSPC in its activities has occurred these few days. Speaking to the Pioneer Linda said this abruptness of TSPC is most sinister but police will foil it’s anymore aberration now.

ADG Meena did not see TSPC activities would spur CPI Maoists to strike rather TSPC is more provoking the police to be after it and police will do all to neutralize its might.

Meena declined to accept that recent TSPC boom is any surge or revival but a momentary tactic of it for which TSPC will burn its own energy as from now on police will leave less space and time for it to breathe.

Meena said there would be no let up in the severity of drive and operations against the extremists but he added “ For us the CPI Maoists are the dreaded enemies since they kill cops and civilians too and have all bad names for laying all kinds of IEDs the latest now is their pressure IED or individual IED.”

Meena said the recent loss of lives of civilians at Latehar ( Bulbul forest) and at Lohardaga in Maoists’ laid anti personal IED has further alienated the Maoists from the masses as people have begun to question the intention of the Maoists.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tspc---s-enhanced-activities-emanate-worry-waves-to-police.html

Priya Kumar, a resident of Kanke Road was upset with plans of a family picnic getting foiled due to the rains. “I was very keen to take my children for boating at the Patratu Dam on January 1 but had to cancel them because of the rains,” she said.

However, temples like Pahari Mandir, Jagannath Mandir and Kali Mandir saw a huge footfall.

“The New Year in my family is always welcomed by seeking the blessings of Lord Shiva. And just like every other year I am here with my family to celebrate the New Year at Jagannath Mandir. Unlike any other year, this year it is more crowded as a lot of people had to cancel their picnics because of the weather conditions,” said Ajay Singh, a resident of Ranchi.

Keeping the present weather conditions in mind, Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray through a tweet has ordered all schools in the capital city to remain closed till January 7.

As per the weather bulletin released by the Meteorological Centre, Ranchi on January 2, the maximum temperature in the city which was being recorded at around 22 degree Celsius was also recorded at 15.2 degree Celsius.

“The maximum temperature recorded was 8 degrees below normal because of which January 1 was declared as a severe cold day in Ranchi. Chances are that January 2 will also be a cold day for the city,” said Deputy Director, MET Centre Ranchi, Abhishek Anand. Scattered places in the north eastern, central and southern parts of the State are expected to receive rainfall accompanied with thunder and lightning on the evening of January 2 and in the early morning hours of January 3. Isolated places may witness rainfall and the cloud cover may also clear off from January 4 onwards. From January 5, it is being predicted that the weather will be dry while the temperatures will fall further.

“A system of induced western disturbances is having an interaction with the easterly winds forming a tough over Jharkhand and thus causing rainfall across the State. The mercury levels are expected to fall further increasing the cold throughout the day. Once the clouds clear, the mornings will also be quite foggy,” Anand further added.

The official further added that at the lower level of the troposphere easterly winds are blowing while at the middle and top levels there is a trough of the western disturbances and the easterly winds are also carrying moisture from the Bay of Bengal.

According to the communiqué issued by the Department, for next few days the minimum temperature in Ranchi and its surrounding areas will be around 8 to 11 degree Celsius.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rains-foil-picnic-plans--people-throng-temples-in-new-year.html

The announcement comes a day before Jaipal Singh Munda’s birth anniversary, to be celebrated by the Tribal Affairs Ministry across the country on January 3.

“Dakra village will be developed into a model village and be an example for the entire nation,” Munda said on Thursday, adding that the village will have all the basic amenities that a model village should have. Freedom fighter and tribal hero Birsa Munda – referred to as Bhagwan (God) in Jharkhand — was also born in the same district, and the development of Dakra village will also be a tribute to him, added Munda.

Birsa Munda’s village, Ulihatu, has already witnessed development as a mark of tribute to the freedom fighter whose portrait adorns a wall in the Parliament of India. On the other hand, State capital Ranchi has a stadium named after Jaipal Singh Munda, who captained the Indian hockey team in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. He later joined politics and fought for the rights of the tribal community.

Former Chief Minister Arjun Munda was elected as an MP in the 18th General Elections from Khunti Parliamentary Constituency. “Jaipal Singh Munda spoke about tribal rights and the fundamental rights of tribesmen living in the far flung jungles and villages. We will pay special attention to villages that gave birth to such personalities,” said Munda.

Highlighting achievements of his ministry, Munda said that around 4700 students are pursuing Ph.D under various schemes of the ministry. Besides, the ministry is running a Digital Leadership Programme called Goal in collaboration with Facebook, a U.S-based multimillion dollar social media company.

100,03-1-20,BJP to elect Leader of Opposition soon,"The first session of the State Assembly is set to begin on January 6, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — the Opposition party with the highest strength in the house — is yet to decide which legislator will be the Leader of Opposition in the House. The party leadership here has been quiet since its thudding fall in the recent elections, and the legislators are waiting for the party high command’s nod to hold a meeting for the selection of a Legislative Party Leader.

“We have not received any communication regarding the selection of Legislative Party Leader so far. The high command will take the decision soon,” said six-time Ranchi legislator and former Minister CP Singh. Another former Minister and Khunti Legislator Neelkanth Singh Munda had a similar reply. “The high command will take the decision,” he said.

Former Chief Minister Raghubar Das – the choice for the Leader of Opposition – lost to former BJP leader turned rebel Saryu Roy in Jamshedpur East and could not even make it to the Assembly. Now, the party is in the process of selecting a new face that can represent the Opposition in the Assembly. BJP insiders said that Neelkanth Singh Munda is a frontrunner for the position at present. However, Munda said he had not received any formal communication regarding this decision and would not believe on speculations.

A party office bearer, who has been in the thick of events lately, said that the party was supposed to hold a meeting on January 5 to name the legislative party leader, However, the meeting was postponed due to some unavoidable circumstances, he added. Nand Kishore Yadav, the election co-in-charge for Jharkhand, said that a decision will be taken before the Assembly session begins. “The high command should ideally take a decision before the session begins,” he said.

The BJP, which formed a majority Government here in 2014 4and also became the first ever Government to be in power for the complete tenure of five years, managed to win only 25 of 81 seats in the recently concluded elections. The party had set a target of winning at least 65 seats, but failed miserably despite aggressive campaigning by national political big guns. The defeat also affected the calculations of the party and now the high command has to rethink its ploy for Jharkhand, party sources said.

The Opposition parties during the former Government had pointed out at the Delhi-centric structure of the BJP and how it failed to touch local issues during the campaigning. Saryu Roy, a BJP veteran-turned-independent-candidate had said in an interview to The Pioneer that the party should at least partially decentralise authority and focus on local issues to maintain their hold in states.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-elect-leader-of-opposition-soon.html
101,03-1-20,January 1 peak power demand makes record,"Delhi’s peak winter power demand touched an all time high of 5,343 MW on New Year’s Day. Heating load (heaters and geysers) is the main reason behind the increase in city’s power load in winter as it constitutes more than 40 per cent of the total power demand, a senior BSES official said.

Delhi’s peak power demand continues its upwards climb, be it summers or winter. After clocking an all-time high of 7,409 MW during summers of 2019, it continues to break records in winters also, touching 5,343 MW which is highest ever in the winter season so far.

Last year, highest peak power demand in winter was recorded 5,298 MW on December 30, 2019. In fact, on January 1, 2020 the peak power demand in BRPL, BYPL and TPDDL also reached the highest of 2,256 MW, 1,148 MW and 1,656 MW respectively.

The official also said that in November, peak power demand this year was higher than the peak power demand of November 2018 on 20 occasions and it was higher in the month of December on 30 occasions.

The back-bone of BSES’ power-supply arrangements during the winter-months includes long-term agreements from power-plants like Dadri (stage 1 and 2), Hydro Stations, Singrauli, Rihand, Sasan, DVC Mejia and Delhi based gas fueled generating stations. Additionally, BSES is also receiving 50 MW of wind power and 20 MW of solar power from SECI.

Apart from these, BSES discoms are using advanced techniques and avenues like “banking”, “reserve shutdown”, “power exchange” and ensuring sufficient “spinning reserves” to dispose of surplus power as well as ensuring reliable power supply, as also making arrangements to get power during summer months, he added.

In case of any unforeseeable contingency, BSES discoms will buy short-term power from the exchange which is available at economical rates and can range between (around) Rs 1 to over Rs 4 per unit - during winter months, depending on the time-slot, he said.

“To meet power demand challenges and to get a grip on so many varied and dynamic variables, BSES uses a mix of advanced statistical forecasting models, combined with state-of-the-art weather forecasting solutions, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/january-1-peak-power-demand-makes-record.html

As per the order, the DLs against the drunken driving cases detected by the RTOs and forwarded by police would be suspended.

The RTOs were also directed to furnish the reasons for not cancelling the DLs forwarded by the police for suspension.

“The Supreme Court committee has directed for 100 per cent suspension of the DLs against the cases of drunk driving detected. In this regard, time to time directions have been issued from this office for 100 per cent suspension of the DLs in the SARATHI Database against the cases detected,” said a notification by the Transport Commissioner.

As per data, while 334 e-challans have been issued for drunk driving cases by the RTOs in September 2019, 496 DLs have been forwarded by the different police districts to the concerned RTOs for suspension of DLs in drunken driving cases.

But as per SARATHI database, only 126 DLs for drunken driving cases have been suspended during the month of September 2019.

It is noticed that in some of the regions, e-challans had been issued for the drunken driving cases and police have also forwarded DLs for suspension for the drunken driving cases. But, the suspension of DLs in the SARATHI database for drunken driving is nil or negligible, said the notification.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-directs-rtos-to-cancel-offenders----dls.html

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too took to Twitter to express his dismay over the issue.

“Why do these people want to cancel PTM? In PTM, parents get an opportunity to discuss their children’s progress with teachers. Many parents wait for PTM eagerly. PTM will be on time. I will also go to one of the schools tomorrow to get parents’ feedback,” he tweeted in Hindi.

Meanwhile talking to The Pioneer Dr Harshvardhan said, “Government school teachers association members had met him requesting to write to the Delhi L-G Anil Baijal for his intervention as holding PTM during chilly winters was not good for the health of children.

The concept began in form of a cattle protection and management, which was later included in election manifesto of the Congress party. Later, it was given the present form of NGGB by Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel.

Interacting exclusively with ‘The Pioneer’, Singhdeo said, activities of ‘Gau Rakshaks’ across the country created excess cattle and in villages the stray bovines are damaging the crops due to shortage of fodder for all.

The villagers started to leave them as stray cattle, causing menace in both rural and urban areas, he added.Singhdeo said natural death and death due to diseases though was preferred, there was also a system earlier of elimination or sale of unwanted and unutilised cattle earlier.

It was a running system and it was absorbing the stray cattle no matter whether one is in its favour or against, he said.

Now that the system has collapsed, one has to take care of the cattle, he added.

Elaborating on the scheme, Singdeo said, it takes care of cattle management, it needs water, can keep stray cattle at one place, utilize cow dung, reserving village land with fencing for all allied activities like poultry, goat rearing etc., preparation of compost (organic manure).For water, scheme has been envisaged to construct stop-dams and other structures which will store water in all rivers, rivulets and water bodies which will indirectly recharge ground water and enhance irrigation facilities, the minister said.

Therefore, Singdeo pointed out that the key challenge now will be to make it a self-sustaining system for employment generation in rural areas through activities around it. He added government cannot go on using tax payers’ money to run the project as revenue from taxes is limited and cannot be further expanded by imposing more tax.

In Sarguja, bio-gas plants have been established and supplied to houses, he said, adding it is a challenge in different aspects.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/making-nggb-self-sustaining-model-for-rural-areas--says-minister-ts-singhdeo.html

126,03-1-20,"‘RSS aur BJP, Kuchh Tathya aur Jankari’ book released","Congress Sevadal in its book on freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, claimed that the Hindu Mahasabha co-founder had homosexual relation with Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse.

The Congress volunteer wing also released another book claiming the RSS derived inspiration from Hitler’s Nazism and Fascism of Mussolini.

However, the Sevadal functionaries claimed that this book was published around three years ago, but no controversy arose then.

The first book was titled—‘RSS aur BJP, Kuchh Tathya aur Jankari’ while the second one was ‘Veer Savarkar Kitne Veer’. Both the books were distributed among volunteers during the inauguration of Seva Dal national training camp which got underway in Bhopal’s Bairagarh on Thursday.

The book on Savarkar makes several objectionable comments on his views on variety of issues including personal relations of Savarkar and Godse, Mahatma Gandhi’s killer, rapes with minority women and so on. The book has candidly blamed RSS and Savarkar for the partition of the country in 1947.

While quoting an instance mentioned in Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins’s book ‘Freedom at Midnight’, the booklet from the Sevadal claimed, “Prior to adopting Brahmacharya, there is one mention of Godse’s physical relationship. He had a homosexual relationship with his political mentor Veer Savarkar.

Page 14 of the booklet also claims, “Savarkar also used to extort Hindu men to rape minority women.” At another page, it is mentioned that Savarkar was the man who gave birth to two-nation theory which sowed the seeds of partition.

The booklet also mentioned, “Savarkar and his friends used to dance in jubilation whenever they learnt about Muslims getting killed in communal riots.

The other booklet on RSS and BJP taking a dig at RSS has claimed that the organisation from the outset derived inspiration from Fascism and Nazism. “RSS always idolised noted dictators –Hitler and Mussolini, the dictators of 1930s and 1940s.”

BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal alleged that Congress offers distorted information to its people and offers them misinformation. On charges of RSS following Hitler and Mussolini, Agrawal said the RSS came into existence in 1925.

National president of Congress Sevadal Lalji Desai said that instances mentioned in the booklets are based on facts. It is important for the public to know the reality of people who are presented as heroes by the BJP, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---rss-aur-bjp--kuchh-tathya-aur-jankari----book-released.html

129,03-1-20,Lekhi likely to contest against Kejriwal,"As Delhi Assembly elections round the corner, the top leadership of BJP is warming up to the idea of fielding its Lok Sabha members from the Assembly constituencies falling in their Parliamentary seats.

BJP is faced with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lead AAP that is completing its first tenure and evolving as a small but the ‘party of governance’.

Under such circumstances, the party high command is discussing out of the box strategy to checkmate Kejriwal’s party by giving pivotal space to its Members of Parliament (MPs). Top sources in BJP told The Pioneer that four sitting MPs - Parvesh Verma , Ramesh Bidhuri , Meenakshi Lekhi and Dr HarshVardhan are the names which are very likely to be on the top of the candidates’ list for the high voltage election. The reason behind opting for MPs in place to contest Assembly seats, is the chemistry between MPs and their constituencies.

Election Commission may soon announce the date of Assembly election in Delhi, while sources in BJP also claimed that there is no leadership crisis in Delhi BJP unit but it will be the decision of the Central BJP to decide who will become the face for Chief Ministerial candidate. If sources are to be believed Lekhi is very likely to contest against Kejriwal.

When asked what is the reason behind pitchforking MPs in political battlefield for the assembly elections, source said, “Delhi is different state, stakes are very high here and MPs have good equation with people..In Delhi, if you ask people to name MLAs, they can hardly tell you, but if you ask about MP, they will name accurately without any confusion,” a party insider said.

“Kejriwal has got peoples’ attention by providing freebies on electricity, water and other issues, instance - health and education but this narrative required counter replies, BJP has done lot for traders…, issues of unauthorised colonies was first coined by BJP only, why AAP is taking credit,” “BJP wants its Delhi leader to be in public and for the public and MPs are the right face to spread the work done by Modi government among public,” said a BJP leader.

Learning from recent state elections in Haryana , Maharashtra and Jharkhand, BJP is leaving no stone unturned and gearing up to gain its power back.

“Delhi being the national Capital, people from every nook and corner come here and with recent announcements on Citizenship Amendment Act (CCA), National Population Register (NPR), challenges are ahead to convey the right message to the people. BJP top brass is weighing pros and cons before fielding its sitting Lok Sabha MPs,”, a Delhi BJP leader added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lekhi-likely-to-contest-against-kejriwal.html
130,03-1-20,Cong protest against hike in LPG outside Shastri Bhawan,"The Delhi Congress on Thursday held a protest outside Shastri Bhawan, demanding a rollback of the hike in LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) prices. Party workers, led by Delhi unit president Subhash Chopra, also raised the slogan of “Awaaz do, hum ek hai” (Call us, we are one) that had rent the air during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Addressing the gathering, Chopra said gas cylinder prices have increased from Rs 574 in September last year to Rs 714. He asked why the Aam Aadmi Party was “silent” on the price hike. Congress’s Delhi in-charge PC Chacko claimed the AAP was the “B” team of the BJP and was quietly “endorsing” its decisions.

Chopra asked the Kejriwal government to announce a subsidy of Rs 140 per cooking gas cylinder to give relief to the people reeling under inflation.

The Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government gave subsidy to stabilize the gas prices when the central government raised the prices of cooking gas, he recalled.

On Wednesday, oil companies raised the price of non-subsidised LPG to Rs 714 per 14.2-kg cylinder from Rs 695.

This was the fifth straight monthly increase in cooking gas prices since September 2019. In all, non-subsidised cooking gas prices have gone up by Rs 139.50 per cylinder in the last five months. Non-subsidised LPG is the gas that consumers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg at sub-market or subsidised rates of Rs 495.86.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-protest-against-hike-in-lpg-outside-shastri-bhawan.html

134,03-1-20,Sikhs devotees holds ‘Nagar Keertan' in city,"Devotees across the city lined up at Gurdwaras today to immerse themselves in the colours of devotion on the occasion of 353rd 'Parkash Purab', the birth anniversary of 10th Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh.

Born in Patna, on December 22, 1666, Guru Gobind Singh was the son of Guru Tegh Bahadur, who devoted his life to protect religious freedom. To protect the people from being oppressed, Guru Gobind Singh established the 'Khalsa Panth' in the year 1699.

The devotees participated in special prayer ceremonies. Free langars (holy kitchen) were also arranged and prasad (holy food) was distributed to mark the occasion.

At all most all the gurudwaras, recitations of sacred Gurubani Keertans ( holy hymns) by renowned Sikh preachers of the city to inculcate the values of Guru Gobind Singh among the devotees on the occasion were held.

A religious procession was taken out from Sonari Gurudwara under the aegis of Central Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (CGPC), the apex body of Sikhs in the city. The procession would culminate at Sakchi Gurudwara in the evening after moving through various areas.

135,03-1-20,CDS sets deadline to prepare roadmap,"Newly-appointed first ever Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat has directed various branch heads of Integrated Defence Staff in the Defence Ministry to come up with recommendations for inter-service synergy and jointness in time bound manner. He also asked the officers to firm up the proposal by June this year to set up Air Defence Command to protect India's airspace and common logistics support pools as part of synergy.

This directive comes in the backdrop of the charter of the CDS to achieve optimal synergy between the three Services including the Army, Navy and IAF to fight modern day war. Moreover, the CDS will also ensure maximum utilization of resources within the budgetary constraints to maintain operational readiness and sustain the temp of modernisation.

On assuming charge as the first CDS, Rawat on Wednesday held a meeting with important functionaries of the Integrated Defence Staff here, officials said on Thursday.

Besides directing that the proposal to create Air Defence Command be prepared by June 30, 2020, he also set out priorities for execution of synergy by June 30 and December, 31 2020. Some of the areas identified for jointness and synergy include creation of common logistics support pools in stations where two or more services have their presence.

Emphasising collegiate system of functioning, Rawat directed that all three services and Coast Guard must be consulted and their views obtained in a time bound manner. Decisions will, however, be taken to ensure optimisation of resources. Efforts will be made to cut out infructuous ceremonial activities, which are manpower intensive. The CDS stressed that all must work towards accomplishing desired results and coming up with healthy views and ideas.

After taking charge as the CDS on Wednesday, Rawat had said the armed forces stay far away from politics. His comments come in the backdrop of his recent comments condemning student protests which drew sharp responses from political parties and on social media.

""Armed forces stay far away from politics. We work according to the directions of the Government in power,"" he said talking to the media after reviewing a tri-service guard of honour outside South Block.

Stating that the task cut out for the CDS is to integrate the three services and enhance their capability, Rawat said the CDS will ""remain neutral within the Service [Army] and to all three services.""

It is important to ensure that the 1+1+1 combine of the three services should add up to more than 3 through synergy, he observed. ""We have to achieve more through integration. The synergised effort should not be the sum total of the whole. It should be more,"" he observed adding his focus will be to ensure best and optimal use of resources allocated to the three services.

The mandate of CDS includes promoting jointness in procurement, training and staffing for the Services; facilitation of restructuring of military commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through ""establishment of joint/theatre commands and promoting use of indigenous equipment by the Services.""

However, there is no consensus presently among the Services on the formation on theatre commands and the Air Force has been especially opposed to the move. On this, Rawat said there are methods to achieve theaterisation. ""I think we are copying Western methods and what others have done. We can have our own systems. We will work out a mechanism... We have to find a system which suits India,"" he stated.

The CDS has an office in South Block and will continue to wear the uniform of the parent service. However, the rank badges and accoutrements of the CDS reflect jointness, integration and synergy and accordingly there is a new Peak cap, shoulder rank badges, belt buckle and car flag.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cds-sets-deadline-to-prepare-roadmap.html
136,03-1-20,"Sena, NCP, TMC slam Centre","nA fierce controversy broke out on Thursday over the rejection of the tableaux of Maharashtra and West Bengal for the Republic Day parade, as the ruling Shiv Sena, NCP and Trinamool Congress (TMC) dubbed the development as an “insult” to the people of the two States and said that behind the move, there appeared to be a Centre-hatched “political conspiracy” against the States ruled by the non-BJP parties.

On a day when the TMC charged that the Narendra Modi Government was “vindictive” in its approach and was meting out “step-motherly” treatment towards West Bengal, Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut tweeted: “At this year’s Republic Day parade, the tableaux of Maharashtra and West Bengal will not be seen. Is there any conspiracy behind this? Is that our crime that we are strong patriots?”.

“Maharashtra tableau attracts the nation’s attention during the parades along Rajpath in New Delhi. Maharashtra tableaux have won first prize on several occasions in the past. What does the Union Government wants to achieve by sidelining Maharashtra? Had such a thing happened during the Congress’ rule at the Centre, the BJP would have raised hue and cry. Why is the BJP keeping quiet?,” Raut asked.

Raut urged the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and West Bengal to take up the matter with the Centre and find out reasons for rejection of their tableaux for the Republic Day parade.

NCP leader and MP Supriya Sule, who took the lead in flagging the issue, tweeted: “The Union Government has rejected the tableaux of Maharashtra and West Bengal for the Republic Day parade. Republic Day is a national celebration. It is essential that the Centre gives representation to all States. The Centre’s act smacks of malice. It is meting out discriminatory treatment towards to the Opposition-ruled states”.

“Maharashtra and West Bengal played an important role in the country’s independence struggle. The act of rejecting the participation of their tableaux in the Republic Day parade is an insult to the people of the two States. We condemn publicly the Centre’s act,” Sule tweeted.

Meanwhile, West Bengal Minister of State for Legislative Affairs Tapas Roy charged that the Narendra Modi Government had adopted a “vindictive” attitude towards his state “Since we have been opposing anti-people policies of the BJP Government, the Centre is meting out step-motherly treatment towards West Bengal. As we have opposed anti-people laws like CAA the Centre has rejected our tableau proposal”.

Roy recalled that the West Bengal’s earlier proposals to showcase Kanyashree in 2015 and 'Ekata-i Sampriti' (unity is harmony) programme in 2018 during Republic Day parades had been rejected by the Centre.

However, West Bengal BJP unit president Dilip Ghosh contested Roy’s statement by saying that West Bengal’s tableau proposals were rejected as the State Government didn't properly follow the rules and procedure regarding it.

“The State Government has not followed the rules. Other states have followed them, so their tableau proposals have been accepted. The TMC should stop doing politics on each and every issue,” Ghosh said. On its part, the Government has rejected the State Government’s criticism, by saying that it had followed due process in the selection of tableaux.

Official sources said that the tableaux proposals received from various states/UTs and Central Ministries/departments were evaluated in a series of meetings of the expert committee comprising of eminent persons in the field of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography etc.

“Many tableaux of BJP-ruled states have also been rejected this year. These states are Haryana, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh. It is pertinent to mention here that the tableau of the government of West Bengal was shortlisted for participation in Republic Day Parade 2019 as an outcome of the same process,” the sources said.

“For Republic Day Parade 2020, a total of 56 tableaux proposals (32 from states/UTs and 24 from Ministries/departments) were received. Out of these, 22 proposals, comprising of 16 states/UTs and six ministries/departments, have finally been shortlisted for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2020 after a series of five meetings,” the sources added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena--ncp--tmc-slam-centre.html
137,03-1-20,Maharashtra Guv Koshyari visits Matoshri for dinner with Uddhav,"In an unusual gesture, Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Thursday night visited Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s Bandra residence “Matoshri” in north-west Mumbai for a dinner.

Official sources confirmed that Koshyari headed from Raj Bhavan to “Matoshri” at 8 pm to break bread with Uddhav.

On his arrival, the Governor was welcomed at “Matoshrri” by Uddhav himself, his wife Rashmi, his Cabinet Minister-son Aditya and youngest son Tejas. The Governor was at “Matoshri” for more than a hour.

Incidentally, Kohyari had hosted breakfast for Uddhav and his wife Rashmi at Raj Bhavan after the latter assumed office as the chief minister early last month.

“In return, Uddhav hosted a dinner for the Governor. The Governor readily accepted the chief minister’s invite and visited “Matoshri” had dinner with Uddhav and his other family members,” a Shiv Sena leader close to the chief minister said.

Thackerays had laid out a special meal for the Governor. However, it was not known immediately know what were the dishes that were laid out at the dinner for Koshyari who prefers simple vegetarian food.

The Governor’s visit to Uddhav’s residence came to be described in the State political as “dinner diplomacy” initiated by the chief minister and responded positively by Koshyari.

It may be recalled that the relations between the Governor and the Shiv Sena had soured after Koshyari declined to invite the party to form a government on November 11 and subsequently on November 23, he hastily swore in BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis and NCP’s breakaway group leader Ajit Pawar as the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister respectively.

Later, the Shiv Sena along other affected parties moved the Supreme Court to challenge the invitation extended by the Governor to the BJP to form a government. On November 26, the apex court ordered the floor test in the State Assembly the following day. The subsequent developments that took place on the day (November 26) saw Ajit Pawar put in his papers, leading to the immediate resignation of Fadnavis and consequent collapse of the BJP-led government within a record 80 hours.

Thursday's dinner meeting between Koshyari and Uddhav came in handy for the both in improving the personal relations between them. However, this is not for the first time that the state Governor has visited the chief minister’s residence. It may be recalled that a few years ago, then Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao and his wife had visited the former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis at the latter’s official bungalow, ‘Varsha’ when the latter’s daughter Divija was injured in an accident.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maharashtra-guv-koshyari-visits-matoshri-for-dinner-with-uddhav.html

Khadse, while speaking to Marathi news channel ABP Majha on Wednesday, also said that some people wanted to end his political career.

“I am told by the BJP's State core committee members that Devendra Fadnavis and Girish Mahajan had opposed issuing ticket to me from Muktainagar Assembly seat in Jalgaon district. They even opposed BJP central committee's willingness to give ticket to me,” Khadse said.

“I was told about it by some core committee members on condition of anonymity,” the former State Minister claimed.

Khadse resigned as revenue minister in 2016 in the then BJP-led Government over allegations of impropriety in a land deal. He was at that time the senior-most minister in the Fadnavis-led Cabinet.

He could never return to the Cabinet and was denied ticket by the BJP in the Assembly polls in October last year.

140,03-1-20,Massive turnout expected in Didi’s Siliguri rally today,"The ruling Trinamool Congress is expecting a massive turnout on its Friday rally at Siliguri which will be led by Chief Minister

Mamata Banerjee to carry the protest movement against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act in North Bengal.

In what is being termed as a “comeback rally” for the Bengal ruling outfit — considering the fact that the TMC lost seven out of eight parliamentary seats in that part of the State stretching about 400 kms and including seven districts — the Trinamool leaders are leaving no stone unturned to ensure attendance of at least a lakh of people.

“Though we had lost the Lok Sabha seats in North Bengal as the BJP managed to polarize the atmosphere, this time the people have realised their dirty game plan to neutralize the impact of price rise, joblessness, fall of industrial and agricultural output with a highly communal narrative that manifests itself through the obnoxious CAA and National Citizenship Register,” said Bengal Minister and local MLA Gautam Deb adding there is no doubt that Friday’s march would witness about a lakh people walking with the Chief Minister.

The TMC has been particularly working among the Gorkhas who were largely cold to a BJP’s pro-CAA rally on December 24 so that a majority of that community joins the Friday march. Gorkhas form a large part of the population in Darjeeling Hills, Siliguri, Terrain are and parts of Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar.

“The treatment the Gorkhas have been meted out in Assam where about one lakh people from the community have been thrown out of the final NRC list is a matter of concern here in Hills and Terrain region. They had voted for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections but now they will not side with them. This was proved by the minimum presence of the Gorkha population in the BJP’s Abihandan Yatra on December 24,” said a local TMC MLA. This apart, the TMC is also counting on the Rajbanshi, Kamptapuri and Cooch population of Raiganj, Jalpaiguri, Alipurudar and Coochbehar for making the rally a grand success.

After taking out five consecutive rallies in Kolkata and around the Chief Minister has decided to take out her campaign in districts. She led a large rally at Purulia on December 31.

According to a local TMC leader in Coochbehar though the BJP had been able to make an inroad amongst these communities in the parliamentary elections they were not willing to remain by its side thanks to the faulty implementation of NRC in neighbouring Assam.

“More than 10 lakh Bengalis including Rajbanshis, Cooch and Kamptapuris have been thrown out of the NTC. Despite being Indian citizens they are now spending their time in courts and tribunals to get back their citizenship rights.

Thousands of local people have their relatives in Assam who are suffering under the NRC’s impact and these people who had voted for the BJP will never go back to its fold. They will naturally side by Mamata Banerjee and respond to her call in Friday’s rally,” said the TMC district leader from Coochbehar who had earlier been in the BJP but has rejoined Trinamool for the same reason.

“We hope to get more than a lakh people coming to the rally. Maybe the rally turns out to be bigger breaking all the records. In fact the Leftists and the Congress men too may join the rally not because they will be with us in future but because they want to register their protest,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/massive-turnout-expected-in-didi---s-siliguri-rally-today.html

142,03-1-20,Protest against Pakistan's atrocities on minorities: Modi to CAA protesters,"Lambasting Congress and its allies for opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the ongoing protests were against the Parliament and called on the agitators to raise their voice against Pakistan's atrocities on its minorities for the last 70 years.

The Prime Minister said protecting and supporting minorities of neighbouring countries who have sought refuge in India was our cultural and national responsibility.

In the meeting, both sides also agreed to hold the next round of Dialogue on a mutually convenient date in India, the Ministry of External Affairs had said in a statement.

Kumar had said last month that both sides decided to ""defer"" Abe's visit for the December 15-17 summit to a mutually convenient date. The cancellation of the Japanese prime minister's trip came a day after Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan called off their visits to India in view of the situation arising out of the enactment of the CAA.

Diplomatic sources had said the Japanese government clearly conveyed to New Delhi that it would not be possible for Abe to travel to Guwahati in view of large-scale protests in the northeastern region.

Meanwhile, on Thursday Kumar also said India has reached out to countries across the world on the issues of the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens(NRC). ""We did reach out to countries across the globe on Citizenship Amendment Act and the NRC,"" he said.

Kumar said ""we emphasised that the Act (CAA) just expedites acquiring of citizenship to persecuted minorities. It does not change basic structure of Constitution."" The ministry also said the Indian missions abroad were asked to share the prospectus on the Citizenship Amendment Act with the host Government.

Asked about Indo-China boundary negotiations last month and talk of early harvest to the boundary question, Kumar said there was this feeling that the boundary issue should be addressed from a strategic perspective of Indo- China relations.

""It was also decided that while the discussions go on under the Special Representative talks framework, there should be peace and tranquillity along the border which is very important for the overall development of the bilateral relationship,"" Kumar said. Noting that these were sensitive negotiations, spokesperson said one issue should not cloud the overall relationship.

India and China last month agreed to intensify efforts to achieve a ""fair"", ""reasonable"" and mutually acceptable solution to the vexed boundary issue, resolving that its early settlement will serve the fundamental interests of both countries.

There was a consensus during ""constructive"" border talks here between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval that both sides should respect each other's sensitivities and concerns in order to build mutual trust, according to the external affairs ministry.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-abe-summit-date-to-be-finalised-soon--mea.html

His remarks came amid criticism by the BJP and BSP supremo Mayawati, who accused the State Government of being insensitive.

Expressing displeasure on the response to the tragedy, Mayawati also questioned the silence of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, saying if she does not meet mothers of the deceased children, then her meeting with the kin of the victims of violence during the anti-CAA protests in UP will be “construed as pure theatrics”.

“The Government is sensitive to the death of sick infants in JK Lon Hospital in Kota. There should no politics over the issue. Infant mortality at this hospital is steadily decreasing. We will try to reduce it further. It is our top priority that mothers and children remain in good healthy,” Gehlot tweeted in Hindi.

Gehlot further claimed that the first ICU for children in Rajasthan was established by the Congress Government in 2003.

“We also established an ICU for children in Kota in 2011,” he added.

Gehlot said the aim of 'Nirogi Rajasthan' was a priority for the government and an expert team from the Centre could further help improve health services in the state.

“We are ready to improve medical services in the state through discussions and cooperation with an expert team from the Centre,” he said.

Meanwhile, BJP state president Satish Poonia expressed displeasure on the state government's attitude towards the issue.

“It is regrettable that the state health minister did not even visit the hospital. The Chief Minister is known for being sensitive.

Sources in the passport office said the department had written a letter to the MEA, seeking it go-ahead to file a criminal case against Patkar for concealing the details about many pending cases against her at the time of filing the passport application in 2017.

The officials said her passport has automatically been impounded after she surrendered it on December 9, in response to a notice issued to her seeking explanation. However, by surrendering the passport she cannot absolve herself from prosecution, they added.

After receiving the permission, the RPO will file a criminal case against her as per the Passport Act. The maximum punishment under the Act is two-year rigorous imprisonment or Rs 5,000 fine or both.

A complaint was filed against the activist in June 2019 by a journalist, alleging that Patkar had obtained her passport by concealing and suppressing material facts from the RPO Mumbai.

The complainant had provided the details of nine criminal cases with documentary evidence, pending against her in various districts of Madhya Pradesh.

Patkar in her passport application of March 30, 2017 claimed that no criminal cases are pending against her and in the column on pending criminal cases, if any, she declared ""none"".

The RPO Mumbai also sought details of pending cases from the Director General of Police, Madhya Pradesh, who confirmed that charge sheet has been filed against her in five cases.

In the show cause notice to Patkar issued on October 18 last year, the RPO Mumbai had asked as to why her passport should not be impounded for failing to disclose information regarding pendency of criminal cases against her.

Out of the nine criminal cases registered against her, three are in Barwani, one in Alirajpur and five in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh.

The notice had said: ""While obtaining passport bearing no...Dated March 30, 2017 you have not disclosed the fact regarding pendency of above cases and obtained passport by suppression of material information"".

""In view of the same, it is proposed to impound your passport bearing no...And any other passport if issued subsequently under section 10(3)(e) of the Passports Act 1967.

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the appointment of Sharma for a period of three years or till the age of 70 years.

According to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Rakesh Kumar Vats, the secretary general in the board of governors of the Medical Council of India (MCI), has been appointed as the secretary of the Commission for the similar term.

President Ram Nath Kovind had on August 8 given assent to the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, which provides for a system that improves access to quality and affordable medical education and ensures availability of adequate and high quality medical professionals in all parts of the country, among others.

The new law provides for setting up of an NMC in place of the Medical Council of India for development and regulation of all aspects of medical education, profession and institutions.

""Some states are passing resolutions against the CAA. Citizenship is a subject under the Central government, and the law has been passed by the Centre and bears the signature of President,"" Nadda said.

""It has been implemented, and beneficiaries will get citizenship, you (state governments opposing the CAA) should stop misleading people,"" he added, speaking at Rs CAA Janjagaran Sammelan' organized by the BJP here.

""You can tell facts to the Congress, but it is not in a position to understand truth. We can explain only if they understand, but if they do not want to understand despite being intelligent, then we cannot do anything,"" he said.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did not know anything about the CAA, he said.

""I would like to ask the Congress why its leaders did not condemn the violence during (anti-CAA) protests that caused damage to public properties. They are all hand in glove,"" the BJP working president said.

Eighty per cent of beneficiaries under the Act would be Dalits, Nadda claimed.

""Congress sheds crocodile tear for Dalits....It only used them for political ends....80 per cent of those being provided citizenship under the Act are Dalits,"" he said.

Communities such as Matua, Rajvanshi and Namo Sudra migrated to India from the three neighbouring countries and they would be the biggest beneficiaries of the CAA, he said.

On New Year Eve, the Kerala Legislative Assembly had passed a resolution against the Act with the ruling CPI(M), CPI and the Opposition Congress and the Muslim League coming together in a rare show of unity. The lone BJP member in the House expressed his opposition against the resolution.

On Thursday, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan in a brief interaction with the media at Thiruvananthapuram on the sidelines of a national seminar on Vedas said that the resoilution passed by the Legislative assembly against the CAA has no constitutional or legal validity.

“Citizenship is an issue that comes under the Union Government. State government has got nothing to do with it. Why is the State Government wasting time? The resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly has no constitutional or legal validity,” said the Governor.

Arif Mohammed Khan further pointed out that the CAA would not have any impact in Kerala as there were no illegal migrants in the State. The Governor expressed his surprise over the obsession of certain political parties in the State over the CAA which has no bearing in Kerala.

The observations by the Governor earned the ire of Marxist and Congress leaders in the State. K Muraleedharan, MP, who is the son of former Congress leader late K Karunakaran warned that he would not allow the Governor to come out of the Raj Bhavan. In a scathing attack, the MP described the Kerala Governor as an agent of the BJP.

Fornmer Chief Minister Oommen Chandi too came down heavily on the stance of the Governor viz-a-viz the CAA. But Subramanian Swamy MO and former Union Minister of law fully agreed with Kerala Governor. “The resolution adopted by the Kerala Legislative Assembly against an Act passed by both Houses of Parliament is a meaningless action. It is illegal and unconstitutional. All I can do is to pity the members of the Kerala Legislative Assembly who showed the outside world that they were ignorant of the law and Constitution of the country.

The Governor has pointed out their mistake and I fully endorse his views as he was well within his rights to say so,” said Dr Swamy.

According to Defence PRO, Lt-Col Devender Anand, “29 year old Naik Sawant Sandip Raghunath,hailing from Satara district of Maharashtra and 25 year old Rifleman Arjun Thapa Magar, hailing from Nepal had attained martyrdom during exchange of fire with heavily armed terrorists in a thickly forested village of Dabar-Potha in Nowshera area of Rajouri in the intervening night of December 31-January 1, 2020”.

Since then, joint teams of security forces have laid a tight cordon in the general area to plug all the escape routes of terrorists, believed to have infiltrated from across the line of control early Monday morning.

According to local villagers in the area, “a group of heavily armed terrorists had taken shelter for some time in the house of a local villager in Dabar-Potha and had made specific queries related to location of local army camps, route towards Kashmir valley via Mughal road”.

Soon after terrorists stepped out of their home, the head of the family had raised first alarm and tipped off the village sarpanch to immediately alert local army unit.

Despite launching cordon and search operations in real time, the security forces have so far failed to track down their foot prints.

Highly placed sources claimed, possibility of their presence (heavily armed terrorists) in a safe hideout, cannot be ruled out as security forces have failed to establish fresh contact with them after a brief exchange of fire leading to fatal injuries of two soldiers.

The security forces are maintaining a tight vigil in the area and have even stopped vehicular movement towards these forward villages to prevent these terrorists from mixing with the local population and escaping using public transport vehicle.

“The Congress always indulges in vote-bank politics. Why is the party opposing CAA? This is a conspiracy by the Congress and other Opposition parties to incite people to commit violence,” the chief minister said.

Rupani was in Kothamba to unveil a statue of Dr B R Ambedkar and to inaugurate some developmental works. After Partition, Mahatma Gandhi had said Hindus of Pakistan and Afghanistan should be allowed to return to India, he claimed, adding that this was also agreed upon in the LiaquatNehru Pact, but the agreement was not implemented.

“Due to anarchy, majority of 450 temples were demolished and only 20 remained in those countries,” he said, referring to alleged temple demolitions in the three countries.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/it-s-our-responsibility-to-take-in-persecuted-minorities--guj-cm.html

163,03-1-20,Sec 144 in Varanasi on 359 days: Priyanka; dist police deny claim,"Congress leader slams PM Modi

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, saying that he had the “gall” to tell people that they had nothing to fear when “Section 144 of the CrPC was imposed in his constituency of Varanasi on 359 days of 365 days in a year.”

“Despite the prohibitory orders for such a long period, the PM has the gall to say that people have nothing to fear?” Priyanka said in her tweet.

Priyanka tweeted a report quoting a BHU student who claimed that Section 144 was imposed on Varanasi for 359 days in 365 days of 2019.

Neither denying or confirming Priyanka’s allegation, Varanasi ADM (City) Vinod Kuma Singh said, “After checking the records, we would only confirm. However, it may be possible because Varanasi is a religious city where festivals fall across the year and are celebrated on big scales.”

However, talking to the Pioneer, Varanasi Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary said Section 144 is promulgated by the District Magistrate on need basis, but it is factually incorrect to claim that Varanasi has remained under prohibited orders for a year. “But we will enforce Section 144 during the forthcoming board examinations near all the centres. This should answer your question,” the SSP replied when asked if Section 144 was clamped in Varanasi for 359 days in 2019.

Varanasi is a holy city, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC are often imposed. At present, there is Section 144 effective which was imposed on December 11 which would remain effective till February 5 for maintaining the law and order during UP TET, Christmas, New Year, Makar Sankranti, Republic Day, and arrivals of VVIPs. Last time, it was imposed on October 16 and remained effective till December 9 for Guru Nanak Jyanti, Barawafat, Karthik Purnima, Dev Deepawali, Eid, bank and other competitive examinations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sec-144-in-varanasi-on-359-days--priyanka--dist-police-deny-claim.html

169,03-1-20,"Air India, BPCL, Concor divestments ‘unlikely’ this fiscal: Govt official","In what can potentially hurt the fiscal math for the ongoing fiscal, a senior Government official said strategic divestments in Air India, BPCL and Container Corporation are “unlikely” to be completed in FY20.

Work on all these companies is on and the process is facing delays due to “surprises” encountered once the wheels have begun moving, the official from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) said.

The Ministry has budgeted to garner Rs 1.05 lakh crore from divestments during the fiscal. The Government has already breached the budgeted fiscal deficit gap and the extent of the gap stands at 115 per cent with four months to go.

The official declined to comment on the impact of such events on the fiscal math. When asked if the strategic divestment in the Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) — which can alone fetch the Government over Rs 60,000 crore if it were to sell its entire 53 per cent stake —will be completed this fiscal, the official said, “unlikely”.

“We are not saying that for ourselves and our timelines are such that it should happen. But we know that the process throws up surprises,” the official said speaking on the sidelines of an event here.

Similarly, on Container Corporation (Concor) and Air India as well, the official said that the sales will not go through in the current fiscal ending March 31.

The official said the Government is preparing the financial statements and getting the data room ready for the sales, suggesting that such aspects take time. Till now, the industry has shown “excitement” over the companies which are being floated, the official said, adding that there are additional details which may be sought by potential bidders.

When asked about the strategic sale in Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), the official said the sale is at a certain stage and going strong. The Government, which had exceeded the budgeted divestment target last fiscal, has mopped up only Rs 12,359 crore of the Rs 1.05 lakh crore target as of September. According to media reports, the stake sale in SCI can fetch it Rs 2,000 crore and over Rs 13,000 crore can accrue from Concor.

Forex traders said crude oil prices surged after US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

At the Interbank Foreign Exchange, the rupee opened on a weak note at 71.56 then fell further to 71.62 against the US dollar, showing a decline of 24 paise over its previous closing.

On Thursday, the rupee had settled at 71.38 against the US dollar.

General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,"" the Department of Defence said.

171,03-1-20,Ratan Tata moves SC against NCLAT order reinstating Mistry as Tata Sons chairman,"Ratan Tata on Friday filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking to quash a company law appellate court order directing Tata Sons to rehire the chairman it had fired in 2016, saying the judgment was ""wrong, erroneous and contrary to the record of the case"".

His petition is separate from the one filed by Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the USD 110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate, in the Supreme Court on Thursday that sought a stay on the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's December 18, 2019 order to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman.

Ratan Tata, who is chairman emeritus and a shareholder of Tata Sons, in the petition said the NCLAT judgment was wrong as it treats Tata Sons as a two-group company.

Mistry, he contended, was made the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons in a purely professional capacity and not as a representative of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which holds 18.4 per cent in Tata Sons.

Tata Trusts, of whom Ratan Tata had been a chairman for many years, holds 65.89 per cent of Tata Sons.

The petition said the NCLAT order wrongly suggests that ""someone from the SP Group had been a director because of some entrenched right or convention"".

""This is untrue and contrary to the records and the articles of association of Tata Sons, which are undisputed and binding on the shareholders including the SP Group,"" he contended.

He said Mistry's leadership ""was lacking"" in ""his reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the Chairman of Tata Sons and address any conflict in this regard, which was a condition precedent to his appointment as Chairman of Tata Sons"".

Mistry, he alleged, ""concentrated power and authority in his own hands"" and ""board members were being alienated on matters relating to Tata Operating Companies where Tata Sons had huge financial exposure and the Board of Tata Sons had to contend with such decisions being cast upon it as fait accompli"".

The chairman emeritus targeted Mistry for the handling of the failed partnership with Japan's DoCoMo saying it showed his ""complete obstinacy"" as he attempted to resist complying with the legal obligations further. ""This is not what the Tata Sons brand stands for. Quite to the contrary, honouring its commitments is one of Tata Sons' highest virtues it takes great pride in. Spat with DoCoMo brought ill-repute and reputational losses to Tata Sons.""

Ratan Tata said the NCLAT reached a judgment based on ""a contrived and self-serving reading of certain correspondence from which it derives erroneous findings which kaleidoscopically portray the larger theme of the judgment on purported oppression and prejudice to the Shapoorji Pallonji Group (SP Group)"".

""The Impugned Judgment is also infirm because it blatantly indulges in propagating a selective narrative where relevant facts and records have been glossed over,"" he said. ""The pretense of reasoning and judicial approach is betrayed by omission to consider the record itself.""

He said there are no 550 mails between him and Cyrus Mistry as mentioned in the NCLAT judgment. ""These mails were between Chairman Emeritus and Chairman Cyrus Mistry and not by entities in Court.""

""The whole case of oppression and prejudice is based entirely on words and statements contained in correspondence without there being an iota of evidence to buttress any actual loss/injury being caused to Tata Sons as a result of Cyrus Mistry being forced to act on such interference/interdiction against his wishes,"" the petition said.

It went on to state that it was ""very unfortunate and distressing"" that the NCLAT judgment without providing any proper evidence has passed adverse remarks against Ratan Tata who has spent more than half of his life in building the name of the Tata Sons and other Tata operating companies to one of the top global companies.

The judgment creates a wrong legal precedent that is vulnerable to being misused against several companies, including the public sector and government companies, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ratan-tata-moves-sc-against-nclat-order-reinstating-mistry-as-tata-sons-chairman-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ratan-tata-moves-sc-against-nclat-order-reinstating-mistry-as-tata-sons-chairman.html
172,03-1-20,Kim touts strategic weapon amid stall in talks,"Expressing deep frustration over stalled nuclear talks, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned of unspecified “shocking” action and that his country will soon reveal a new “strategic weapon” to the world as its bolsters its nuclear deterrent in face of “gangster-like” US pressure.

Kim also said North Korea was no longer obligated to maintain a self-imposed suspension on the testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which President Donald Trump has touted as a major diplomatic accomplishment. But Kim gave no clear indication that a resumption of such tests was impending and appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations.

Kim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40-50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the US mainland.

Kim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

Lee Sang-min, spokesman for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said North Korea carrying out its threat to showcase a new strategic weapon would be unhelpful for diplomacy.

Strategic weapons usually refer to nuclear-capable delivery systems such as ICBMs, but North Korea otherwise has been vague about what new arms it would display. It announced in December that it performed two “crucial” tests at its long-range rocket launch site that would further strengthen its nuclear deterrent.

Kim’s comments published in state media Wednesday were made at a key, four-day meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered over disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions.

Some experts say North Korea, which has always been sensitive about electoral changes in US government, will avoid serious negotiations in the coming months as it watches how Trump’s impending impeachment trial over his dealings with Ukraine affects US presidential elections in November.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/kim-touts-strategic-weapon-amid-stall-in-talks.html
173,03-1-20,India’s mfg sector activity rose in Dec,"The country’s manufacturing sector activity improved in December driven by new orders that rose at the fastest pace since July as companies ramped up production and resumed hiring efforts, a monthly survey said on Thursday.

Notwithstanding the improvement in operating conditions during December, companies were cautious regarding the annual outlook of 2020 and this could have an impact on job creation and investment in the year, the survey said.

The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI rose from 51.2 in November to 52.7 in December, registering the “joint-strongest” improvement in 10 months.

“Factories benefited from a rebound in demand, and responded by scaling up production to the greatest extent since May. There were also renewed increases in input purchasing and employment during December,” said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

As per the survey, new work orders witnessed marked improvement, with the pace of expansion picking up to the fastest since July.

Moreover, the uptick in total sales was supported by higher demand from overseas. New export orders expanded for the 26th month in a row, albeit modestly, the survey said.

This is the 29th consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Lima, however, said “a note of caution is evident from the survey’s measure of business confidence. The degree of optimism signalled at the end of 2019 was the weakest in just under three years, reflecting concerns over market conditions, which could restrict job creation and investment in the early part of 2020”.

According to the survey, production is expected to expand in the coming 12 months, but the degree of optimism weakened to a 34-month low. On the inflation front, the overall rate of inflation reached a 13-month high.

174,03-1-20,Asian markets lifted by China support and trade optimism,"Asian markets started the new decade on the front foot, with most rallying out of the blocks on Thursday on lingering trade optimism, while China’s central bank announced fresh stimulus for the country’s stuttering economy.

The broad advances come as investors remain upbeat about the global outlook after Washington and Beijing eventually reached a trade agreement to ease tensions between the two, while Brexit uncertainty has essentially been removed.

However, geopolitical worries resurfaced following a warning from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests had ended, with talks with the US going nowhere.

Shanghai and Hong Kong led gains after the People’s Bank of China said it would lower the amount of cash lenders must keep in reserve, freeing up more than USD 100 billion for loans to small businesses.

The move comes as leaders try to kickstart growth in the world’s number two economy, which is running at its weakest for almost three decades.

“We expect the PBoC to continue to ease policy through 2020, trying to ensure growth remains around that six per cent target,” Stephen Halmarick at Commonwealth Bank of Australia told Bloomberg TV. “Easier monetary policy across Asia and the Pacific is a theme for this year as well.”

Shanghai and Hong Kong both added one per cent, while Sydney gained 0.1 per cent and Singapore put on 0.7 per cent. Taipei and Bangkok also rose, though Manila and Jakarta retreated. Tokyo remains closed for the rest of the week.

Dealers were also being supported by relief after Donald Trump said the mini China-US trade deal will be signed off in Washington on January 15, and he will later travel to Beijing for the next phase of talks.

Seoul was down one per cent after Kim declared a self-imposed moratorium was no longer needed, raising the possibility that the North could soon resume missile launches or nuclear tests.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/asian-markets-lifted-by-china-support-and-trade-optimism.html

178,03-1-20,Tata Sons moves SC against NCLAT order on Cyrus Mistry,"Tata Sons on Thursday moved the Supreme Court challenging reinstatement of Cyrus Mistry as executive Chairman and director of Tata Sons and the three group companies — Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Tata Industries Ltd and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.

The company has challenged the complete order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), pronounced on December 18, restoring Mistry as executive Chairman and also his immediate reinstatement as director of Tata Sons and three group companies.

The petition seeks a stay on the NCLAT order in the wake of the TCS Board Meeting slated for January 9.

It is learnt that the board meeting is likely to consider the third quarter earnings and a discussion on the reinstatement of Mistry as a director. The petitioner will urge the apex court to list the matter for urgent hearing after the court reopens after vacations on January 6.

The NCLAT while reinstating ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry, held that the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as his successor is illegal. The appeals court observed the haste in Mistry’s removal as chairman of the Tata group’s holding company, and this action completely ignored the interest and oppression of minority shareholders.

However, the appellate tribunal has granted the Tata Group four weeks to file an appeal against its judgement. The restoration order will only be operational after this time period.

Aryama Sundaram, counsel for Mistry, had told IANS, “NCLT appeared to have gone with the Tata name and the majoritarian view in its earlier judgment. This goes against the grain of Company Law and Companies Act. If one follows the earlier path, then you don’t need provisions in law which safeguards minority shareholders’ rights. “This was an erroneous approach. What we did as counsel was that we contested this template. It wasn’t the individual right of Mr Mistry, which was being trampled, it was the oppression and mismanagement of the board that was in question and this directly impacted varied shareholders including millions of public shareholders.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/tata-sons-moves-sc-against-nclat-order-on-cyrus-mistry.html

At a meeting with some 13 Air India unions in Delhi, Puri also said that the government was trying to address the concerns of the employees regarding issues such as job protection post privatisation, a union representative said.

“The Minister said Air India has a debt of Rs 80,000 crore and no expert has solution to that. In this situation, privatisation is the only choice left for the Government,” one of the union representatives told PTI after the meeting, which lasted for an hour.

180,03-1-20,China detains activists in year-end crackdown,"Over a dozen Chinese lawyers and activists were detained or went missing in the final days of 2019 in a crackdown on participants of a private democracy gathering, rights groups said on Thursday.

The Chinese government has severely reduced the space for civil liberties since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, rounding up rights lawyers, labour activists and even Marxists students in various sweeps.

The latest crackdown was linked to a December gathering in the east coast city of Xiamen in Fujian province, where participants discussed “democratic transition in China,” said Human Rights Watch researcher Wang Yaqiu.

The period around Christmas and New Year is traditionally when China chooses to sentence prominent dissidents in an effort to minimise international media attention, “so it is not a surprise that they chose this particular time to launch a manhunt of activists,” Wang said.

The meeting involved a small group of people “peacefully discussing politics in a private space,” she said.

Ding Jiaxi, a prominent Beijing-based disbarred lawyer previously jailed for protesting against official corruption, was among the activists known to have been detained across the country since December 26, according to China Human Rights Defenders (CHRD).

At least seven people, including Shandong-based disbarred lawyer Liu Shuqing, were released after being detained for questioning.

Other civil society figures, including pro-democracy activist Xu Zhiyong and human rights lawyer Tang Jingling, have gone missing or are currently unreachable, CHRD said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-detains-activists-in-year-end-crackdown.html
181,03-1-20,‘Chhapaak isn’t a biopic’,"When Deepika Padukone unveiled her look in Chhapaak, based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, people saw her decision to do the film as “gutsy”, “brave” and “life altering.” Deepika, who has also turned a producer with the Meghna Gulzar directorial, said she didn’t think about her appearance in it and how people would react to her “different look.”

Apart from her talent, the audience and her fans have been in awe of her beauty. Asked if she saw Chhapaak as a risky film as she looks different, Deepika said, “No, it is not something that ever crossed my mind. I never thought about my appearance or the way I am going to look. In fact, that’s exactly what we want to challenge through this film. That we all have very set ideas, notions of what beauty is and we really want to challenge that and broaden that perspective through this film.”

She added, “I never really thought about what people are going to think or say because I was going to look different from the way people have seen me onscreen before.”

The project is certainly very close to her heart and it didn’t take her long to say “yes” to it.

“Meghna came to me with the script and I was instantly drawn to Meghna’s honesty, to Laxmi’s story and her journey. I felt like it was very very powerful and I felt like as an actor, I definitely wanted to be a part of the film. Even as a person, I felt like there’s a really strong narrative in Laxmi’s life, and I wanted the world to see that,” she said.

Deepika said that she was so impressed by Laxmi’s story, among other things, that she decided to be attached to the film as a producer too. “We finished the narration and I said yes to the film. I said, ‘wait a second, should we produce this film as well?’ Meghna was open to the idea. She and I came on board as producers and then we went around to studios and had Fox (Fox Star Studios) join us,” she said.

The film’s narrative leans on Laxmi but Deepika says it’s not a biopic. “It also throws light on acid violence in our country,” she said.

The film’s team has women calling the shots. What was it like for Deepika to work on a film set full of powerful women? “Gender has never figured in my scheme of things. I am not doing Chhapaak because it is by a female director. I am doing it because I really have faith in Meghna,” she said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---chhapaak-isn---t-a-biopic----2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---chhapaak-isn---t-a-biopic---.html
182,03-1-20,Try this road trip,"Despite a few misses, Roadies Cafe makes for a cool place for its light bites, says Ayushi Sharma

As I sat at the Cafe Roadies on a chilly winter evening, I stared blankly at the golden Edison bulbs spread all across the ceiling, wrapped in green climbers. On my left were glass windows splashed with what looked like melted chocolate. The TV show Roadies has always had a separate fan base and this newbie cafe at Gardens Galleria, Noida, is based on the very theme. Its set of wooden tables and chairs gives a very rustic and rugged feel, similar to that of the show. To make the decor look more ragged and rough, a bullet stood right in front of a wall as though breaking it through. It could have easily won the tag of an “insta-worthy picture spot,” only if there was any such contest. Some quirky quotes on the wall, too, resonated with the theme and the vibe of the game show.

Coming to what I was here for — food — they suggested that I should start with hummus. Well, if you want to up your hummus game, you should try your hands at Hum-Mus Sath Sath Hai, an authentic variety seasoned with tandoori pickle and served with pita bread. Prepared using chickpeas, it was cooked, mashed and blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. The only variation, here, was that it had a touch of tandoori pickle. Just for the record, I am a huge fan of hummus and usually like to add a swirl of yogurt to bump up the creaminess factor but this one was just complete in itself. Initially, I wondered why would anyone like a bland bread as well as an almost bland dip together? But this triangular pita bread cleared the apprehension.

Before I could even realise, the next on the plate was Roadies Fry-Yay, one of the finest preparations of potatoes loaded with sesame and goodness of honey. Let’s just say that they came straight from the wok. When you eat honey chilli potatoes, what really matters is how crisp the potatoes are in spite of being tossed in the sauce. The key to making the dish super crispy is to batter fry the potato fingers twice. Deep frying them only once results in potatoes that don’t hold their shape and get soggy after a few minutes. These really stood out for their crunch. Ideally, I should have used a fork or a toothpick but to enjoy the real flavours, I ate them with bare fingers.

After munching on to the starters, I hopped on to trying something different and cheesy altogether. And wait, the place actually had ‘my’ kind of combo — It’s Cheesy. It was a combination of melted cheese served fondue style with toasted bread sticks and crispy naan fingers. Even though it was an amalgamation of five kinds of cheese, the dish tasted bland and the graph of my expectations declined a bit. Let’s say, to soothe the tastebuds or just as a mere accompaniment, I ordered Old Fashion and Margarita. While the former cocktail was blended with Bourbon, sugar cubes and orange bitters, the latter had tequila, triple sec, sweet and sour. I could taste all the different flavours, which seemed perfectly blended, and the drinks — not much diluted — certainly made a mark.

Moving on to the main course, I ordered the special vegetarian tandoori platter. The two-levelled plate was filled with Achari paneer tikka, Kagazi paneer barfi on the first base and Beetroot seekh, Tandoori mushrooms on the second. The former, Achari paneer tikka, was yet another variation of the regular paneer tikka, flavoured with pickling spices. If you enjoy pickle and relish the sour taste of lemon or mango, you might love it. However, the Kagazi paneer barfi was the ultimate of all. Filled with crushed dry fruits, while its outer layering was extremely delicate and soft, it turned out to be a complete opposite when I bit into it.

Next up was the Peri peri chicken, which was overnight marinated chicken patty, served with homemade peri peri sauce. The dish, topped with jalapenos, melted yellow cheddar and emmenthal, had its success mantra in its sauce — both spicy and hot.

Then the Cottage cheese steak, paneer slab marinated with cajun spice, got me going. A huge burger, after eating four dishes, sipping and repeating cocktails, was certainly a bad idea. However, the very first bite made me go to ‘I need more of this’ from ‘I think I am nearly full’. The grand burger was crunchy from the outside and tender on the inside. It was a great combination of lettuce, sliced tomatoes, onions, cottage cheese and spices. What made it look appealing? — The bite-sized tomato or one may confuse it with a cherry on the top.

For accompaniment, there was subliminal music for a relaxed evening. And also, because I finally found the best burger in town.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/try-this-road-trip-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/try-this-road-trip.html
183,03-1-20,Sip it again,"Whether you are quaffing French champagne, prosecco from Italy, cava from Spain or something domestic and sparkling, you may end up with some left in a bottle. Here are some ideas to use that

From early December to January, the pop of a champagne or sparkling wine cork is a welcome and frequent sound. Fizzy wine is just the most festive of drinks, whether sipped straight up in a flute or mixed into cocktails. And many a New Year’s toast would feel incomplete without a glass of bubbles.

But whether you are quaffing French champagne, prosecco from Italy, cava from Spain or something domestic and sparkly, you may end up with some left in a bottle. Since sparkling wine corks are notoriously tough to jam back into bottles, use a wine stopper as soon as you can to hold on to some effervescence. Tuck those half-full bottles into the fridge. And then… what?

A mimosa (orange juice and sparkling wine) as a post-holiday brunch drink is a lovely little bit of decadence and should be considered. You also could make sparking wine the base of a sangria the next day, maybe with some berries and berry liqueur, plus a touch of some sweetener. Or add it to some pureed and sweetened fruit, like mangoes or peaches, for a Bellini-type cocktail. It might not be as fizzy as it was the day before but if you sealed the bottle in a timely manner, it should be bubbly enough.

But maybe you’re cocktail-ed out. If your sparkling wine was dry (not sweet), then you can use it pretty much as you would any other leftover white wine in cooking. And if the bubbles are gone, no worries — the fizziness would be lost in the cooking process anyway.

Sweeter Champagne should be saved for drinks and dishes that have sweetness already in them. Zabaglione, an airy sweet pudding, is a dessert traditionally made with champagne, so you might head in that direction. Note that in cooking, most of the alcohol burns out but if you are adding wine to an uncooked dish, make sure there is no one with an alcohol sensitivity consuming it.

Other ideas:

MAKE A PAN SAUCE

Use leftover sparkling wine to deglase a pan, pouring it in after you’ve sautéed your onions, garlic or other aromatics to loosen the brown bits from the bottom of the pan and beginning to build a pan sauce, with broth or some other liquid added after the wine cooks and reduces a bit.

You can also add cream, a lovely partner to sparkling wine or champagne. Or add minced fresh herbs and other seasonings like mustard, olive tapenade or hot sauce. Drizzle the sauce over sautéed chicken, pork, fish or seafood.

CREPES

Replace half the milk in your favourite crepe recipe with champagne. You can use dry or sweet sparkling wine, depending on what type of crepe you are making. Dessert crepes can be made with sweeter bubbly.

FONDUE

Use it instead of white wine in your favourite fondue or Welsh Rabbit recipe. A bit of white wine is traditional in these European melted-cheese dishes.

STEAMING SHELLFISH

Simmer some garlic and herbs and whatever other seasonings you like (tomatoes, fennel, saffron, etc) in champagne, perhaps combined with a bit of broth or water and then steam clams or mussels until they open. These can be eaten right from the shells or used to make a seafood soup or stew or pasta with mussels or clam sauce. The broth from steaming the shellfish should be strained and used in any recipe as well.

RISOTTO

When you start your risotto (any version), after you’ve sautéed the rice in oil or butter, start adding liquid by pouring in half cup of sparkling wine. This will absorb quickly into the grains and give the finished dish another level of flavour. Then switch to broth, adding it slowly until the rice is plump and al dente, stirring frequently. Also use sparkling wine to start off farrotto, a modern take on risotto using farro.

VINAIGRETTE

A splash of wine can enhance the taste of a homemade vinaigrette, to dress a green salad, vegetable salad (such as a green bean salad), grain salad or even better, a French-style mayo-free potato salad. If your champagne is more than a week old and has taken on a vinegary taste, you can still use it this way.

BRAISES

If it’s not sweet, think about adding a few glugs of leftover bubbly to dishes like braised chicken with mushrooms or pork chops with apples. Or use it in braised vegetable dishes, like braised cippolini or pearl onions or braised cabbage and radicchio.

STEWS

Champagne would be great in a chicken or fish stew, especially one with Mediterranean flavours. And even though many meat stews call for red wine, if it’s a small amount you can usually sub in a dry white or sparkling wine. Use it in a lamb stew with orange and fennel, or a pork or beef stew with root vegetables.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sip-it-again-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/sip-it-again.html

185,03-1-20,Magic Mikel,"Arteta earns first win as Gunners sink Red Devils; Spurs, Chelsea stumble

Arsenal rang in the new year by giving boss Mikel Arteta his first victory as lacklustre Manchester United crashed to a 2-0 defeat, while Tottenham and Chelsea also slipped up in the Premier League’s top four race on Wednesday.

Arteta had watched Arsenal take only one point from his first two matches, with last weekend’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea especially painful after the Blues scored twice in the final minutes.

But Arsenal had played well for long periods in that London derby and they produced an even more sparkling display to put United to the sword at the Emirates Stadium.

The Gunners took the lead in the eighth minute when Sead Kolasinac’s cross ran through to Nicolas Pepe at the far post and the Ivory Coast winger beat David De Gea from close-range.

Arsenal, who last won in the league at West Ham on December 9, got a deserved second goal in the 43rd minute when De Gea kept out Alexandre Lacazette’s flick and Sokratis reacted quickest to lash home.

Arteta’s team are nine points adrift of the top four, but their second win in 16 matches in all competitions offers hope of a brighter future under the former Arsenal midfielder’s management.

“It feels great, incredible. I’m so happy and proud of the players,” Arteta said.

“Physically the level dropped in the second half but the commitment and desire was terrific.

“The performances are getting better so I was desperate for the win and we got it.”

United are fifth, five points behind fourth placed Chelsea, after the latest in a long list of underwhelming performances in a troubled campaign.

“We started decent the first five or six minutes, didn’t capitalise, and then they played really well,” United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said.

“We were too slow in the first half, but that’s credit to them. Some tired heads maybe.”

Chelsea remain in pole position to secure the fourth Champions League qualification place but manager Frank Lampard will rue conceding a spectacular late equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Brighton.

Cesar Azpilicueta gave Chelsea the lead, tapping in from close-range in the 10th minute.

But Brighton scored the goal their persistence deserved in the 84th minute when Iranian substitute Alireza Jahanbakhsh acrobatically found the bottom-left corner with an overhead kick.

Those dropped points gave Jose Mourinho’s Spurs the chance to crank up the pressure on Chelsea and United, but they slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Southampton and England captain Harry Kane limped off with a hamstring injury.

Tottenham fell behind to a 17th-minute Danny Ings goal and Kane injured himself as he converted Christian Eriksen’s free-kick in the second half but was flagged offside.

Mourinho’s frustration boiled over as he was shown a yellow card after an altercation with the Southampton bench.

“I was rude,” Mourinho said. “I clearly deserved the yellow card. I had bad words.”

Elsewhere at the top of the table, second-placed Leicester cruised to a 3-0 win at Newcastle and Manchester City beat Everton 2-1 to hand Carlo Ancelotti his first defeat since taking over as manager.

Leicester appear to have put a mini-slump behind them, courtesy of goals from Ayoze Perez, James Maddison and Hamza Choudhury to move to within 10 points of leaders Liverpool.

City remain in third after their home win against Everton, a single point behind Leicester.

Gabriel Jesus scored twice in the second half at the Etihad before Richarlison pulled a goal back for Everton but City held on despite some nervy moments.

“This period is so tough. When you are far away from the first position sometimes people give up, but we never give up,” City boss Pep Guardiola said.

Struggling West Ham made a flying start under Moyes, returning to the London Stadium for a second stint as manager, hammering hapless Bournemouth 4-0 and lifting themselves out of the relegation zone, with the visitors now in the bottom three.

Watford continued their impressive run under new manager Nigel Pearson, holding on to beat seventh-placed Wolves 2-1.

Villa beat Burnley 2-1 with first-half goals from Wesley and Jack Grealish while Norwich drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/magic-mikel.html

Sindhu claimed India’s first ever World Championships Gold in 2019 but she made early exits from a series of tournaments the rest of the season, including her failure to defend the World Tour Finals title last month.

“World Championship was really good for me but after that I kept losing in the first rounds but I kept myself positive. It is not possible that you will win all matches. Sometimes you may play brilliantly, sometimes you will make mistakes,” Sindhu said.

“I learnt a lot from those mistakes. It is important for me to stay positive, and come back stronger,” she added.

Sindhu said she is working on her technique to iron out the flaws.

“There will definitely be a lot of expectations from me but pressure and criticism doesn’t affect me because people always expect me to win whenever I go. Olympics is the ultimate aim, for anybody. “We are doing a lot of work on technique and skill workouts and everything will be planned and it will go well in the Olympic season,” Sindhu exuded confidence while talking about the Tokyo Games.

The 24-year-old from Hyderabad, who claimed a Silver at the Rio Olympics, will have the opportunity to emulate wrestler Sushil Kumar in becoming the second Indian to secure two Olympic medals when she turns up at the Tokyo Games.

“He (Sushil) has done really well for the country and I hope and wish that I also do well and get a medal in Tokyo. It never crossed my mind where I think about others. It is step by step for me. So, I think I need to train hard and give my best,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sindhu-working-on-technique-to-win-olympic-medal.html
187,03-1-20,"Djoker, Nadal lead calls for ATP, Davis Cup to merge","Superstars Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal on Thursday said that there was little point in having two men’s team tennis competitions so close together and suggested the new ATP Cup should merge with the Davis Cup.

The ATP Cup is about to kick off its inaugural edition, replacing a number of previous Australian Open warm-up tournaments.

It comes six weeks after the revamped Davis Cup, which also has countries playing each other in a round-robin format, was held in Madrid.

Canadian Denis Shapovalov suggested Thursday that the two events — one run by the men’s tour, the Association of Tennis Professionals, and the other by the International Tennis Federation — should combine.

“It’s a really similar event and it’s literally back-to-back from the other one, so it’s a little bit of a weird sensation coming from what felt like the world championships coming to play another world championship,” Shapovalov said.

“So for me I don’t see why they, the ATP and ITF can’t combine, can’t join, can’t come to some agreement and make just one, really unique and special tournament for everyone.”

When asked about the Canadian’s comments, Djokovic, who heads the ATP players’ council, agreed.

“We need to have one Super World Cup event, whatever you want to call it,” he said.

“That’s not going to happen next year as well. But if the two sides, the ITF, the Davis Cup, and the ATP get together very quickly, it can happen possibly for 2022.

“I hope it will happen because it's kind of hard to get top players to commit to play both events, the Davis Cup and the ATP Cup.

“And it’s six weeks apart, so they’re not really helping each other in terms of marketing, in terms of the value of the event.”

Djokovic’s concerns were shared by world number one Nadal, who also questioned the timing of the events.

“Yeah, is confusing to have two World Cups of tennis in one month. For me personally that’s not the ideal situation for our sport, but that’s how it works today,” he said in Perth.

Asked if the two should be combined into one world championship, he replied: “I think that tennis deserves something like this.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/djoker--nadal-lead-calls-for-atp--davis-cup-to-merge.html
188,03-1-20,ISIS claims deadly attack on police in Russian Caucasus,"Two men who attacked a police post this week killing at least one officer in the Russian Caucasus were fighters from the Islamic State jihadist group, the ISIS propaganda agency Amaq said.

The perpetrators rammed a car into a traffic police post outside the city of Magas in Ingushetia region around 5.30 pm on Tuesday, after which they attacked policemen with knives, according to the regional Government.

The Amaq statement on Telegram posted late Wednesday said the men were “two fighters from Islamic state” who killed two officers and injured others.

The Ingushetia regional Government and regional investigators said one officer died from injuries.

There has been no official confirmation of a second police death.

The attackers were Akhmed Imagozhev, a well-known arm wrestler, and Mikail Miziev, both residents of Ingushetia and Russian citizens.

Miziev was shot dead by police while Imagozhev is in hospital, Ingushetia’s Government said.

The governor on Tuesday evening lambasted regional police, saying incompetence on New Year’s Eve — a huge Russian holiday — led to the incident, while negligence resulted in the death as the officer was not wearing protective armour.

Ordering a boost in security measures, he said one of the attackers worked as a guard in the local culture centre.

Investigators launched a probe into an attempt on the life of police officers, making no mention of terrorism as a motive.

North Caucasus has been a hotbed of Islamic extremism after the breakup of the Soviet Union followed by two separatist wars in Chechnya, a region bordering Ingushetia.

Many radical Islamists went to Iraq and Syria in recent years to join IS and other jihadist groups.

189,03-1-20,Pakistan Govt seeks stay on SC’s ruling on Army chief’s extension,"Pakistan Government on Thursday sought a stay order from the Supreme Court against its landmark verdict in the extension of service case involving Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had extended 59-year-old Gen Bajwa’s tenure through a notification on August 19. However, the Supreme Court suspended the Government order, citing irregularities in the manner the army chief, a close confidant of Khan, was granted an extension.

The Government in its plea requested the apex court “to accept the application and suspend/stay the operation of the impugned judgment dated November 28, 2019, in the interest of justice”.

This is the second petition filed by the government in this high-profile case.

On December 26, the law ministry had approached the top court against its detailed judgement, issued on December 16, in which the Government was ordered to legislate on Bajwa’s extension within six months.

The Government urged the apex court to form a larger bench to hear the case and set aside the earlier judgment.

On November 28, Bajwa got a six-month conditional extension from the apex court, ending an unprecedented legal wrangle that shook the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and pitted the powerful military against the judiciary.

The petition filed on Thursday prayed to the court that the “petitioners have a strong prima facie case to succeed; hence the operation of the impugned judgement may be suspended/stayed till the final decision of this civil review petition.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pakistan-govt-seeks-stay-on-sc---s-ruling-on-army-chief---s-extension.html
190,03-1-20,Floods in Indonesia capital recede as death toll reaches 30,"Residents of Indonesia’s capital who had been forced into shelters by widespread flooding began returning to their homes Thursday as the waters started to recede, though the death toll from the disaster jumped to 30.

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 182 neighbourhoods in greater Jakarta starting Wednesday and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on the city’s outskirts.

Jakarta Governor Anies Bawesdan said much of the water had receded by Thursday evening and the number of displaced people at temporary shelters had fallen to about 5,000 from 19,000.

Officials had earlier said 35,000 people were in shelters across the greater metropolitan area.

Those returning to their homes found streets covered in mud and debris. Cars that had been parked in driveways were swept away, landing upside down in parks or piled up in narrow alleys. Sidewalks were strewn with sandals, pots and pans and old photographs.

Authorities took advantage of the receding waters to clear away mud and remove piles of wet garbage from the streets. Electricity was restored to tens of thousands of residences and businesses.

At their peak, the floods had inundated thousands of homes and buildings, forced authorities to cut off electricity and water and paralysed transport networks, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said. Floodwaters reached as high as 2.5 metres (more than 8 feet) in places.

Wibowo said the number of people killed in the disaster had climbed to 30.

It was the worst flooding since 2013, when 47 people were killed after Jakarta was inundated by monsoon rains.

Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport reopened Thursday after operations were suspended when flood water submerged its runway, said Muhammad Awaluddin, the president director of PT Angkasa Pura II, the airport’s operator.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/floods-in-indonesia-capital-recede-as-death-toll-reaches-30.html

Clinton, who received an honorary doctorate from Queen’s in October 2018, will become the University’s 11th Chancellor and will serve in the post for a period of five years with effect from January 1, 2020, the university said in a statement.

193,03-1-20,Why do Resolutions fail?,"Vinit Bansode suggests how graphology and practising small writing sessions everyday can help in maintaining new pledges

It’s that time of the year again when you take stock of your life, reflect on your shortcomings and pledge to start afresh. While there could be some most genuine resolutions made on the new year, these also turn out to be the most “broken” ones. From taking a pledge to adopt a healthier lifestyle to giving more of ourselves to our near and dear ones, our resolutions are like milestones set by our conscience so as to follow a path that will be good for us. Psychologists estimate that approximately 50 per cent of the population makes resolutions each year, which are primarily focussed on weight loss, exercising, quitting smoking and being able to manage money better. Alas, a few months into the new year, most of these are broken, due to several reasons, bringing us back to where we started from. And the struggle begins again.

Reason for failure

Resolutions are an effort to renew oneself. People look at resolutions as a way of motivating themselves and making their lifestyles a little better. However, having said that, people are never ready to change their habits, particularly the bad ones, and that accounts for the high failure rate. Making resolutions work involves changing behaviour and in order to do that, you have to change your thinking. When goals are set, we have to make them specific and timebound. But it turns out that those characteristics are precisely the reasons goals can fail. A specific timebound goal drives behaviour that is narrowly focussed and often leads to either cheating or myopia. Yes, we often reach the goal, but at what cost?

How can graphology help

Changing the way you write can change your approach towards life. Graphology is a proven science that can express the current thought pattern of a person by the way they present their writings. To the untrained eye, some notes scribbled on a piece of paper may seem to be innocuous and only the content of the note may be of any significance. But a recent study from the University of Haifa, Israel shows that your handwriting actually says more about you than you think. You may notice that when you are sad or tired, your handwriting may be just a scrawl. And then on the days when you are chirpy, you display bubbly, curvaceous, and uplifting strokes. Though the basic steadiness of your natural writing remains the same, the mood of your writing undergoes differences which only a keen observer may notice. Researchers have already developed a computerised system that measures and analyses even the smallest detail of an individual’s handwriting such as the amount of pressure applied while writing or even the space between the letters/words.

Many people ask whether a person can change their personality with a mere change in their handwriting. Is it that simple? The answer is yes. It can be done through the science of graphology, which is different as compared to other sciences, and the deeper you study it, many new and hidden aspects of disposition of a person will be revealed to you. Handwriting of a person reveals the pattern of thinking and the psychological state of a person. It is, in fact, a direct reflection of a person’s thoughts. Graphotherapy helps understand these patterns and bring a change in the handwriting which can help you make the desirable changes in your lives. Then over a period of regular practice of 30-40 days, these adaptations start reflecting in your behaviour as well.

It’s not the written content but only the handwriting that needs to be read. The way to change is not merely to compel oneself to follow the resolution. Instead, a small graphology exercise on focus can help bring about the change. Every morning, as soon as you wake up, make a habit of practising to write a little — something, anything — putting a heavy pressure on the paper. This needs to be done first thing in the morning before getting involved in other chores like reading the newspaper or responding to notifications on your smartphone. Make a to-do list or some diary entry of the previous night, this will tremendously help improve your focus. You will be able to put a lot of thought in every action and increase your concentration level. The check list that you made in that morning hour will instantly grab your focus and your day will be more dedicated towards doing it.

This is what graphology does. It detects and sets an alarm prior to your setting of the resolution. Here are some ways to understand it better:

- Check if your handwriting is larger than usual. In that case, your “characters” do not support your consideration to resolutions.

- People with many friends often display a need to be loved and appreciated, which is reflected in their handwriting. Such people hate to be tied down to resolutions that require monotonous repetition because they cannot stay focussed.

- People who have a large handwriting do not worry about small things. They are quick to leave behind unpleasant experiences and get on with life. This would explain giving little importance to a small but significant change in life that was their resolution but then they simply don’t find it meaningful enough to hold on.

Apart from the purpose of increasing focus, graphology has also proven effective in parenting techniques, for purposes of effective HR policies, hiring, and team-building as well as for entrepreneurs who can hone their leadership skills by modifying their signature.

Resolutions can be made with the beginning of every year but this graphology practice done for a certain tenure, daily, can improve the thought pattern and hence, the quality of everyday life. One good habit is better than a verbal resolution. Do think about it and implement it.

Actor Sunny Leone feels she lives in a bubble and says that she would like to believe that the whole dialogue around women empowerment and the #MeToo movement has changed people’s mindset.

Sunny said, “I don’t work in an office. I live in a bubble but I do think and believe that the more women talk about the issues of sexual harassment or instances of people making them feel uncomfortable at work, whether it is a man or a woman... yes, it does happen to men as well. It is just not recognised because ‘he is guy what is the big deal.’ The more that they speak up, the more they put it out that it is not ‘okay.’ I think, yes, things will change.”

‘I have definitely evolved as an actor over time. I had no training in filmmaking. Whatever I have learned is on the job. My acting process is very organic and spontaneous but it does require homework. There’s no fixed formula. One should be able to understand his or her craft better and figure out what’s working and what’s not. I am critical of my performances and always analyse them. These things keep me growing.’ —

“When it comes to family holidays, we often go on a safari since my son loves the wilderness. He loves to watch tigers and lions in the forest. When it comes to destinations, I love Kashmir. I would love to go there with my family and hope we are able to do that soon,” said she.

195,03-1-20,‘Big Three’ will be toppled at Slams: Thiem,"World number four Dominic Thiem expressed confidence a new Grand Slam champion will be crowned in 2020 outside the big three of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

While the Austrian, Germany’s Alexander Zverev, Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas and others have had success at lesser tournaments, the big guns continue to dominate the majors.

Thiem, in Sydney for the inaugural ATP Cup team event, is one of the men tipped to make the breakthrough, with the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open, just weeks away in Melbourne.

He said the younger players were getting close.

“I think we challenged them already a lot. We also beat them especially on Masters 1000 stages and the ATP Finals,” said Thiem, who was runner-up to Tsitsipas at the ATP Finals in London in November.

“I think the last stage we have to conquer is the Grand Slam stage, and I really think we’ll see a new Grand Slam champion in 2020.

“I really hope that it’s me, but you cannot guarantee anything. There are also many other very strong guys who can achieve that.

“Maybe it’s also not happening and Big Three are taking all four,” he added. “But we are trying everything to achieve top position, to achieve the biggest titles, Grand Slam titles.”

Thiem, 26, won five titles last year at Indian Wells, Barcelona, Kitzbuhel, Beijing and Vienna, but he had a mixed time at the majors, falling at the first hurdle at Wimbledon and the US Open and in the second round in Australia.

Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had to be detained for ""some time"" after they made provocative statements, the home minister said on Thursday night while addressing an event organised by media outlet ABP News.

""Please see the statements made by them, like the entire country will be on fire if Article 370 was touched...In the backdrop of these statements, a professional decision was taken to keep them under detention for sometime,"" Shah said at the news summit.

Such statements amounted to giving Pakistan an invitation to discuss Article 370, he said.

""Everyone including the Congress, is asking questions about the detentions. Surprisingly, Congress has forgotten that it had jailed Farooq Abdullah's Sheikh Abdullah for 12 years in Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu,"" the home minister said, adding that the opposition party had also incarcerated 60,000 politicians across the country for 19 months.

""And these people (the Congress) are asking us questions within six months...,"" he said, in a reference to the Emergency from 1975-1977.

Many political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, including the three former chief ministers, were detained on August 5, the day the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the state into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

While Farooq Abdullah has been booked under the stringent Public Safety Act and confined to his Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar, which has been declared a sub-jail, his son Omar Abdullah has been detained at Hari Niwas. PDP chief Mufti was lodged at Chesmashahi hut initially but later shifted to a government accommodation.

To a question pointing out that Abdullahs' National Conference and Mufti's PDP were alliance partners of the BJP at some point of time and the leaders were now being labelled ""anti-national"", the home minister made it clear that neither he nor anyone from the government had called them so.

""As far as the decision to release them is concerned, this decision will be taken by the local administration and not me,"" he said, adding that the administration will release them whenever it deems it suitable.

Noting that new India wants technology and logical temperament, so that we can give a new direction for the progress of our social and economic life, Modi said with the production of cheap smart phone and cheap data in the country even a common man is confident that they are not separate and can directly connect with the government.

Observing that science and technology was being used in governance in a large scale, than ever in past, the Prime Minister said, ""We are continuing our efforts to ensure 'Ease of doing Science,' and effectively using Information Technology to reduce red tape.""

He also mentioned that the digital technology, e- commerce, internet banking and mobile banking services are assisting rural population significantly, and farmers are getting required weather information at their finger tips through e- governance initiatives.

The coming decade will be a decisive time for the science and technology based governance, Modi said.

Recalling his government's decision to get rid of single use plastic, Modi said, researchers have to find a cheap and efficient alternative to it in their labs.

He said the government's efforts were to reduce import of crude oil by 10 per cent by 2022, as it would provide opportunity for startups to explore in the field of ethanol and bio-fuel.

Reviewing the year gone by, Manpreet said 2019 has been productive for the team in terms of its performances despite not getting enough opportunities to compete in high-level international tournaments.

“Looking back, 2019 has been very good for us. We started the year in the fifth spot and managed to maintain that. The biggest aim for us in 2019 was to qualify for the Olympics and we have managed to achieve that under a new coach,” Manpreet said.

“Our main target in 2019 is to reach the finals of the Olympics and believe me it’s achievable. Throughout the year we have managed to maintain the No 5 position in world rankings and there is no reason why we can’t climb from that.

“But for that, we have to maintain the consistency which we have showed in the entire 2019,” he added.

204,03-1-20,Clash of the titans,"Focus on Shaw, Rahane as Mumbai take on Karnataka in Ranji clash

Focus will be firmly on Test specialist Ajinkya Rahane and young prodigy Prithvi Shaw when Mumbai take on Karnataka in their Ranji Trophy Elite Group B game, beginning here today.

Both Rahane and Shaw failed with the bat in the last Ranji game versus Railways which the domestic giants lost by 10 wickets inside two and half days.

It will be a good opportunity for the two players to get some runs under their belt. This will be the last Ranji match for Shaw, who departs for New Zealand with the India A team on January 10.

The pint-sized opener got starts but was not able to convert in the last game, following his double hundred in the lung-opener against Baroda.

Shaw will have to counter Karnataka’s attack in slightly windy conditions at the Bandra-Kurla Complex ground.

For Rahane, who has played 63 Tests, the Karnataka game provides perfect platform to find form before he also departs for New Zealand.

Also, Mumbai needs to improve in all departments after the embarrassing loss against the Railways at home.

The 41-time Ranji champions will miss the services of India players Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube and pacer Shardul Thakur, who will be on national duty.

In their absence, it will be a chance for the likes of skipper Suryakumar Yadav, crisis man Siddhesh Lad and experienced Aditya Tare to make a mark. Also, if another player Sarfaraz Khan, who has been named in the squad, makes the playing XI, then it will be an opportunity for him to make it count. Yadav also heads for New Zealand with the India A team on January 10. The bowlers will be led by Tushar Deshpande.

Meanwhile, Karnataka would not have the services of India opener Mayank Agarwal but have the likes of skipper Karun Nair, opener Devdutt Padikkal to do the job. Their pace bowling attack, led by prolific Abhimanyu Mithun, will pose a huge challenge to the Mumbai side.

The BCCI has asked Mayank to rest in view of the upcoming season and hence he would not be playing the game, said sources in the Karnataka team.

Punjab host Delhi

Mohali: Sans India opener Shikhar Dhawan and speedster Ishant Sharma, a depleted Delhi will have to improve their game significantly to present a tough challenge against table leaders Punjab.

Delhi, whose batting has proved to be their weakest link so far this season, will find it tougher in the absence of Dhawan, who will miss the game as he will be on national duty.

The southpaw had made a match-winning 140 in testing conditions against Hyderabad in the previous game at Feroz Shah Kotla grounds.

Kunal Chandela, who failed in the last two games after scoring a hundred against Kerala in the tournament-opener, is likely to open with Anuj Rawat in Dhawan’s absence. Since it is an away game, Delhi’s lead pacer Ishant is also be unavailable as he play only home matches as part of his workload management. Expectations are high from 21-year-old Simrajeet Singh, who impressed in the last two games against Hyderabad and Andhra, taking 12 wickets.

Medium pacer Subodh Bhati may get a chance to play his first game of the season in Ishant’s absence.

The Dhruv Shorey-led side has its task cut out against hosts Punjab, who are the team to beat with two bonus points victories and a draw.

Young India batsman Shubman Gill was back among the runs with a 100 in the last game against defending champions Vidarbha.

He would be aiming for more runs before he leaves for New Zealand with the A team. Captain Mandeep Singh has been leading from the front with 385 runs in three games, including a double hundred.

Gurkeerat Singh too is in fine form, having scored 149 against Vidarbha.

Leg-spinner Mayank Markande has been the pick of Punjab’s bowlers with 11 wickets at an average of 18.45.

Bengal take on Gujarat

Kolkata: With weather threatening to rob the opening day’s play, Bengal find themselves in a familiar tight spot against an in-form Gujarat in a home Elite fixture.

In their previous match, Bengal had taken a firm footing against Andhra but rain and bad light resulted in a truncated match and eventually the hosts had to settle for three points on basis of first innings lead.

Outside top-five in the elite cross pool, Bengal will have to keep a close eye on the skies with rain forecast today. But the Arun Lal-mentored side will be desperate for full points against a team, who are on a roll with successive wins over Hyderabad away and Kerala at home.

In Ashok Dinda’s absence, who is out of the team on disciplinary grounds, 21-year-old Ishan Porel relished the challenge of being the leader of Bengal’s pace attack.

In the batting department, Abhishek Raman, with two consecutive centuries, will be the one to watch out for, while skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran will also be desperate to return among runs before leaving for New Zealand tour.

Bengal will miss both Easwaran and Porel in the later stages of the premier domestic tournament as both are part of New Zealand-bound India A squad.

Bengal also might be tempted to hand a maiden Ranji cap to 24-year-old Ritwik Roy Chowdhury in place of a struggling Sudip Chatterjee.

The Parthiv Patel-led Gujarat also boast of talented opener Priyank Panchal, who scored a match-winning 90 against Hyderabad, while the experienced duo of Piyush Chawla and Axar Patel will lead the spin attack.

The visitors will also look up to some insights from coach Sairaj Bahutule, who was in charge of the Bengal side before Lal took over.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/clash-of-the-titans-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/clash-of-the-titans.html
205,03-1-20,Chile's Niemann grabs Tournament of Champions lead,"Chile's Joaquin Niemann, riding the confidence-boost of a Presidents Cup appearance, fired seven birdies in a seven-under par 66 on Thursday to take a one-shot first-round lead in the US PGA Tour Tournament of Champions.

Niemann didn't win a match in the International team's Presidents Cup loss to the United States at Royal Melbourne last month, but the 21-year-old said the week was a valuable learning experience.

""I think the Presidents Cup was huge for me, for my career, for my future,"" Niemann said.

""I think during that week I learned a lot, I was with the best players in the world, I was teammates with Adam Scott. I talked a lot with them. It was an unbelievable week."" Niemann, whose six-shot win at The Greenbrier in September secured his spot in the winner's only Tournament of Champions, showed plenty of confidence on the par-73 Plantation course at Kapalua, Hawaii.

He rolled in a 31-foot birdie putt for his first birdie of the day at the fourth, and his remaining six birdies were all from within 11 feet.

He missed just one green in regulation, and got up and down for par to head into the second round with a one-shot lead over world number four Justin Thomas.

Thomas also played without a bogey, grabbing five of his six birdies on the back nine to take sole possession of second place on 67.

Americans Matt Kuchar and Rickie Fowler shared third on 68, with defending champion Xander Schauffele heading a group of five players on 69.

Only nine players in the 34-man field were over par in Thursday's light breezes -- which were expected to be replaced by gusty winds on Friday.

Despite the relatively benign conditions, it was an eventful day for two-time tournament winner Dustin Johnson.

The former world number one's one-under par 72 included five birdies and an eagle along with a double-bogey seven at the par-five ninth and four bogeys.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/chile-s-niemann-grabs-tournament-of-champions-lead-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chile-s-niemann-grabs-tournament-of-champions-lead.html

Chhetri said he will take one game at a time from now on.

""I understand that I don't have many games left to play for my country. There's no point in jumping the gun. Hence, personally I want to take one game at a time,"" Chhetri said in a press release issued by the All India Football Federation (AIFF).

The 35-year-old, who is the second-highest goal-scorer in international football after Cristiano Ronaldo, said he has to work hard to maintain his fitness levels even though national coach Igor Stimac has described him as ""having the body of a 29-year old.""

""As a team, we need to win as many games as possible. The eventual aim is to qualify for AFC Asian Cup China 22023. We need to be consistently qualifying for the Continental Championship and there can be no compromise on that aspect,"" he said.

""The belief in the squad is unmistakable. There's no reason why we can't be in China,"" he added.

India are currently on three points from five matches in the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and are next slated to play Qatar at home on March 26.

""I am so proud that at my club we have 5-6 players playing for the country. It would be great if we can add to that number,"" he said.

""There's so much talent among the young lads. It's important we continue doing what we are doing. Most importantly we can never get stagnant or complacent,"" he added.

""At BFC we have really done well domestically. We want to continue on the trend domestically, and most definitely want to do well in Asia. There's an opportunity knocking at our doors this year too, and we need to grab it.""

Chhetri said he is aiming ""to be a better person than what I was in 2019.""

""Little by little, not by making big promises, I need to be calmer, read more, spend more time with my loved ones, and be more mindful about nature and environment,"" he said.

""There can never be any stop to learn about different cultures by travelling to different places. And whatever comes your way, continue the healthy eating habits,"" he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-have-too-many-india-games-left--will-take-one-match-at-a-time--chhetri-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don-t-have-too-many-india-games-left--will-take-one-match-at-a-time--chhetri.html

208,03-1-20,Iran warns of 'severe revenge' after US kills top general,"Iran warned of ""severe revenge"" and said arch-enemy the United States bore responsiblity for the consequences after killing one of its top commanders, Qasem Soleimani, in a strike Friday outside Baghdad airport.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed the commander of its Quds Force foreign operations arm had been killed by US forces in Baghdad, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denouncing it as a ""dangerous escalation"".

""The Revolutionary Guards announces that the glorious commander of Islam, haj Qasem Soleimani, following a life of servitude, was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning,"" said a Guards statement read out on state television. The channel said the attack was carried out by US helicopters.

""Two vehicles were attacked with missiles by US forces"" and all 10 passengers, including Soleimani, were ""martyred"", Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi, told state television.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of ""severe revenge"" for ""the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with his blood"", and vowed that ""God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped"".

He also declared three days of mourning.

""We are taking the necessary measures to transfer the bodies of these martyrs to the Islamic Republic of Iran which will be done as soon as possible,"" said Masjedi.

State television interrupted its regular programming to detail Soleimani's achievements in the region, recalling the many times he had ""foiled"" US plans.

A black ribbon was displayed on the screen and a photo montage was shown with images of Soleimani smiling and praying.

Soleimani was one of the most popular figures in Iran and seen as a deadly adversary by America and its allies.

President Hassan Rouhani said Iran and the ""free nations of the region"" would take revenge on the US for ""this gruesome crime"".

His death had ""redoubled the determination of the nation of Iran and other free nations"" to stand against the US, Rouhani said.

The Islamic republic's top security body called an emergency meeting over the killing.

The foreign ministry summoned an official from the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran, to ""strongly protest"" the killing, according to ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.

The Guards said they and the ""resistance front"" would ""start a new chapter as of today"".

""Certainly, the fleeting rejoicing of Americans and Zionists will turn into mourning before too long,"" Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif told state television.

""We were saddened to hear the news... But our determination has increased to take revenge on the murderous America and oppressor Zionists and this will certainly happen."" After the interview, Sharif broke down in tears and he and the reporter embraced.

Zarif tweeted that ""the US act of international terrorism, targeting and assassinating General Soleimani... Is extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation"".

""The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,"" he added.

His ministry said the US would pay for the ""atrocity"".

""The malice and stupidity of America's terrorist forces in assassinating General Soleimani, this hero martyr and the leader of combatting terrorism and extremism, will certainly further empower the tree of resistance in the region and the world,"" it said.

Zarif and his top aides held an urgent meeting in the morning to assess the situation, ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi tweeted. A former Guards chief said revenge would be exacted on the United States.

""Soleimani joined his martyr brothers but we will exact terrible vengeance upon America,"" tweeted Mohsen Rezai, who currently heads the Expediency Council, a top state body.

Tehran-based analyst Mohammad Marandi said the US has ""declared war"" against Iran and Iraq, and ""it's best for Westerners to evacuate countries like UAE and Iraq immediately"".

""It is best for all American citizens to leave the region immediately. US occupiers will be forced to leave Iraq,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-supreme-leader-vows--severe-revenge--for-soleimani-killing-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/iran-warns-of--severe-revenge--after-us-kills-top-general.html
209,03-1-20,Pentagon confirms Trump ordered killing of Iran Guards commander,"US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guards commander Qasem Soleimani, who died in Baghdad ""in a decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad,"" the Pentagon said.

""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,"" the Department of Defence said.

Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

The strike, which occurred at Baghdad's international airport on Friday in Iraq, also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force. A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Baghdad airport was hit in a volley of missiles just after midnight Friday, Iraq's military had announced.

Security sources told AFP the bombardment hit a Hashed convoy and killed eight people, including ""important figures."" Soleimani heads the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force and also serves as Iran's pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil.

""At the direction of the President, the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,"" the Pentagon said.

""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,"" it added. The Pentagon said that Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the past months, including on December 27, the day the US contractor was killed. ""General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,"" it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-ordered-killing-of-iran-guards-commander--pentagon-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pentagon-confirms-trump-ordered-killing-of-iran-guards-commander.html
210,03-1-20,"There may be flight disruptions, airspace closure in Pak due to 'clashes' in Kashmir: US warns its airlines","The US aviation regulator has warned America's airlines that there may be airspace closures and flight disruptions in Pakistan, with little or no warning, due to ""clashes"" in the ""Kashmir region"", according to an official document.

The warning is a part of a US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) notice to airmen (NOTAM) on December 30, in which it has also flagged risks involved in operating flights in Pakistan airspace due to ""extremist or militant activity"".

The December 30 NOTAM -- which is applicable to all US-based airlines and pilots -- was issued with a background note that mentioned the February 14, 2019 terrorist attack on Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Pulwama of Jammu and Kashmir.

In response to the Pulwama attack, that had left 40 CRPF personnel dead, the Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted air strikes against Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camps in Balakot on February 26, 2019.

""Pakistan carried out retaliatory air strikes on unidentified targets (on February 27) in Indian-administered Kashmir and subsequently claimed to have shot down two Indian fighter jets entering Pakistani airspace"", the FAA said in the background note dated December 30, 2019.

It also said, ""India and Pakistan employ a variety of advanced air-to-air fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missile systems capable of targeting aircraft up to and beyond overflight altitudes typically used by civil aircraft.""

Although India and Pakistan have no intent to target civil aviation, if military operations were to resume, such operations could present an inadvertent risk to US civil aviation, said the FAA.

""Historically, Pakistan and neighboring air navigation service providers have managed their airspace appropriately to deconflict and protect civil aviation overflight operations in response to clashes in the Kashmir Region,"" it added.

""In addition to the extremist/militant threat to US civil aviation operations in the territory and airspace of Pakistan, there may be flight disruptions and airspace closures implemented due to clashes in the Kashmir Region with little or no warning,"" it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/there-may-be-flight-disruptions--airspace-closure-in-pak-due-to--clashes--in-kashmir--us-warns-its-airlines-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/there-may-be-flight-disruptions--airspace-closure-in-pak-due-to--clashes--in-kashmir--us-warns-its-airlines.html

Dr Mohit Dhawan had filed a complaint against Asthana; former Chandigarh DGP Tajinder Singh Luthra; former DSP Satish Kumar; Inspector Ashwani Attri and an NRI woman before the CBI Director in New Delhi last year.

The doctor also levelled allegations of extortion, harassment and fabrication of documents by police.

The CBI had forwarded the complaint of Dr Dhawan to the Chandigarh Vigilance Department recently.

In 2018, the Chandigarh Police had registered a case of cheating against the doctor on the complaint of US national G D' Souza, who had alleged that Dr Dhawan's dental implant procedure on her was improper.

The dentist had claimed that the case was registered against him under the pressure of the senior CBI officer and the former Chandigarh DGP.

The doctor alleged that he had filed a cheque-bounce case against D'Souza in a court after her cheque for Rs 7 lakh was dishonoured.

""A staff member of the Vigilance office acknowledged that my complaint to the CBI has been forwarded to the Vigilance Department here on December 28,"" the doctor claimed.

In his complaint to the CBI, Dr Dhawan had attached copies of a few e-mails accessed through an RTI, which claim that the NRI woman had contacted Asthana.

212,03-1-20,General Soleimani should have been eliminated many years ago: Trump,"General Qasem Soleimani should have been eliminated many years ago as the powerful commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards killed and wounded thousands of Americans and was plotting to kill many more, US president Donald Trump said on Friday.

Gen Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force and some local Iran-backed militias.

Soleimani, 62, was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran behind the Ayatollah Khamenei. His Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the Ayatollah and he was hailed as a heroic national figure.

""General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...But got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number....

""Of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!,"" Trump tweeted, breaking his silence after he tweeted a picture of the US flag.

Following Soleimani's killing, Trump, on a vacation in Florida, initially tweeted an image of the US flag.

214,03-1-20,Kota deaths grab centre stage,"Centre rushes probe team; Sonia summons Rajasthan Cong incharge; Gehlot sends report to party chief

The Centre on Thursday dispatched a high-level team to probe the death of 100 infants in a Kota hospital in Rajasthan even as Congress president Sonia Gandhi summoned the party’s State incharge to Delhi over the issue and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot sent a detailed report to her.

While Gehlot said the issue is being raked up to divert attention from anti-CAA protests, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BSP supremo Mayawati slammed Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi for their alleged indifference to the tragedy.

The Centre has dispatched a high-level team comprising experts from AIIMS Jodhpur and health economists to Kota. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the Centre was ready to provide any technical help or assistance.

“Let us ensure no child succumbs to preventable causes or due to lack of health system capacity,” Vardhan wrote to Gehlot, who has urged the Union Health Minister to visit the State-run JK Lon hospital in Kota and see for himself the “best facilities” provided there.

Expressing concern, Gehlot said the alarming statistic is in fact an improvement over what the previous Vasundhara Raje-led BJP Government had recorded at the same hospital.

“Government cites figures to say child casualties in JK Lon Hospital in Kota have reduced to 963 this year from 1,260 in 2015 and 1,193 in 2016 when the State was ruled by the BJP. In 2018, 1,005 children lost their lives here,” tweeted Gehlot defending his Government. The hospital in Kota is about 250 kms from the Jaipur.

The State Government in its report admitted that some of the incubators at the hospital used for newborns were not in proper working condition. The committee, led by secretary medical education and senior doctors who visited the hospital on December 27 to investigate the matter, also pointed out that the extreme cold has made it tougher for babies, already fighting for their life, to survive their illnesses.

Sonia discussed the tragedy with Avinash Pandey, who is the chief of the Rajasthan Congress. Talking to media, Pandey said the Congress chief is “upset” and “wanted to know the reason for the deaths”.

Yogi and Mayawati targeted the Congress over infant deaths at a Rajasthan hospital, saying party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi should have gone there to console the children’s mothers instead of “playing politics” in UP. Other BJP leaders have also attacked the Congress-led Government in Rajasthan over 100 deaths in December at the Kota hospital.

Attacking Priyanka and Sonia, the UP Chief Minister said it was extremely sad that despite being women both could not feel the pain of the mothers.

In a series of tweets in Hindi, Yogi said, “The death of 100 innocent children is extremely saddening and heart-wrenching. The death of children is a blot on a civilised society, human values and feelings.”

“It is extremely sad that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, despite being women, are not able to understand the sorrow of the mothers,” he added. He said it would have been better “had Priyanka met and consoled the aggrieved mothers instead of indulging in politics in UP”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kota-deaths-grab-centre-stage-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kota-deaths-grab-centre-stage.html

In an official order, the Union Home Ministry said Ayodhya matters and related court judgments will be handled by three officers, headed by Additional Secretary Gynesh Kumar.

The move follows the November 9 judgment of the Supreme Court which allowed construction of a Ram temple on the disputed site in Ayodha. The apex court also ordered handing over of a 5-acre plot to Uttar Pradesh Sunni Waqf Board and setting up of a trust for construction of the Ram temple. The new wing of the Home Ministry, headed by Kumar, will look after all matters related to the Ayodhya issue. It is learnt that the Uttar Pradesh Government has sent a proposal to the Home Ministry suggesting three plots in Ayodhya, one of which can be given to UP Sunni Waqf Board.

There was a dedicated Ayodha cell in the Home Ministry in the 1990s and early 2000s.

However, it was closed down after the submission of the Liberhan Commission of Inquiry on Ayodha.

Till now, matters related to Ayodhya and court cases related to the Ayodhya dispute were handled by the Internal Security-I division of the Home Ministry, along with matters related to National Integration Council, Sikh militancy, Official Secrets Act, communal riots besides others.

In the same order, the Home Ministry also said the Internal Security-II division has been merged with the Internal Security-I division and henceforth it will be known as Internal Security-I division. Joint Secretary (Women Safety) Punya Salila Srivastava has been given the charge of the merged Internal Security-I division along with her present responsibility in the Home Ministry.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mha-sets-up-addl-secy-led-ayodhya-panel.html
216,03-1-20,DP Tripathi loses battle with cancer,"NCP general secretary DP Tripathi, known for his political acumen and wit, passed away on Thursday here after battling cancer for a prolonged period, his family said. He was 67.

Describing Tripathi as a scholar, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said he was a perfect blend of diligence and intelligence. “A firm voice who took a stand for my party as a spokesperson and general secretary. He has been with us since the establishment of the Nationalist Congress Party and played a very important role at the national level. His demise is a personal loss to me. May his soul rest in peace!” he tweeted.

Party MP Supriya Sule said Tripathi was a guide and mentor. “We will miss his wise counsel and guidance which he had given us from the day the NCP was established,” she said.

“May he rest in peace. My thoughts and prayers are with his family members. Heartfelt condolences,” Sule said.

Known in Delhi’s political circles as an erudite personality, Tripathi began his career as a students’ leader. He was the president of the Jawaharlal Nehru Students Union (JNUSU) from 1975-77 and was even jailed during the Emergency.

Tripathi, who was visually challenged, had also been a lecturer of political science at the Allahabad University.

From becoming a close aide to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to growing close to NCP president Pawar, Tripathi enjoyed warm relations with leaders across party lines.

He was known for his witty one-liners and his proficiency in Hindi and English. When there was a buzz about merging of the NCP with the Congress, Tripathi had said, “We are there to emerge, not merge.”

In the same breath, he said in Hindi, “Hum lay chahate hain, vilay nahi (We want coordination and not merger).”

During his stint as a parliamentarian from 2012-2018, Tripathi’s attendance in the Rajya Sabha was 98 per cent, despite battling cancer during that phase.

When the Opposition tried to rally against the Modi Government over Rafale deal, EVMs and economic slowdown, Tripathi represented the NCP.

He was active until last month when the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP were engaged in hectic parleys over Government formation in Maharashtra.

Tributes poured across party lines condoling his death.

Union External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar recalled how he would discuss world affairs with the senior NCP leader.

“Deeply grieved to learn of the passing away of DP Tripathi. Since 1973, when we joined JNU, have discussed and debated the world with him. Always open-minded and pragmatic. Will miss him very much,” he tweeted.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury recalled Tripathi as a “fellow traveller” and said he will be missed. “Comrade, fellow-student, fellow-traveller and much more. From university and right until his last days we spoke, argued, disagreed, and learnt so much together. You will be missed, my friend. Deepest condolences,” he said in a tweet.

The JD(U), which is in power in Bihar, described the deceased leader as a distinguished parliamentarian, an extraordinary speaker, thinker and writer.

218,03-1-20,Govt won't budge on CAA: Amit Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said the government will not budge an inch on its decision to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act despite the opposition criticism of the law.

Launching an “awareness programme” in support of the amended citizenship law, Shah accused the Congress and other opposition parties of running a misinformation campaign.

He said the amended law does not take away Indian citizenship from anyone but grants citizenship.

Opposition parties have criticised the amendment which allows non-Muslims an easier path to citizenship if they have come to India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution.

Shah accused the Congress of playing vote-bank politics by spreading “misinformation”.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-won-t-budge-on-caa--amit-shah-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/govt-won-t-budge-on-caa--amit-shah.html

In a statement, the External Affairs Ministry said India has consistently advocated restraint and continues to do so and it is vital that the situation does not escalate further.

General Qasem Soleimani, the powerful commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday, the Pentagon announced.

The head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus was killed when the drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday.

The deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force and some local Iran-backed militias were also killed in the strike.

In its statement, the External Affairs Ministry said, ""The increase in tension has alarmed the world. Peace, stability and security in this region is of utmost importance to India.""

221,03-1-20,ED grills Chidambaram for 6 hrs in Air India deal case,"In more troubles for the former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday questioned him for over six hours in its probe into the Air India aircraft deal case, first time since his release from Tihar jail almost a month ago.

A senior ED official told IANS, ""We questioned Chidambaram for over six hours today in the ongoing probe into the Air India deal with Airbus.""

According to financial probe agency officials, Air India had planned to buy over 111 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing during the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2009.

This is the first time the ED has questioned the senior Congress leader in the Air India deal case.

The questioning of Chidambaram came for the first time since his release from the Tihar jail where he spent 106 days in connection with the INX media money laundering case. He was released from Tihar on December 4 last year after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.

The former finance minister is also being investigated by the ED in a separate money-laundering cases of Aircel-Maxis deal.

An ED official said the contract to buy 43 aircraft from Airbus was finalised by a panel of ministers headed by Chidambaram in 2009.

According to the ED, when the proposal to buy 43 aircraft from Airbus was sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), there was a condition that the aircraft manufacturer would have to build training facilities and MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) centres at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore. But later, when the purchase order was placed, the clause was removed.

The name of another UPA minister, Praful Patel, had also come up in the alleged scam in a chargesheet filed by the ED against corporate lobbyist Deepak Talwar on March 30 last year. Talwar was arrested last year by the ED after he was deported from the UAE.

The ED is probing the Air India-Indian Airlines merger; purchase of 111 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus at Rs 70,000 crore; ceding profitable routes and schedules to private airlines, and opening of training institutes with foreign investment.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ed-grills-chidambaram-for-6-hrs-in-air-india-deal-case-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ed-grills-chidambaram-for-6-hrs-in-air-india-deal-case.html
222,03-1-20,Verbal spat between Babul Supriyo and Muslim student,"A verbal spat has erupted between union minister Babul Supriyo and a Muslim college student in which he has threatened on social media to pack off the youth to ""his own country"" for his post seeking to know the BJP MP's ""education level"".

The student, Mustafizur Rahman said on Friday that he wanted nothing but an ""unconditional apology"" in public from the BJP leader.

The union minister returned the fire by accusing Rahman of being a ""serial offender"" and saying that he ""does not need to apologize to fools"".

Supriyo also said that his comments had nothing to do with the student's religion.

The matter came to light on December 26 when Supriyo shared a post on the social media advocating CAA and criticised the act of a female JU student, who tore up the first page of the contentious legislation at the annual convocation of the university while receiving her gold medal on December 24.

The next day Rahman commented on Supriyo's Facebook post and questioned the educational qualifications of Supriyo and BJP state president Dilip Ghosh.

""Babul-da (dada) how educated are people like you can be gauged from the fact that your mentor (state president) Dilip Ghosh spots gold in cow milk,"" Rahman said in his comment on Supriyo's post.

To this Supriyo retored ""Mustafizur Rahaman let me first pack you off to your country, then will send the reply in post card"". The comment triggered a wave of protests.

Rahman, who is a final year student of chemistry at a college at Ilambazar in Birbhum district, in a prompt rejoinder said, ""I am in possession of enough proof about my identity as Indian and Bengali. You don't know how to respect Bengalis and still you are the MP of the state..... Are you drinking cow urine regularly?""

The youth has received the support from a number of netizens and organisations like 'Jatiya Bangla Sammelan' after screenshots of the comments went viral on social media since December 27.

He told PTI, ""I had merely made a comment whether people like Babul Supriyo and Dilip Ghosh have the authority to make adverse comments about the individual decision of a gold medalist to protest against CAA at the annual convocation of an educational institution.""

Referring to the stinging remarks by the union minister against him, Rahman said ""It was an outrageous comment by a minister who has taken the oath to protect the Constitution. He cannot discriminate 130 crore Indians on the basis of caste and religion.

""I was born and brought up here. I only demand an unequivocal public apology from him on social media and through statement - nothing less nothing more,"" he said.

Reacting to the youth's demand for apology, Supriyo claimed that Rahman is a ""serial offender"" on social media.

""He (Rahman) could have told me whatever he wanted to. I had made the comment with a pinch of a salt. Those who are fools won't understand my comment. It has nothing to do with Hindus or Muslims. I don't need to apologize to fools,"" Supriyo said.

""Why did he(Rahman) bring in Dilip Ghosh in the conversation? Whoever makes abusive comment on my Facebook or Twitter page I just block that person. I have blocked Rahman too,"" he said.

Ghosh had courted controversy in November 2019 for saying that Indian cow milk contains traces of gold and that is the reason the colour is yellow. He later sought to justify it by saying it was backed by conclusions of research taking place in foreign countries.

Jatiya Bangla Sammelan, which promotes the cause of the Bengali community, organised a protest rally at Jadavpur area of the city on Thursday in protest against Supriyo's comments and burnt an effigy of the Asansol MP.

""We have undertaken a signature campaign in protest against the venomous comment of Babul Supriyo and will submit a letter with the signatures to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar very soon,"" Siddhabrata Das of the outfit told PTI on Friday.

""We will urge the governor to forward the letter to the Centre to let it know how pained and anguished the people of Bengal are over Babul Supriyo's comments,"" he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/verbal-spat-between-babul-supriyo-and-muslim-student-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/verbal-spat-between-babul-supriyo-and-muslim-student.html

225,03-1-20,"Kejriwal announces Rs 1 cr to victim’s kin, 17 hurt hospitalized","A 20-year-old firefighter died while 17 others were injured after an Okaya battery godown was engulfed in a blaze in northwest Delhi’s Peeragarhi following an explosion due to fire early on Thursday morning.

Firefighter Amit Kumar Balyan, a fire operator with Delhi Fire Services (DFS) posted at Kirti Nagar fire station and a resident of Delhi’s Shahdara area, died after he was trapped in the debris of a portion of a factory building which collapsed in the fire, said police, adding that the incident will be probed by its Crime Branch. Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain visited the spot and ordered a magisterial enquiry.

Police said Amit was admitted to Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute and succumbed to his injuries during the treatment.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal condoled Amit’s death and announced an ex gratia of Rs 1 crore to the family of the firefighter.

According to Atul Garg, Director, DFS, a call regarding a blaze in a factory located at Udyog Nagar in Peeragarhi was received at 4.23 am following which firefighters rushed to the spot.

“While the firemen were dousing the fire, a large portion of the two-storey building collapsed following an explosion. The National Disaster Response Force, CAT and civil authorities rushed to the spot to control the situation and a total of 35 fire tenders were at the spot,” said Garg.

“The fire was brought under control by noon. All the firemen, who were trapped under the debris, were rescued,” said Garg.

Police said eighteen people were rescued, including two caretakers and a security guard. “A total of 14 injured were firefighters. The other injured also included a security guard and two workers of the godown. They all were rushed to nearby hospitals,” said a senior police official.

227,03-1-20,Indonesia flood rescuers hunt for missing after 43 killed,"Indonesian rescuers mounted a desperate search Friday for those missing after flash floods and landslides sparked by torrential rains killed at least 43 people across the Jakarta region while health authorities raced to prevent disease outbreaks.

Around a dozen people were still unaccounted for after record rains that started on New Year's Eve pounded the capital and left swathes of the megalopolis, home to some 30 million, under water and with thousands homeless.

Around 192,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters, according to authorities, with many unable to return to waterlogged homes in neighbourhoods turned into wastelands of debris and overturned cars.

""We're encouraging people whose houses are still inundated to go to a safer place,"" said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

The agency said 43 people had been confirmed dead in Greater Jakarta and neighbouring Lebak regency in the south of Java island.

Waters had receded in many areas and power, which had been shut off across many districts, was being restored.

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the outskirts of the city, swampy streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other -- with waterline marks reaching as high as buildings' second floors.

The government said Friday it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital -- inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes -- to prevent approaching rainfall from pounding the region.

Using inflatable boats to evacuate residents trapped in their homes, including children and seniors, rescuers said they were targeting the hardest-hit areas of the city on Friday.

Shelters filled up with many refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.

""It's impossible for me to go back to my home,"" said 72-year-old Lumongga Siregar.

""We have no clean water right now ... And we're hoping for more food because there isn't much,"" she added.

Mother Dewi Puspitasari worried about her one-year-old daughter's health. ""The blanket and mat I've got here aren't thick enough for her and we're scared she will get sick,"" she told AFP.

Indonesia's health ministry said it deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.

In hard-hit Lebak outside Jakarta, residents started the slow process of cleaning up their deluged homes.

""Everything's gone,"" said shop owner Aminah, who goes by one name. ""I couldn't bring anything ... I left it all because I got scared at how high the water was getting.""

Around Jakarta, a family -- including a four and nine-year-old -- died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an eight-year-old boy killed in a landslide and an 82-year-old pensioner were also among the victims. Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line. Most services have been restored although some commuter train lines were still suspended Friday.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November.

But this week's disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

""This year's flooding was phenomenally bad because of the extremely high rainfall,"" said Yayat Supriatna, a Jakarta-based urban planning expert.

But Jakarta's myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, worsened the situation, he added.

""Yes, the weather conditions were terrible, but this was exacerbated by awful urban planning,"" Supriatna said.

""General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,"" the Department of Defence said.

Following Soleimani's death, Trump tweeted an image of the US flag without any further explanation.

The strike, which occurred at Baghdad's international airport on Friday in Iraq, also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force. A pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

The US had called the strikes in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

The Baghdad airport was hit in a volley of missiles just after midnight Friday, Iraq's military had announced.

""Thankful that our allies recognize the continuing aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force,"" he wrote. ""The US remains committed to de-escalation.""

The United States announced earlier that it had killed the commander of the Islamic republic's Quds Force in a strike on Baghdad's international airport.

The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

Pro-Iranian demonstrators laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, angered by US weekend air strikes that killed two dozen fighters from the hardline Kataeb Hezbollah paramilitary group.

The strikes were in response to a rocket attack last week that killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

232,03-1-20,Cold surprise lies in store for Delhi,"While December 2019 witnessed harshest winters in the last few decades and shattered records, the worst is yet to come. According to independent weather monitor agency — Skymet, January will be colder than December due to heavy snowfall in hills and western disturbance which play crucial role for Delhi weather and air quality as well.

However on Thursday, Delhi recorded above normal maximum temperature for the second consecutive day after remaining in the grip of a prolonged cold spell, the longest since 1919.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), city recorded a high of 23 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, and a low of 4.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal.

Beginning of January has brought much needed relief for people due to scattered sunrays in atmosphere. “Due to this, night temperatures have also shown a rising trend, abating the cold wave,” Skymet said.

Skymet said winter is governed by the passage and intensity of western disturbance travelling across Western Himalayas. “This season has seen series of weather systems affecting North India. Frequency of western disturbance was such that it has not let the snow melt. Due to this, snowfall keeps on accumulating, which is what is reflecting in the atmosphere over the plains as well,” it added.

Meanwhile updating weekly weather forecast, the MeT has said the trance of western disturbance would continue in January month.

233,03-1-20,Row over recitation of Faiz’s poem at IIT-K,"IIT-Kanpur has formed a committee to enquire into a complaint against the recitation of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s noted poem “Hum Dekhenge” on campus by students to express solidarity with their peers at Jamia Millia Islamia, the institute’s deputy director Manindra Agarwal said.

A complaint was filed by Dr Vashimant Sharma, a temporary faculty member, and 16 others, including faculty members and students, calling the recitation as anti-Hindu. “The video suggests that the poem also provokes anti-Hindu sentiments,” the complaint stated.

Agarwal said a “very peaceful protest” was held on December 17 by about 300 students of the premier institute on its premises as they were not allowed to go out due to enforcement of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in the city.

However, IIT-Kanpur director Abhay Karandikar has criticised a section of the media for reporting since Wednesday that the institute has set up a committee to decide whether the poem by Faiz is anti-Hindu or not, saying this is “very misleading”.

Top poets and writers, including Javed Akhtar, Rahat Indori and Vishal Bhardwaj, on Thursday described attempts to paint Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s revolutionary “Hum Dekhenge” as anti-Hindu and pro-Islam, a “ridiculous” and “narrow-minded” attempt. Faculty members and some students filed a complaint against a student for reciting the poem, which they claimed provoked “anti-Hindu” sentiments.

“This poem was written against a fundamentalist called Zia-ul-Haq, a dictator. It is interesting that fundamentalists don’t like this poem,” Akhtar told India Today TV.

Explaining the context of the poem, which was written in 1979 to criticise the dictatorship and fundamentalism of former Pakistani general-turned president Zia-ul-Haq, the veteran poet-screenwriter said if Faiz’s poem is anti-Hindu, then one would have to believe that Zia was secular, which does not make sense.

“A committee of six members was established, headed by me, to investigate the matter. Some students have been questioned, while the others will be questioned after they return to the institution after the holidays,"" the deputy director said.

There was a war of words on social media between those supporting the recitation of the poem and those who opposed it, he said.

“It was contributing to escalation of the situation and hence we requested both sides to stop it and they obliged,” Agarwal said.

The video also shows students carrying placards with slogans like ‘Tumhari laathi aur goli se tez hamari awaaz hai’ (our voice is louder than your sticks and bullets) and “IIT-Kanpur condemns police brutality on Jamia and AMU students. Shame on Delhi Police”, an official said.

“We would take some more days to hear both sides before coming up with the findings as some students were left to question and it could only be possible after their return to the institution after holidays,” Agarwal said, adding, “Once everything cools down, we will be able to sort out the matter amicably.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/row-over-recitation-of-faiz---s-poem-at-iit-k.html
234,03-1-20,Aus PM Morrison may cancel India visit from January 13 due to major bushfire crisis,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday indicated that he is likely to cancel his first official visit to India scheduled from January 13 amidst the catastrophic bushfire crisis in his country.

Massive fires ripped through swathes of the Australia's south-east on New Year's Eve, killing at least 20 people and stranding holidaymakers as seaside towns were ringed by flames.

Australian authorities on Thursday declared a state of emergency and forced evacuation of residents, tourists and closure of roads in the bushfire zones in the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria ahead of Saturday's forecast of ""horrible"" fire conditions due to the intensified heat wave.

Morrison was due to visit India on January 13-16 following an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

During a press conference in Bairnsdale in Victoria, the prime minister said ""The National Security Committee is going to hook up actually in the morning on this. I'm inclined not to proceed with that visit (to India).""

""There are some issues that I need to resolve formally, through what you would expect when you make a decision of that nature. To work though those issues with the other ministers. But that is my inclination at this point, I'll make a further announcement on that and we will make the arrangements accordingly,"" he said.

Prime Minister Morrison said a further announcement would be made about the decision to cancel his trip to India.

Last month, Morrison had come under fire and was forced to cut short a holiday to Hawaii just before Christmas following the bushfire conditions.

On Thursday, during his visit to the bushfire hit NSW South Coast town of Cobargo, Morrison was also heckled by angry locals.

He later told ABC news channel that he came to Cobargo to ""see it for myself, to offer what comfort I could, but you can't always in every circumstances"".

""I'm not surprised people are feeling very raw at the moment,"" Morrison said adding ""I understand the very strong feelings people have. They've lost everything and there are still some very dangerous days ahead.""

235,03-1-20,Mediterranean diet may help kidney patients post transplant,"Adopting a Mediterranean diet could help preserve kidney functions in patients who have had transplants, suggests a new study.

According to the study, published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, kidney transplant recipients, those with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet were less likely to experience kidney function loss.

A typical Mediterranean diet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate amount of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods.

""Increasing scientific evidence has demonstrated health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet on cardiovascular and kidney health."" said the study's researcher Antonio Gomes-Neto from University of Groningen, Netherlands.

""In this study, we show that kidney transplant recipients with higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet are less likely to experience function loss of their kidney transplant,"" Gomes-Neto said.

According to the researchers, despite improvements in the survival of transplanted kidneys in the early years after transplantation, loss of kidney function within 10 years still occurs in more than one-third of recipients.

For the findings, the research team investigated whether adhering to the Mediterranean diet might help protect transplant recipients' kidney health.

For the study, 632 adult kidney transplant recipients with a functioning donor kidney for at least one year completed a food-related questionnaire, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using a 9-point score.

During an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 119 recipients experienced kidney function decline (76 of whom developed kidney failure), the research said.

The Mediterranean Diet score was inversely associated with kidney function decline and kidney failure.

According to the findings, each 2-point higher score was associated with a 29 per cent lower risk of kidney function decline and a 32 per cent lower risk of kidney failure.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mediterranean-diet-may-help-kidney-patients-post-transplant-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/mediterranean-diet-may-help-kidney-patients-post-transplant.html
236,03-1-20,Top Iran commander Qasem Soleimani killed in US strike on Baghdad,"Top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed Friday in a US strike on Baghdad's international airport, Iran and the US confirmed, in the most dramatic episode yet of escalating tensions between the two countries.

The Pentagon said US President Donald Trump ordered Soleimani's ""killing,"" after a pro-Iran mob this week laid siege to the US embassy.

Declaring three days of mourning across the country, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to take ""severe revenge"" for Soleimani's death.

Trump tweeted out a picture of the US flag without any explanation, as the pre-dawn developments marked the most major escalation yet in a feared proxy war between Iran and the US on Iraqi soil.

Early Friday, a volley of missiles hit Baghdad's international airport, striking a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary force with close ties to Iran.

Just a few hours later, the Revolutionary Guard Corps announced Soleimani ""was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning.""

The Hashed confirmed both Soleimani and its deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in what it said was a ""US strike that targeted their car on the Baghdad International Airport road.""

The Hashed is a network of mostly-Shiite armed units, many of whom have close ties to Tehran but which have been officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.

The units joined forces to fight the Islamic State group in 2014, after many of them built up years of fighting experience during Iraq's war years, including against the US.

Muhandis was the Hashed's deputy chief but widely recognised as the real shot-caller within the group.

Soleimani headed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force and also served as Iran's pointman on Iraq, visiting the country in times of turmoil. Both were sanctioned by the United States.

The Pentagon said Soleimani had been ""actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region."" It said it took ""decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,"" but did not specify how.

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif slammed the US strike as ""extremely dangerous and a foolish escalation."" Top official Mohsen Rezai pledged to ""exact terrible vengeance upon America,"" and Tehran's top security council said it would hold an urgent meeting.

There was no immediate reaction from Iraqi officials on the strike.

""In terms of a decapitation strike, what just happened is the most major decapitation strike that the US has ever pulled off,"" said Phillip Smyth, a US-based specialist in Shiite armed groups.

He told AFP it would have ""bigger"" ramifications than the 2011 US operation that killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the 2019 American raid that killed Islamic State group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""There is no comparison,"" he added.

But others said it remains unclear how Iran could respond to the blow. ""A lot of the focus is on what is the price that the US is gonna pay and how Iran will retaliate against the US,"" said Fanar Haddad of the Singapore University's Middle East Institute.

The developments come after an unprecedented attack on the US mission in Baghdad.

A mob of Hashed supporters surrounded the US embassy on Tuesday in outrage over American air strikes that killed 25 fighters from the network's hardline Kataeb Hezbollah faction, which is backed by Iran.

The US had acted in response to a rocket attack days earlier that had killed an American contractor working in Iraq.

Trump had blamed Iran for a spate of rocket attacks targeting US forces as well as the siege at the embassy, saying: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat."" US lawmakers however were not told in advance of Friday's attack, House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel said in a statement. Ties between the US and Iran have deteriorated since Washington pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

It then reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, aiming to choke off its oil exports. Oil prices soared following Friday's attack, with Brent surging 4.4 percent to $69.16 and WTI jumping 4.3 percent to 63.84.

The attack threatens to destabilise Iraq, which has close political and military ties with both Tehran and Washington.

The United States led the 2003 invasion against then-dictator Saddam Hussein and has worked closely with Iraqi officials since.

But its influence has waned compared with that of Tehran, which has carefully crafted personal ties with Iraqi politicians and armed factions, even during Saddam's reign. Iraqi officials have warned in recent months that their country could be used as an arena for score-settling between Iran and the US.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/top-iran-commander-qasem-soleimani-killed-in-us-strike-on-baghdad-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/top-iran-commander-qasem-soleimani-killed-in-us-strike-on-baghdad.html

239,03-1-20,Taiwan grounds Black Hawks after crash killed top personnel,"Taiwan grounded its fleet of Black Hawk helicopters after a crash killed the island's top military officer and other prominent personnel.

The official Central News Agency said Friday all 52 of the UH-60M aircraft belonging to the air force, army and National Airborne Service Corps have ceased flight operations while they are inspected for any problems with their structural, software, radar and other systems.

The one that crashed Thursday morning in forested mountains outside the capital was a model dedicated to search and rescue and had been delivered in 2018, according to the defense ministry.

The crash killed eight people including former air force Gen. Shen Yi-ming, who had taken over as chief of the general staff in July.

Other victims included both pilots, the deputy head of the Political Warfare Bureau and the deputy chief of the General Staff for Intelligence, while two lieutenant generals and a major general were among the five survivors.

Memorial services were being held for those killed, and all three candidates in Jan. 11's presidential election suspended their campaigns to observe a period of mourning.

The crash, which is under investigation, is not expected to affect the holding of the election but will require an urgent reshuffling of top military staff. Questions have also been raised as to why so many high-ranking officers were aboard a single flight.

Shen, 63, was responsible for overseeing the self-governing island's defense against China, which threatens to use military force if necessary to annex what it considers part of its territory.

240,03-1-20,Would love to do more realistic films with Ranveer: Deepika Padukone on ''83',"Actor Deepika Padukone is set to reunite with frequent co-star and husband Ranveer Singh for sports drama ""'83"" and she says it was a ""refreshing"" change for the couple who have previously collaborated on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's spectacle films.

The 33-year-old star will play Romi Dev, wife to cricketing legend Kapil Dev, to be played by Ranveer.

Directed by Kabir Khan, ""'83"" will chronicle India's win under Kapil's captainship, when the team defeated West Indies in the final to clinch their first-ever World Cup trophy in 1983.

Deepika, in the past, has worked with Ranveer on larger-than-life movies such as ""Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela"", ""Bajirao Mastani"" and ""Padmaavat"".

""It was nice to work with Ranveer in a slightly more realistic setting. Not having to mouth such intense dialogue with that kind of language like we did on three films. It was refreshing. In fact, we had to remind ourselves that 'this is the same actor that I've worked with'.

""The characters are completely different, the era is completely different. The costume, the sets are so, so different and even refreshing. We both looked at each other and said, 'wow, we should do stuff like this more often together',"" she told PTI in a telephonic interview from Mumbai.

The actor revealed she doesn't have many scenes in ""'83"" and she took up the project as the role gave her an opportunity to explore the personal side of public figures like Kapil and Romi Dev.

""The reason I wanted to do this film is because I've seen what an important support system my mother has been in my father's life as an athlete and her contribution to his success. I saw many similarities when it came to Romi and Kapil Dev.

""While ''83' is really the three week journey from the time they left India to the time they won the World Cup, there are smaller moments of their personal side of their personality as well which I thought was very exciting,"" Deepika, daughter of former Indian ace badminton player Prakash Padukone and homemaker Ujjala Padukone, added.

The actor will next start working on a romantic thriller, directed by Shakun Batra. A Dharma Productions project, the movie will also star Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ananya Panday.

""There is going to be another actor. It's basically about two couples and domestic noir is the genre. We start filming in March,"" Deepika added.

She is also set to play the central role of Draupadi in a retelling of the epic story of Mahabharata from the female perspective.

Deepika said, when it comes to Mahabharata, the audience has always been ""fed"" a unidimensional point-of-view.

""There's a lot of excitement within the audience to see this film as it is not a narrative that we're very familiar with...

""I think we've always been fed a certain perspective on Mahabharata and it'd be interesting for us to see a different perspective. Same narrative, different perspective,"" the actor, who will co-produce the film with Madhu Mantena, said.

The actor is looking forward to the release of ""Chhapaak"", which also marks her production debut.

Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has recently claime that Apple may launch four 5G-enabled iPhones next year and while 5G-related components could raise the production costs of the devices, he believes that the iPhone maker will not significantly increase the price of 5G iPhones.

5G components are projected to raise the production cost of the new iPhones by anywhere from $30 to $100.

Kuo states that Apple intends to offset this additional cost by reducing its supply chain expenses, including dropping its upfront non-recurring engineering payment to suppliers of the redesigned metal chassis and frame for 5G iPhone.

Additionally, Apple's plans of introducing its own iPhone 5G chip could take as long as six years.

In order to reduce its reliance on suppliers, the iPhone-maker has been designing a lot of components which would be required to integrate superfast 5G connectivity into phones by itself.

According to a report by The Information, Apple may not have a homegrown 5G modem ready for its iPhones till 2025.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tsmc-to-start-production-of-a14-chip-for-2020-iphones--report-2020-01-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/tsmc-to-start-production-of-a14-chip-for-2020-iphones--report.html
248,03-1-20,"India tops requests on TikTok, China not on list","India sent a total of 118 requests to the Chinese short-video making platform TikTok in the in the first half of 2019 (January 1-June 30, 2019) to take certain actions against those accounts.

The strange part is that there was not a single request from China, TikTok's home country where the app functions as a different name Douyin, which has stricter control.

While there were 107 legal requests, the Indian government asked information for 11 accounts, requesting to take down content deemed to be in violation of local laws, or to provide information related to accounts under certain defined circumstances, TikTok said in its first transparency report, mimicking US tech companies who have the practice of revealing such information.

For 107 legal requests from India, TikTok which has nearly 200 million users in the country acted in 47 per cent cases while for the government requests, it removed eight accounts.

The US was second with 79 requests related to 255 accounts, and received information on 86 per cent of its requests. Third was Japan with 35 requests linked to 39 accounts.

TikTok has seen nearly 1.5 billion downloads globally and the US market with 37.6 million downloads is at the third sport, after India and China.

""In balancing our responsibilities to law enforcement with our respect for the privacy of our users, we respond only to legally valid requests and only with the requisite amount of information needed,"" said Eric Ebenstein, TikTok's public policy chief.

The transparency report follows the US Army and Navy banning the app owned by Beijing-based ByteDance.

ByteDance has reportedly been under scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) after lawmakers demanded an investigation to see whether the Chinese government can collect users' data or control the content that is shared.

TikTok became the first Chinese-owned app to reach first place in the US Apple App Store last November.
