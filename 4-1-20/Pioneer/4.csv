0,04-1-20,Consensus still possible,"The very rationale of establishing the Inter-State Council was to have a wide perspective on resolving frictions. In the present context, we need to remind ourselves of its role

The Inter-State Council, having its roots in Article 263 of the Constitution, was meant for situations just like the present one but appears to have been lost sight of. There are several advantages of having a written Constitution, the foremost being that even for certain unforeseen eventualities, a Constitutional approach can be incorporated in specific terms. As such, it is entirely to the credit of the Constituent Assembly that it could envisage the importance of Centre-State relations, more than 70 years ago, and included Article 263 in our Constitution, without a even a debate.

Titled as “Provisions with respect to an Inter-State Council”, Article 263 states that it would be lawful for the President to establish such a Council, if at any time it appears that public interest will be served. The Council has been charged with the duty of inquiring into and advising upon disputes, which may have arisen between States; investigating and discussing subjects in which some or all of the States or the Union and one or more of the States have a common interest; or making recommendations upon any such subject and, in particular, recommendations for better coordination of policy and action with respect to that subject. There was, however, no opportunity to operationalise the provisions of this Article till almost 40 years after the promulgation of the Constitution.

In the current scenario and in the context of the political developments between the Centre and some States, it would be relevant to recapitulate the envisaged role of the Inter-State Council and the recommendations made by various Constitutional review commissions on its significance. An initial review of various aspects of Centre-State relations was undertaken by the First Administrative Reforms Commission chaired by K Hanumanthaiah (1966-70). The political situation after the 1967 general elections, when for the first time the ruling party at the Centre had to face hostile State Governments, had a definite impact on its recommendations, which among others also included: “The Inter-State or Centre-State differences should be settled by mutual discussions. To the extent possible, these discussions should be held in camera. Only the decisions may be issued in the form of Statements. An Inter-State Council should be constituted under Article 263 of the Constitution; it may consist of: (i) the Prime Minister-Chairman (ii) the Finance Minister (iii) the Home Minister (iv) the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha (when one is not available, a representative should be elected by the Opposition parties by single transferable vote) (v) five representatives, one each from the five Zonal Councils; any of the Union Cabinet Ministers or Chief Ministers, who may be concerned with a particular subject, may be invited for discussion when the relevant subject is under consideration; and the proceedings of this Council must be secret. (i) The Inter-State Council will have the functions indicated in Article 263 of the Constitution. (ii) The inter-State Council may be set up, to begin with, for a period of two years. A decision may be taken on its continuance in the light of experience gained.”

However, despite the deteriorating Centre-State relations in the late 1960s, not much could be achieved as the Council was not established. Later, as the political situation underwent a change after the mid-term poll of 1971 and followed a similar trajectory in the States, these recommendations were practically forgotten.

In the early 1980s, the dynamics of Centre-State relations once again came under stress, leading to a virtual breakdown. The atmosphere of consensus and cooperation was giving way to politics of confrontation. In this strained atmosphere, the Prime Minister constituted a Commission under the chairmanship of Justice (retd) RS Sarkaria, formerly of the Supreme Court. The charter of this Commission was to “review the existing arrangements between the Centre and the States while keeping in view the social and economic developments that had taken place over the years. The review was also to take into account the importance of unity and integrity of the nation for promoting welfare of the people.”

While endorsing the recommendations of the First Administrative Reforms Commission, Justice Sarkaria added that there should be a Standing Committee of the inter-governmental council under Article 263 of the Constitution. While the general body of the Council was to meet at least twice a year, the Standing Committee was stipulated to meet at least four times a year. A permanent secretariat for the Council was also recommended to be established.

The report of the Sarkaria Commission became available sometime in 1987-88 and it was left to the National Front Government of VP Singh to establish the Inter-State Council in 1990. Though from time to time several meetings of the Chief Ministers have been convened at the Centre on various subjects, these possibly cannot be termed as Constitutional meetings under the Article 263.

Later, the Justice Venkatachaliah Commission, while reviewing the working of the Constitution, affirmed the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission and emphasised that “in resolving problems and coordinating policy and action, the Union as well as the States should utilise the forum of Inter-State Council more effectively. This will be in tune with the spirit of cooperative federalism, requiring proper understanding and mutual confidence and resolution of problems of common interest expeditiously.”

Yet another Constitutional review took place in 2007, where Justice MM Punchhi, former Chief Justice of India (CJI), expressed that “federalism is a living faith to manage diversities and it needs to be supported by institutional mechanisms to facilitate co-operation and co-ordination among the units and between the units and the Union. Co-operative federalism is easily endorsed but difficult to practice without adequate means of consultation at all levels of Government.” The Inter-State Council was seen as an extremely useful mechanism for consensus-building and voluntary settlement of disputes, in case given the autonomy required for functioning as a Constitutional body, independent of the Union and the States.

According to our Constitution, the administrative relations between the Centre and the States are to be governed as per the provisions of Articles 256 and 257. The provisions of Article 257 (1) are quite explicit as it is stated that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union, and the executive power of the Union shall extend to the giving of such directions to a State as may appear to the Government of India to be necessary for the purpose. A similar provision exists in Article 256 for implementation by States of the laws framed by the Parliament.

Several States had raised objections to the powers exercisable by the Centre under Articles 256 and 257 on grounds that they not only diluted the autonomy of States but were also not in the interest of a healthy federal arrangement. In this context, the Commission was of the considered view that there was no case for amendment of these provisions. While at the same time, it must be clarified that “favouring the retention of these provisions is entirely different from advocating easy or quick resort to them. Articles 256 and 257 may be viewed as a safety valve, one which may never come into play but which is nevertheless required to be retained.”

On the subject of Centre-State relations, it would be useful to recall the eminent jurist Justice (retd) VR Krishna Iyer, who elaborated, “The purpose is not to weaken the Centre nor to exaggerate the autonomy of the States, nor to usurp powers rightfully lodged elsewhere. India can be strong only if the Union is strong and it can be strong only if the units are equally strong and operate on a common wavelength in matters fundamental to the governance of the country.”

The very rationale of having a Constitutional body like the Inter-State Council has been to have an extremely wide perspective, which would be all encompassing, besides having an integrated approach towards building a consensus on policies of national importance. In the present context, we may have lost an opportunity but it may still not be too late.

1,04-1-20,Children of a lesser God,"Fit India is an impossible dream when the real burden of disease is systemic negligence, no matter who runs the Govt

Even the death of 100 infants in a month at Kota’s JK Lon Hospital due to sheer negligence hasn’t shocked us as a nurturer and bequeather of our future generation. We would rather confine ourselves to silly debates on religion and identity when there is a mindless loss of young lives and a lost generation that may not be healthy enough to shape their identity in the first place. We can be termite-free, zero this and that but not disease-free. Isn’t a nation that is aspiring to be a $5 trillion economy on bullet trains ashamed that its newborns cannot even survive a harsh winter simply because they are underweight and underdeveloped? All political slugfests and demagoguery have no meaning in this country when year after year the poor and underprivileged children die because of a compromised public healthcare system, no matter who is running the regime with a difference or who is running it on an ad hoc basis. Government hospitals in this country are but death traps for children, not the hope to revive and grow them. In fact, it is grossly insensitive of the authorities to not provide the basics of neo-natal care in the Kota facility — there were not enough incubators, no hygiene standards with pigs moving around as carriers of germs, no oxygen supplies and infrastructural breakdowns of critical care — but hire a red carpet for a visit by the Rajasthan Health Minister to investigate gaps in the system. They restored the piped oxygen supply system in the neo-natal unit overnight, which had so far been relying on cylinders, just because of a public outcry. In other words, we will get our basic rights only when we scream. Otherwise, we settle blissfully into ignorance as we are gradually being tamed by a system into being complacent and not question the status quo. How else can one explain why the Kota incident is an exact mirror image of the one at a Government hospital in Gorakhpur in 2017? There, too, medical negligence arising from the shortage of oxygen supply was discovered to have been a major cause for avoidable deaths of infants. The oxygen supply was cut by the supplier due to non-payment of dues. The State Government had ignored repeated requests for clearing them despite warnings about supply being cut. One year after the incident, the families of the victims had not been compensated or visited by State Government officials. Both the JK Lon and the BRD Medical College hospitals in Kota and Gorakhpur are supposedly among the biggest Government facilities in their States and claim to be a specialised facility to treat pediatric complications. Both are the only hope for villagers from the districts.

The politics over the child deaths has been pitiful, reprehensible and infuriating. The Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot seemed a clone of the BJP as he engaged in competitive whataboutery, claiming 954 children died at the hospital this year as compared to 1,005 in 2018 and 1,198 in 2014 when the BJP was in power. “Every day some deaths occur in every hospital in the country. There is nothing new in this,” he said, legitimising institutional apathy and making helplessness habitual than punishable. Is that what he means by his pledge of Nirogi Rajasthan, a log book of fewer child deaths? Remember, before the uproar, the State Government had appointed an inquiry committee, which had cleared the hospital of any wrong-doing and identified the child deaths as caused by cold. Predictably, the BJP brigade, led by the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, claimed the number of deaths was definitely higher this time compared to the last few years and patronisingly extended help in identifying gaps in healthcare delivery. What needs to be understood is that such cases are not always about the lack of infrastructure or funds but the lack of will to optimise their use and functions, an institutionalised fund leakage and a behaviour that believes in short-changing the poor and uneducated. Simply because they cannot afford private medical care despite schemes like Ayushman Bharat with corporate facilities putting many riders to availing it. The Government hospital then becomes the only hope for the sick and infirm in the heart of India. Then there is the bigger structural mapping. Our public expenditure on health as a percentage of the GDP is far lower than countries classified as the “poorest” in the world, a fact conceded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In the National Health Profile 2019, the Government admitted that in 2016, its public spending on health was just 1.17 per cent of the GDP. In comparison, nations classified as Lower Income Countries by the World Bank spent 1.57 per cent of their GDP on health that year.

2,04-1-20,Netas love communal strife,"Since Dec 25, not a day passes when politicians from different parties don’t come out with volatile statements. For them, this is the right time to strengthen their political base

For four days, starting from December 19, 2019, Uttar Pradesh (UP) burnt. It all started from Lucknow — the city of tehzeeb (culture) — where nazakat (delicacy) and nafassat (purity) were torn to shreds as old-timers said that they had not witnessed a pogrom and police atrocities of such magnitude for the last many decades as they did during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests. People were beaten up. Innocents were arrested as rioters and sent to jail . The cries and plea of mothers, wives, fathers and children were trampled under the police jackboot on the pretext of maintaining law and order. Police claim that 19 people lost their lives but social activists put the number to over 24. They say many people are missing. Their relatives do not know where they are. Had they been arrested and sent to jail or were they killed during the crackdown on protests that spread across the State?

The basic question of this pogrom is — who orchestrated it? One thing is sure that those who took part in these protests do not know the tenets of the CAA. Then, why did this happen? Who benefitted from the large-scale destruction? Despite such large-scale preparation, that included the imposition of Section 144 and appeals issued by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Director General of UP Police OP Singh, how were the protesters able to reach Parivartan Chowk? Was it an Intelligence failure or a purposeful BJP design to derive political mileage from the emanating discordant notes of the CAA in which official machinery played a conduit to political design?

The protest call was given by some social organisations, members of civil society and the Samajwadi Party (SP) on December 19. The Winter Session of the UP Legislative Assembly was on. That day, a supplementary grant was to be taken up in the Vidhan Sabha. The SP had announced that its units would stage protests across the State. In Lucknow, the SP and other organisations had announced that protests would be held at Parivartan Chowk — the heart of Lucknow. The administration was ready, as Section 144 was promulgated and any gathering was declared unlawful. DGP Singh went on record saying that all the protests had been “declared illegal”. Then how did the rioters, armed with stones and sticks, reach Parivartan Chowk and the vicinity of Hazratganj? Why did the police not stop them near old Lucknow? Were the policemen not competent enough to handle the high-tension situation? As the police force in UP is facing a staff crunch, the recruits were asked to join duties after six months of training instead of the mandatory nine months. Did their inexperience add fuel to fire?

On the other hand, the way the rioters attacked the OB vans of different television news channels and cars and two-wheelers of journalists, shows that they came with a plan. Protesters are bound to get bad Press if they attack the media and this is exactly what happened. So who stands to benefit from this design?

The videos of the protests emerging after the riots are disturbing. In many videos, youths and members of the minority community were seen throwing stones at the police. In one of the video grabs from Meerut, a youth was seen firing from his revolver. Even more disturbingly, in many of the shots policemen are seen damaging public property and vehicles. In one of the videos, a few people coming out of a car sporting BJP stickers are seen asking people to attack private property. In another video, a senior police officer was seen asking some Muslim youths to go to Pakistan. The police say that these men were shouting anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans which prompted the police officer to curtly tell them to go to Pakistan.

Amid this bloodshed and inconsolable wails of mothers and wives, the trust between the Hindus and the Muslims became the first casualty. The Ganga–Jamuni tehzeeb, the fulcrum of Awadh’s intrinsic culture, was thrown to the wind. Instead, mistrust and apprehension have slowly vitiated the minds of the Hindus and Muslims alike.

Muzaffarnagar, known as the sugar bowl of UP, which was once ripped apart by one of the worst communal riots in 2013 and had seen a thaw in relations between two communities in the last six years, again witnessed seeds of distrust being sown in the community in the name of CAA.

Amid this massacre and destruction, politics has emerged as the clear winner. Parties of all hues are out on the streets trying to take advantage of the situation. Every word spoken by the leaders was used as an opportunity to garner political support.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s statement that his Government would take “revenge” from those involved in the CAA violence was made keeping the Hindu voters in mind and used by the Opposition to hammer him.

The Chief Minister, in his statement, said that those people found involved in the riots would be asked to pay for the damage caused to public assets and the property of those who failed to make good the damage would be auctioned to compensate for the losses. Twitter trolled Yogi Adityanath for his “revenge” comment. One user wrote, “The Govt will take revenge??? Govt is supposed to punish the guilty as per law, not take revenge.”

“Badla (revenge)” became a political buzzword. From the Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to SP national president Akhilesh Yadav and from national president Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Mayawati to Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Chaudhary, all derided Yogi Adityanath for calling for “badla.” Every police action against the rioters was linked to the CM’s “badla” statement. When the district administration of Muzaffarnagar sealed 67 shops following the anti-CAA protests the Opposition leaders called it “badla.” When police raided the houses of people of a particular community and arrested social activists, claiming that they had pelted stones at the police in which over 200 cops were injured, the Opposition again called it vendetta.

The Opposition highlighted cases of an unarmed Sadaf Jafar, a woman social activist who was arrested for allegedly inciting people against the CAA from Parivartan Chowk. This despite a video showing that she was pleading with the policemen to arrest hooligans who were pelting stones.

Then there is Farooq Rahmani, a known Muslim face in Rampur and the office-bearer of Ittehad Naujawan Committee, who was arrested and charged with IPC Section 147 (rioting) and 307 (Attempt to murder) when he was trying to placate some Muslim youth in Gher Mohalla in the Old City area.

Ishtiaq Ahmad Khan, 28, was arrested and charged with rioting when he was returning home after purchasing medicines for his ailing mother. He showed the policemen the doctor’s prescription and the medicines he had purchased as proof that he had gone out to buy them and had got stuck during the riots but his pleas fell on deaf ears. His only fault was that he was wearing a skull cap.

Those who were arrested were booked under different Sections for rioting, unlawful assembly, attempt to murder, wrongful constraints, criminal intimidation, criminal assault on public servant and so on. They were also booked for alleged criminal conspiracy and under Public Property Damage Act.

The SP has grabbed this opportunity and Akhilesh Yadav said that if his Government comes to power, it will order a probe into the violence. He even suggested action against officials and declared that the SP Government would drop charges against the rioters.

This statement suits the designs of the SP and the BJP alike. The ruling BJP has always tried to consolidate Hindus in the name of religion. Yadav’s statement gives the BJP that chance and, therefore, the BJP State president Swatantra Dev Singh immediately used the opportunity to remind people how the erstwhile SP Government had withdrawn cases against terrorists.

Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sent the police in a tizzy and went to meet family members of the activists who were arrested and in turn grabbed headlines. Since December 25, 2019 not a day passes when leaders of different political shades don’t come out with volatile political statements to suit their ideology. For them, this is the right time to strengthen their political base. Because it is true that all politicians love a communal divide.

3,04-1-20,Akhilesh claims 1000 kids died in Gorakhpur in last 12 months,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Friday that more than 1,000 kids had lost their lives in Gorakhpur in the last 12 months but Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was tweeting about infant deaths at the Kota government hospital.

Akhilesh also said that he would be releasing a list of children who lost their lives due to lack of treatment in BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur.

He also charged that the state government pressured doctors to “manage” the number of deaths caused by Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in Gorakhpur.

At least 103 infants have died in a government-run hospital in Kota district of Rajasthan in the last 35 days.

On Thursday, Yogi had targeted the Congress over the death of infants in Kota and said that the party’s general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should have gone there to console the mothers of the children who had died instead of “playing politics” over anti-CAA protests in UP.

Speaking to media persons in Lucknow on Friday, the SP chief said, “The Chief Minister is concerned about deaths of children in Kota but when will he show his concern over deaths of more than a thousand kids over the last few years in Gorakhpur?”

“Despite knowing that the kids were suffering from JE, doctors could not give them the right medication as they were told to keep the figures of such cases under control at any cost,” said Akhilesh, even as the Congress government in Rajasthan was up against a major political storm over infant deaths in the Kota hospital.

Yadav sought to know why wrong medicines were administered to the child patients and who should be accountable for the tragedy.

However, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma denied claims made by the SP chief and said, “I will compliment the chief minister for improving facilities at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur which has resulted in a sharp decline in JE causalities. Akhileshji should come up with a list to substantiate his claim as his charges are baseless.”

Referring to Bharatiya Janata Party state president Swatantra Dev Singh’s remark that the SP chief should stay in Pakistan for a month to understand atrocities being faced by Hindus there, Akhilesh Yadav said that the saffron party suggested this as it did not want any discussion on unemployment.

The BJP regime at the Centre has been silent on pressing economic issues, rising prices of essentials, higher cost of LPG cylinders and hike in power tariff, he added.

Referring to the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and police action against the protesters, the SP chief claimed that all deaths during the protests were caused by police bullets.

Akhilesh Yadav said that the SP workers would take out rallies across the state against National Population Register (NPR) soon, as it would do no good to the people.

“Nahi chahiye NPR, humey chahiye rozgar (We don’t need NPR, we need employment) will be our slogan,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-claims-1000-kids-died--in-gorakhpur-in-last-12-months.html
4,04-1-20,Issue with Vij sorted out: Haryana CM,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Friday sought to play down his ongoing tussle with Home Minister Anil Vij, who has expressed his displeasure over the defiance of the officers in his Department and the CMO overruling him in the matter of transfers of IPS officers.

A day after meeting BJP’s working President JP Nadda in Delhi to seek his intervention to appease Minister Anil Vij, the Chief Minister claimed that issue is sorted out.

“We have discussed with him (Anil Vij) and things are fine…,” said Manohar Lal, when asked about his differences with the Home Minister.

“It is a mere speculation. I met Nadda to discuss Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and forthcoming elections in Delhi,” he added.

Only a day back, senior BJP Minister Anil Vij had challenged the Haryana Government to take back his Home portfolio if it continues to function in the same manner.

Perturbed over the defiance of the officers in his Department and the Chief Minister’s office taking decisions regarding IPS transfers without keeping him in the loop, Vij had said, “Although the Chief Minister has power to overrule me, but I should be kept in the loop at least.”

Vij had reportedly also pulled up the State’s intelligence department (CID) recently for allegedly not sharing information sought by him on recent assembly polls and had also marked a dissent note to the Chief Minister over transfer of nine IPS officers without taking him in confidence.

Commenting on the ongoing tussle, Haryana BJP affairs in-charge Anil Jain has said that the Chief Minister is supreme in any matter.Notably, in the first term of the BJP Government in Haryana, the Home Portfolio was kept by the Chief Minister himself.

However, in BJP’s second term the prestigious Home Portfolio was given to Vij with independent charge.

The allocation of Home portfolio to Vij, senior-most Minister in Haryana Government had come as a surprise to many but the BJP’s move to appoint was crucial to balance out heavyweight Dushyant Chautala of the JJP who was made the Deputy Chief Minister for lending support to the BJP for forming the government.

Meanwhile, it is not the first time that the two senior BJP leaders are locked in a power tussle.

During BJP’s first term in Haryana also, Anil Vij had hurled barbs at Manohar Lalfor interfering in his Departments.

Vij also did not shy away from questioning the functioning of his own government on several occasions.

At that time also, the BJP high command had intervened to pacify Vij.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/issue-with-vij-sorted-out--haryana-cm.html

Shah said this while dedicating the new campus of the National Fire Service College (NFSC) at Nagpur to the nation on Thursday.

“In 1999, we lost 10,000 people in Super Cyclone in Odisha whereas Cyclone Fani was managed so effectively this year that it could claim only 64 lives. In these two decades, the country has built huge capabilities in Disaster Response mechanisms,” he said.

Notably, the Odisha Government showed a high degree of preparedness and effectively managed to evacuate about 1.6 million people based on predictions.

India has been able to reduce the loss of lives to less than 1 per cent in two decades, claimed the Home Minister.

The Home Minister presented Fire Service Gallantry Medals and awards to meritorious students of the NFSC during the event.

He also laid the foundation of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Academy at Nagpur and announced Subhash Chandra Bose Award in the field of disaster management.

He expressed hope that though fire services are a State subject, all States would have a better coordination with the Centre to fight fire disasters through the NFSC.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shah-praises-odisha---s-fani-management.html

According to information available, the students of the institute have sought an entry into the Guinness Book of the World Records for their ingenious development of an alluring model of 22.1 feet high object which is claimed to be the “largest fishing lure of the world” . The lure, made up of scrap, is 99 cm wide and its hook measures 3.33 feet, said Principal of the institute Rajat Panigrahi.

The institute has submitted a formal application to the Guinness Book of World Records for recognising the exemplary lure as the largest in the world, Panigrahi claimed.

The fishing lure which is currently figured in the Guinness Book of World Records is only 15.2 feet in height at USA. The students and Principal of the ITI are quite confident to break the existing world record and set up a new record by such induction.

The open-air scrap museum which is coming up shortly in the institute's campus will instal such huge structures for the view of the general public as well as technocrats.

According to information available, 20 students from fitter, welder and painting trade have succeeded in designing, developing, fabricating and painting the lure within a short span of 40 days during their internship programme. For this innovating design, the students collected the scrap of iron rods and the GI sheets from the Trysem Hostel (demolished a couple of years back) after appropriate chemical treatment in order prevent rust, the students said.

Two damaged lens of camera have been used as the eyes of the lure, sources said.

The basic objective of developing such an exemplary and innovative lure is to accord a special identity to Gopalpur-On-Sea and popularizing its fishing pier.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/b-pur-students-make-largest-fishing-lure-from-scrap.html
10,04-1-20,A costly mistake by protesters,"Anti-CAA agitators should have made it clear they were not against citizenship for immigrants who came to India to escape religious persecution

The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) permits non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to become Indian citizens if they have lived in the country for at least five years but it does not grant the same rights to Muslim immigrants.The justification for this distinction given by the Government is that non-Muslims were minorities in these Muslim- majority countries and came to India to escape religious persecution, whereas Muslims who came into India from there could not be said to have come due to persecution but were “economic refugees” i.e. they came for a better life.

This reasoning is partially correct. Indeed, Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and so on, are often persecuted in these Muslim-majority countries by forcible conversions and marriage of minor girls, misuse of blasphemy laws, Ordinance XX made by late General Zia-ul-Haq, and so on.

So the anti-CAA protesters should have clearly said that they were not against the grant of citizenship to immigrants who came into India to escape religious persecution, rather they support it and condemn the persecution of minorities in the aforementioned three countries. At the same time, they should have said they oppose denial of citizenship to all Muslim immigrants because some Muslim sects in Pakistan, like the Shias and the Ahmadiyyas, are often persecuted and that economic refugees is a worldwide phenomenon.

As many as 11 million Mexicans are said to be living illegally in the USA. Many Muslims who came from Bangladesh into Assam after March 1971 (the cut-off date under the Assam Accord) have now been living in Assam for decades, some for over 40 years and now have no roots in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Government has refused to take them back, so, surely they cannot be dumped into the Bay of Bengal. They, too, should be granted citizenship if they have lived in Assam for at least five years.

However, the anti-CAA protesters failed to clarify this and created an impression among many Hindus that this was only an agitation for Muslims. Secularism has to be a two-way traffic, it cannot be a one-way traffic. So it won’t do to condemn the persecution of Muslims but turn a Nelson’s eye to the persecution of Hindus. Most Muslims shout themselves hoarse if Muslims are persecuted in Palestine but they were quiet when much nearer home Kashmiri Pandits were hounded out of their homes in Kashmir in the 1990s.

This is the problem with most (not all) Muslims. When people condemn atrocities on Muslims, they clap and cheer. But when the same people condemn atrocities by Muslims on Hindus, Christians or Sikhs, they are immediately branded as communal. When people say there is nothing wrong in eating beef, they applaud. But when the same people say that the sharia, burqa and madrasas should be banned (for their good) many Muslims abuse them.

It is well known that in India Muslims were treated by crafty politicians as a vote bank, because of which such politicians adopted a policy of appeasement. For instance, Mamata Banerjee announced a monthly stipend of Rs 2,500 to each of the thousands of imams in masjids in West Bengal and Rs 1,500 to each of the muezzins but nothing for the Hindu priests. This decision was later struck down as unconstitutional by the Calcutta High Court.

Surely this antagonised the Hindus, as is evident from the fact that BJP won 18 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 elections, whereas it had none earlier.

The Hindus were further antagonised by the way many Muslims behaved. If one criticised Hindu extremism, they applauded but if one criticised Muslim extremism or fundamentalists like Zakir Naik they branded you as communal. People are often applauded for saying that a cow is only an animal, like a horse or a dog hence it should not be venerated and there is nothing wrong with eating beef. But when the same people say that there is no place for Wahabi Islam in India, they are viciously attacked by most Muslims.

Communalism had existed in Indian society even before 2014 when the BJP came to power. But till then it was latent and erupted only occasionally. After 2014 it has become open, virulent and continuous. Indian society is much more polarised now.

Keeping the above factors in mind, the anti-CAA protesters should have ensured that an impression was not created that the agitation was mainly driven by Muslims, for if that happens, most of the 80 per cent Hindus in India (except for some idealistic youths) will not join it. But that is precisely what happened. The messaging needs to be pointed if protesters want to blunt the BJP.

11,04-1-20,Tableau politics,"Instead of fighting over selection norms, a clear-cut format must be devised to ensure just representation of all States

In a highly polarised atmosphere over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the antagonism between the ruling BJP and the protesting Opposition is spilling over into every sphere involving Centre-State relations. So it is that the Bengal, Kerala, Bihar and Maharashtra Governments are complaining that their floats for the Republic Day have been rejected as part of the Centre’s political vendetta because they have been criticising identity-based politics. Out of the six States whose proposals have been rejected, four are ruled by the Opposition parties. The Centre claims that floats were allotted on a rotational basis and since the excluded States had made the cut last year through the same screening process, nothing much should be made of it. But by the same logic, nobody can explain why certain States should be repeated year after year. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, no stranger to making political capital out of culture issues, quickly claimed that Bengal’s artistic expressions were some of the finest but were being held hostage to stifle her voice on the CAA and NRC. Similarly, the Shiv Sena, which is leading an alliance government in Maharashtra, feels it is being punished for dumping the BJP because a fair review would not have disqualified a State which has been showcasing the work of students of the JJ School of Art over the years. While the two cases do seem contextual, fact is politics over R-Day tableaux happens every year, no matter which party is in power. During the UPA-led Congress rule, Andhra Pradesh did not get a chance to present its floats for four consecutive years. Similar was the case for Jharkhand. Maharashtra’s tableaux have been rejected nine times.

Tableaux are a cultural showcase of India’s diversity and pride and should be above narrow political considerations. The selection criteria should be made transparent. Considering time constraints for such an extravaganza, a rotational procedure of 32 States, where representation could perhaps follow an alphabetical order, could ensure fairness. May be all criteria can be done away with by getting States to work on common themes for tableaux or even front them with live acts by respective folk artistes. While States conduct their own R-Day events, the Delhi one solemnises the union of States. Tableaux represent the stakeholdership of the States in the Union and they should be treated right and with a certain pride. A new format of cooperative federalism could be worked on.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tableau-politics-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/tableau-politics.html
12,04-1-20,Silent warriors against pollution,"Large-scale tree felling is starting to resemble a genocide. Greedy man may not sit peacefully till he has harnessed all natural resources for himself. Can India avoid this genocide?

The recent uproar over the felling of trees in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony area for setting up a metro car shed highlighted how India is taking the urban green canopy for granted. It was only due to the timely intervention of citizens that 2,500 trees escaped the axe. But sadly, by the time the Supreme Court (SC) intervened and put on hold any further deforestation, nearly 1,500 trees had already been cut and cleared. The fact that even the Bombay High Court refused to consider Aarey Colony as an urban forest reserve is not only distressing but also worrying as it may set a bad precedent. According to the United Nation’s (UN’s) urban forestry estimates, trees have excellent pollution combatting capabilities. A balanced concrete to tree cover ratio has the ability to bring down ambient urban temperatures by two to eight degree Celsius. A healthy urban tree cover can also reduce air-conditioning use by 30 per cent and bring down heating energy requirement by 20-50 per cent. A healthy, mature tree, for instance, has the innate capacity to absorb 150 kg of carbon dioxide and also filter harmful airborne pollutants including some fine particulate matter. Trees reduce cortisol levels in their immediate neighbourhood, thereby bringing down average stress levels. If given a fair chance, trees can really turn the tables on rising pollution levels. This is the reason why urban areas with green cover are better poised to deal with pollution levels as compared to industrial areas that have a high density of construction and a poor green cover.

Given the pollution fighting attributes of trees, it is advisable for cities to have at least 40 per cent green cover. This not only helps reduce pollution but also improves the quality of life. According to a study by the University of Illinois, people residing in high-density green areas have higher tolerance levels and low levels of fatigue.

Given what trees can do to fight pollution and improve human and animal health, it is shocking that in India we still cut them down in large numbers.

Tree felling to make way for large development projects and housing or commercial projects is a countrywide phenomena and in the national Capital alone, new Government complexes and residential projects are poised to take a toll on 14,000-16,000 mature trees.

This reflects the regressive mentality of all stakeholders and that includes even the most respected institutions as well as individuals of our nation. This needs to change by highlighting and creating awareness about the direct benefits trees bring to this world and all life on the planet. The authorities need to understand that erasing nature for urban development is an outdated approach and given the harmful impacts of climate change, it is also a very dangerous thing to do. The puzzling aspect of this is how the authorities are completely unwilling and oblivious to the latent possibilities of urban development that is in harmony with nature. There are many examples across the world where trees and heavy green canopy have been actively integrated into urban planning and made even better by including water bodies. This improves the livability quotient of the cities to unprecedented levels.

Worldwide there are 422 trees to a person, whereas India only has 28 trees per person. This disparity with our global counterparts is not only adversely impacting our life expectancy and quality of life but also resulting in the ambient temperatures climbing steadily. Problems like the ever-dwindling green cover, rising population, pollution and not enough new trees being planned and planted, besiege today’s environment. The cumulative impact of this is also increasing the disease burden of the urban citizen. The Government must take note of the rising health disorders arising out of pollution and related causes and take immediate measures to remedy the same. Increasing the urban green cover is one of them.

Planting of saplings in exchange for cutting down full-grown trees seems to be the newest way of cutting down trees in large numbers and getting away with it. Many institutions and individuals claim that double the saplings have been planted for the actual number of trees cut, but seldom does anyone specify how many saplings actually lived and whether those that had died were replaced immediately with fresh ones. Also, in order to be able to combat pollution effectively, a tree has to be mature (at least 10-years-old) and saplings cannot do the work of cleaning the air the way a mature tree can. These shortcuts mean that the country is losing its tree cover fast and is unable to replenish it in an effective manner. Moreover, as these saplings take 10 years to properly grow up and start helping to contain pollution, this means that we have to endure the absence of trees for at least a decade after trees are cut and the new saplings grow up. This gap is unacceptable and not in the best interests of both man and nature.

Large-scale tree felling is starting to resemble a genocide. Greedy man may not sit peacefully till he has harnessed all natural resources for himself. Can India avoid this genocide? That depends entirely on who is witnessing and appreciating the contributions of these silent warriors. It is high time that the common man took up the fight for their survival, as our own future is closely linked to them.

13,04-1-20,Akhilesh set to embark on cycle yatra,"Apparently overwhelmed by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s forays into UP and the grand old party occupying centre stage in the country-wide protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav is all set to hit the streets and embark on a cycle yatra in Uttar Pradesh.

The focus on Uttar Pradesh by Priyanka and her visits to Sonbhadra, Unnao, Bijnor, Meerut and her prolonged stay in Lucknow has left the SP chief with little option but to pull his socks and mobilise his party cadre.

Sources in the SP said that Akhilesh had cancelled his winter vacation with his family in Europe this year. For the last several years, Akhilesh has been visiting Europe twice a year – in December and June-July.

A SP leader said that during the cycle yatra, Akhilesh would visit buildings and projects that were completed during his tenure as chief minister and compare the development work undertaken during his tenure and that of the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state.

“The SP chief wants to show a comparative picture of work done during his tenure and that of the Yogi Adityanath government. This will serve dual purpose as he will also meet youth and farmers en route and interact with them on welfare measures started during his tenure,” a SP leader said.

In 2012, Akhilesh had undertaken a cycle yatra, criss-crossing various parts of the state, and had led his party to power with a majority for the first time.

The sources said that preparations were underway to decide the mode and route for the cycle yatra so that the party cadre could be motivated for the next Assembly elections in 2022.

Leader of opposition in UP Assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary, said the cycle yatra dates would be finalised soon and all party leaders would participate in it.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-set--to-embark-on--cycle-yatra.html
14,04-1-20,Priyanka continues her forays into UP Sending greeting cards to people,"Aiming to revive the beleaguered party in the politically significant Uttar Pradesh, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has continued her forays into the state in the New Year after going into action in the last half of 2019.

Since the beginning of 2020, Priyanka has been sending greeting cards to lakhs of people of the state, with the Preamble of the Indian Constitution printed on one side. The cards are being sent to intellectuals, writers, poets, journalists and social workers of UP.

Sources in the Congress said in Lucknow on Friday that the party planned to send around five lakh greeting cards to the people in UP and of these, 50,000 cards had been sent by post.

The sources further claimed that the plan of sending greeting cards was prepared much in advance and the main task was to gather addresses of intellectuals and social workers across the state. He said addresses of journalists were gathered by district committees.

Ever since the Congress took up cudgels against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Priyanka has spoken about the Preamble of the Constitution from different fora several times.

At the Congress rally at Mahatma Gandhi’s samadhi at Raj Ghat in Delhi, Priyanka had read the Preamble in her address and later, on Congress Foundation Day function at UPCC headquarters in Lucknow, she had again read it while interacting with party workers.

Justifying Priyanka’s move, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the maximum numbers of attacks on the Constitution were witnessed during the present Bharatiya Janata Party regime at the Centre.

“At such a crucial juncture, it was imperative to make people aware of the Constitution and that is why Priyankaji decided to initiate the move. Sending New Year greetings along with the Preamble is an effort to inform people about the Constitution as well,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-continues--her-forays-into-up--sending-greeting-cards-to-people.html
15,04-1-20,UP Cong demands judicial probe into functioning of all UP govt depts,"Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu once again targeted Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on his much-hyped claim of ‘zero tolerance’ towards corruption after a letter written to the CM Office by Noida district police chief found its way to the media.

Alleging large-scale corruption in UP Police and other departments, Lallu demanded a judicial inquiry into the functioning of all government departments of the state.

Citing the 5-page report of Noida’s Senior Superintendent of Police Vaibhav Krishna that contain serious graft allegations among the ranks of UP Police, Lallu said that it spoke volumes about the rampant corruption and bribery prevailing in the department.

The Congress leader said that an impartial inquiry into the case would expose some big names and bring out the reality of the Bharatiya Janata Party government in UP.

“The entire state is plagued by corruption and bribery. Complaints in this regard are received on a daily basis. Hence a judicial inquiry be conducted into the working of all government departments so as to rid the people of these problems,” Lallu said in a statement issued in Lucknow.

16,04-1-20,Confidential letter leak Explanation sought from Noida SSP,"Senior Superintendent of Police of Noida, Vaibhav Krishna, seems to be staring down the barrel as Director General of Police (DGP) OP Singh on Friday sought an explanation from him for the leaking out of his recent confidential letter to the state government.

At a hurriedly convened press conference in Lucknow on Friday, the DGP said that the SSP of Noida had been given 15 days to explain whether he had flouted service conduct rules by leaking the missive.

Singh said that Inspector General of Meerut Range, Alok Singh, had been asked to enquire into the matter and a show-cause notice was served on Vaibhav Krishna on Friday morning.

The IG has been given 15 days’ time to complete the enquiry and submit his report for further action.

The DGP claimed that he would come out with the findings once the IG, Meerut, submitted his findings.

Earlier, Vaibhav Krishna had alleged corruption in the ranks of UP Police and levelled serious charges of bribe for postings against five fellow officers.

The Noida SSP’s letter to the government mentioned that details of graft emerged during a probe into a case in which four people were arrested in Noida on August 23, 2019.

The SSP sent a report on some “very sensitive cases” related to corruption a month ago to the Chief Minister’s Office in Lucknow.

Earlier this week, the Gautam Buddha Nagar district administration had announced booking 128 members of three criminal gangs under UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 and initiated proceedings to attach their properties, in a bid to choke their funding.

The decision was taken on the basis of a report prepared by the Noida police and the accused included kingpins of gangs involved in contract killing, extortion and various contracts relating to private businesses in the district.

A few days back, three videos had gone viral on social media showing some explicit content featuring the Noida SSP but they were dismissed by Krishna as a conspiracy to sully his image because he had started a crusade against corruption in which some journalists and IPS officers were involved.

Krishna clarified that his image was morphed and hence he got a criminal case registered in the matter so that the culprits instrumental in making the videos viral could be arrested.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/confidential-letter-leak--explanation-sought--from-noida-ssp.html

Bharti was in Bhopal on Friday to take part in BJP’s pro-CAA rally in Govindpura area while commenting on ‘distasteful’ remarks on Savarkar in Congress book said it is an old habit of grand old party to insult great personalities.

She stated that Congress has now accepted saffron as the colour of this country and the day is not far away when Nehru-Gandhi family would chant Jai Sri Ram and would say Gau mata ki jai.

“I urge my brother Uddhav Thackarey to specify whether he would tolerate this insult to Veer Savarkar or he would throw Congress out of his Government,” asked Bharti saying he wish to know from him (Uddhav) whether he reckons his government more important or Savarkar’s pride.

“We consider Savarkar’s pride above all and consider those speaking against him as against the nation, she said, adding that Congress is exhibiting it is distorted and loath able mentality.

Attacking the Nehru-Gandhi family, Bharti said once a senior Congress leader and the former MP CM had coined the term saffron terrorism and recently the party’s general secretary has accepted that saffron is the colour this country’s culture and spirituality so the day is not far away when the family would start chanting Jai Sri Ram, Bharat Mata ki Jai and Gau Mata ki Jai.

25,04-1-20,Row over chariots parking in corridor blueprint,"Following release of the Jagannath corridor blueprint by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Shreemandir servitors have started lodging protests.

Looking at the blueprint of parking of three decorated chariots near the temple administration office, servitors have questioned the move of the administration. Upping their ante against shifting of three chariots from Lions’ Gate in Shree Gundicha, the servitors have termed the blueprint as breach of an age-old tradition.

Reportedly in Jagannath corridor blueprint, three chariots are found parked not at Lions Gate but near the Jagannath Temple office. It is said that the chariots from the upcoming Rath Yatra would park near the temple administration office instead of at the Lions Gate and start their journey to the Gundicha Temple.

If it happens then the holy deities would have to move to temple office instead of Lions Gate.

“If the chariots are kept near the temple office instead of Lions Gate, the deities would have to move to more distance. This might harm the body of deities as they have to move more distance sustaining to severe jerk,” said servitor Durgadas Mohapatra.

Raising concern over the shift of parking place, Mohapatra said any shift of chariots would be treated as breach of tradition.

However, the temple administration has diverted the issue saying that it was merely a picture during construction.

Reportedly, in the 75-meter heritage zone, the administration has built permanent steel structure for pilgrims’ pathway. Besides, there are many new structures in place which would be used as rest shed for pilgrims, shoe and mobile stands where no space are available for chariots’ parking during the Gundicha Yatra.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/row-over-chariots-parking-in-corridor-blueprint.html

29,04-1-20,"India of engaged, enraged & indifferent!","The recent ruckus over the recital of the poem “Hum Dekhenge” written by Pakistani poet, communist and revolutionary Faiz Ahmad Faiz in IIT Kanpur indicates to a fast-spreading toxic culture of ‘issue building’ over nonissues and pathetic undemocratic intolerance. It is indeed amusing that, as to how a poem written in 1979 as a form of protest against Pakistani military dictator Zia-ul-Haq has anything to do with hurting religious sentiment, when the intent of the poet was something else, this is by far the best standard of interpretation.

It seems, those who talk about absolute absence of intolerance are more or so contributing to it either out of ignorance of fact, history and law or are part of a deliberate design to destabilise the social harmony and to exploit the consequential socio-political-religious unrest to earn rich political dividends.

Many of us by virtue of our births are Indians and Hindus, but certainly have inculcated the Indianness, the virtues of Hinduism, the philosophy and ideology of being a liberal, by understanding and acceptance; so therefore by choice are Indians, Hindus and liberals. We don’t believe in radical perspectives of any side, we refuse such concoctions; refuse to blindly believe that, CAA, NRC and NPR are against the interest of the nation, or totally in the interest of the nation; we would rather choose to watch the way the Government is going to take it forward. We refuse to believe in violent protests but certainly would support the fundamental right of meaningful dissent vented through the right forum. We also have concerns on what shall happen to our minority brethrens post NRC, but at the same time would like to wait and trust the assurances given by the Government for the time being after many fellow citizens have expressed their strong dissent, but shall not prefer to withstand hooliganism and vandalism in the name of protest.

A positive national discourse has a lot to contribute to boost the national spirit and inclusive growth through inclusive participation. But unfortunately, we have completely ignored some of the undisputed positive stories, mainly on the legislative side. As no one has significantly discussed or celebrated some of the important legislative developments. For example, the Personal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2018, that was cleared by the Parliament to remove leprosy as a ground for divorce, which has given a more humane approach to the personal law covering marriage and divorce. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019, which was cleared by the Rajya Sabha on November 26, aims at protecting the rights of transgender persons by granting them recognition and making welfare provisions for them. It prohibits discrimination against a transgender person, including denial of service or unfair treatment. Further, it criminalizes denial of use of public places to transgender persons , removal of transgender persons from household, villages etc. Apart from the above, the Consumer Protection Bill, 2019, which once notified shall replace the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. This bill was passed to strengthen consumer rights, considering the modern day issue such as e-commerce, direct selling, tele-marketing etc. It also provides a range of legal recourses from class action suits to liability for celebrity endorsements.

So, the point that is being tried to be made here is, that we as a nation, which also includes the opposition and ideological opponents of those who are in power, need not always be obsessed about our dissent on many issues those bother or concern us , so much so that we completely lose sight of the positive stories that are imperative to be celebrated, not just to encourage the Government to do further good work but also to encourage the entire governance mechanism and various stakeholders in the various walks of national life. Not everywhere you stand in opposition, some of the decisions are for common cause and what we need is constructive opposition and not obsessed dissent, not a rioting minds but strong and calm critic.

The one who is an Indian, a Hindu and at the same time a liberal, has a prism and a perspective to look through; we don’t believe in being a devotee and singing glories for the regime but certainly would dislike an opposition which is far from being a true critic on real issues, who complains of the Government, of hiding its fallacies in economic decisions behind CAA and other populist strides but at the same time running behind and inflaming over the same issues. The question is why don’t you pick up the more meaningful ones and prioritise on what to raise and when to raise.

Being a Hindu is not anti-islam, or for that matter not anti-anything or any ‘ism’, rather it is synonymous with the ‘idea of India’, as long as it is all encompassing, taking every belief, faith and religion along; and rooted in the true doctrine of humanism and participatory and inclusive growth. It doesn’t compel the other to believe in any fixed tenet or faith, hence, it is far from proselytising.

Being a liberal is about believing in liberty, consent of the governed and equality before law, but it is also about accepting the many forms of culture and tradition within its own space and certainly with dignity. And being an Indian is about tolerance, robust conscience but certainly not dogmatism; it is about a cascade of knowledge, culture, literature and best of human traditions, but it has its own follies and fallacies spread by generation of opportunists, however meaningfully resisted by the class of the enlightened beings over the generations. It is about optimum dissent and at the same time acceptance and a peaceful convergence of both, a melting pot of various manifestations of humanity.

The India in 2020, like before shall have its own share of populace, which includes the engaged, the enraged and the indifferent, and it shall have among others the Indian, the Hindu and the liberal, but common national cause is a must, irrespective of the differences. We would love to participate in national growth, criticise the Government and at the same time wait and afford opportunity to the Government to rectify its mistakes, refuse to give in to the clutches of political opportunism and keep national interest above anything and everything.

The decision was taken during the party’s core committee meeting presided over by SAD president Sukhbir Badal.

The core committee said that the spate of political assassinations of Akali leaders by “gangsters with direct links to the Congress leaders and Ministers” was unprecedented. “The party is committed to breaking the gangster-minister nexus in Punjab and will take all necessary steps in this regard, be it going to the people or the courts,” it noted.

DISTRICT LEVEL DHARNAS TO DEMAND ROLLBACK OF POWER TARIFF HIKE

To ensure withdrawal of unjust and unprecedented power tariff hike in Punjab, the SAD core committee also announced to hold agitation across all districts.

They party said that the government had put an unbearable burden on the common man and made industries unsustainable.

Stating that the SAD would not allow the Congress Government to pass on its inefficiencies as well as management failures to the consumers, SAD chief Sukhbir Badal announced that the party would hold district level dharnas across the State to demand immediate withdrawal of the power hike.

The first dharna will be held at Sangrur on February 2 followed by dharnas in Bathinda, Ferozepur and Fazilka.

Rajoana is currently undergoing death sentence at Patiala Central Jail, and the Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has moved a plea seeking commutation.

DEMANDS REGISTERATION OF CASE AGAINST RANDHAWA

Taking note of the “sacrilegious” conduct of Punjab Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, the SAD core committee condemned him for “ridiculing” the first Sikh master, Guru Nanak Dev and comparing him with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.

“Such shameful conduct has hurt the religious sentiments of the entire Sikh community and a case under Section 295 – A should be registered against him immediately besides his immediate dismissal from the State Cabinet,” noted the core committee.

TWO-MP PANEL TO VISIT UP, MP TO ENSURE JUSTICE FOR SIKH VICTIMS

Expressing grave concern at the developments, the core panel has appointed a two-member panel of MPs — Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Naresh Gujral — to look into both incidents and suggest remedies.

The MPs will visit both places and will also take up cases of the victims appropriately.

34,04-1-20,Decisions taken to set up quality school education system,"School education paves the way to the future of children. Therefore, it is important that there should be quality in education, schools must have good environment and teachers must be rich in knowledge so that children are always eager to attend school and study.

The State Government has taken many landmark decisions in the last one year to set up quality school education system in the state. Now children have started attending school, teachers have also become more dedicated towards providing good education to children. The change is becoming visible.

‘Learn for the best’ scheme has been implemented to improve the quality of school education. Under the scheme, departmental officers, principals and teachers visited local private schools, schools in Delhi, Mahamaya School in Noida and Korea Development Institute of South Korea.

This has changed the thinking and teaching style of principals and teachers. They are beginning to realize their responsibility towards children’s education and are coming to schools regularly.

System of daily checking of children’s copies of basic subjects has been implemented in schools. District and state level officials are visiting schools to ensure that the teachers check the copies of students daily and correct mistakes.

A special copy checking campaign has been launched in 2742 schools in the state. Disciplinary action is being taken against teachers who do not check copies and do not mark corrections. Recently, increments of 139 teachers were withheld, deductions were made in the salaries of 425 teachers, 665 teachers were issued warning and 751 teachers were issued show cause notices.

A system for the analysis of exam results in schools has been made. In order to assess the efficiency of teachers of schools with less than thirty percent exam results, 6215 teachers appeared in the examination held on June 12 and 15, 2019. Efficiency improvement training was also imparted to the teachers. After this, a re-test was taken.

Disciplinary action was taken against teachers whose results were not found satisfactory in this examination. Compulsory retirement was given to 16 teachers who failed in the open book exam after being imparted two months of training.

A system of regular parents-teachers meetings has been implemented in schools. Now parents-teacher meetings are being held simultaneously in every government school every three months. In these meetings, issues of student profiling, skill upgradation workbook, Partibha Parv results, bridge course, half-yearly examination, school attendance etc. are being discussed.

About 40 lakh parents attended these meetings for the first time. On Children's Day, the Education Minister sent a letter to all parents urging them to cooperate in improving the quality and efficiency of students.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/decisions-taken-to-set-up-quality-school-education-system.html
35,04-1-20,AAP accuses Govt of promoting health mafia,"Hitting out at Capt Amarinder Singh’s government for stopping the Non-Practice Allowance (NPA) provided to the doctors in government hospitals and dispensaries in Punjab and allowing them to do private practice, the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab unit on Friday termed it as a lopsided decision.

At the same time, AAP cautioned that the government’s decision would hit the public health services in the State, besides giving more teeth to the health mafia active in Punjab.

It has been learnt that the State Government is planning to abolish the NPA and to allow the doctors for private practice.

“The government is trying to save public money at the cost of people’s interests…Allowing doctors to do private practice in the name of saving just Rs 153 crore is a lopsided decision all set to hit health services in the state. The worst affected would be the poor people,” said AAP leaders including the party's state core committee chairman and MLA Principal Budh Ram, Deputy Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Sarabjit Kaur Manuke, party spokesperson and MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby and NRI wing president Jai Kishan Singh Rori, in a joint statement.

Principal Budh Ram and Manuke reiterated that during its tenure from 2002-07, the Capt Amarinder government had come out with the proposal, but had to roll back on the decision amid vehement protests poured in from the public. Even the doctors had opposed the Captain Government's move to stop NPA and allowing private practice, they pointed.

Rori and Ruby said that the Government was trying to fill the government coffers by stopping NPA payable to doctors in government hospitals and dispensaries, suggesting that it should do it by taming the liquor mafia, health and education mafia, sand mafia, transport mafia usurping major chunk of the state exchequer.

“The Captain Government is not bothered about the issues and concerns of the people…Mafia is gaining ground under the protective patronage of the Capt Amarinder Government, like his predecessor,” they added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-accuses-govt-of-promoting-health-mafia.html

37,04-1-20,PCMSA OPPOSES GOVT'S PLAN TO ABOLISH NPA,"Taking a serious note of Punjab Government’s plans to withdraw non-practice allowance given to the Government doctors across the State, the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA) on Friday decided to oppose the move.

The Association maintained that its delegation would soon meet the state Health Minister to raise the issue and to oppose the move.

Terming the decision as “anti-people” and “anti-doctors” step, PCMSA president Dr Gagandeep Singh said: “NPA is given to the doctors for their long study of the medical education which leads them for their late entry to the government services.

Also, they engage in tough and high-risk duties like emergency duty, VIP duty, and postmortem duties”

“Allowing the private practice at the hospital campus will result in extra burden on the poor and downtrodden masses of the State. Also, it will be a step towards privatization of the health services across the State,” said PCMSA senior vice-president Dr Gagandeep Shergill.

He added that the allowance of the private practice will be a setback for on-call emergency specialty services, especially the mother and children health services will be the worst hit as the doctors will not prefer to go on-call specialty care duties. The state is already facing crunch of specialist doctors and it will deepen the crisis further, he said. “Most of the government doctors are dedicated to their government services. It will be a setback to their dedication.

And those, who have served the department for many years and never did the private practice, will be forced to resign crippling the public sector health services across the State,” said the Association’s organizing secretary Dr Indervir Singh Gill.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pcmsa-opposes-govt-s-plan-to-abolish-npa.html

39,04-1-20,1500 Haryana families to get benefit of Citizenship Act,"About 1500 families including one from Muslim community, who had came from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and are currently living in Haryana, have applied for Indian Citizenship.

“As per the data compiled by Haryana Government, there are around 1500 families of various religions, who have applied for Indian Citizenship.

These families, who faced religious persecution, would now be eligible for the citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA). There is only one family from Muslim Community among them while all others belong to other religions,” said Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal while addressing a press conference here on Friday.

According to the CAA, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh and Parsi migrants who have entered India illegally-that is, without a visa-on or before December 31, 2014 from the Muslim-majority countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and have stayed in the country for five years, are eligible to apply for Indian citizenship.

Manohar Lal, while defending the BJP led Central Government’s decision on CAA and proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) said, “India has provided all facilities to the minorities in the country but people of six faiths including Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh and Parsi migrants have faced persecution in three Islamic countries but Muslims haven't.

It was, therefore, decided to give immunity to such refugees in India.”

Lashing out at the opposition for its allegations that the new law is discriminatory against Muslims, the Chief Minister said that the Congress is only interested in vote bank politics and hence, misinforming people and spreading illusionary fear among minorities.

In the last five years, the Union Government has given citizenship to around 550 Muslims from various countries, who had sought for it, he added.

Responding to a question related to immigrants from Ahmadiyya Muslim community living in Haryana for several decades, Manohar Lal said that many of them have already been given citizenship and they are from good background… I can give verbal certificate that they are nationalists, he added.

When asked whether the Muslim family which is among 1500 others seeking Indian citizenship would be given the citizenship, the Chief Minister said that they would be given citizenship as per the criteria.

On being further asked if it is correct to exclude Muslims from CAA and indulge in discrimination against a particular religion, the Chief Minister said that any kind of discrimination is wrong in any country. But, Muslims haven't faced any kind of persecution in three Islamic countries namely Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh… They are in majority there, he said.

Commenting on NCR, he said that opposition parties are also doing politics on NCR. If we do not implement NRC in India and do not issue national identity card to the citizens, then the entry of intruders would become easier, the Chief Minister said.

We have accepted all the refugees who came in 1947.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Union Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani are also included in this. Even I, myself is one of such refugees, he added.

Pointing out the figures of minority in neighboring countries, the Chief Minister said that population of minority people in Pakistan has reduced to 3.7 percent from 23 percent of 1947.

It reduced to 7.9 percent from 22 percent in Bangladesh, he further added.

Notably, ever since the controversial Act came into effect in December last year, the anti-CAA protests have intensified across the nation, with some of them turning violent and leading to several deaths.

The Bharatiya Janta Party has decided to hold a massive public awareness campaign from January 5 onwards to dispel any widespread misconception regarding the CAA. The Chief Minister Manohar Lal is also scheduled to hold a meeting on January 5 in neighboring Punjab to address concerns about the CAA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/1500-haryana-families-to-get-benefit-of-citizenship-act.html

Announcing this while presiding over a high-level meeting of the Cooperative Department, the state Cooperation and Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Friday said that the beginning of computerization would be made from the cooperative societies of the border areas.

societies.

Stating this at his late afternoon press conference held on Friday DC, Palamu, Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said that 13 paddy procurement centres have been located and identified and FCI will do the paddy procurement.

He said the district administration is all determined to ensure a hassle free paddy business to the farmers. He said more than 6,000 farmers have got themselves registered for their paddy sale.

Paddy procurement goes slow for want of bags a problem that plagues paddy procurement centres every year, to which the DC said all efforts are on to ensure a smooth procurement of paddy and dearth of bags will not be allowed to take place.

Chief minister Hemant Soren in his very first Cabinet meeting had asked the DCs to update payment of wages to Aaganwadi sewikas and sahayeekas to which Agrahari said 2,515 sewikas and 2,255 sahayikas have been paid their wages now till October and billing for November and December is in full swing.

CM had asked for updating of all 8 types of pension about which DC said 40,397 pensioners have got their pension till October 2019. He said 106 new applications came in for pension our Tuesday camp held to gauge the pension scenario.

He said 375 pensioners have been found dead and against this vacancy the new aspirants will be inducted for which we have already got 106 new applications in our just one camp and we expect this number to rise further once the weather condition here improves and old people begin to visit our camps which are to be held on Tuesday and Thursday.

64,04-1-20,"Cold wave, erratic rainfall damage Rabi crops","Heightened cold wave with the dipping mercury and erratic rainfall that lashed several parts of the country damaged the ongoing standing rabi crops and vegetable cultivations. The steel and coal belt of Jharkhand was also whipped by the cold wave and downpour for past few weeks.

Weather experts attributed the cause of dipping mercury and rainfall at this time of the year to mainly the northern disturbance.

According to a Meteorological department official, heavy snowfall in northern India and rains due to the emergence of any Low-Pressure Area or depression over the Bay of Bengal are adding to the crispness of weather in Jharkhand. “The chill has intensified because of the strong and dry currents hits vegetations as well as standing rabi crops,” added the official.

The coal and steel belt of Jharkhand experienced a minimum of 4 to 6.5 degrees Celsius temperature from the past fortnight; this unexpected Celsius free fall has spurred the cold wave, he said.

A cold wave modified by ground frost and dense to very dense fog is now weighing in on ‘rabi crops’ including vegetations in several parts of the district. It harmed the standing ‘rabi crop’ too, said P Mahato an official (Agriculture) of Krishi Vigyan Kendra Bokaro.

“However, it is too early to estimate the damage from cold wave and rainfall. If the temperature goes below 4 degree Celsius and continues for more than 12 hours may cause huge damage to rabi crops and vegetations,” he added.

“Potato, tomato, Pea, including mustard and its varieties, and leafy vegetables in several hectares of cultivable land were wilt in the pricing cold and due to dense fog and rain, create huge loss (in several lakhs rupees) to the farmers of Paterwar, Nawadih, Chandrapura, Gomia, Chandankiyari blocks of the district; largely hits to the farmers of Lodhi, Chatrochati, Chhutu, Karikhurd, Chidri, Sidhawar, Hurlung and in other villages under Chatrochatti Police station at Bermo.

“If such condition continues for few more days it will effect in large across the district,” said Shankar Mahato a farmer of Gomia block.

Akash Oraon, a farmer from Chandankiyari block, said rain at this time will help in containing the fungal disease yellow rust, but hailstorm will destroy the crop.

Fog and ground frost strike mostly in tandem and have contrasting implications on Rabi crop. Though rabi wheat may be less sensitive to frost, other crops such as mustard, gram and pulses are known to be extremely sensitive, said an expert.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cold-wave--erratic-rainfall-damage-rabi-crops.html
65,04-1-20,LWE incidents on rise after polls,"Incidents triggered by Left Wing Extremist (LWE) groups have witnessed a sudden surge since the conclusion of the 2019 Assembly polls in State. While the CPI (Maoist) – the oldest and the most dreaded LWE group in Jharkhand – has made its presence felt in parts of the bordering areas of Hazaribag and Chatra, a splinter outfit has gone on a rampage in the highly-sensitive Palamu region.

On Thursday late evening, around seven armed insurgents torched at least six vehicles used for construction of a bridge over Damodar river in Hazaribag, police said. Meanwhile, rebels from the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), a banned splinter outfit of the CPI (Maoist), have set ablaze several vehicles – mostly used for construction works—in the Palamu region.

On Thursday night, the purported members of the CPI (Maoist) barged into the camp of a private construction company which got the Government’s tender for the construction of the bridge. They snatched mobile phones from the workers at the camp and set ablaze two poclain, two tractors and two drill machines, the staff of the construction company told cops at the Keredari Police Station.

The workers of the company had sought police protection after a group of rebels visited the construction site on November 22 and threatened them of dire consequences if the construction work continues. Police, too, had assured protection to the workers. “We had asked the workers to only work under police protection. They did not inform the police that they will be working on Thursday night,” said Hazaribag Superintendent of Police, Mayur Patel Kanhaiya Lal.

Police suspect that CPI (Maoist) might be behind the attack, said Lal, adding that the investigation is in process and further developments may come forth in the days to come. Meanwhile, TPC rebels left a trail of destruction by arson in Malhaan area close to the border of Latehar and Ranchi this week. They torched three heavy vehicles besides damaging a number of other vehicles parked at a railway construction site. In Palamu’s Munkeri village, the splinter group torched one hywa of a stone mines quarry and beat up its driver Akhilesh Yadav.

Jharkhand has witnessed a similar rise in LWE violence soon after the conclusion of the Lok Sabha elections last year. Several jawans from central forces sustained major injuries in Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts triggered by the CPI (Maoist) in parts of Kolhan division.

The Assembly elections for the 81 constituencies here were conducted in five phases, over a period of 20 days, due to LWE presence in the State. The Election Commission of India (ECI) cited a report of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to state the reason for the prolonged elections.

68,04-1-20,Jaipal Singh Munda remembered on 117th birth anniversary,"To commemorate the birth anniversary of visionary leader and sportsperson Jaipal Singh Munda, several programmes were organised across the State on Friday. At the residence of Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Ajun Munda a programme was organised to pay tributes to the leader.

On the occasion, the Minister said that the Constitution needs to assess the rights given to the tribals as the tribal societies cannot retain their rights without realizing their identities.

“The role played by Jaipal Singh Munda for the tribal society is unforgettable. As a member of the Constituent Assembly, he put the identities of the tribals extensively before the framers of the Constitution. And this is the reason that the tribal have different constitutional rights mentioned in the Constitution,” said Munda.

The tribal affairs minister further stated that Jaipal Singh Munda had a versatile personality and was known as Pramod in his village. “He was an ICS, a hockey player, a teacher, a leader and a social figure. He was the one to envisage a separate State of Jharkhand,” added Munda.

The Minister further stated that students should do a research on Jaipal Singh Munda and lectures should also be started on tribal leaders from across the country that have played an important role for the tribal society.

Former MLAs Vimla Pradhan and Shiv Shankar Oraon, Mayor Asha Lakra, newly elected MLA Naveen Jaiswal, Samit Lal, Deputy Mayor Sanjeev Vijaywargiya, former international hockey player Savitri Purti, National President of Bharat Munda Society Etwa Munda and several international hockey players were present on the occasion.

Meanwhile, on the 117th birth anniversary of ‘Marang Gomke’ Jaipal Singh Munda members of Central Sarna Committee garlanded his statue at the Jaipal Singh stadium and discussed his biography.

“Most of the Jharkhandis are either not aware or have forgotten the father of Jharkhand’s separate state movement. His idol in the stadium is lying neglected while the size of the stadium which is in his name is also shrinking which is like an insult to him,” said Jaglal Pahan.

General Secretary Krishna Kant said that it is very important to include the biography of the great men of Jharkhand in the school curriculum so that the coming generations can take inspiration from them.

Chairman of the Central Committee Bablu Munda said that Jaipal Singh Munda had contributed immensely for the tribal. “After coming to India, the leader instead of propagating Christianity formed the Adivasi Mahasabha in 1938 to fight for the rights of the tribal. He asked for a separate state out of Bihar,”

The chairman further added that the name plate on the statue inside the stadium has only Jaipal Singh written on it which is unfortunate for the tribal society.

Patron Ram Sahay Singh Munda said that a tribal college and stadium should be opened on a large scale in the village Takra while Jaipal Singh Munda’s birthday should be declared as a State holiday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jaipal-singh-munda-remembered-on-117th-birth-anniversary.html

70,04-1-20,Lies being spread on CAA to divide people: CM Rawat,"Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that those frustrated at being rejected by the people are bent upon carrying out their conspiracy to defame the Bharatiya Janata Party—led government at the Centre by spreading misinformation about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The Chief Minister said this while addressing the media at the circuit house in Almora on Friday. Rawat said that providing refuge to those in need was an old tradition in India.

He cited the quotes of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and other tall leaders in support of this aspect of Indian culture and ideals. He stressed that the CAA was to grant citizenship and not to take it from any Indian citizen. More than 200 persons had been identified in Uttarakhand for citizenship of which the majority are in Rishikesh, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar.

Citing data, he said that at the time of the creation of Pakistan, the Hindus comprised 23 per cent of the population which has now decreased to about 2.7 per cent.

On the other hand, the population of Muslims has grown in India since the nation gained independence. Rawat said that members of the minority communities are forcibly converted in Pakistan. Their children are forced into labour and child marriages.

The division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice Alok Kumar Verma has set the next date of hearing on January 9.

On Friday, the Central government counsel informed that court that both the Central and State governments were supposed to file the status of assets division on December 13, 2019 but neither of the governments had done so yet. Considering this, the court directed the Centre to submit an affidavit on January 9. The union had filed the PIL stating that the government was planning to impose the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) on them which is against the rules. The petitioner had stated that the Government has been forcing the roadways workers to go on strike. The State Government and transport corporation are neither regularising the workers, nor paying their salaries regularly, the union said, adding that the workers had not been paid their overtime for four years now. The union had reached an agreement on many occasions with the Government and the corporation regarding its demands. Despite this, the Government was prepared to impose ESMA on them.

While the State Government has to pay Rs 69 crore due to the transport corporation, the Uttar Pradesh transport corporation has to pay Rs 700 crore to the Uttarakhand transport corporation.

Stating that if the Government and corporation recover their dues, the problems of the Uttarakhand transport corporation would be resolved with the amount due from Uttar Pradesh, the union had stated that imposing ESMA on them is not justified.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/file-affidavit-in-pil-by-roadways-union--hc-to-centre.html

87,04-1-20,‘Cong needs strong local leadership’,"The decisive victory of the ‘Mahagatbandhan’ in Jharkhand (JMM, Congress and RJD) is an important turning point in State and National electoral politics, say political experts. Now a pattern is evident- affirmation of the regional political parties in State matters, and ascendance of local issues and people’s aspirations over lofty sloganeering generally at the national level. Two adjacent maps depicting the slump of BJP in the states since a peak in 2017 was the common features of almost all the newspapers, they added.

One is tempted to read in the Jharkhand results a decisive “no” for supposedly populist move to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, verdict on the Ayodhya dispute and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 – all part of the BJP’s Hindutva agenda, said a senior Congress leader.

“The portents are, however, more ominous. Jharkhand is the fifth State after Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan to deny power to BJP. People want to show how disappointed are they at the abject failure of BJP in addressing real issues in their lives- poverty, scarcity, price-rise, increasingly difficult living conditions in cities and villages alike, and joblessness with no ray of hope in sight. To this adds the precarious agriculture situation- steadily decreasing returns from agriculture, abysmally slow change for the better. Significantly, these contributing factors have major implications for the upcoming Delhi and Bihar elections and, may be, for national politics,” he added.

Congress insiders said that the contributing factors for BJP’s defeat and victory of the JMM-Congress-RJD combine are rooted in the ability of the winners to touch the soul of the people. “After a long time, Congress has been able to discover its roots and connect with the people of the State. This should herald in the real sense the resurgence of Congress. One of the architects of this rejuvenation, veteran Subodhkant Sahay, should take heart from the fact that he withstood the Modi-Shah carpet bombing with aplomb. The defeated Modi-Shah combine has conceded that the absence of an effective leadership at the local level had been their major failing. All the recent State election results have shown clearly that para-landing of leaders from other places does not in any manner compensate the effectiveness of a strong local leader,” said a leader.

“Mahagathbandhan’s facile victory is in no small measure a result of Sahay’s meticulous planning based on his acute understanding of the social dynamics of the region. His well thought strategy to approach people at the roots and avoid pomp and show paid him rich dividends. A key matter was the transfer of tribal land to Adani and the consequential economic deprivation of the adivasis. Sahay, craftily articulated party’s concern and reaped results. It goes to his credit that he did not waste either energy or time in raising high edifices of nationalist ideals which do not answer the call of hunger and provide any solace to the socially-economically deprived common Jharkhandi Adivasi. Sahay is from Ranchi and has spent a lifetime of his political career in intervening and mediating in social and political issues of importance for the state of Jharkhand,” said another leader.

“The diminutive but extremely effective method of reading peoples’ psyche, identifying critical fundamental issues affecting them and then accessing people directly or through meaningful social groups was Sahay’s master strategy which floored BJP’s money and manpower,” he said.

BJP was not able to read the irksome mood of the people against the undemocratic arrests of Adivasis who participated in the ‘Pathalgadi Movement,’ the misadventure of pushing amendments to the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) Act and Santhal Parganas Tenancy (SPT) and the passage of the divisive Religious Freedom Bill, 2017, said Congress insiders.

It is also the general feeling among the key political analysts that the bonding together of Mahagathbandhan and its joint political strategy became possible due primarily to the trust reposed and reciprocated by Sahay, said sources.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---cong-needs-strong-local-leadership---.html
88,04-1-20,Special arrangements at Bhagwan Birsa Zoo to keep animals warm,"As mercury continues to dip, a slew of measures have been taken to keep the animals warm at the Bhagwan Birsa Zoological Park also known as Birsa Jaivik Udyaan. Special arrangements have been made to give the animals a warm environment along with dietary supplements to avoid any health problems in the winter months.

“With biting cold being experienced in Ranchi, various steps have been taken to protect the animals in the severe winter months. Heaters have been installed in the cages along with the windows that have been covered with jute curtains and gunny bags. As compared to any other time of the year, in winters the animals are also given more food,” said Director of Birsa Zoological Park, D. Venkateshwarlu.

Preparations for winter are generally started around the beginning of November and the arrangements are in use till about the end of January or as required. One of the most important initiatives taken is towards environmental management

“Steps are being taken to make changes in the housing system of the animals, especially those which live individually in a cell at night like lions, tigers and leopards. Wooden planks and paddy straws are spread on the floor. Electric heaters are also installed at a safe distance from the cage to keep them warm,” said Birsa Zoological Park– Veterinary doctor, Dr. Ajay Kumar.

To prevent from the cold wind in the evenings, all the windows and ventilators are covered with jute curtains and gunny bags. Apart from keeping the retiring rooms warm and cozy, changes are also made in the regular diet of the inmates.

“In winters, there is an increase in the appetite of the animals so high energy food is given which also enables them to fight the cold,” added Kumar.

For the big cats and carnivores supplements of Vitamin A, D3 and E are given. Herbivore animals which are not kept in shelter rooms identify spots near trees to keep themselves warm at night around which hay and paddy straws are spread out.

“In addition to the routine diet, herbivorous animals are given food rich in vitamin C and high carbohydrate content along with jaggery and mahua. Animals like elephants and deer are also fed sugarcane during winters. Fruits like amla and guava are also added to their food,” said the doctor.

At present the zoo houses 85 different species of animals including birds, mammals and reptiles. Currently there are about 1315 animals and birds like Black Panther, a pair of Asiatic lions, albino black buck, Himalayan black bears and sloth bears which are always a treat to watch.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/special-arrangements-at-bhagwan-birsa-zoo-to-keep-animals-warm.html

99,04-1-20,Police nab 7 men planning robbery in Doon,"Seven men planning to carry out a robbery in Dehradun were arrested on Thursday by the police before they could commit the crime.

The deputy inspector general of police (DIG)/ Dehradun senior superintendent of police Arun Mohan Joshi ordered formation of a team after information was received from Rishikesh about a group of men from Uttar Pradesh planning to carry out a robbery possibly in Dehradun after failing to rob a jewellery shop in Rishikesh.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Joshi said that inspector-in-charge of Rishikesh received information that some people from Saharanpur had planned to rob a jeweller's shop in Rishikesh. However, because they could not succeed, they might try somewhere else- possibly in Dehradun.

The police were informed that the men could be travelling in a black car and a red/black motorcycle to Dehradun, following which the police stepped up checks. The police caught four men- Sanjay Kumar, Farman, Ravi Kumar and Anuj. The leader of the gang Sanjay Kumar told the police during questioning that his business was not doing well and he was under considerable debt, so he had planned to carry out robbery with his friends. They were planning to pose as representatives of some fake company and offer to double money and transfer it from the company’s dead account to the account of their target who was identified as a person with considerable cash.

They had planned to seek half of the amount from the target first and after the person showed the cash, they would then rob the target at gun point.

They had carried out part of their plan at a jewellery shop in Rishikesh some days ago but some of the gang members did not come to rob at gun point citing strict police checking in the town.

Then, they planned to attempt the same in Dehradun but were caught by the police before they could carry out their plan. While four of the men were arrested initially, the police later arrested the three other members of the gang- Puran Ahuja, Devendra and Pandit. According to Sanjay Kumar he was introduced to a man called Pandit who hails from Dehradun, who later called him here to rob target after failing in Rishikesh.

The police are also investigating the case to ascertain if more persons were involved in the conspiracy to rob. “More information will be collected from the jeweller whom they tried to rob in Rishikesh.

We are working on collecting more evidence about it. We will also interrogate the person from Dehradun who was involved with them,” said Joshi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-nab-7-men-planning-robbery-in-doon.html

101,04-1-20,Malls in City insist on charging for carry bags,"A shopping mall at Saheed Nagar attending a negotiation meeting for a second time at the District Consumer Dispute Redresssal Forum here on Friday insisted that it would not supply carry bags free of cost to its customers.

Thus, the aggrieved customer, Bobin Mohany, has decided to file a case against the mall at the District Consumer Court, Khordha with all supported documents and records of hearing of Consumer Court of other States in these regards.

Notably, Mohanty, a resident of Saheed Nagar, recently lodged a complaint at the forum at Khandagiri alleging that the mall had taken Rs 10 from him for giving a carry bag to take a saree he bought from it. The forum set December 17 for resolving the matter mutually and asked both the parties to remain present during the hearing.

Accordingly, Mohanty and a lawyer representing the shopping mall attended the hearing. While Mohanty said shopping malls should not charge for carry bags and cited that the Consumer Commission in Chandigarh had imposed a fine on a shopping mall for charging for a carry bag, the mall’s lawyer said that this judgment would not be implemented in Odisha. However, he sought time to contact the head office of the mall at Mumbai. The forum then posted the matter till January 3.

On Friday, the counsel of the mall insisted that his client has decided not to supply carry bags free-of-cost in the State. He also denied to accept Mohanty’s contention that malls in Chandigarh are supplying carry bags for customer satisfaction and, as such, the concerned mall should follow suit.

After the lawyer’s refusal, Mohanty has now decided to file a case against the shopping mall at the District Consumer Forum, Khordha.

“There can’t be separate laws in different States. In the interest of common people, I will file a case against the shopping mall,” said Mohanty.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/malls-in-city-insist-on-charging-for-carry-bags.html
102,04-1-20,"Rain, cold wave hit life hard in State","Even as rain and cold threw normal life out of gear in the State, the Regional Office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) here on Friday forecasted that light to moderate rainfall or thundershower is very likely to occur at many places across the State for the next three days.

This would subsequently lead to fall in minimum temperature as soon as the rain subsides, said the weather office.

In view of the situation, the Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) has advised the district Collectors to ensure that the farmers shift their harvested paddy to safe places and properly store it as to avoid any loss or damage due to rain. Also, necessary measures should be taken by farmers to protect the paddy in mandis, if any, against rain.

Besides, the SRC has directed to keep all shelters, school buildings open at night for homeless and needy people to protect them from the cold condition.

On Thursday and Friday, moderate to heavy rainfall under the impact of a trough line lashed several parts of the State causing damage to standing crops and harvested paddy stocked in farmlands and mandis.

There were reports on damage to paddy crops in Baleswar, Nuapada, Subarnapur and several other districts. Farmers have reportedly suffered considerable losses, as the rain damaged standing crops, along with harvested paddy stocks stashed in open fields.

State revenue and disaster management minister Sudam Marndi said that the Collectors have been asked to make a thorough assessment of the affected areas and then the extent of crop damage, if any, would be ascertained.

According to the latest forecast, there would be a fall in minimum or night temperature by 4 to 5 degree Celsius after 48 hours. Light to moderate rain or thundershower is very likely to occur at many places over the districts of north Odisha, Kandhamal, Koraput, Nuapada, Malkangiri, Sonepur and at a few places over the rest of the districts.

The IMD has also warned of thunderstorm with lightning at some places in Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Dhenkanal, Angul, Bhadrak, Baleswar, Jajpur, Koraput, Cuttack, Khordha, Subarnapur, Boudh and Sundargarh districts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rain--cold-wave-hit-life-hard-in-state.html
103,04-1-20,Amarinder supports Kerala Assembly resolution against CAA,"Taking exception to the Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s remarks on the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA), Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday come out in support of the resolution passed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly seeking amendment to the controversial Act terming it the “voice of the people”, and urging the Centre to heed the same.

In an open letter to the Union Law Minister, the Chief Minister countered the former’s recent remarks in which he had “discounted the position being taken by some of the States against the CAA” and “called upon such politicians to seek appropriate legal advice before taking such a stand”.

Asserting that the said States had already taken the necessary legal advice, Capt Amarinder said that the Kerala Assembly’s resolution represented the will and wisdom of the people, as spoken through their elected representatives.

“Such MLAs represent the voice of the people at large,” he said, adding that it was not only a matter of parliamentary privilege but the constitutional duty of those representatives to make known such views.

Declaring that as heads of responsible State Governments, “we are neither naive nor misguided”, the Chief Minister said that laws could not be forcibly imposed on citizens, and like all powers, even the parliamentary power, was coupled with the duty to exercise it responsibly.

“By insisting that only Parliament under Article 245 had the legislative power to pass laws as regards Citizenship, and not the State Governments, the Law Minister has entirely missed the point of the resolution passed by the Kerala Legislative Assembly…It has not passed any citizenship law,” he said while urging the Central Government (through Parliament where it now has a majority) to amend the CAA.

“Surely, you, both as Minister of Law as well as a lawyer, know that the resolution is rightly directed, as it is Parliament which must amend or repeal such law based on a proposal or Bill mooted by the Government of India,” Capt Amarinder quipped.

The Chief Minister also took a dig to the Law Minister’s remarks reminding the States of their “constitutional” duty to implement such laws. The leaders of such States had won their elections and taken oaths of office under the Constitution of India, he noted.

Drawing the Minister’s attention to the Preamble of the Constitution, Capt Amarinder reminded him that he was a lawyer, and should know that the word ‘Secular’ was one of the three words specifically introduced into the Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976. Given that the very fabric of our Constitution requires secular conduct, the Minister was actually asking the States to abide by the very foundation of the Constitution, he observed.

Capt Amarinder dubbed the Union Minister’s continuous disclaimer that the CAA does not in any manner affect Indian Muslims as “a public or political stand which you are forced to take out of compulsion of office”.

“Surely (and again as a lawyer yourself) you would be alive to the raging debate that the CAA fails the test of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees to all persons equality before law and equal protection of laws, irrespective of their religion,” said the Chief Minister.

If the CAA seeks to protect religious persecution, such protection should be available to persons of all religious minorities, from all countries where people may face religious persecution, he emphasized, citing the example of Uganda as a country from where Hindus were ousted during the Idi Amin regime.

Citing Punjab’s sensitive border location, Capt Amarinder also expressed another serious concern with respect to CAA, noting that Act’s language “does even require that any illegal migrant seeking its benefit need be of Indian origin in any manner”.

“All they have to be is from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan,” he pointed out, adding that this could be a citizen or even a resident, or even a temporary person in transit through these countries.

“Since CAA has no requirement of being of Indian origin or having to prove any such origins, this means that any person claiming to be of the six religions could simply apply in terms of the amended law, prove entry on or before the cut-off date and be eligible for citizenship. This could, in fact, be misused for infiltration into our country, particularly in the border states, converting this misguided legislation into a national security threat,” said Capt Amarinder in his letter.

Referring to the NRC, on which conflicting statements had been emerging from the Central Government, “which generates no confidence whatsoever”, Capt Amarinder pointed out that when read along with CAA, it would automatically deprive many (if not all) Indian Muslims of the rights of citizenship.

“The fear that laws can be mutilated, shredded and discarded overnight to suit political objectives is naturally a legitimate concern of many right minded citizens of our country,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amarinder-supports-kerala-assembly-resolution-against-caa.html

106,04-1-20,"Son folllows Dhindsa’s footsteps, resigns as SAD legislative wing leader","SAD leader Parminder Singh Dhindsa, it seems, has finally decided to follow footsteps of his father and SAD’s Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who has already raised a banner of revolt against the party and the Badals after resigning from all party posts in September 2018 and joined hands with a Akali faction — SAD Taksali.

Parminder, who is party MLA from Lehra Gaga, on Friday submitted a simple one-line resignation with the SAD president Sukhbir Badal as the leader of party’s legislative wing, without specifying any reason. Sukhbir, who has all along been claiming Parminder’s support even as his father was openly speaking against the party, wasted no time in accepting the resignation.

At the same time, Sukhbir announced that former Minister and party MLA from Sahnewal, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, will now hold the post of legislative party leader.

Parminder Dhindsa, who was appointed the leader of legislative party in August 2018, has gone incommunicado after his father decided to side with the Taksali splinter group to celebrate the Akali Dal’s 99th foundation day on December 14 instead of SAD (Badal) event.

The former Finance Minister, Parminder strategically chose to stay away from both the events.

He also gave a miss to the party’s protest dharna in Chief Minister’s home city, Patiala, December 21. Claiming that junior Dhindsa is by his side, Sukhbir had then defended him saying that Parminder had taken his permission to go to Mumbai for urgent work.

Only recently, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had opened front against the SAD leadership, especially its president Sukhbir Badal “to liberate Akali Dal” from the Badal family and “revive its lost glory”.

He had made clear his intent to slug it out with the party’s top leadership “while staying in the party” while at the same time, daring the party leadership to “expel” him.

Veteran Akali leader had even openly demanded Sukhbir’s resignation as the party president to restore democracy in the party, while declaring the SAD’s presidential election as “undemocratic” and “unconstitutional”.

“I will protest while staying in the party. I will not resign…If the party wants to expel me, they can do it,” he had stated after a workers’ meeting at Sangrur on December 18.

Dhindsa had then also claimed that his son is also with him in his fight. “Parminder is my son and he will go with me,” Dhindsa had said while maintaining that he had no personal fight with anyone but against the way the party is functioning at present.

Rajya Sabha MP has been maintaining a distance with the party leadership since more than a year after he resigned from the party posts in September 2018.

It was only on December 14 (Saturday) that he openly came out against the parent Akali Dal by joining its splinter faction, SAD Taksali, to commemorate SAD’s 99th foundation day.

SAD Taksali came into being just ahead the 2017 state assembly elections with a call to liberate Akali Dal from the control of the Badals and has all along been claiming to be a “real Akali Dal”.

Now, Dhindsa has joined hands with the taksali faction which already has the Akali stalwarts former MP Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, former MP Ratan Singh Ajnala, former state Minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan, among others.

Notably, the five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal is maintaining a distance from the party functioning owing to his bad health, and Sukhbir Badal is running the show.

Ahead the 2017 election, SAD passed through its worst ever political crisis with the party’s old guard raising its voice against the functioning of the party’s current “young” leadership, and questioning the party’s role in the Akal Takht pardon to Sirsa-based Dera sect head Ram Rahim Singh, and series of sacrilege incidents. One by one, the traditional Akali leaders left the SAD’s sinking ship.

The Badal father-son duo had ruled Punjab for a decade, until they were ousted by the Congress in 2017.

When on a winning spree, everyone appreciated Sukhbir’s election management skill, accrediting a shift from SAD’s style of traditional panthic politics to the one based on development agenda.

But the series of sacrilege incidents and the related firing incidents, coupled with SAD-administered apology to Dera Sacha Sauda chief, had hurt SAD’s image to a large extent, with its own leaders going against the party. Party’s resounding defeat in 2017 polls was also attributed to the same reasons.

At its lowest ebb, the Akali Dal has been trying hard to make its way back among the Sikh masses. Various panthic leaders and organizations, besides the rebel taksali Akalis, have been raising their voice to free SAD from the “clutches of the Badals”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/son-folllows-dhindsa---s-footsteps--resigns-as-sad-legislative-wing-leader.html

116,04-1-20,CWC runs pillar to post to clear hospital bill of 1-year-old,"After failing to get any financial support from the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC), members of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) — a judicial body constituted under the Juvenile Justice Act — are running pillar to post to pay the hospital bill for treatment of a one-year-old child who fell in an open drain and sustained critical injuries, CWC members said on Friday.

The CWC addressed a letter to the Ranchi Municipal Commissioner Manoj Kumar on December 6 seeking monetary assistance for treatment of the child. However, the CWC claims that RMC officials did not even bother to respond to the letter. CWC member, Tanushree Sarkar said that the committee expected some assistance from the RMC on humanitarian grounds as the incident occurred due to an uncovered drain, and it was RMC’s responsibility to keep such accidents at bay. The Pioneer has a copy of the letter.

“It is not CWC’s responsibility to bear the expenses of the child’s treatment. But we are still trying our level best. On our request, Rani Children Hospital agreed to provide the best possible treatment to the child. The hospital authorities also agreed to discharge him on our assurance that the hospital bill will be paid,” said Sarkar. The CWC has to now seek donations in order to pay the hospital bill of Rs.81,770 as there are no funds in the committee’s treasury, she added. On Friday, Malayalee Association, a Ranchi-based civil society organization donated a sum of Rs.41,000 to the CWC for clearing the hospital bill.

The child, Akhil Oraon, fell in an open drain in Lalpur on December 4, while his mother was washing clothes at a nearby hand pump. The incident hogged media attention as the child had a narrow escape from the clutches of death. “The incident could have proved fatal. The child might have succumbed to his injuries if we did not ensure quality medical assistance at that time,” said Sarkar.

Akhil’s accident was the third reported in a year in Ranchi. Earlier in 2019, four-year-old Falak died after falling in an open drain and getting washed away. On August 22, seven-year-old Pappu fell in an open drain. However, locals came to his rescue and fished out the boy from the filth and stench of the drain.

Municipal Commissioner Manoj Kumar could not be reached over phone on Friday. Ranchi Deputy Mayor Sanjiv Vijaywargiya said that the RMC could not disburse any financial assistance as the Model Code of Conduct was enforced in Jharkhand when the incident occurred. “I am unaware of any letter sent by the CWC. I will have to check with the RMC officials. The Commissioner is on leave. Let him return, I will have a word with him,” Vijaywargiya said.

Deputy Municipal Commissioner Shankar Yadav admitted that the RMC had received a letter from the CWC regarding the same. However, he said that there were no provisions of bearing hospital expenses of such accident survivors under the Act. “There is no provision under the Act. However, helping on humanitarian grounds is a subjective choice. It may vary from person to person,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cwc-runs-pillar-to-post-to-clear-hospital-bill-of-1-year-old.html

The student, Mustafizur Rahman said on Friday that he wanted nothing but an “unconditional apology” in public from the BJP leader.

The Union Minister returned the fire by accusing Rahman of being a “serial offender” and saying that he “does not need to apologise to fools”. Supriyo also said that his comments had nothing to do with the student's religion. The matter came to light on December 26 when Supriyo shared a post on the social media advocating CAA and criticised the act of a female JU student, who tore up the first page of the contentious legislation at the annual convocation of the university while receiving her gold medal on December 24.

The next day Rahman commented on Supriyo's Facebook post and questioned the educational qualifications of Supriyo and BJP state president Dilip Ghosh.

“Babul-da (dada) how educated are people like you can be gauged from the fact that your mentor (state president) Dilip Ghosh spots gold in cow milk,” Rahman said in his comment on Supriyo's post.

To this Supriyo retored “Mustafizur Rahaman let me first pack you off to your country, then will send the reply in post card”. The comment triggered a wave of protests. Rahman, who is a final year student of chemistry at a college at Ilambazar in Birbhum district, in a prompt rejoinder said, “I am in possession of enough proof about my identity as Indian and Bengali. You don't know how to respect Bengalis and still you are the MP of the state.....

Leader of the Opposition in the UP Legislative Assembly, Ram Goving Chaudhary, said their party would also give compensation to the kin of those jailed or killed during anti-CAA protests in the State.

“If our party comes to power at the Centre and in UP, they (protesters) will be given pension as they have struggled to save the Constitution and the democracy,” said Chaudhary responding to a question.

He said they protect all those who seek refuge from them. “Jo humari sharan mein aa gaye woh humari sharan mein hain. Hum sabki raksha karney wale log hain,” the senior SP leader told mediapersons here.

Referring to remarks of state BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should stay in Pakistan for a month to understand atrocities being on Hindus, the senior SP leader said the Narendra Modi-led Union government was out to divert people's attention from real issues.

Anyone raising a question is being asked to go to Pakistan, he alleged. Later, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma lashed out at the Samjawadi Party, saying, “It is in the DNA of that party to honour the rioters and anti-socials.” “They had also tried to withdraw cases against terrorists in the past and the court had to intervene. It is unfortunate that SP leaders are speaking about giving citizenship rights to the Bangladeshis and Rohangiyas,” Sharma alleged.

Commenting on SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's statement that he would not fill form for the National Population Register, the UP deputy CM said,” Perhaps, he is not aware that the NPR is the basis of all development schemes.

127,04-1-20,PM betrayed people of K’taka in a big way: Siddaramaiah,"Former Chief Minister Siddaramaia on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of betraying Karnataka in a “big way” by not announcing any flood relief for the State during his two day visit, despite the mandate given to him by the people during the Lok Sbha polls.

There was expectation from the people that Modi would announce something to the effect, but he 'did not utter a word on it,”

He recalled that during the previous election, Modi had said that if BJP comes to power at both at State and the centre, the doors of good fortune will open for Karnataka.

“Forget about opening the doors of good fortune, he did not even open the doors of his house to the leaders of his own party, Siddaramaiah said.

Speaking to reporters here, he pointed out that the people of Karnataka had elected 25 BJP MPs during the Lok Sabha polls.

“With 25 MPs and with their own Chief Minister, all we got was Rs 1,200 crore (flood relief).

Thats why I call Yediyurappa a weak CM...He should have demanded for about Rs 36,000 crore estimated from centre and for declaration of floods as national disaster, but he didnt have the courage, he said.

Modi had begun his two-day visit to Karnataka on Thursday, which he ended after attending various programmes at both Tumakuru and Bengaluru. Noting that Modi should have at least given an assurance to examine the States demand of adequate flood relief, Siddaramaiah said the Prime Minister had not responded to it despite Yediyurappa raising the issue, which showed his “neglect” towards Karnataka.

“...People of the state voted for Modi, but today Modi has betrayed Karnataka in a big way, he said. As many as 103 taluks in 22 districts of Karnataka were affected due to unprecedented floods in August, in which over 80 people were killed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-betrayed-people-of-k---taka-in-a-big-way--siddaramaiah.html

The clarification came a day after Yediyurappa sought the Centres help while addressing the 'Krishi Karman' awards event in Tumakuru, which Modi attended.

Yediyurappa said he had urged the Prime Minister to grant more funds for relief work, scientific and remunerative price for farm produce, and special fund of Rs 50,000 crore for speeding up of on-going irrigation works.

As it was a farmers meet, I felt it worthy and timely to plead with the Prime Minister for more funds for all the developmental activities in the state,” he added.

131,04-1-20,Didi asks Modi: Are you Pak ambassador?,"In a blistering attack on Narendra Modi for “frequently invoking Pakistan as a diversionary tactic from major issues of unemployment, price rise and people’s rights” Mamata Banerjee on Friday said the Prime Minister was conducting himself as though he was an “ambassador of Pakistan.”

Launching her first citizenship rally in North Bengal city of Siliguri the Chief Minister told a massive turnout of humanity how “India wants to listen about Hindustan and not Pakistan.”

She said “we are Indian citizens and we do not want to listen about Pakistan which is a small country of only 22 crore people… Whenever the people of India raise questions about unemployment, inflation and hunger you start talking about Pakistan. By doing so you only glorify an insignificant country … I want to ask you: Are you the Prime Minister of India or the Ambassador of Pakistan? Why do you always glorify that country?

“We don’t want to listen about Pakistan. Tell us about Hindustan,” Banerjee thundered from the head of an “unexpectedly big” rally — considering the fact that the Trinamool Congress had in the April-May parliamentary elections conceded 7 out of 8 Lok Sabha seats to the BJP from this part of the State.

Going all guns blazing the Chief Minister targeted both the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah for “making contradictory statements” on the amended citizenship laws saying “who is to be believed when one person says National Citizenship Register was never discussed in the Government level while the other says NRC will definitely be invoked.”

She said “it is a shame that even after 70 years of Independence, we have to prove our citizenship,” adding “till she was at the helm “I will not allow anyone to take away the rights of the Indian people… There will be no CAA, no NRC, no NPR in Bengal.”

The Prime Minister had earlier attacked the opposition parties for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act but not raising their voices against Pakistan which was formed on the basis of religion and where the minorities like the Hindus were subjected untold persecution so that “they are forced to migrate to India.”

Giving a sharp reply the Chief Minister wanted to know whether Modi had forgotten about India. “Have you (Prime Minister) forgotten about

India that you need to talk about Pakistan regularly? We are a big country with a rich cultural heritage. We do we have to be compared with Pakistan so regularly?” Banerjee asked.

Asking all the parties to come together to protest against CAA-NRC Banerjee said “today if you do not come out in protest, then these people will destroy Hindustan, will destroy Azadi (freedom). Our religion is to protect our Azadi, our tradition,” appealing to the Opposition parties to consider the present movement as “our second fight for Azadi.”

Meanwhile, the Left Front leaders on Friday asked the Chief Minister to call an all-party meeting on the CAA-NRC issue. CPI(M)’s legislature party leader Sujan Chakrabarty said “we have no problem to join an all-party meeting but the Chief Minister has to call that at first.”

The Railway Minister was speaking at IMC Centre at Churchgate in south Mumbai while launching BJP's 10-day-long campaign aimed at mobilising support for the CAA.

“Ever since the Citizen Amendment Act was passed in the Parliament, they (opposition) started spreading wrong perception (about it) in the country. They tried to instigate youngsters and spread violence at different places,” Goyal said.

“I believe the Congress has become a directionless party. I would like to appeal to the Congress that it should not spread rumours and violence. It should give priority to the interest of the country and people, and keep humanity at top,” he said.

Goyal alleged that in order to protect its own political interests, the Congress was misleading a specific class of people and trying to spread fear and instability in the country over the CAA.

“Congress has slowly lost its supremacy in every state and it is forming Governments in many states as junior partners,” he said, adding that in Maharashtra the party won just 44 seats despite contesting on 140-150 seats.

140,04-1-20,Cong to bring resolution against CAA implementation in Assam: Tarun Gogoi,"Former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on Friday said the Congress will bring a resolution during the special one-day session of the Assam Legislative Assembly on January 13 to ensure that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not implemented in the State.

The resolution will make a plea to ensure that the Assam Accord is not violated or diluted in any way by the CAA which should not be implemented in the state, Gogoi told reporters here.

""The Assam Accord must be implemented in letter and spirit and should not be diluted in any way. The CAA has violated the Accord and the Preamble of our Constitution, leading to widespread agitations across the country"", he said.

The stir demanding CAA's withdrawal is not confined to Assam alone but even in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Varanasi constituency where Section 144 has been imposed, Gogoi said.

The special session of the state assembly has been called on January 13 for constitutional ratification of the extension of reservations for scheduled tribes and castes.

""There is no dispute on this ratification and we support it.

""If the ruling BJP brings the resolution against the implementation of CAA, we will support it but if they do not, then we will place it in the house"", Gogoi, who is fourth term MLA, said.

Assam is passing through a critical period and this issue must be discussed in the house, the former cm said.

Protests against the CAA in Assam is by all sections of people and has been democratic so far but the government led by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has adopted repressive measures to curb it, he said.

Congress members and other agitators are being put behind the bars with KMSS leader Akhil Gogoi arrested, handcuffed and the way he was treated as a criminal made the Assam Human Rights Commission take cognisance of it, he added.

The BJP has adopted a ""double standard"" on the foreigners' issue but ""we are very clear that anyone who has come after March 24, 1971 should be detected and deported and this means even those who have come during our tenure"".

The BJP accuses the Congress of doing vote bank politics on the issue but ""when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Prime Minister and I was the Chief Minister, they wanted to issue work permits to the illegal foreigners"", he said.

""The BJP then wanted to give permits to both Hindus and Muslims but now they want to give it only to the Hindus"", Gogoi added.

He accused the chief minister of betraying people of the state who had voted for him with love and trust, but now he does not listen to the voice of the people.

""He is the greatest betrayer. He was once given the title of 'Jatiya Nayak' (Peoples' Hero) but now he is considered as 'Jatiya Shatru' (Peoples' enemy)"", the three time former chief minister said.

Responding to a query on Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the Congress leader said, ""forget him. He moves to whoever is in power. He is a professional singer who sings to the tune of those in power"".

""The BJP's arrogance will bring them down. They are undemocratic and are determined to destroy the unity and integrity of the nation"", he added.

Gogoi accused the BJP government of failing to protect the language and culture of the state, and added the country was in a mess- both politically and economically.

Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Ripun Bora and Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia were also present on the occasion.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-to-bring-resolution-against-caa-implementation-in-assam--tarun-gogoi.html
141,04-1-20,Fresh plea filed in SC challenging constitutional validity of CAA,"A fresh plea has been filed by an NGO in the Supreme Court challenging the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, claiming that it is violative of fundamental rights granted under the Constitution and needs to be set aside.

The plea filed by NGO Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) and others also sought a direction to the Centre to refrain from preparing the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The NGO also sought interim stay on the CAA saying it would lead to irreversible consequences as the citizenship once granted cannot be reversed and such a person cannot be rendered stateless retrospectively, even if the disputed Act and notifications are declared unconstitutional subsequently.

""The petitioners herein are challenging the impugned Act as well as the impugned provisions and the impugned notifications, as being violative of Articles 13, 14, 15, 21, 51(c) and 51-A of the Constitution of India. It is submitted that the impugned Act, the impugned provisions and the impugned notifications are manifestly arbitrary and ought to be set aside..."" the plea said.

It said the CAA makes professing of certain religions as a ground of eligibility for the status of citizenship which is against the principle of secularism and is violative of the basic structure of the constitution.

The NGO, while challenging the CAA on various other grounds, said, ""the impugned Act and the impugned notifications are discriminatory as it is directed against Muslims on the basis of their religion and place of birth"".

In its plea, the NGO said, ""if the provisions of the CAA are operationalized and the NRC is prepared, several undocumented Indians will become stateless and therefore, it is submitted that this Court maybe pleased to direct the Respondent Union of India from refraining to prepare NRC arbitrarily"".

The petition filed through advocate Ejaz Maqbool have also challenged Section 3(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, terming it as ""arbitrary"" and unconstitutional.

It said section 3(1) lays down different parameters for granting citizenship to children born in India in different periods.

Section 3(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, grants citizenship to children born in India in different periods in three different scenarios.

In the first scenario — children born in India on or after January 26, 1950 but before July 1,1987, were entitled to Indian Citizenship by birth.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fresh-plea-filed-in-sc-challenging-constitutional-validity-of-caa.html

143,04-1-20,Nobody can be denied C’ship on ground of religion: Paswan,"Union Minister and BJP ally Ram Vilas Paswan on Friday said no Government can snatch away citizenship of any Indian and sought to reassure people over a number of citizenship measures which have triggered protests in various parts of the country.

""Be it Dalits, tribals, backwards, minorities of upper castes, they are all original citizens of the country. Citizenship is their birthright. No Government can snatch it away. No Indian citizen will be bothered unnecessarily,"" Paswan said.

As far as National Register of Citizens is concerned, there has been no discussion on it but it has nothing to with any religion, he said, adding that nobody can be denied citizenship on the ground of religion Paswan said social justice and secularism are his party's mission, and he has fought for the rights of Dalits, tribals, backwards and minorities for his entire life. ""Leave alone citizenship, no government can raise a question about their rights,"" he said.

In his tweets, Paswan said confusion is being spread across the country about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as part of a conspiracy.

Muslims have no reason to worry about the law as it has nothing to do with Indian citizens, he said.

Muslims have constituted a bulk of protestors agitating against the CAA.

He noted that the NRC was conceptualised in 2003 and the UPA Government which was in power during 2004-14 never repealed it and the then Home Minister P Chidambaram had in fact said that the NRC will be a subset of the NPR (National Population Register).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nobody-can-be-denied-c---ship-on-ground-of-religion--paswan.html
144,04-1-20,Politics meaningless without religion: Nadda,"Terming religion as a “code of conduct” which guides people, BJP working president JP Nadda on Friday said politics was meaningless without religion.

Addressing devotees of Swaminarayan sect at a function here, Nadda also said politics needs religion the most.

“Samaaj mein ye prashna baar baar khada hota hai ki rajniti ka dharma se sambandh kya hai. Mera ye manana hai ki rajniti dharma ke bagair vivek-heen hai, uska koi arth nahi hai. Rajniti hamesha dharma ke sath chalti hai.

(One question is frequently asked in the society: what is the relation between religion and politics? I firmly believe that politics would become wisdom-less without the presence of religion. There is no meaning of politics without religion. They both go together),” Nadda said.

“Aur dharma ka matlab hai code of conduct. Dharma ka matlab hai kya karna aur kya nahi karna. Dharma ka matlab hai kya uchit aur kya anuchit. Aur iss liye dharma ki sabse badi avashyakta hai toh woh rajniti mein hai. (Religion means code of conduct. It tells us what to do and what not to. Religion stands for wisdom to differentiate between what is good and what is not. It is the politics which needs religion the most),” Nadda said.

“And BJP always works with such positivity and do things which are good for the country and society,” he added.

Whenever opponents tried to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi by spreading negativity, the PM surged ahead with more energy and took everyone along for development, Nadda said.

The BJP leader listed several key achievements of the Modi Government, such as Ayushman Bharat Yojana to provide free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh and Ujjwala Yojana of distributing LPG connections to poor families.

Citing a recent report which claimed India's forest cover has increased, Nadda said that Ujjwala scheme has also contributed to it.

“The Ujjawala Yojana has contributed a lot in increasing our forest cover. Under the scheme, as many as 8 crore gas connections and stoves were already distributed to women. It also improved their health, as they are now spared from inhaling smoke,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/politics-meaningless-without-religion--nadda.html
145,04-1-20,‘Tableau rejection for R-Day parade politically motivated’,"The Kerala Government on Friday termed as “politically motivated”, the Centre rejecting the State’s proposed theme for the tableau for the Republic Day parade for the second consecutive year.

State Cultural Minister AK Balan said the Defence Ministry rejected the State’s theme in the third screening and he failed to understand why the centre has a “hatred” towards the State.

“We had proposed a beautiful theme in the background of backwaters. We don’t understand why the centre has a hatred towards all these.

The Centre gets into a frenzy when it hears Kerala or Malayali. There was no politics in that tableau. This was rejected in the third screening it seems. This is not possible without a political intervention,” Balan said.

He asked why the State can't showcase backwaters or Kathakali or boats or anything that represents Kerala.

“Are they (BJP) expecting to improve their vote share in the state through these moves?,” Balan asked.

He also said that the centre had even rejected the recommendations for Padma awards from Kerala.

“Barring a few,they have rejected all the names,”he said. The state had proposed a theme of art and architecture of the State with a Koothambalam, a model of the state's architecture, along with performing arts, including Kathakali, Kalaripayatt, Mohiniyattom, Theyyam and Chenda.

The front portion of the proposed theme has elephant, the official animal of the State and coconut trees and others.

Jayaprabha Menon, a jury member told mediapersons that there was nothing fresh in the tableau.

“We have always seen the boat race, pulikali and others many times.

There was nothing new in this year's theme. There was no politics in a committee of artists, who decide the themes for the parade,” Menon told a television channel.

Last year also, the State's proposed 'Vaikom Satyagraha' theme was rejected by the centre for the Republic Day parade.

The historic Vaikom Satyagraha in Travancore was against untouchability that prevailed in Hindu society.

The movement was centred at the Shiva temple at Vaikom, near Kottayam during 1924-25.

Apart from Kerala, the Centre has also rejected the proposals of West Bengal and Maharashtra, prompting the TMC, Shiv Sena and the NCP to attack the Centre.

Twenty-two proposals, 16 from states and union territories and six from central ministries — out of a total 56 have been short-listed for this Republic Day parade, the Defence Ministry had said on January 1.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---tableau-rejection-for-r-day-parade-politically-motivated---.html
146,04-1-20,Savitribai: The woman who started girls' school 171 years ago,"Hailed as a pioneer in women's education, Savitribai Phule and her husband, social reformer Jyotirao Phule started what is believed to be India’s first school for girls here 171 years ago.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among those who paid tributes to this remarkable woman on her birth anniversary on Friday.

Born on January 3, 1831, at Naigaon in Satara district of Maharashtra, Savitribai married Jyotirao at the age of nine, and moved to Pune with him.

Her husband, fired by modern ideas and a reformist zeal, taught her to read and write. Savitribai took a teachers' training course and became a qualified teacher in 1847. The couple then started a school for girls in Bhidewada in Pune city in 1848, and she became its first teacher.

The couple had to face tremendous harassment from conservative elements who found the idea of women' education repugnant.

They faced ostracism; it is said that Savitribai carried a spare saree with her because people sometimes threw stones and dung at her as walked to the school.

Actor Renuka Shahane referred to this in her tweet on Friday.”Savitribai Phule carried an extra saree because trolls of that time would pelt her with dung & stones for breaking caste & gender barriers to get educated & to educate the marginalised. Her resistance paved the way for the education we take for granted today,” Shahane said.

Savitribai and her husband were instrumental in setting up Rs Satyashodhak Samaj' (Society of Truth-seekers), which championed progressive ideas, denounced the dowry custom and encouraged marriage without exchange of dowry.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/savitribai--the-woman-who-started-girls--school-171-years-ago.html
147,04-1-20,250 terrorists try to infiltrate into J&K per day: Army Chief,"With Pakistan often threatening to use the nuclear option, new Army Chief MM Naravane said here on Friday nuclear weapons are only a deterrence and they never ""came into play"" in the past when India carried out operations, in obvious reference to surgical strikes and Balakot air raid. He also said at least 200-250 terrorists are trying to infiltrate into Jammu & Kashmir almost every day.

He said even though terrorist camps had again come up in Balakot post the IAF strikes in February last year, the Indian action sent a strong signal that terror launch pads and camps can be taken down. They cannot operate with impunity was the big message which the Balakot action underlined, Naravane said.

On the spectre of crossing the nuclear threshold, the Army Chief elaborated during an interaction with the print media that ""historically nuclear weapons are deterrence and that is where their role ends."" Further, India carried out two or three actions in the past without the nuclear option coming into play. He, however, did not specify those operations though the inference was clear about the surgical strikes across the Line of Control(LOC) two years back and the Balakot action last year.

The IAF has carried aerial strikes against terrorist training camps in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan in retaliation against the killing of 41 Central Reserve Police Force(CRPF) in a suicide bombing by Pakistan based proscribed terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM).

Asked if the air strikes served any purpose as the terrorist camps had again started functioning at Balakot, Naravane said besides sending a stern signal to Pakistan without naming it, the action also served a note of caution against any escalatory action in future.

Admitting that the terrorist camps had again sprung up in Balakot, the Army Chief said even in war time destroyed buildings are reconstructed after some time and said it is not correct to say that the Balakot strikes did not achieve much.

On terrorist infrastructure across the LOC, Naravane said they are active and at least 200-250 militants are waiting to infiltrate adding they are trying to coming almost ""every day."" He also said there are more than 25 launch pads and terror camps now active across the LOC.

Asked about the situation in Jammu & Kashmir post the abrogation of Article 370 giving special status to it in August last year, the Army Chief said the law and order is improving and facts speak for themselves. Incidents of stone pelting and terrorist initiated incidents have come down and levels of violence are also down, he added.

As regards China, he said India has to be firm in resolve but need not be aggressive and should be assertive legitimately. This observation was obviously in the backdrop of Chinese army many times transgressing the Line of Actual Control(LAC) leading to stand-offs.

Stressing the need to be correct, Naravane said there is no point in raising the ante and new friction points. Highlighting that over the years, India has focused on the eastern frontier facing China, he said infrastructure development is taking place.

Moreover, the situation on the nearly 4,000 km long LAC is constantly reviewed and the Army is now laying importance on three factors including infrastructure, surveillance and reserves. Clarifying that the entire LAC cannot be manned as the troop strength will be thinned out, Naravane said the focus is now on having good defences in vantage positions and using surveillance methods for less critical sectors of the LAC.

Replying to a query about paucity funds hampering modernization of the armed forces, Naravane said at the national level there are only finite level of resources and the budget has to be apportioned to various ministries.

Observing that everybody has a wish list and will not necessarily get everything, the Army Chief said solution lies in evolving more efficient systems to save money and cut down redundant processes.

He lauded the government for improving the war fighting capabilities of the armed forces by delegating more financial powers to the Vice-Chiefs. This resulted in arms and ammunition coming in and the Army is absolutely ready to take any task assigned to it, Naravane said.

Replying to a question over the perception that the Armed Forces are getting politicised, Naravane denied it and reiterated that the Services have been apolitical since independence. ""I disagree that there is any politicisation of the armed forces,"" he said adding there is some misperception on that. On the Army being called frequently to assist the civil administration he observed they are the Army ""of the people and for the people.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/250-terrorists-try-to-infiltrate-into-j-k-per-day--army-chief.html
148,04-1-20,KVIC opens first silk processing plant in Gujarat,"Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has opened its first Silk processing plant in Gujarat to boost production of signature Patola Saree, while creating livelihoods for women.

Patola, the trademark Saree of Gujarat, is priced very high and is out of reach of common women. The raw material is purchased from Karnataka or West Bengal, where silk

processing units are situated. This increases the cost of the fabric manifolds.

In a major initiative, the KVIC unveiled its first Silk Processing Plant at Surendranagar, which would help cut down the cost of production of silk yarn drastically and increase the sale and availability of raw material for Gujarati Patola Sarees locally.

The plant has been set up by a khadi institution at a cost of Rs 75 lakh in which KVIC has contributed Rs 60 lakh. The unit has employed 90 local women, 70 of which belong to the Muslim community.

Chairman of KVIC VK Saxena said, “Promoting the Indian Crafts and Culture has been the top most priority of KVIC since its inception. There could have been no better way to start the new year, than by inaugurating a one of a kind plant, where cocoons will be brought from Karnataka and West Bengal and Silk yarn will be processed in house, thus reducing the cost of production and giving a major boost to the sale of famous Gujarati Patola Sarees — one of the most eminent symbol of Indian Craftsmanship.

Khadi is the spirit of Indianness, the fabric of transformation. This is the transformation that Khadi seeks, and it is just the beginning.”

Surendranagar district is a backward district in Gujarat where KVIC has invested Rs 60 Lakhs to build the Silk Processing Plant, in order to generate livelihood and boost sales of Patola Sarees by making silk more ready available at a low cost, for the Patola Saree manufacturers in the nearby area.

Traditionally, every region in India has had its own unique weave for the Silk Saree. It is quite notable that Patola Silk Saree is amongst the top five silk weaves which are desired in every Indian Saree Lover's wardrobe.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kvic-opens-first-silk-processing-plant-in-gujarat.html

The grand old party accused the Home Minister of imposing a ""conspiratorial and divisive agenda"" on India and bringing the country to a 1947-like situation.

""Amit Shah ji. Modi ji and you have been made Prime Minister and Home Minister to work for the public welfare and generate livelihoods for them and not abuse opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi. You have put the entire country in a situation like that in 1947 with your divisive and conspiratorial agenda...You should desist from slapping your conspiratorial and divisive agenda on the country,"" Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a video posted on Twitter.

He alleged that NDA partners and BJP Chief Ministers are themselves not accepting the ""divisive"" CAA but Modi and Shah were ""venting out their grouse"" on the Opposition by abusing them.

""Now your own partners and allies as also your chief minister of Assam Sabananda Sonowal have refused to accept and implement the divisive CAA. Why are you venting out your grouse on the opposition. You should first set your own house in order and then talk to the country and take on the opposition,"" the Congress leader said.

Tagging a news report in English about Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal not being ready to accept the CAA in his state, Surjewala tweeted in Hindi, ""Your allies are not accepting the divisive CAA, your own chief ministers are not accepting the CAA. Should we send you a Hindi translation"".

Surjewala earlier dared Modi to dismiss the Assam chief minister from his own party for openly opposing the amended Citizenship Act and declare him an ""anti-national"" for doing so.

""Mr Prime Minister, Stop fooling India! Your own CM is openly opposing CAA. Will you now declare him 'anti national'? I challenge you to dismiss him before criticising the opposition,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Sonowal gave a fresh twist to the debate over the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), after he said in a tweet, ""As a son of Assam, I will never settle foreigners in my state. This Sarbananda Sonowal will never allow this....""

151,04-1-20,ED quizzes PC in UPA-era aviation scam for six hours,"The Enforcement Directorate on Friday questioned former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram for about six hours in connection with a money laundering probe into the alleged irregularities in the aviation sector during the UPA era.

Chidambaram's statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) even as he was grilled for six hours at one of the ED's offices here.

Chidambaram was first summoned by the agency in this case on August 23 last year but at that time he was under CBI custody after being arrested in the INX Media corruption case.

The latest investigation relates to losses suffered by Air India due to an alleged multi-crore aviation scam and irregularities in fixing air slots for international airlines.

The Enforcement Directorate probe in this case also covers the purchase of over 110 aircraft in 2006, costing about Rs 70,000 crore, for public sector carrier Air India.

The CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General) had in 2011 questioned the rationale behind the Government's decision to purchase the passenger aircraft.

Former aviation minister Praful Patel has been grilled by the ED in connection with these decisions. Following this, the agency questioned Chidambaram on some leads it obtained in the case during Patel's quizzing, officials said.

Chidambaram was heading an empowered Group of Ministers for these deals and his questioning was necessary to unravel the decision-making process undertaken by the UPA Government for these controversial decisions, officials said.

Chidambaram came out of jail early December last year after over 100 days in CBI and ED custody in the INX Media case. He was released only after the Supreme Court granted him bail.

Chidambaram is also being probed by ED in a third case of money laundering related to the Aircel-Maxis deal. The ED had questioned him in this case earlier.

Chidambaram had earlier described the ED action in the Aircel-Maxis case as a ""crazy mixture of falsehoods and conjectures"".",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ed-quizzes-pc-in-upa-era-aviation-scam-for-six-hours.html
152,04-1-20,Sena: Surgical strike failed to demoralise Pak terrorists,"The Shiv Sena on Friday targeted the Centre by questioning the “efficacy” of the 2016 surgical strike and said the perception that it would demoralise Pakistani terrorists remained an “illusion” as Indian soldiers continue to get killed in terror attacks in Kashmir.

Accusing the Modi government of boasting about how Pakistan was straightened out after the surgical strike, the Sena sought to know whether it has really happened.

It also observed that troubled borders were not good for the country's well-being.

The Sena's remarks come in the wake of the death of an Army soldier from Maharashtra, Naik Sandip Raghunath Sawant, who was killed during a counter-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.

“The New Year did not begin on a positive note in Kashmir. Our jawan from Satara, Sandip Sawant, attained martyrdom in Kashmir along with two other soldiers. In the last one month, seven to eight jawans from Maharashtra were killed in the line of duty. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra is not responsible for this,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

The party also questioned whether the situation in Kashmir has improved after the surgical strike and abrogation of Article 370 provisions.

The party, however, maintained that scrapping Article 370 was a good move. India had conducted the surgical strike on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC) as a response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir earlier that month. Without naming the Centre, the Sena alleged, “Circulating news that only the Pakistanis were getting killed in Kashmir will not change the reality as tricolour-draped bodies of Indian soldiers, like Sawant, are reaching their respective villages.”

“There is a bloodshed along the Kashmir border and mounting anger among the families of martyred jawans. The perception that surgical strike will demoralise Pakistani terrorists has turned out to be an illusion. In fact, the (terror) attacks have increased,” it added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena--surgical-strike-failed-to-demoralise-pak-terrorists.html

154,04-1-20,MCA says no illegality in conversion of Tata Sons into private company,"The Ministry of Corporate Affairs on Friday told the company law appellate court that it did not commit any illegality in granting permission to convert Tata Sons — the holding company of the $110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate — into a private company.

The submission was made before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) during the course of hearing on a petition filed by Registrar of Companies (RoC) that seeks modifications in the tribunal’s December 18, 2019 judgment reinstating Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of Tata Sons.

A two-member Bench of the NCLAT headed by Chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya, which reserved its order on the RoC’s petition, said it will clarify that the December 18 judgement does not cast aspersions on the RoC and indicated that its order is likely to come on Monday next week.

Last month, the NCLAT set aside the RoC decision allowing conversion of Tata Sons into a private company.

During the proceedings on Friday, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) said it was only discharging its duty and has not committed any illegality in the conversion of Tata Sons from a public company to a private company.

Director Prosecution, representing the MCA, informed the appellate tribunal that after amendment in 2015, there is no such requirement of any minimum prescribed share capital for conversion of companies from public to private ones.

“Nothing has been prescribed. There is no requirement. This has been done for ease of doing business,” said the MCA official.

155,04-1-20,Ratan Tata moves SC against NCLAT order reinstating Mistry,"Ratan Tata on Friday filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking to quash a company law appellate court order directing Tata Sons to rehire the chairman it had fired in 2016, saying the judgment was “wrong, erroneous and contrary to the record of the case”.

His petition is separate from the one filed by Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the $110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate, in the Supreme Court on Thursday that sought a stay on the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s December 18, 2019 order to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman.

Ratan Tata, who is chairman emeritus and a shareholder of Tata Sons, in the petition said the NCLAT judgment was wrong as it treats Tata Sons as a two-group company.

Mistry, he contended, was made the Executive Chairman of Tata Sons in a purely professional capacity and not as a representative of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which holds 18.4 per cent in Tata Sons.

Tata Trusts, of whom Ratan Tata had been a chairman for many years, holds 65.89 per cent of Tata Sons.

The petition said the NCLAT order wrongly suggests that “someone from the SP Group had been a director because of some entrenched right or convention”.

“This is untrue and contrary to the records and the articles of association of Tata Sons, which are undisputed and binding on the shareholders including the SP Group,” he contended.

He said Mistry’s leadership “was lacking” in “his reluctance to timely and meaningfully disassociate himself from his family business after he became the Chairman of Tata Sons and address any conflict in this regard, which was a condition precedent to his appointment as Chairman of Tata Sons”.

Mistry, he alleged, “concentrated power and authority in his own hands” and “board members were being alienated on matters relating to Tata Operating Companies where Tata Sons had huge financial exposure and the Board of Tata Sons had to contend with such decisions being cast upon it as fait accompli”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ratan-tata-moves-sc-against-nclat-order-reinstating-mistry.html
156,04-1-20,"Niti moots Rs 22,500-cr plan for private trains on 100 routes","Niti Aayog and Indian Railways have come out with a discussion paper for running 150 trains on 100 routes by private operators, envisaging an investment of Rs 22,500 crore. The discussion paper titled ‘Private Participation: Passenger Trains’ has identified 100 routes, including Mumbai Central-New Delhi, New Delhi- Patna, Allahabad-Pune and Dadar-Vadodara.

Other prominent routes include Howrah-Chennai, Howrah Patna, Indore-Okhla, Lucknow-Jammu Tawi, Chennai-Okhla, Anand Vihar-Bhagalpur, Secunderabad-Guwahati and Howrah-Anand Vihar. The paper, prepared for discussions with stakeholders, has split the 100 routes into 10-12 clusters. As per the paper, the private operator will have the right to collect market-linked fares and will be provided flexibility of class composition and halts. The privatisation of train operation, the paper said, will help in introducing modern technology and rolling stocks with reduced maintenance.

Besides, it would provide world-class service experience to passengers and also help in reducing the supply demand deficit. The operators could be domestic or international entities, the paper said. Each bidder would eligible for award of maximum three clusters, it added.

The Tejas Express on the Lucknow-Delhi route, which was flagged off on October 4, is the railways’ first experience of letting a non-railway operator run a train. The Tejas Express is run by railways’ subsidiary IRCTC.

IRCTC has a slew of benefits worked out for its passengers — combination meals, free insurance of up to Rs 25 lakh and compensation in case of delays.

161,04-1-20,Markets recoil as Mideast tensions flare up,"Indian equity indices tumbled in tandem with global markets on Friday after the killing of a top Iranian general by the US ratcheted up geopolitical tensions, triggering a flight from riskier assets.

After dropping over 286 points intra-day, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 162.03 points, or 0.39%, lower at 41,464.61.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty closed 55.55 points, or 0.45%, down at 12,226.65.

Global equities swooned after top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq, marking a dangerous escalation in Middle East tensions.

World leaders reacted to the killing with alarm, even as Iran vowed “severe revenge”.

Safe-haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen strengthened as investors assessed the risk dynamics.

Back home, Asian Paints was the top loser in the Sensex pack, dropping 2.16%, followed by Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, SBI, NTPC and Bajaj Finance.

On the other hand, Sun Pharma, TCS, HCL Tech, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Bharti Airtel rose up to 2.08%.

During the week, the Sensex slipped 110.53 points or 0.26%, while the Nifty lost 19.15 points or 0.15%.

“Investors turned cautious as tensions emerge in the Middle East. Crude oil prices rose while strong dollar held IT and pharma stocks higher. With market testing new highs, emergence of geopolitical tensions could force people to book some profits.

“Crude prices could turn volatile due to risk of possible retaliation from Iran which could impact the performance in the short-term,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

BSE power, auto, bankex, finance, metal, utilities and basic materials indices skidded up to 1.20%, while IT, teck and healthcare rose up to 1.52%.

163,04-1-20,Mutual funds add Rs 3.15L cr to asset base in 2019,"Mutual funds have added a whopping Rs 3.15 lakh crore to their asset base in 2019 on the back of robust inflows in debt schemes and measures taken by regulator Sebi for boosting investor confidence.

The asset under management (AUM) of the industry rose by over 13% (Rs 3.15 lakh crore) to Rs 26.77 lakh crore at the end of last month, up from Rs 23.62 lakh crore at the end of December 2018, as per the latest data available with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).

The AUM growth seen by the 44-member mutual fund industry in 2019 is significantly higher than 7.5% witnessed in 2018. However, the growth was much more higher at 32% in 2017, when the asset base expanded by over Rs 5.4 lakh crore.

Industry experts said the double-digit growth was a positive sign given the negative sentiment about equity and fixed income securities.

This growth should be primarily credited to inflows in debt-oriented schemes, steps taken by Sebi that boosted investor confidence, and to distributors for helping take the message of “mutual fund sahi hai” (mutual funds are right) to every nook and corner of the country.

“Growth we now see in AUM is largely attributed to debt-oriented schemes. The inflows in debt-oriented schemes have been surprisingly high and saved the year 2019 from becoming a ‘dark-dull year of investing’, as the year saw Sensex at its record high, investors chose to book profits and drew themselves away from all the negative aura that was around markets.

“While SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) inflows were impressive with around Rs 8,000-crore-plus, the overall equity excitement was missing. The positive side to this is that investors have not lost their complete faith in equity investments and trust the process of SIP,” Quantum Mutual Fund CEO Jimmy Patel said.

The year 2019 marks the seventh consecutive yearly rise in the industry AUM after a drop during the two preceding years. The AUM of the industry has grown from Rs 8.22 lakh crore in November 2009 to Rs 27 lakh crore in November 2019, indicating an over three-fold jump in 10 years.

The year has also seen repayment issues and downgrades with certain companies, which affected investor sentiment.

However, this has also resulted in investors becoming more aware about the overall risk involved with different categories of mutual funds and now choose funds based on their risk appetite.

In terms of asset size, HDFC MF continued to lead the pack with an AUM of Rs 3,82,517 crore (excluding fund of funds) at the end of December 2019, followed by ICICI Prudential MF (Rs 3,61,506 crore) and SBI MF (Rs 3,52,632 crore).

Going ahead, Patel said 2020 will be the year of SIPs, which will rule over lumpsum investments and millennials will start investing in mutual funds.

“If the regulatory framework and the supportive infrastructure is conducive there may be investment by mutual funds in commodities. Overall in my view one could expect a marginal growth in the year 2020. However, mutual fund as an avenue for investment is here to stay,” he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mutual-funds-add-rs-3-15l-cr-to-asset-base-in-2019.html

165,04-1-20,Oil price jumps on fear of Iranian retaliation,"The price of oil surged on Friday as global investors were gripped with uncertainty over the potential repercussions after the United States killed Iran’s top general.

News that Gen Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, was killed in an air attack at the Baghdad international airport prompted expectations of Iranian retaliation against US and Israeli targets.

In previous flare-ups in tensions with the US, Iran has threatened the supply of oil that travels from the Persian Gulf to the rest of the world.

About 20 per cent of oil traded worldwide goes through the Strait of Hormuz, where the shipping lane is only 3 kilometers (2 miles) wide and tankers have come under attack this year. The international benchmark for crude oil jumped 4.1 per cent, or $2.70, to $68.95 a barrel in London trading.

“Revenge will come, maybe not overnight but it will come and until then we need to increase the geopolitical risk premium,” said Olivier Jakob, head of consultancy Petromatrix, in a note to investors.

He noted that Iran’s response may not be limited to the Strait of Hormuz.

In September, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world’s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia.

The strike briefly took out about half of the supplies from the world’s largest oil exporter.

The US directly blamed Iran, which denied any involvement. Launching attacks that can’t be easily linked back to Iran limits the chances of direct retaliation. But Iran has also directly targeted tankers. This year it seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, for several weeks. And it has shot down a US military drone.

About 80 per cent of the crude oil that goes through the Strait of Hormuz goes to countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-price-jumps-on-fear-of-iranian-retaliation.html

169,04-1-20,Uncharted Brexit waters: Johnson faces 2020 tests,"After a remarkable political turnaround, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is on the verge of taking Britain out of the European Union with the enthusiastic support of a strong majority in Parliament.

After suffering a string of parliamentary defeats over Brexit — plus the ignominy of being told by Britain’s Supreme Court that his suspension of Parliament last year was unlawful —Johnson cruised to victory in the country’s December 12 election and finally got his landmark Brexit bill passed before Christmas.

Expectations for the coming year are high, fueled by Johnson’s upbeat approach. He promised in his New Year’s message that resolving the Brexit stalemate means Britain “can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people.”

He pledged to “work my socks off” to unite the country. The message was pre-recorded; Johnson spent the holiday on the Caribbean island of Mustique with girlfriend Carrie Symonds. Johnson’s predecessor, former Prime Minister Theresa May, was stung by repeated rebukes from a hostile Parliament.

Johnson, however, is in a much stronger position with a healthy Conservative Party majority in the House of Commons after the election that he called two years early. When Johnson’s tenure at 10 Downing Street began in July with a series of defeats in Parliament, many observers said he likely would have the shortest reign of any recent PM.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/uncharted-brexit-waters--johnson-faces-2020-tests.html

172,04-1-20,Strings attached,"Dr L Subramaniam’s name might be synonymous with the violin but he credits his father for his fame. By Team Viva

Violinist and composer Dr L Subramaniam is credited for popularising Indian ragas on the violin worldwide. But when you talk to the maestro, he insists that it was his father, Professor V Lakshminarayan, who was instrumental in taking the violin to the global stage as a solo instrument.

“My father is responsible for making Indian classical known internationally. Earlier, the violin was an accompanying instrument. His dream was to make it a solo instrument. I follow my father’s vision and direction and learn from him.

But not just the violin, his father worked towards mainstreaming Carnatic music. “He had to create lot of new techniques because it was not possible with the existing ones. He worked on technical perfection, concentration and tonality to expand the reach. People have seen what I have done but are unaware of what my father did,” he adds.

It was to make the contribution of his father known better that Dr Subramaniam organises Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival every year. The festival, currently in its 29th year, was started with a focus of bringing leading artists from different genres and cultural backgrounds on one stage. The world’s best artists bring together their unique perspectives and art, giving the audience a rare opportunity to experience musical styles from around the world. “We aim to bring some of the greatest musicians and orchestras to our doorsteps for our people and students. We have brought 29 different groups over the years, otherwise one has to go to different cities and continents to hear them. The best part is that they don’t perform only their genre, they blend it with Indian classical as well. This helps to create a global awareness about various genres of music and promote Indian as well as global heritage,” says Subramaniam.

This year the festival celebrates the 150th birth year of Mahatma Gandhi. The musical tribute by Dr Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurti will feature Symphony Orchestra of Castile and Leon from Spain. The artist says, “We are bringing the Spanish orchestra for the first time to India. We have had orchestras from Germany, Norway and other places.”

His wife, Kavita, will be singing Raghupati Raghav and Mera Bhajan, an original composition. “We are doing a piece called Nada Priya. This will be the concluding piece which I will be playing with the orchestra. There is also Spring Rhapsody. It is a very special year,” he says.

Besides the festival, Dr Subramaniam works on collaborations as well. “Once I was invited to perform at Lord Belgium’s 70th birthday in Germany. After I finished playing the violin he came to the stage, hugged me and said it was very powerful and he wanted to collaborate. I never thought he really meant it. But voila, it did happen,” recalls Dr Subramaniam and adds that this was the most enriching experience of his musical journey.

During the initial stages of his career, an overseas collaboration meant a lot to to him as he nurtured his father’s dream of taking violin to the global level.

The emphasis, according to Dr Subramaniam, is on promoting Indian classical music. “Even the collaborative work, which we call contemporary classical music, is based in Indian and Western classical as well as world music. I created this format in 1980s and it called for a global fusion concept,” he says. In pursuance of this aim they brought in performers from Africa and eastern European countries.

But the collaborations do not end there. Dr Subramaniam interacts with students and engages with them during workshops. “I have also done two television shows including one on Shankara TV where we present different instruments, explain their working and different concepts. Through this students who are interested in music but cannot afford to learn music get the opportunity to do so,” he says.

Dr Subramaniam believes that one cannot emphasise enough about promoting young instrumentalists in the South Indian tradition. “If they are given the opportunity, our music will go a long way. Young instrumentalists don’t get enough opportunities or even what they deserve,” he says and adds, “If people are given opportunities it will make way for new innovations.”

If one is talking about students, the focus naturally shifts to Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts, Bengaluru. Dr Subramaniam elaborates on the reasons for starting it. He says, “Great musicians didn’t go to school but they make great artists. Ustad Bismillah Khan, MS Subbalaxmi are examples. We have not seen any great performers coming out of any University. Music is a practical art form so if you want to become a performer you have to practise it. This is the reason the courses are designed in a manner where 70 per cent of the emphasis is on practical aspect.”

Talking of the musical instrument that he is so closely identified with, Dr Subramaniam says, “The violin is used in different genres including Western and Indian Classical, jazz or even in an orchestra. The reason is that it is very easy to adapt. For example Veena is not used in Western music but it is common in Indian tradition. But the violin has been adapted worldwide.”

And as a larger discipline, he feels that he is nothing without music. “It is my everything. It is part of my emotional journey, expression and living. It has given me inner peace and satisfaction. One has to experience the state of mind while one is playing music. For me it is very personal and also professional,” he concludes.

173,04-1-20,In her voice,"Australian producer Tammy Brennan and Indian theatre director Anuradha Kapur tell Chahak Mittal that their latest production, Daughters Opera, addresses numerous instances of gender violence and challenges the conventional opera

When his violence got worse and was directed at children, I changed.’ ‘There was never any physical abuse but the emotional one was constant and tremendous.’ ‘They killed my child, said, next time, there should be a son.’ ‘We had our good times but once we were married, his desire to control everything became more obvious.’ ‘He took every opportunity to belittle me. When in a temper, he often hit me.’ ‘He often came to my home when my parents weren’t around. As a child, I confused his touch with love.’ Talk to women around you and multiple stories of violence and abuse against them can be heard. But how do we actually address these issues and an excessive amount of abuse that they have been through?

Indo-Australian production Daughters Opera, which is an inter-cultural contemporary performance, aims to address just that. Through diverse backgrounds, art forms, cultures and languages, the production initiates a conversation about the systemic violence and the globally-shared experiences of trauma and resistance of women and girls.

The act is directed by Indian theatre director Anuradha Kapur where the libretto (the text of an opera or other long vocal work) is written by Australian independent producer Tammy Brennan. The National School of Drama’s theatre festival Bharat Rang Mahotsav inspired Tammy and gave her the idea to bring several stories of gender violence together. “I was observing the kind of violence that was happening around and how the country was reacting to such incidences over the past few years. There were students protesting on the streets. There were candle marches. I hadn’t really witnessed anything like that before and started questioning the prolificity of violence. Why is it getting so massive with each day? So I begun my research and spent time with various organisations, which stand against violence and conduct programmes about it across India to sensitise people,” she says.

From there, she began looking at multiple new stories and framing them into a narrative. She adds, “I thought these could be woven in an inter-cultural framework too and brought to the global stage as violence is prevalent everywhere.”

With an all-female cast, the performance aims at addressing the ongoing everyday acts of gender violence, such as forced labour, infanticide, sexual abuse and injury. Since it combines elements of opera, poetry and theatre, alongside the expressive form of Portuguese Fado music and live experimental electronics, what particular genre do we slot the act under? Anuradha labels it as an “Opera.” Even though she feels that the conversation should have happened after we have seen the play but she tells us that it has a lot of elements incorporated in it. She adds, “We’d call it opera but even that too is of many different kinds. But yes, music dominates the whole act. We have constructed an entirely different framework in which all the elements speak to each other. There is music, opera, several body acts and expressions. There are only women on stage, who weave together different forms and cultures. They combine different ideas and narratives of violence like female foeticide, infanticide, domestic violence, child sexual abuse, rape, marital rape and so on.”

Narrating some of the instances that the duo has used for the play, Anuradha says, “There is one sequence, where women in an absolutely packed local train cut vegetables while commuting. They are going to their workplace, which is visible labour, but before going there, they also cook for their family, which is invisible. Even after coming back home, they cook dinner. How do women negotiate so much in their lives? We address the fact that women have much more labour that they do during the day than is actually visible. And even labour has its own quality of violence to it. And that’s what we aim to highlight. The need of the hour is to blur these boundaries and the so-called gender roles.”

The emphasis on the need for women’s emancipation is brought to the fore in several different ways. “It can be seen very distinguishably when we are quoting a feminist scholar in the play. But it is also very subtle. In some scenes, the audience will also feel how death is the safest place for a daughter to be in,” adds Anuradha.

The music is composed by award-winning Australian composer David Chisholm and scenography is done by Deepan Sivaram. Tammy says that it is because of such diverse elements that the play is very experimental. “It is a term which I don’t use much. But I would call it experimental because it has so many cross-cultural elements in it. We are merging so many forms — languages, music, poetry, people of different nationalities and scenography. But it’s certainly very contemporary as it also challenges the conventional opera,” adds she.

So where did these stories come from? “They are all around us. They constantly come in front of us everyday through newspapers and the news on TV. So we have woven all those multiple instances into one narrative,” says Tammy and tells us that one of the references for the stories has also been taken from the roadside women ragpickers. Adds Anuradha, “We are rehearsing at a place where just down the street, there are women collecting rags for recycling. So that story too has entered our space.”

174,04-1-20,For the greater good,"Actor James McAvoy says that his character’s strong desire to change the world in His Dark Materials makes it exciting. By Team Viva

Tell us about your character in the show?

I play the role of Lord Asriel. He is a scientist and an explorer. He is probably the most self-possessed and ruthless person in the world of His Dark Materials. This show is all about trying not to limit creativity and the liberation of the human spirit but one of the things that really define Lord Asriel is that he is viewed in this tale through the eyes of Lyra. Lyra is his niece who doesn’t understand him, he is a Mercutio (fictional character). He is unattainable. She can’t hold onto him as much as she wants to.

My character believes that he has a huge sense of responsibility to all the humanity and he will sacrifice his own family in order to serve the greater good. The magisterium want to control the flow of knowledge and the development of the human intellect. That is something that Lord Asriel cannot take as a scholar, as a student. He sees that as a challenge. He might break those invisible chains that are holding humanity back.

One fascinating thing about the show?

In this reality of His Dark Materials, the human soul is actually personified in the category of an animal, which is quite an interesting idea.

Were you acquainted with the show? Did you read the books? The trilogy?

I was particularly well acquainted with His Dark Materials. I think I read the first trilogy. I was, maybe, 21. All my research was done. I was excited because I knew exactly what we were going to do on day one.

What are your thoughts on Philip Pullman’s work of imagination?

Scope of Phillip Pullman’s imagination is incredible. The fact that he’s dealing with free will and human rights. He is dealing with liberty and the things that they have to do in order to free us from the grip of these institutions. Philip Pullman is celebrating humanity. I think part of what he sees as the prime characteristic of humanity is rational, creative and an imaginative thought. I think that is beautiful.

Your character is personified as an animal in a way that you imagine yourself outside of your being. What is your take on this?

I think one of the really cool stuff about the world in this show is that when you are a child your daemon is changeable. It can be changed into any shape depending on your mood or just what you desire and anything that would help the situation. But when you hit puberty and start to understand who you really are, your daemon also settles on an animal’s form. My character’s daemon settles on snow leopard. He is totally uncompromising and this is very different kind of a relationship with yourself because you got a reflection of yourself right in front of you, you can’t really hide from, can’t really lie to. Everyone can also see what and how your soul is like.

You are playing a character who is willing to do literally anything to achieve a goal. You might think of him as a classic hero at the beginning but there is some ruthlessness about him. You have played such a wide array of characters. What appeals to you the most about Asriel?

No, I am totally not as ruthless as him. But it is exciting to play somebody that looks at the world and goes “I don’t like this. This is utterly wrong and I am going to change it. Nothing is going to stop me from doing that. Even love cannot stop me. No respect for any particular institution will stop me from making this world a paradise. And emancipating all of us from the systems.” This thinking drew me to the character I play.

According to the Indian Oil website, the petrol costs Rs 75.45 a litre in Delhi, Rs 81.04 per litre in Mumbai, Rs 78.04 a litre in Kolkata and Rs 78.39 a litre in Chennai after the revised rates were implemented on Saturday morning.

176,04-1-20,CEO Tim Cook sees pay ebb along with Apple performance,"Apple chief Tim Cook saw his annual pay slip to $11.6 million in 2019 after the company registered a weaker financial performance compared with the previous year, according to documents filed Friday.

Cook, who took home $15.7 million in 2018, is paid a base salary of $3 million, in addition to a bonus and various compensations.

His 2019 incentive bonus, which is tied to Apple's performance, tallied about $7.7 million, and was calculated based on the fact that Apple exceeded its sales target by only 28 percent.

That compared with $12 million in 2018, based on the company exceeding its sales target by 100 percent, the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said.

Cook's 2019 pay was also reported to include another $885,000 worth of benefits, most of which were for security and use of a private jet.

""For security and efficiency reasons, the board requires Mr. Cook to use private aircraft for all business and personal travel,"" the filing said.

Apart from his salary, Cook also saw more than $113 million worth of Apple shares become vested as part of his long-term compensation as head of the firm, according to the filing.

As iPhone sales have weakened, Apple has been shifting to earnings from digital content and services sold to the legions of fans of its devices. Apple reported net sales of $260.2 billion and operating income of $63.9 billion for 2019, it said in the filing.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ceo-tim-cook-sees-pay-ebb-along-with-apple-performance-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ceo-tim-cook-sees-pay-ebb-along-with-apple-performance.html
177,04-1-20,A More Dangerous World: Iran killing triggers global alarm,"Global powers warned on Friday that the world became a more dangerous place after the US assassinated Iran’s top general, urging restraint on all sides. Britain and Germany also suggested that Iran shared some blame for provoking the targeted killing that dramatically ratcheted up tensions in the Mideast.

China, Russia and France, all permanent members of the UN Security Council, took a dim view of the US airstrike near Baghdad’s airport on early Friday that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani and several of his associates. The 62-year-old ledIran’s elite Quds Force, responsible for the country’s foreign campaigns.

The White House justified the strike with a tweet alleging that Soleimani “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.”

Social media flooded with alarm, with Twitter users morbidly turning “WWIII” into the top trending term worldwide.

“We are waking up in a more dangerous world. Military escalation is always dangerous,” France’s deputy minister for foreign affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, told RTL radio. “When such actions, such operations, take place, we see that escalation is underway.”

Russia likewise characterised the deadly US strike as “fraught with serious consequences.” A Foreign Ministry statement warned that “such actions don’t help resolve complicated problems in the Middle East, but instead lead to a new round of escalating tensions.” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman

Maria Zakharova suggested that in ordering the killing, US President Donald Trump had one eye on his re-election campaign.

Trump’s election opponents characterised the killing as reckless, with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden saying the US president “tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.”

China described itself as “highly concerned.” “Peace in the Middle East and the Gulf region should be preserved,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. “We urge all parties concerned, especially the United States, to maintain calm and restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions.”

But while echoing the concerns of other Security Council members about spiraling tensions, Britain and Germany broke ranks, voicing qualified understanding for the US position.

German Government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer described the US strike as “a reaction to a whole series of military provocations for which Iran bears responsibility,” pointing to attacks on tankers and a Saudi oil facility, among other events.

“We are at a dangerous escalation point and what matters now is contributing with prudence and restraint to de-escalation,” she said. Germany currently sits on the UN Security Council but is not a permanent member.

The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said “we have always recognised the aggressive threat posed by the Iranian Quds force led by Qasem Soleimani.” “Following his death, we urge all parties to de-escalate,” he said.

“Further conflict is in none of our interests.”

There were also warnings that the killing could set back efforts to stamp out remnants of the ISIS. A top European Union official, Charles Michel, said “the risk is a generalised flare up of violence in the whole region and the rise of obscure forces of terrorism that thrive at times of religious and nationalist tensions.”

Italy also warned that increased tensions “risk being fertile terrain for terrorism and violent extremism.” But right-wing Italian opposition leader Matteo Salvini praised Trump for eliminating “one of the most dangerous and pitiless men in the world, an Islamic terrorist, an enemy of the West, of Israel, of rights and of freedoms.”

Trump also won the support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “for acting swiftly, forcefully and decisively.”

Behind the scenes, the strike triggered urgent flurries of diplomatic activity. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo worked phones, calling world capitals to defend Trump’s decision. He said the US is committed to de-escalating tensions that have soared since Iranian-backed militia killed an American contractor and the US responded with strikes on the militia. That set off violent pro-Iran protests outside the US Embassy in Baghdad, which in turn set the stage for the killing of Soleimani.

In the Mideast, the strike provoked waves of shock, fury and fears of worse to come.

Iraq’s most powerful Shia religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, said in a speech during Friday prayers that the country must brace for “very difficult times.”

In Iran, a hard-line adviser to the country’s supreme leader who led Friday prayers in Tehran likened US troops in Iraq to “insidious beasts” and said they should be swept from the region.

“I am telling Americans, especially Trump, we will take a revenge that will change their daylight into to a nighttime darkness,” said the cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/a-more-dangerous-world--iran-killing-triggers-global-alarm.html
178,04-1-20,Iran can call on powerful friends,"If Iran decides to follow through on its vow of harsh retaliation for the killing of its top general, it can call upon heavily armed allies across the Middle East that are within easy striking distance of US forces and American allies.

Here’s a look at Tehran’s allies in the Mideast: IRAQ MILITIAS

Iran has trained, financed, and equipped Shia militias in Iraq that battled US forces in the years after the 2003 invasion and remobilised to battle the ISIS a decade later. The groups include Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Kataeb Hezbollah and the Badr Organization, all three led by men with close ties to Soleimani, leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force.

HEZBOLLAH

The militia, whose Arabic name translates into “Party of God,” was established by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard during Lebanon’s civil war in the 1980s. Today it is among the most effective armed groups in the region, extending Iran’s influence to Israel’s doorstep. Hezbollah was formed to combat Israel following its invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Today, the group has an arsenal of tens of thousands of rockets and missiles that can reach deep into Israel, as well as thousands of highly disciplined and battle-hardened fighters. Hezbollah has fought alongside Government forces in Syria for more than six years, gaining even more battlefield experience and expanding its reach.

YEMEN’S HOUTHIS

Yemen’s Shia rebels, known as Houthis, swept down from the north and captured the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict on the side of the Government the following year. The war has since killed tens of thousands of people and generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia views the Houthis as an Iranian proxy, and along with Western nations and UN experts has accused Tehran of providing arms to the rebels, including the long-range missiles they have fired into Saudi Arabia. Iran supports the rebels but denies arming them.

GAZA MILITANTS

Iran has long supported Palestinian militant groups, including Gaza’s Hamas rulers and particularly the smaller Islamic Jihad group.

A source in Netanyahu’s office said that the premier was returning from Athens but did not elaborate. Following Friday morning’s killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement called for the missile strike by Israel’s closest ally, to be avenged.

“Meting out the appropriate punishment to these criminal assassins...Will be the responsibility and task of all resistance fighters worldwide,” Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in a statement.

The Israeli army on Friday closed a ski resort in the annexed Golan Heights, which border Lebanon and Syria. “Following a security assessment, it was decided to close Mount Hermon to visitors today,” an army spokeswoman said.

“There are no further instructions for civilians in the area.” The ski resort on Mount Hermon lies in the Israeli-occupied part of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed in a move still not recognised by most of the international community.

181,04-1-20,Iraqi militant killed by US worked with Iran for decades,"Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a veteran Iraqi militant who was closely allied with Iran and rose to be a senior militia commander during the war against the ISIS, was killed overnight Friday in a US strike that also felled Iran’s top general.

Al-Muhandis was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mostly Shiite paramilitaries. He was also the founder of the Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades. The US blamed the group, which is separate from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, for a rocket attack in northern Iraq last week that killed a US contractor.

The militias, many of which are backed by Iran and trace their roots back to Shia insurgency against US forces following the 2003 invasion, mobilised in 2014 when the ISIS swept across northern and western Iraq. Al-Muhandis, who had spent much of his life as a secretive operative in Iran’s regional shadow wars, emerged as a public face of the force, a tall man with a gray beard and thick glasses who was often seen on the front lines directing his fighters by radio.

He was killed in an American airstrike near Baghdad’s international airport around midnight along with Gen.

The Reds haven’t lost in 37 league games since a defeat at Manchester City on January 3, 2019 and it looks certain they will win the English title for the first time since 1990.

With a game in hand to further bolster their advantage, it would take an astonishing collapse to deprive Liverpool of their holy grail.

“It says a lot of positive things. I have not enough words for it, it is exceptional,” Klopp said.

“I’m really happy and really proud of the boys. We should not take things like this for granted.”

Winners of their last 18 home league games, Liverpool are unbeaten in 51 top-flight matches at Anfield dating back to April 2017.

As if it wasn’t hard enough to beat Liverpool already, they are proving more impregnable than ever lately.

This was their fifth consecutive top-flight clean-sheet — the first time they have managed that since 2007 — and they completed more passes than any team in one match in the Premier League era.

“The way we controlled Sheffield United was exceptional. In possession we were incredible, we were calm but lively as well. The goals we scored were exceptional,” Klopp said.

“It’s obviously good (to go unbeaten for a year) but the target was not to extend this, but to win the game.

“We did not think about the one year (undefeated). We have season resolutions, not New Year resolutions!”

After a golden 2019 saw Liverpool crowned European and Club World champions, the next target is ending Manchester City’s two-year spell as champions after narrowly missing out last season.

Their sights set on domestic bliss, the new year started just as the old one finished, with Liverpool setting standards of excellence that rival anything achieved by City’s breath-taking team.

Premier League immortality is within touching distance as Klopp’s men are already over halfway towards an unbeaten league season that would replicate the incredible feat of Arsenal’s 2003-04 Invincibles.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/incredible-year.html
186,04-1-20,Shubman argues with umpire after being given ‘out’,"Rising star of Indian cricket Shubman Gill was embroiled in a controversy when his dismissal was overturned after an argument with the on-field umpire during Punjab’s encounter against Delhi, leading to stoppage of play for around 10 minutes.

The current white-ball captain of the India A team refused to leave the crease after he was adjudged caught-behind by slow medium bowler Subodh Bhati. An argument with the umpire followed and the batsman was reinstated after a discussion between the on-field officials.

Showing dissent to the umpire’s decision is a breach of the ‘Code of Conduct’ and there is a possibility that match referee P Ranganathan will have a word with the player. He could either be let off with a warning or charged with a Level 1 offence.

Gill was batting on 10 then. He didn’t last long as he edged one off Simarjeet Singh to Anuj Rawat for 23 off 41 balls with the team’s score on 60.

DDCA general secretary Vinod Tihara said: “The match was halted for seven to eight minutes. There was nothing untoward. Our boys felt that Gill was out and that’s why they asked the umpires why the decision was reversed. We are not filing any official complaint as the matter is closed for us.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shubman-argues-with-umpire-after-being-given----out---.html
187,04-1-20,Injury scare for Shaw,"Barely a week before leaving for New Zealand with the India A team, Prithvi Shaw hurt his left shoulder while fielding in Ranji game.

The incident happened in the third session at the Bandra Kurla Complex ground when Shaw dived to save an overthrow. He was immediately taken off the field.

Shaw is named in the India A squad for the upcoming New Zealand tour and the team leaves on January 10. He is there in the limited overs as well as the squad for the four-day matches.

After the day’s play, Mumbai skipper Suryakumar Yadav said Shaw looked better.

“He (Shaw) looks better. Looking at him on the ground, it was not looking good but now I think he is looking good.

Later on I will get to know from the physio on what exactly the situation is (with regard to him),” Surya told reporters.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/injury-scare-for-shaw.html
188,04-1-20,Karnataka bundle out Mumbai for 194,"Ajinkya Rahane and Prithvi Shaw faltered yet again as Karnataka pacers wreaked a havoc and bundled out Mumbai for a paltry 194 on the opening day of their Elite Ranji Trophy game at Bandra-Kurla complex.

However, skipper Suryakumar Yadav (77 off 94 balls; 10x4 and 2x6) stood alone when all other batsmen failed. His knock ensured that the hosts at least went past the 175-run mark.

Earlier, the four-pronged Karnataka pace attack justified skipper Karun Nair’s decision to bowl first on a breezy morning as they ran through the Mumbai batting line-up.

Mumbai was reduced to 86/6 at lunch.

Surya and Shashank Attarde (35 off 51 balls; 6x4) then rallied the innings with their 88-run stand off 92 balls with Attarde playing the second fiddle.

Surya played a responsible knock as he took the team out of the rubble.

In reply, Karnataka openers Devdutt Padikkal (32; 5x4) and R Samarth (40 not out) gave the visitors a sedate start by conjuring 68 for the first wicket.

However, left arm spinner Shams Mulani pegged back Karnataka by removing Padikkal and Abhishek Reddy (0) in the same over as Karnataka were 68-2. Rohan Kadam (4) was dismissed by offie Attarde.

At stumps, Karnataka were 79/3 with skipper Karun Nair (0 batting) with Samarth as Karnataka still trail by 115 runs.

delhi restrict Punjab

Mohali: Delhi’s seamer all-rounder Kunwar Bidhuri and leg-spinner Tejas Baroka restricted Punjab to 266 for eight after Shubman Gill grabbed headlines for arguing with an umpire in at IS Bindra stadium.

Bidhuri (3/62 in 13 overs) and Baroka (2/34 in 10 overs) put the brakes on scoring on the opening day of the Group A match. Skipper Mandeep Singh’s painstaking (81 off 181 balls) was the only saving grace for the hosts.

Gurkeerat Mann (65 off 50 balls) entertained for a while as he struck 12 boundaries in his innings before a delivery from left-arm spinner Vikas Mishra (1/52 in 29 overs), whose job was to bowl wicket to wicket and keep one end tight, castled him.

Mandeep and Anmolpreet Singh (45) had a 64-run stand before Bidhuri got one to held its line and trap Anmol plumb in-front.

Sharad Lumba (0) gave a return catch to Baroka, who also removed Anmol Malhotra, caught by skipper Dhruv Shorey.

At 223 for six, Mandeep didn’t have the option to attack as Bidhuru struck twice with the old ball, castling Mayank Markande and then getting Mandeep caught by substitute fielder Vaibhav Kandpal.

Maharashtra 44 all out

New Delhi: Services bowled out Maharashtra for 44 with medium pacer P S Poonia returning figures of 5/11.

By stumps on the opening day, Services took full control of the Group C game by taking a 97-run lead.

189,04-1-20,Labuschagne on the wheel,"Marnus Labuschagne hit his fourth century in just 14 Tests to guide Australia into a commanding position against virus-hit New Zealand on the opening day of the third Test in Sydney on Friday.

The rock-solid number three, last year’s leading Test scorer with 1,104 runs at 64.94, again proved the Black Caps’ nemesis with his second ton of the series to continue his remarkable scoring sequence.

Supported by Steve Smith’s 28th Test half-century, Australia reached stumps at 283 for three with Labuschagne unbeaten on 130 and Matthew Wade a breezy 22 not out.

The South African-born Labuschagne has now scored four centuries in seven Test innings this southern summer against Pakistan and New Zealand.

“Terrific day,” he said. “When you bat on day one you know it can be a real prosperous day but if you get off to a shaky start it can be tough work.

“It’s all a bit of a whirlwind at the moment. I haven’t really sat down and completely thought about how amazing this summer has been for me.”

Smith, who took 39 balls to get off the mark, shared in a 156-run stand with Labuschagne before he again missed out after a lengthy stay and was caught at slip off Colin de Grandhomme for 63 off 182 balls.

David Warner fell again to the leg-side trap on the third ball after lunch when he was caught by de Grandhomme at leg gully off Neil Wagner for 45.

It was the fourth time in the series left-armer Wagner has snared Warner, who has yet to reach a half-century against New Zealand this summer after scoring an unbeaten 335 and 154 against Pakistan last November.

Opener Joe Burns was dismissed in the 15th over, squared up by de Grandhomme and caught by Taylor at first slip for 18.

The Black Caps went into the Sydney Test without skipper and star batsman Kane Williamson, who has been ill in the lead-up.

Batsman Henry Nicholls and spinner Mitchell Santner were other illness withdrawals while Southee lost his place to leg-spinner Todd Astle.

Paceman Trent Boult is also missing after returning home with a broken hand suffered in the second Test in Melbourne.

Batsman Glenn Phillips, who made a late dash to Sydney as cover on Thursday, was named to make his Test debut, with opener Tom Latham to lead the side in Williamson’s absence.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/labuschagne-on-the-wheel.html
190,04-1-20,in continuum,"Sooryavanshi has a hint for fans awaiting Singham 3, reveals actor Ajay Devgn

Fans are waiting with bated breath for the third installment of Ajay Devgn’s iconic character DCP Bajirao Singham and the superstar has just dropped a hint about the films release. When quizzed about Singham 3, Ajay said, “Yes it will happen but right now we are doing Golmaal first. Then maybe after that, we will do Singham. When you see Sooryavanshi, you will get the answer. The answer is there in that film. Even in Sooryavanshi, I’m there.”

As of now, Ajay is busy promoting his forthcoming film, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, a period drama delving into the life of Tanaji Malusare, a brave leader in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s Maratha army. However, not more than a paragraph can be found about Tanaji in history books. And that’s exactly the reason why Ajay Devgn has chosen to make a film on him.

The actor also revealed that he has started this series called Unsung Warriors, which will feature other similar sons of our nation who have sacrificed so much for their motherland but have been ignored in the pages of history books.

Ajay shared, “That is the whole idea that’s why we have started this series called Unsung Warriors. Like Tanhaji is limited to Maharashtra but he has fought for the whole country. There are such people in Punjab, Bengal, Rajasthan and other parts of the country who have made big sacrifices but they are limited to their states. There are great stories which need to be told. The idea is to bring these people out and make them known pan India because they have sacrificed for the entire country and not just for their state.”

Period dramas are currently a popular trend in Bollywood. However, Ajay claims that he did not make Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior to follow any trend. He expressed, “I don’t know if there is a trend but you hear good stories and you want to tell them. I think, people are getting educated by finding out good stories because they want to make good films. So that’s how it has happened. The research of this film started four years back. That time there was no trend. It just happens sometimes.”

Indian cinema is currently witnessing a historical change. A change from the tradition of hero-worshipping film stars to shifting the prime focus on content. In such a time, the definition of stardom is changing, feels Ajay Devgn. The actor shared, “Of course, it is changing. I think now stars are becoming…it depends from film to film. However, big you are as an actor, if the film is not good it has its limitations. It will open big maybe but stop at a point. So content has become very important. Audience does not want to waste money to see rubbish and that is very good for us because it keeps us on our toes.”

Many B-Towners feel OTT platforms are giving a tough competition to the mainstream cinema because the audience, especially youngsters, are hooked on to web shows these days. However, for Ajay Devgn, the glass is also half full. He said, “Not really. It has become a competition but it is helping us a lot also. OTT platforms are increasing the shelf life of our films. Otherwise, once it was out of the theatre, you never remembered that this film was there. Now, people do remember. They can keep going back and watch it again and again. Even people who have missed it (from the theatres) can watch it.”

The film directed by Om Raut hits theatres on January 10.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-continuum-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/in-continuum.html
191,04-1-20,"Once more, with feeling","TS Eliot’s letters to his confidante and rumoured muse Emily Hale will be unveiled after 60 years

After more than 60 years spent sealed up in a library storage facility, about 1,000 letters written by poet TS Eliot to confidante Emily Hale will be unveiled this week and scholars hope they will reveal the extent of a relationship that’s been speculated about for decades.

Many consider Hale to not only be his close friend, but also his muse and they hope their correspondence will offer insight into the more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work. Students, researchers and scholars can read the letters at Princeton University Library starting Thursday.

“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” says Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the TS Eliot International Summer School. She added, “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”

Lifelong friends, Hale and Eliot exchanged letters for about 25 years beginning in 1930. The two met in 1912 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but did not rekindle their friendship until 1927. Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at US universities, including Scripps College in California.

In 1956, Hale donated the letters under an agreement they wouldn’t be opened until 50 years after either her or Eliot’s death, whichever came second. Eliot died in 1965. Hale died four years later.

Biographers say Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned. Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” Cuda says.

TS Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock became his first professionally published poem.

Eliot’s 1939 book of whimsical poetry, Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, was adapted into Cats, the award-winning musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The play opened in London first in 1981 and then on Broadway the next year. It was then turned into a feature film starring an ensemble cast that includes Judi Dench and James Corden just released in December.

His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets. The first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton, piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.

“His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it’s a door he chose not to open,” she said. The letters could also reveal details about Eliot’s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.

Dickey, who served as one of the editors on The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he was with for more than 15 years. Dickey said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were and if the two ever considered marriage. “Was this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic?” Dickey said. “What role did she play in his emotional life?”

Eliot’s letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended. Whatever else she was, Hale was a link to the life Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Dickey said. “He was really thinking more about the US and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale. I have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way,” he added.

The unsealed boxes, which also contain photographs, clippings and other ephemera, were actually opened at the library’s special collections area called Firestone Library in October for cataloging and digitising. Daniel Linke, interim head of special collections at the library, was part of the team working on the 14 boxes. He said there was very minimal, if any, reading.

He said that scholars from around the world will be traveling to Princeton in the first days they are available since they are copyrighted and won’t be made available online. “It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,” Linke said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/once-more--with-feeling-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/once-more--with-feeling.html
192,04-1-20,"Zverev, Tsitsipas upset at ATP Cup","Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas both crashed to defeat in their first matches of the year on Friday as day one of the inaugural ATP Cup sprung some big upsets.

The German world number seven was stunned by Australia’s fast-improving Alex de Minaur, who rallied from a set and 4-2 down to win 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2.

Greek star Tsitsipas, who won the 2019 season-ending ATP Finals in London and is now ranked six, slumped to a 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7/4) loss to young Canadian Denis Shapovalov.

It led to both Germany and Greece being defeated in their opening ties at the 24-nation event, where the countries are split into six groups across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

The top eight from the round robin go onto the knockout phase in Sydney before one is eventually crowned the winner.

Along with Australia and Canada, Belgium also won, sweeping Moldova 3-0, while tennis minnows Norway pulled off a big 2-1 upset against the United States.

Drawcards Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic make their debut today, for Spain in Perth and Serbia in Brisbane respectively.

“It’s definitely up there,” said de Minaur in Brisbane, when asked how the victory ranked in his career. “This one feels very, very good.

Earlier, Nick Kyrgios beat Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 7-6 (7/4).

“First game, first match of the year is always going to be tough,” said Kyrgios, who has pledged Aus$200 (US$140) for every ace he serves during the Australian tennis summer to help victims of bushfires that are raging across Australia.

“To be honest, I was actually pretty happy with my performance.”

Tsitsipas went into his match with Shapovalov, also in Brisbane, as slight favourite, with the Canadian ranked nine places below him.

But Shapovalov’s left-handed serve was working beautifully and Tsitsipas faltered at key moments in both tiebreaks.

With teammate Michail Pervolarakis being thrashed by Felix Auger-Aliassime in two quick sets, Greece lost their opening tie.

The United States were also upset, with emerging Norwegian youngster Casper Ruud beating big-serving John Isner. He then backed up in the decisive doubles alongside Viktor Durasovic to ensure the win.

Earlier, Taylor Fritz had thrashed Durasovic 6-2, 6-2 to give the US a 1-0 lead.

193,04-1-20,Faction feud intensifies in AICF,"The faction feud within the All India Chess Federation has intensified after the Federation President PR Venketarama Raja formed a three-member committee to oversee the AICF elections in Ahmedabad on February 9. AICF secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan has accused Raja of misusing his power and asked him to refrain from taking such arbitrary actions.

In a letter dated January 3, Chauhan has hit back at Raja, saying, “We are surprised and shocked to receive your so called office order allegedly forming a three member committee to administer the affairs of the Federation till the elections are conducted on 09/02/2020 at Ahmedabad. This is a blatant abuse of your office, in no case you have the authority to take away powers and authorities of other 14 elected members of AICF. We would also like to bring forward your conduct in past three months, wherein you have issued following orders/decisions under Article 15 of the byelaws of the Federation.”

Chauhan has listed a series of actions, which he feels, were arbitrary taken by Raja in gross misuse of his power.

Among these are Raja’s decision to appoint an enquiry committee on the complaint of Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua without consulting the AICF secretary. Chauhan has also criticized Raja for not including him in the committee despite AICF constitution clearly stating that the Secretary has to be part of any such committee. Chauhan has also accused Raja of unilaterally cancelling the Central Council meeting called by him on December 22. Chauhan has also question Raja’s decision to serve on him a show cause notice on “flimsy” charges.

“All above orders/decisions have ipso facto become illegal on their own. It is also not out place to mention that many of your orders/decisions have already been rejected by GB (General Body) and CC (Central Council).As per the byelaws, you are required to use these powers in exception and only in emergency, but you started misusing the provision for trivial, small and for almost everything. It is expected from you not to use byelaws for your ulterior motive. Thus, with this communication we would request you to desist from sending such order/decision in future,” Chauhan writes.

The AICF is in turmoil mainly over corruption charges leveled by Arjuna Aawardee Dibyendu Barua against West Bengal Chess Association secretary Atanu Lahiri. After a three-member committee of the AICF set up by the Federation President and, opposed both by Barua and AICF secretary, gave a clean chit to Lahiri, the sports ministry discovered a major scandal involving Lahiri. Lahiri had submitted a fake utilization certificate of national sub junior championship and the signature of the chartered account was forged. The CA himself gave this in writing.

In the backdrop of this, the AICF held a special/urgent meeting of office bearers and state associations in Bhopal on December 28 in the presence of sports ministry observers.

After the meeting, AICF treasurer Kishor Bandrekar issued a press release alleging that Federation Secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan snatched mikes and spoke on issues outside the agenda and was lustily cheered by his “rowdy” supporters.

Bandrekar claimed that the AICF President didn’t allow Chauhan to discuss any other item and concluded the meeting after the West Bengal issue was taken up. Bandrekar claimed that Lahiri accused Barua and Chauhan of leveling frivolous charges against him and revealed that he had filed criminal defamation case against them.

On January 2, AICF joint secretary Naresh Sharma, who is also general secretary of the Haryana Chess Association, slammed the Federation Treasurer Kishor Bandrekar, who belongs to the Raja faction, accusing him of misrepresenting the outcome of the above meeting.

Sharma said the statement issued by Bandrekar is misleading and far from the truth. He said the President did not object to the proceedings in any manner whatsoever. “The Hon Secretary briefed the members present and the snatching of the mike as alleged by the treasurer did not happen at all. The President only left after all the points were discussed by the members present,” Sharma said.

Sharma claimed that only Vice President DV Sundar tried to suppress the democratic open discussion of the constituent members and their representatives, by exclaiming “Shut up; what do you know?”

There was no slogan by members present and the members only expressed their strong feelings about the various matters.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/faction-feud-intensifies-in-aicf.html
194,04-1-20,Zlatan wants to lift AC Milan,"Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic warned on Friday he is not back at AC Milan as a mascot but for the “last bit of adrenaline” and to lift a club he loved out of a difficult situation.

“I’m not here as a mascot to dance for the fans next to the Devil (Milan mascot),” the 38-year-old told a press conference.

“I’m looking for the last bit of adrenaline I might have. At my age you’re not looking for anything else but a challenge.

“When you’re 38 and get hired by AC Milan it’s something that doesn’t happen very often, coming here means I still have something to give.

“I got more requests now than when I was 28,” he continued.

“I am ready, I feel more than alive, I hope to play immediately.”

Ibrahimovic has signed a six-month contract worth 3.5 million euros ($3.9 million) with the option for an additional year.

It will mark the Swede’s second stint with Milan, seven years after he left for Paris Saint-Germain.

He played for the Rossoneri from 2010-2012 scoring 56 goals in 85 appearances and helped the club win their 18th and last league title in 2011.

One of the most successful clubs in the world the seven-times European champions are 11th in the table just seven points above relegation.

“After Atalanta I got lots and lots of calls, it wasn’t a difficult decision in the end,” continued Ibrahimovic.

“Last time I left Milan I didn’t want to leave. Milan gave me the happiness of playing soccer, I hope this will be true again.

“Things need to be improved in the field and that’s why I'm here.

“Milan is always AC Milan and the image of ACM is something that can’t be deleted, you can’t change history.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/zlatan-wants-to-lift-ac-milan.html
195,04-1-20,Hazard to miss Spanish Super Cup,"Eden Hazard’s injury-plagued start at Real Madrid will continue this month after Zinedine Zidane said on Friday the Belgian will not play in the Spanish Super Cup next week.

Hazard suffered an ankle fracture during Madrid’s draw against Paris Saint-Germain on November 26 and was expected to be out for around four to six weeks.

But Zidane has confirmed Hazard will miss Madrid’s La Liga game against Getafe today and will not travel to Saudi Arabia, where his team face Valencia in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals on Wednesday before a potential final against either Barcelona or Atletico Madrid four days later.

“He is 100 per cent out of the Super Cup,” said Zidane in a press conference. “He is not travelling, he is recovering and we hope that just after the Super Cup, little by little, we could see him with us again.”

If Hazard returns against Sevilla in La Liga on January 18 he will have been out for almost eight weeks.

The 28-year-old, who joined Real Madrid from Chelsea last summer, also missed three matches at the start of the season with a thigh strain.

Madrid found form without him before Christmas but trail Barcelona by two points in the table after consecutive draws in the Clasico at Camp Nou and then at home to Athletic Bilbao.

They play sixth-placed Getafe this weekend at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, where Zidane’s team were held to a goalless draw in April.

Marcelo and Lucas Vazquez are available again after recovering from injuries but Sergio Ramos is suspended, meaning Eder Militao is likely to play in central defence.

Zidane also suggested some fringe players could be allowed to leave in the January transfer window. Striker Mariano Diaz is among those that could depart.

“There are players that have not had minutes and that can be a problem but we speak with them like always,” Zidane said. “Between now and January 31 a lot can happen.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hazard-to-miss-spanish-super-cup.html

The Tottenham boss said the full extent of the problem would soon become apparent.

Kane pulled up as he slotted home Christian Eriksen’s free-kick 15 minutes from time on Wednesday but was flagged offside.

“I don’t know yet, I think maybe later today we have news,” Mourinho said. “But if you ask me just my feeling, good news or bad news, I am more bad news than good news, what the player felt, Harry Kane leaving a match the way he did.

197,04-1-20,Honours even on Day 1,"Ollie Pope hit a half-century to give England a late boost after they struggled against a disciplined South African bowling attack on the first day of the second Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday.

Pope made 56 not out as England struggled to 262 for nine on a day when the tourists, 1-0 down in the four-match series, failed to take advantage of what looked like a good batting pitch.

Before Pope prospered in a unbeaten last wicket stand of 28 with James Anderson after six England batsmen perished for scores between 29 and 47.

England’s problems were a tribute to the pressure exerted by the South African bowlers, who shared the wickets. Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje and Dwaine Pretorius took two each, while left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj kept a tight rein on the batsmen while sending down 27 overs and taking one for 68.

South Africa thought they had completed a highly satisfactory day when Pope was caught by Philander off Rabada shortly before the close with the total on 261 — but a review by the umpires showed that Rabada had sent down a no-ball.

The day after his 22nd birthday, Pope, who missed England's 107-run defeat in the first Test in Centurion because of illness, played a composed innings and shared a 58-run fifth wicket partnership with Ben Stokes which threatened to break the South African stranglehold.

Stokes reached 47 on the ground where he made a career-best 258 four years ago and was striking the ball crisply before he hit an awkward drive against the pace of Nortje and was caught at cover.

It came hours ahead of a planned mourning march for Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary heavyweight Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, slain in a precision drone strike by the US in Baghdad on Friday.

The assassination was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, which pledged to send more troops to the region even as US President Donald Trump insisted he did not want war.

The killing was the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between the US and Iran, which Iraqis fear could play out in their homeland.

Almost exactly 24 hours later, a new strike targeted a convoy belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary network whose Shiite-majority factions have close ties to Iran, the group said in a statement.

It did not say who was responsible but Iraqi state television reported it was a US air strike.

A police source told AFP the bombardment north of Baghdad left ""dead and wounded,"" without providing a specific toll. There was no immediate comment from the US.

The assassination of Soleimani, who had led the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' foreign operations branch and was Iran's pointman on Iraq, rattled the region. US officials said the 62-year-old, who had been blacklisted by the US, was killed when a drone hit his vehicle near Baghdad's international airport.

A total of five Revolutionary Guards and five Hashed members were killed in the strike.

Their bodies were to be taken through an elaborate mourning procession on Saturday, beginning with a state funeral in Baghdad and ending in the holy shrine city of Najaf.

The bodies of the Guards would then be sent to Iran, which had declared three days of mourning for Soleimani.

Tehran has already named Soleimani's deputy, Esmail Qaani, to succeed him.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-air-strike-on-pro-iran-convoy-in-iraq-ahead-of-soleimani-funeral-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/new-air-strike-on-pro-iran-convoy-in-iraq-ahead-of-soleimani-funeral.html

Official sources said two light metro corridors are proposed to be built in the constituency which Adityanath represented in Parliament. All stations will be elevated and the project is estimated to cost around Rs 4,589 crore, they said.

The first corridor will be 15.14-km long from Shyam Nagar to MMM Engineering College.

201,04-1-20,India close to concluding a trade package with US: Shringla,"India and the US are close to concluding a trade package that would provide enhanced market access to both countries, India's outgoing Ambassador to the US Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said.

Shringla made the comments while addressing a group of Indian-American entrepreneurs during a farewell lunch on Friday organised for him by TiE DC, a regional chapter of the global non-profit membership and mentoring organization for entrepreneurs.

“We are close to concluding a trade package that would provide enhanced market access to both countries,” Shringla said during the event.

The outgoing Ambassador, who would take up his new assignment as India's next foreign secretary later this month, however, did not give an exact date for the inking of the much anticipated trade deal.

The trade deal was first announced by US President Donald Trump when he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New York in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

Trump on September 24 said his country will soon have a trade deal with India to boost economic ties between the two nations.

Shringla said the signing of the trade package would pave the way for a much bigger bilateral trade deal between the two largest democracies of the world, which will only benefit the companies of the two countries.

“We see a lot of openings,” he said.

Shringla, who is scheduled to leave for India later this month, said that the India- US bilateral trade has increased significantly in the last one decade and it is expected to be over USD160 billion by 2019.

Noting that there are a lot of complementarities between the Indian and the US economy, the Ambassador said that Indian-American entrepreneurs and in particular organizations like TiE DC play an important part in strengthening these bilateral ties, not only people to people but also economic and strategic relationship.

Ravi Puli, an entrepreneur from TiE DC, said that in just about an year, Shringla has made a great impact on India-US relationship.

“As an ambassador, he has taken the US- India relations to a level that all of us are feeling very proud and we are looking forward to take it even further with his leadership as a foreign secretary of India,” he said.

The event was attended by eminent Indian-American entrepreneurs from in and around Washington DC and leaders of other chapters from various parts of the country.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-close-to-concluding-a-trade-package-with-us--shringla-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-close-to-concluding-a-trade-package-with-us--shringla.html

205,04-1-20,Steyn in talks for int’l comeback,"Injury-ravaged South African pace legend Dale Steyn says this year’s Twenty20 World Cup is very much on his “agenda” and he will begin another effort at an international comeback with the series against England next month.

Steyn, who retired from Test cricket last year, has been battling to keep his career alive in the other two formats despite being hampered by a recurring shoulder injury. The 36-year-old is currently playing in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Stars. “I know I’ll be part of (the T20 series against England), that was the last conversation I’ve had. I get a nice two-week break, then straight into it again. I’ll be around for the ODIs — to be honest, I don’t know how much I’ll play (the ODIs) … I’ll be there for that and then definitely the T20s,” he told cricket.Com.Au.

“That (T20 World Cup) is very much on my agenda. I’m starting to enjoy my cricket a lot more now, I think four overs is a lot easier on the body than the Test matches are,” he added.

“KG (Kagiso Rabada) is very young — to lead the attack at 24, and the next bowlers to come in are all younger than him, I think he needs somebody that’s there that is experienced, to look around and he knows he’s not only one there,” Steyn said.

“So I’m putting my hand up for that and then I’ll wait and see how selections goes. After the MSL (Mzansi Super League) that we played, there were a lot of players that come out — some fantastic bowlers.

“But the old guys still seem to do the trick — AB (de Villiers) was there, Imran Tahir was taking wickets, I was up in the wickets. Maybe we will get the nod, maybe we don’t — but I’m putting my hand up,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/steyn-in-talks-for-int---l-comeback.html
206,04-1-20,"Get fit or take a pay cut, Pakistan tell cricketers","Pakistan’s centrally-contracted players will have to meet the fitness standards set by the team management or else lose 15 per cent of their monthly salary, the country’s cricket board (PCB) warned on Friday.

The directive came after new head coach Misbah-ul-Haq had termed that top level fitness is paramount for national team players as lack of it has been the reason for team’s steady decline.

The PCB has said that a player will be subjected to a 15 per cent deduction from his monthly retainer fees in case he fails to meet the minimum fitness requirements while a “consistent defaulter” will risk a chance of getting relegated to a lower grade.

“A player failing to meet the minimum fitness requirements will be fined 15 per cent of his monthly retainer, which will remain effective until such time he achieves the minimum fitness standards,” a PCB statement read.

“Player failing consecutive tests will risk the chances of retaining his central contract category and may face demotion,” it added

The test will cover five major areas, namely fat analysis, strength, endurance, speed endurance and cross-fit, and will carry equal weightage.

“There has always been an emphasis on the monitoring of players’ fitness levels,” PCB Director Cricket — International, Zakir Khan said.

“This time we have decided to enforce penalties, which is in accordance with the contracts, as part of our objective to make the players more accountable and responsible for maintaining high fitness standards throughout the year.

“All the players were informed last month of the PCB’s expectations and potential sanctions in the scenario of failures,” he added.

Khan further said that domestic players will also have to undergo the tests.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s centrally contracted players, including Babar Azam, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Shaheen Afridi will undergo fitness tests here on January 6 and 7.

The two-day testing will be held under the tutelage of Pakistan cricket team’s strength and conditioning coach Yasir Malik at the National Cricket Academy.

“All the available centrally contracted players will attend the two-day testing, which is aligned to their contracts,” the PCB said.

“Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir and Shadab Khan, who will be occupied with their commitments in the Bangladesh Premier League, will undergo the tests on January 20 and 21,” it further added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/get-fit-or-take-a-pay-cut--pakistan-tell-cricketers.html
207,04-1-20,Saini excited to share new ball with Jasprit,"Navdeep Saini didn’t get a chance to share the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah in his six international games and no wonder he is excited at an opportunity to pick the brains of India’s pace spearhead during the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.

Saini, has so far played an ODI and five T20Is but Bumrah has either been rested or was out due to his stress fracture on lower back during these games.

“I can now share my weaknesses and shortcomings with him. I can learn more by watching him bowl. It will be a good opportunity for me. I am really looking forward to it,” Saini said on Friday.

The 27-year-old had a memorable last year when he made impressive debut in white ball cricket as he hopes put in those hard yards to cement his place in a highly competitive bowling attack ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup in October.

“Our bowling attack is the strongest at the moment and that gives me that extra motivation. And that I have to work even harder to secure a regular spot,” he said when asked where does he see himself in the World Cup-bound Australia squad.

Saini is aware that it’s very tough to secure a place with so much of competition in the ranks.

“From hereon, every match and series is important for me. If I do well, I can also grow well as a cricketer and the team will also win. I don’t think too far ahead. Always I take one match at a time and think of giving my best every time.

“All my hard work paid off and I had a successful 2019. It’s about putting in that extra mile again so as to secure my place.”

For Saini, the challenge will be to become mentally stronger when the batsmen go on offensive.

“It’s about becoming mentally strong. Everything boils down to the fact that how strong you are mentally. You can put in that hardwork of you are strong mentally.”

Known for his fiery pace with ability to bowl consistently as 140kph, Saini said his success mantra is sheer hardwork and nothing else.

“It’s nothing but sheer hardwork. That’s the only secret. There is no other formula. It’s as simple as that,” he signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saini-excited-to-share-new-ball-with-jasprit.html
208,04-1-20,Fit-again Bumrah shows his wares at nets,"Jasprit Bumrah started off from where he had left before being laid low by stress fracture as he bowled flat out at the India nets ahead of their first T20I against Sri Lanka tomorrow.

Closely monitored by team’s support headed by Ravi Shastri, Bumrah hit the straps straightway, bowling with pace on a breezy winter evening even as the Sri Lankan team decided to take rest for the day.

Bumrah was seen mixing up his deliveries as there were yorkers, variety of bouncers, bowling in tandem with Shardul Thakur and Shivam Dube. He also did the single stump practice to get his channel right.

After bowling every delivery, Bumrah was seen engaged in a discussions with the team think-tank as he continued the exercise for about 45 minutes.

The Indian fielding session was mainly about taking high catches with the likes of Kohli, Bumrah, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer taking turns under lights to get into the groove.

The likes of Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal were not seen during India’s optional practice.

Having missed competitive cricket for more than three months due to his lower back injury, the three-T20I series will mark the return of Bumrah in the New Year after achieving a some high points in a phenomenal 2019.

From three Tests in 2019, Bumrah picked 14 wickets at an average of 13.14 including two five-wicket hauls — both against the West Indies in North Sound and Kingston, becoming the only Asian bowler in history to bag five-fors in South Africa, England, Australia and West Indies. He also had 25 wickets in 14 ODIs during the year.

At the Sabina Park, Bumrah became only the third Indian bowler after Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan to record a hat-trick in the longest format.

There’s a rain forecast for the remaining two days but the Assam Cricket Association officials are confident of hosting the match.

“It’s a T20 fixture and even if it rains in the morning, it will dry out by evening. Today also it rained in the morning but practice was not affected,” ACA secretary Devajit Saikia said.

According to the local curator, there could be some dew towards the evening as the pitch wore a tinge of grass and was closely inspected by Shastri and bowling coach Bharath Arun.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fit-again-bumrah-shows-his-wares-at-nets-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/fit-again-bumrah-shows-his-wares-at-nets.html
209,04-1-20,"Real Madrid will improve in 2020, says Zidane","Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has said his objective is to improve the team in 2020 following a difficult 2019 in which the Spanish powerhouse failed to pick up any silverware.

""We dropped points, that's a reality Zidane told a press conference on Friday. ""But it's a complicated season in which it's difficult to secure points all the time because there are teams that play well. The most important thing is to give everything, that's the strength of this time,"" Efe news quoted him as saying.

""We are going to try to improve in 2020,"" he added.

He said players had returned from the Christmas break motivated to get working ahead of the Supercopa tie against Getafe on Saturday.

""The fight always goes on. I would underline the desire we have to get out and play again.""

Looking into the second half of the season, Madrid faces a tough campaign domestically in La Liga and on a European level in the Champions League.

""Failure would be to not try, to not give everything.

But he did give a special mention to Isco Alarcon, whom he said he identified with.

210,04-1-20,1st T20 Int'l: Bumrah boost spices up Indo-Lanka contest in T20 World Cup year,"Comeback man Jasprit Bumrah will be cynosure of all eyes during India's first T20 international against Sri Lanka in the year 2020 where its namesake global meet will gain precedence over everything for the 'Men In Blue'.

Out for four months with a back stress fracture, the 26-year-old Bumrah is that precious diamond in this Indian set-up, which had been wrapped in cotton wool during the rehabilitation period.

So much so that he was even exempted from playing domestic first-class cricket for Gujarat after intervention from BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, keeping in mind the workload he will have to take post international comeback.

If 2019 was all about focussing on 50-over format, the current year will witness the Indian team playing close to 15 games before their T20 World Cup campaign starts against South Africa in Perth in October.

There are slots to be locked and till Indian Premier League ends, a clearer picture is unlikely to emerge. But that won't stop head coach Ravi Shastri and skipper Virat Kohli to set the ball rolling in this current series.

It all starts here at the Barsapara Stadium on Sunday as the biggest city in Assam is slowly getting back to normalcy after protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Indian team would be checking out how the likes Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur react to pressure situations in death overs alongside Bumrah in the absence of frontline speedsters Mohammed Shami (rested), Deepak Chahar (stress fracture) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (sports hernia).

Washington Sundar is still work in progress and he would like to put up performances that can ensure that only one among Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal can be picked in playing XI at any given point of time.

Shivam Dube is a big hitter for sure but whether his seam up stuff can withstand the onslaught on docile tracks till Hardik Pandya is fully fit and back in action is yet to be seen.

And that lingering question on Rishabh Pant's consistency with Sanju Samson having already warmed the benches for six straight T20 games and the invisible presence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, making things a little unsettling.

While Bumrah predictably grabs more eyeballs, the series is also important for Shikhar Dhawan, making a comeback into the team post knee injury.

He will also look to make an impact in absence of rested vice-captain Rohit Sharma with KL Rahul in red-hot form at the other end.

On his return to competitive cricket, the Delhi left-hander smashed 140 against Hyderabad in a Ranji Trophy match as he will look to score in a format, where he has 272 runs in 12 innings to show for his efforts in 2019.

In their last T20I series, Sri Lanka suffered a 0-3 rout in Australia as their batsmen struggled and will be under scrutiny.

The relied heavily on Kusal Perera, who was their leading run-getter with 100 runs from three matches in Australia in October-November.

They would also look forward to the return of former Sri Lankan captain, Angelo Mathews, who last played a T20I against South Africa in August 2018.

Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Oshada Fernando and Danushka Gunathilaka were their batting mainstays in their 3-0 win in Pakistan in October as they will look forward to return among runs.

Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga led the bowling in Pakistan with eight wickets from three matches at an average of 9.87 but was ineffective in Australia as he will also look to contribute.

India lost their only T20 match against Australia on October 10, 2017, which was further marred by stone-pelting on the team bus on post-match return to hotel.

It's time for Kohli's men to rewrite their poor record here.

Squads

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Sanju Samson, Rishabh Pant (wk), Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini and Washington Sundar.

211,04-1-20,"Not in favour of four-day Tests, says India captain Kohli","Indian captain Virat Kohli on Saturday strongly opposed the ""four-day Test"" proposed by the ICC as he is not in favour of any alterations which hurts the sanctity of the traditional five-day format.

The ICC wants to try out the four-day Test matches during the next FTP cycle between 2023-2031 in order to get more free days for the commercially lucrative shorter formats.

While this is at the proposal stage, Cricket Australia had expressed its intent of trying out the format even though senior bowler Nathan Lyon termed it ""ridiculous"".

""According to me, it should not be altered. As I said, the day-night is another step towards commercialising Test cricket and you know, creating excitement around it, but it can't be tinkered with too much. I don't believe so,"" Kohli, one of the biggest names in world cricket, told mediapersons on the eve of first T20 against Sri Lanka.

India recently played Day/Night Tests and that's about the change Kohli would like in the five-day version for now.

""You know the Day-Night Test is the most that should be changed about Test cricket, according to me,"" he said.

The India captain feels that the intent in reducing a day from five can't be right and then one might talk about having ""three-day Tests"".

""Then you are purely only talking about getting numbers, entertainment and you know. I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests. I mean where do you end. Then you will speak of Test cricket disappearing,"" Kohli was forthright in his answer.

""So I don't endorse that at all. I don't think that is fair to the purest format of the game. How cricket started initially, and you know five-day Tests was the highest of tests you can have at the International level.""

With thumbs down from currently the most influential international cricketer, ICC might find it difficult to implement it.

""T20 was a revelation (in terms) of introduction of a new format. I was asked about the 100-ball format (introduced by ECB) and I said I am not going to go and try myself out in another kind of format because there's already so much going on.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-in-favour-of-four-day-tests--says-india-captain-kohli-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-in-favour-of-four-day-tests--says-india-captain-kohli.html

213,04-1-20,US kills Iran’s top General,"Gen Soleimani should have been eliminated years ago, says Trump

The US military killed General Qasem Soleimani, the powerful commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, in a drone strike in Iraq on Friday to protect American personnel abroad, dramatically escalating hostilities between the arch-rivals and spiking tensions in the already volatile Persian Gulf region.

Gen Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed when a drone fired missiles into a convoy that was leaving the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq’s powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force and some local Iran-backed militias.

Gen Soleimani, 62, was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran behind the Ayatollah Khamenei. His Quds Force, an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reported directly to the ayatollah and he was hailed as a heroic national figure.

The Pentagon said, “At the direction of the president, the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation.”

Following Soleimani’s killing, Trump, on vacation in Florida, initially tweeted an image of the US flag. Hours later, he tweeted again. “Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” he wrote, in an apparent slight against the nuclear deal Barack Obama negotiated with Tehran.

The strike comes days after Trump threatened Tehran after Iraqi supporters of pro-Iranian regime laid siege to the US embassy in Baghdad, following deadly American air strikes on a hardline Hashed faction.

Gen Soleimani and officials from Iran-backed militias were leaving Baghdad airport in two cars when they were hit.

He had reportedly flown in from Lebanon or Syria. Several missiles struck the convoy and at least six people are believed to have died, according to media reports from Baghdad.

The Pentagon alleged that the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.

“General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more,” it said.

The Pentagon said that Soleimani had “orchestrated” attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December 27 - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.

“General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” it said.

“The US will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world,” it said. Meanwhile, global oil prices have soared by more than four per cent in the wake of the attack.

The news of Soleimani’s killing generated different reactions in Washington along party lines with Republicans heaping praise on Trump and Democrats expressing concerns about the legality and consequences of the strike.

“I appreciate President @realDonaldTrump’s bold action against Iranian aggression,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a fierce Trump ally, tweeted. “To the Iranian government: if you want more, you will get more.”

Trump’s decision was supported by his former Cabinet colleague, Indian- American Nikki Haley, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations. “Qasem Soleimani was an arch terrorist with American blood on his hands. His demise should be applauded by all who seek peace and justice. Proud of President Trump for doing the strong and right thing,” she tweeted.

Senator Marco Rubio backed Trump’s action in a tweet. “They chose to ignore these warnings because they believed @POTUS was constrained from acting by our domestic political divisions. They badly miscalculated,” he said.

Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also running for president in the Democratic primary, called it a “dangerous escalation” that brings the US “closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-kills-iran---s-top-general-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/us-kills-iran---s-top-general.html
214,04-1-20,Khamenei threatens ‘severe revenge’,"Iran has warned of “severe revenge” and said arch-enemy the United States bore responsibility for the consequences after killing one of its top commanders, Qasem Soleimani, in a strike Friday outside Baghdad airport.

In Tehran, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “severe revenge awaits the criminals” behind the attack. He also announced three days of national mourning. “For years it was his wish to become a martyr, and finally God granted him his highest office”, Khamenei said.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed the commander of its Quds Force foreign operations arm had been killed by US forces in Baghdad, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif denouncing it as a “dangerous escalation”.

“The Revolutionary Guards announces that the glorious commander of Islam, haj Qasem Soleimani, following a life of servitude, was martyred in an attack by America on Baghdad airport this morning,” the Guards said.

“Two vehicles were attacked with missiles by US forces” and all 10 passengers, including Soleimani, were “martyred”, said Iran’s ambassador to Iraq, Iraj Masjedi.

The Quds Force said the dead consisted of five members of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network and five Guards — Brigadier General Hossein Pourjafari, Colonel Shahroud Mozafarinia, Major Hadi Taremi and Captain Vahid Zamanian.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened “severe revenge” for “the criminals who bloodied their foul hands with (Soleimani’s) blood”, and vowed that “God willing, his work and his path will not be stopped”.

He also declared three days of mourning. State television interrupted its regular programming to detail Soleimani’s achievements in the region, recalling the many times he had “foiled” US plans.

A black ribbon was displayed on the screen and a photo montage was shown with images of Soleimani smiling and praying.

Soleimani was one of the most popular figures in Iran and seen as a deadly adversary by America and its allies. President Hassan Rouhani said Iran and the “free nations of the region” would take revenge on the US for “this gruesome crime”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/khamenei-threatens-----severe-revenge---.html
215,04-1-20,Won’t budge on CAA: Shah,"HM launches law awareness

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said the Government will not budge an inch on its decision to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act despite the Opposition criticism of the law.

Launching an “awareness programme” in support of the amended citizenship law, Shah accused the Congress and other Opposition parties of running a misinformation campaign.

He said the amended law does not take away Indian citizenship from anyone but grants citizenship.

Opposition parties have criticised the amendment which allows non-Muslims an easier path to citizenship if they have come to India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution.

Shah accused the Congress of playing vote-bank politics by spreading “misinformation”. “No provision in the Citizenship Amendment Act to take anyone’s citizenship away, it is a law to grant citizenship. Minorities living honourably in India while their percentage declined in neighbouring countries,” the Home Minister said.

The Jodhpur rally by Shah is the first of 30 mega rallies planned by the BJP across the country to reach out to people on the new Citizenship law, NRC and NPR. According to Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the city has around 25,000 refugees from Pakistan seeking citizenship under the new law.

Earlier on Thursday, the Minister said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was not on the agenda of the Government yet. However, asked if it had been put in cold storage, he said he had never said that and added that the CAA should be discussed now. He also targeted the Opposition for spreading misinformation about the CAA.

“Pradhanmantri ne ye kaha hai ki abhi NRC nahi aa raha hai. Aur main bhi keh raha hun ki abhi NRC ki charcha nahi hai (The PM has only said that NRC is not coming as yet. I am also saying that there is no talk of NRC now),” Shah said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/won---t-budge-on-caa--shah-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/won---t-budge-on-caa--shah.html
216,04-1-20,Kerala CM writes to 11 counterparts for united fight,"Days after a Kerala Assembly resolution demanded that the CAA be scrapped, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday wrote to 11 non-BJP Chief Ministers asking them to take similar steps against the controversial law and pitching for unity to protect democracy and secularism.

The Kerala Assembly had on Tuesday passed the resolution — supported by ruling CPIM-led LDF and Opposition Congress headed UDF — demanding the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Kerala became the first State to take such a course amid the continuing protests against the citizenship law in various parts of the country.

Vijayan, who has been strident in his Opposition to the CAA, wrote to Chief Ministers of 11 States, including Bihar’s Nitish Kumar, an ally of BJP, saying there was need to stand united in preserving the country’s democracy and secularism.

“The need of the hour is unity among all Indians who wish to protect and preserve our cherished values of democracy and secularism.

“People from various cross sections of the society irrespective of any difference they might have, need to stand united in preserving the basic tenets of our polity which form the cornerstone of Indian democracy,” he said in his letter, a copy of which was released to the media here.

Vijayan, the lone Left Chief Minister in the country, claimed apprehensions have arisen among large sections of the society consequent to the CAA.

He drew attention of the 11 States to the resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly on December 31 expressing its concern regarding the impact the CAA on the “nation’s secular credentials” and urging the Centre to repeal it.

States, which have the opinion that the CAA should be repealed, can also consider similar steps so that it will be an “eyeopener” to the proponents of the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC),” Vijayan said.

The Marxist veteran expressed hope that the unity in diversity of the country, which has stood the test of times, will ultimately emerge stronger.

“Kerala has decided to address the apprehensions about NRC that preparations of NPR (National Population Register) will lead to NRC by staying all activities relating to NPR in the State,” he said in the letter.

Vijayan’s appeal to his counterparts comes a day after Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said the resolution passed by the State Assembly against CAA has absolutely no Constitutional or legal validity.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had criticised the Left Government for passing the resolution and said Vijayan should seek “better legal advice.”

Vijayan sent identical letter to Chief Ministers Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi), Hemant Soren (Jharkhand), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), YS Jaganmohan Reddy (Andhra Pradesh), Kamal Nath (Madhya Pradesh), Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan) Naveen Patnaik (Odisha) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kerala-cm-writes-to-11-counterparts-for-united-fight.html
217,04-1-20,PM-UDAY helps Delhi’s illegal colony residents save Rs 90 lakh,"Centre gives 20 houses ownership papers in Delhi

Twenty residents of unauthorised colonies in Delhi saved money on registration of land as Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday handed over conveyance deeds and registry papers of houses to 20 residents of unauthorised colonies. The documents were given to the residents of Raja Vihar and Samaypur Badli at a Press conference here, ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls.

Karam Wati, Ashok Kumar Singh and Karma Chand Sharma, all residents of Suraj Park here, saved a whopping Rs 97 lakh, 66 lakh and 60 lakh respectively on their land registration charges as they got ownership rights under the PM-UDAY (Prime Minister - Unauthorized Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana).

Also, residents in Raja Vihar witnessed huge savings by paying as little as Rs 400 towards registration fee.

The Centre on Friday released the first list of 20 beneficiaries who were given the conveyance deeds and registry documents. So far, the Ministry has received 57,000 applications, which are being processed.

Dubbing the Friday event as “ceremonial”, Puri said in the coming days, more residents of unauthorised colonies will be given conveyance deeds and registry papers.

According Puri, the 20 beneficiaries were required to pay small amounts and thus they made huge saving. Citing benefits under the PM-UDAY, Puri said Pinki Sharma, who has a house measuring 41.8 sqm and has four floors, paid only Rs 19,400 under the scheme and hence she saved around Rs 23.90 lakh.

The circle rate (minimum value at which sale or transfer of a plot, built-up houses, apartment, commercial property or land takes place) of Suraj Park was Rs 46,200 per square meter while Rs 23,280 per sqm for Raja Vihar area.

Rupanjay, a resident of Raja Vihar, owns 42.6 sqm and having two floors, paid only Rs 700 under the scheme and hence, he saved around Rs 12.59 lakh. Ashok Kumar a resident of Raja Vihar who owns 54.5 sqm, paid only Rs 900 and hence saved Rs 17.29 lakh. Asha Devi who owns 21 sqm plot paid only Rs 400 for conveyance deeds and registry documents and hence she saved Rs 6.10 lakh. Vinod Kumar Sharma, who paid only Rs 400 for registry documents and conveyance deeds under the scheme and he saved Rs 12.35 lakh.

Karam Chand Gupta of Suraj Park has paid only Rs 89,100 for registry of 103.6 sqm having four floors and hence saved Rs 59.36 lakh. Vijendra Bansal, of Surja Park has saved Rs 19.57 lakh in conveyance deeds and registry of 33.4 sqm plot which have three floors. He has paid only Rs 3,985. Ram Kumar has paid only Rs 30,300 for his 60 sq mtr plot and hence he saved Rs 34.84 lakh.

Puri said a special development fund (SDF) will be created from the registration charges received in form of charges of conveyance deeds and registry documents. The SDF will be used to build infrastructure and social development in 1,731 unauthorised colonies. Puri said “as people in large number have been making registration at the DDA portal, we will upgrade the server of the DDA portal”.

The move to regularise such colonies is likely to benefit around 40-50 lakh residents who play a vital role in any election in the national Capital. The announcement of the Delhi Assembly elections is likely to be made in the next few days.

When asked, whether the AAP Government had been involved in the process, Puri, without taking any names, said, “I continue to be amazed at their capacity to derail matters.”

The HUA Minister said people had been hearing about the regularisation of unauthorised colonies for a long time as the previous Governments did not fulfil their promises. “But now, development will take place in these areas at a greater speed,” he said. The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi had recently asked the residents of unauthorised colonies not to trust the BJP-led Central Government unless they get registry papers of their houses in their hands.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-uday-helps-delhi---s-illegal-colony-residents-save-rs-90-lakh-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pm-uday-helps-delhi---s-illegal-colony-residents-save-rs-90-lakh.html

219,04-1-20,"Sena, BJP slam Cong for insulting Savarkar","The Shiv Sena and the rival BJP on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress over a scandalous insinuation by its key frontal organisation Seva Dal about Veer Savarkar’s relationship with Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse.

The Sena said the Congress had “dirt” in their mind by questioning Savarkar’s credentials as a patriot and his reputation for valour, while the BJP described as abhorrent and perverted the comments by the Seva Dal against the Hindutva ideologue in a Hindi booklet. The BJP demanded an apology from the Congress.

BJP general secretary Anil Jain took a swipe at the Congress, saying that “the world knows various relationships of Congress leaders”, but he does not want to throw such muck.”

Nobody in the Congress suffered like Veer Savarkar, a Hindutva icon, Jain said and asked as to what low the Opposition party has fallen to in attacking him. The Congress should answer about such an abhorrent comment made about Savarkar, he said.

“Except for a family nobody is worthy of respect for the Congress,” Jain said while accusing the party of denigrating leaders like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Bhim Rao Ambedkar and Savarkar.

A Hindi booklet, distributed at a camp of Congress-affiliated Seva Dal in Madhya Pradesh, has claimed that Savarkar and Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse were in a physical relationship.

Union Minister Smriti Irani asked the Congress if it will continue to humiliate Veer Savarkar and other freedom fighters just because they were “utterly disliked” by Rahul Gandhi.

The Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, will have to answer to the Marathi people and all patriots in the country as to how long it will continue to “insult the sacrifice” of Veer Savarkar, Irani said at the Delhi BJP office after launching the party’s ‘Meri Dilli, Mera Sujhav’ campaign.

The Sena said the Congress had “dirt” in their mind by questioning Savarkar’s credentials as a patriot and his reputation for valour.

“Veer Savarkar was a great man and will remain a great man. A section keeps talking against him. This shows the dirt in their mind,” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, responding to the insinuations in the booklet, titled “Veer Savarkar, Kitne ‘Veer’?”

The book also alleged that Savarkar received money from the British after he was released from Andaman’s Cellular Jail.

Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said the Congress should apologise for the “perverted” content in the booklet. “The booklet contains lies and perverted content. The Congress should tender an apology for the same,” Patil said. “Savarkar was acquitted by the court in the Gandhi assassination case. Despite this, the Congress-affiliated organisation is trying to link him and the accused in the case,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sena--bjp-slam-cong-for-insulting-savarkar-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sena--bjp-slam-cong-for-insulting-savarkar.html
220,04-1-20,Attack on Pakistan's Nankana Sahib triggers protests in India,"The attack on the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, in Pakistan has triggered protests among Sikhs in India.



While several Sikh groups were to protest outside Pakistan High Commissioner in New Delhi on Saturday to condemn the attack, Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the issue with his counterpart in Islamabad Imran Khan since Sikh minorities in the country were feeling extremely unsafe and insecure.

On Friday, the Gurdwara was attacked by a huge Muslim mob while Sikh devotees were stuck inside the shrine.

The mob that had gathered outside raised communal and hateful slogans against the minority community and pelted stones on the shrine, videos circulated on social media showed.

Pakistani sources said the mob was led by the family of Mohammed Hassan, the man who had abducted and converted a sick girl Jagjit Kaur, to protest police action against him.

The Nankana Saheb attack is violative of the 1955 Pant-Mirza Agreement under which India and Pakistan are obliged ""to make every effort to ensure that the places of worship"" visited by members of their countries ""are properly maintained and their sanctity preserved.""

226,04-1-20,Nankana Sahib under siege!,"Mob attacks gurdwara to protest arrest of people held for kidnap, forced conversion of a Sikh girl

A mob attacked Nankana Sahib Gurdwara, the birthplace of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, in Nankana in Pakistan on Friday. According to reports, hundreds of angry Muslim residents at Nankana Sahib pelted stones and held a day-long sit-in outside the Gurdwara to protest the arrest of a few persons who are accused of abduction and forced conversion of a teenaged Sikh girl, police said as reported in a Pakistani daily.

According to Nankana police, the man named Hassan had married 18-year-old Jagjit Kaur in September last year after abducting her and forcefully converting her to Islam.

A police official said they had only summoned some of the family members of Hassan in connection with the FIR registered against them. The FIR earlier was reported to have been sealed after Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar claimed to have amicably resolved the matter.

The issue snowballed into a controversy after the girl’s family in a video message, that went viral, claimed that she was abducted and forcibly converted to Islam.

India’s External Affairs Ministry said members of the minority Sikh community in Pakistan have been subjected to acts of violence at the holy city of Nankana Sahib.

“India strongly condemns these wanton acts of destruction and desecration of the holy place. We call upon the Government of Pakistan to take immediate steps to ensure safety, security, and welfare of the members of the Sikh community,” the MEA said in a statement.

“Strong action must be taken against the miscreants who indulged in desecration of the holy Gurdwara and attacked members of the minority Sikh community,” the MEA said.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) expressed concern over reports of the mob attack on the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara.

In a tweet, Singh appealed to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to ensure that the devotees stranded at the gurdwara are rescued from the mob. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the issue with his Pakistani counterpart.

Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa too condemned the attack. Sirsa alleged the mob led by Mohammad Hassan tried to break down the gurdwara gate. The DSGMC chief also claimed Hassan had addressed a gathering before the attack, saying they would not allow Sikhs to reside at Nankana Sahib even threatened to rename the holy city as Ghulam Ali Mustafa.

However, evacuee Trust Property Board spokesperson Amir Hashmi told PTI, “The family members of Hassan on Friday held a sit-in outside Gurdwara against the arrest of some of their relatives on the dispute over the Sikh girl.”

Replying to a question on reports in the Indian media about the country strongly condemning the vandalism at the revered gurdwara, Hashmi claimed, “The protesters remained peaceful. They ended the demonstration after police released a detained person.”

Meanwhile, a local correspondent of a Pakistani English daily told PTI that the Pakistani Sikhs, who were present at the gurdwara to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh “got panicky” over the Muslim’s demonstration outside the shrine. They thought the protesters might attack it.

“The protesters also blocked the main road leading to the gurdwara, causing disruption of traffic for several hours,” he said.

However, a contingent of police reached the site and secured the gurdwara premises.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nankana-sahib-under-siege--2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nankana-sahib-under-siege-.html

Morrison on Saturday called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the raging bushfire crisis which has so far claimed the lives of 23 people with high temperatures and strong winds threatening to worsen the conditions across the country. Tens of thousands of residents fled their homes amid catastrophic conditions.

The bushfires have been burning throughout the country for months now, with a state of emergency declared in New South Wales and Victoria while Tasmania and South Australia also face significant threats.

The ongoing bushfire crisis continues to worsen the deadly conditions in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. More than 14,000 hectares have been destroyed in South Australia's Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island.

About 100,000 people were said to be in the fire zone of East Gippsland and according to police up to 70 per cent of people had now left the region.

Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.

229,04-1-20,China urges US 'not to abuse force': Foreign Minister,"The United States should not ""abuse force"" and instead seek solutions through dialogue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a call with his Iranian counterpart on Saturday.

""The dangerous US military operation violates the basic norms of international relations and will aggravate regional tensions and turbulence,"" Wang told Javad Zarif according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry, referring to the killing in Iraq on Friday of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.

A US drone strike killed Soleimani -- head of the Quds Force, Iran's foreign operations arm -- before dawn on Friday in Baghdad, an attack that has sparked fears of a regional war between Washington and Tehran.

Iran promised ""severe revenge"" in response, as a number of nations -- including China -- urged restraint.

""China opposes the use of force in international relations. There is no way out for military means, nor for extreme pressure,"" Wang said in his Saturday call with Zarif, according to the ministry.

China, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, is a key partner of Tehran and major buyer of Iranian oil.

Iran, China and Russia held joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman last week and the Iranian foreign minister visited Beijing earlier this week.

230,04-1-20,DMK beats ADMK in rural polls,"Of 515 seats, DMK gets 261, AIADMK 242; results of 9 seats awaited

The Opposition DMK led by party chief MK Stalin continued its dream run in the two-phase election held to the rural local bodies of Tamil Nadu on December 27 and 30, the counting of which began on Thursday.

Out of the 515 district panchayat seats at stake in 27 districts where election was held, the DMK and its allies romped home by winning 261 seats. The AIADMK had to content with 242 seats. Results from nine seats are expected by late evening as the counting of paper ballots is taking time, according to an official of the State Election Commission.

The DMK won 2,330 seats out of the 5,067 panchayat union seats while the AIADMK finished with 2,165 seats. The elections held in two phases on December 27 and 30 were conducted in rural Tamil Nadu to elect 655 district ward panchayat members, 6,471 panchayat union ward members, 12,524 village panchayat presidents, and 99,324 village panchayat ward members.

Notable losses from the AIADMK include the defeat of the son and daughter of former Ramanathapuram MP Anwhar Raajhaa, who is also the Muslim face of the party. “They were defeated because of the AIADMK’s support for the Citizenship Amendment Act in the Rajya Sabha,” said Nawas Kani, the DMK MP from Ramanathapuram.

Though the DMK was yet to react officially to the poll results, party leaders were upbeat. Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters in Chennai’s Mount Road was in a jubilant mood. “It is sure that we are going to have a new Government led by Stalin in the State Secretariat after the 2021 Assembly election,” said one of the senior leaders.

CD Meyyappan, secretary AICC, said the poll results were an indicator to the changes on the anvil in Tamil Nadu. “This is a precursor to the Assembly election scheduled for 2021. The DMK-led front is confident of sweeping the Assembly election,” said Meyyappan.

Though the election to village panchayats were held in an apolitical manner, leaders of the AIADMK and the DMK campaigned intensively throughout the districts and the battle turned out to be a tightly fought one. By Friday noon, it was clear that the AIADMK has lost heavily in the hustings. O Panneerselvam, Deputy Chief Minister who is also the coordinator of the steering committee heading the AIADMK, told reporters at Chennai that the party would accept the verdict of the people and continue its work intensively for the welfare of the masses.

Despite the impressive win, the DMK continued its rhetoric against the AIADMK Government in the State. Friday saw former Union Minister and DMK strongman TR Baalu making a grand appearance at the headquarters of the State Election Commission to complaint against the “deliberate delay’ in announcing the results of the polls as well as to submit details about “irregularities” by the Government as well as the SEC in conducting the election.

“We have submitted detailed account of the misuse of Government machinery by the AIADMK in the polls and also the complicity of the SEC in the hustings,” said Baalu while speaking to the media.

Kattumannarkoil Kannan, senior BJP leader said money and muscle power played major roles in the local body election. “We cannot pinpoint who are the culprits but I am sure that each vote was purchased at a price of Rs 2,000,” said Kannan.

T Ramakrishnan, author and commentator said though the DMK had made impressive strides in the local body elections, it is too early to forecast about the results of the State Assembly election expected to take place in early 2022. “What is the guarantee that the AIADMK would not bounce back? One year is a long time in politics,” said Ramakrishnan.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dmk-beats-admk-in-rural-polls-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/dmk-beats-admk-in-rural-polls.html

235,04-1-20,Soleimani's 'reign of terror' over: Trump,"Defending the killing of top Iranian commander in a US strike, President Donald Trump on Friday said the ""reign of terror is over"" and claimed Qasem Soleimani had contributed to ""terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London.""

General Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed following a US airstrike at Baghdad's international airport on Friday. The strike also killed the deputy chief of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force.

""The recent attacks on US targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani,” Trump told reporters at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

""Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today we remember and honour the victims of Soleimani's many atrocities and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over,” he said.

Trump alleged that Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years.

""What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just recently Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than 1,000 innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government,” he said.

Amidst escalation of tension with Iran, Trump claimed Soleimani's killing will not lead to war.

""We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change,” Trump said.

""However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbours, must end and it must end now. The future belongs to the people of Iran, those who seek peaceful co-existence and cooperation, not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad,” he said.

Trump said at his direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the ""number one terrorist"" anywhere in the world.

""Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him,” he said.

""Under my leadership America's policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American. We will find you. We will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans and our allies,” Trump said.

""For years the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force under Soleimani's leadership has targeted, injured and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen,” he said in his remarks.

Trump said that the United States has the best military in the world.

""We have the best intelligence in the world. If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. And that in particular refers to Iran,” he said.

“Under my leadership we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently American special operations forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi. The world is a safer place without these monsters,” the president said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/soleimani-s--reign-of-terror--over--trump-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/soleimani-s--reign-of-terror--over--trump.html
236,04-1-20,Iran vows revenge for US attack that killed powerful general,"Iran promised to seek revenge for a US airstrike near Baghdad's airport that killed the mastermind of its interventions across the Middle East, and the U.S. Said Friday that it was sending thousands more troops to the region as tensions soared in the wake of the targeted killing.

The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran, which has careened from one crisis to another since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed crippling sanctions.

Almost 24 hours after the attack on Soleimani, Iraqi officials and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq reported another deadly airstrike.

An Iraqi government official reported a strike on two vehicles north of Baghdad but had no information on casualties. Another security official who witnessed the aftermath described charred vehicles and said five people were killed. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Iraqi state television and the media arm of the Iran-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces also reported the strike. The group said its medics were targeted.

An American official who spoke on the condition on anonymity denied the U.S. Was behind the reported attack.

The targeted strike against Soleimani and any retaliation by Iran could ignite a conflict that engulfs the whole region, endangering U.S. Troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Over the last two decades, Soleimani had assembled a network of heavily armed allies stretching all the way to southern Lebanon, on Israel's doorstep.

“We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over,” Trump said of Soleimani.

The United States said it was sending nearly 3,000 more troops to the Middle East, reflecting concern about potential Iranian retaliation. The U.S. Also urged Americans to leave Iraq immediately following the airstrike at Baghdad's international airport that Iran's state TV said killed Soleimani and nine others.

The State Department said the embassy in Baghdad, which was attacked by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters earlier this week, is closed and all consular services have been suspended.

Around 5,200 American troops are based in Iraq to train Iraqi forces and help in the fight against Islamic State militants. Defense officials who discussed the new troop movements spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet announced by the Pentagon.

A Pentagon official who was not authorized to speak publicly said the U.S. Also had placed an Army brigade on alert to fly into Lebanon to protect the American Embassy. U.S. Embassies also issued a security alert for Americans in Bahrain, Kuwait and Nigeria.

The announcement about sending more troops came as Trump said Soleimani's killing was not an effort to begin a conflict with Iran.

“We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war,” Trump said, adding that he does not seek regime change in Iran.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed “harsh retaliation"" after the airstrike, calling Soleimani the “international face of resistance.” Khamenei declared three days of public mourning and appointed Maj. Gen. Esmail Ghaani, Soleimani's deputy, to replace him as head of the Quds Force.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the killing a “heinous crime"" and said his country would “take revenge.” Iran twice summoned the Swiss envoy, the first time delivering a letter to pass to Washington.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the U.S. Attack a “cowardly terrorist action” and said Iran has the right to respond “in any method and any time.“ Thousands of worshipers in Tehran took to the streets after Friday prayers to condemn the killing, waving posters of Soleimani and chanting “Death to deceitful America.” However, the attack could act as a deterrent for Iran and its allies to delay or restrain any potential response. Trump said possible targets had been identified and the U.S. Was prepared. Oil prices surged on news of the airstrike, and markets were mixed.

The killing promised to further strain relations with Iraq's government, which is allied with both Washington and Tehran and has been deeply worried about becoming a battleground in their rivalry. Iraqi politicians close to Iran called for the country to order U.S. Forces out.

The U.S. Defense Department said it killed the 62-year-old Soleimani because he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region."" It also accused Soleimani of approving orchestrated violent protests at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

The strike, on an access road near Baghdad's airport, was carried out early Friday by an American drone, according to a U.S. Official.

Soleimani had just disembarked from a plane arriving from either Syria or Lebanon, a senior Iraqi security official said. The blast tore apart his body and that of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces. A senior politician said Soleimani's body was identified by the ring he wore.

Others killed include five members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard and Soleimani's son-in-law, Iranian state TV said.

237,04-1-20,"US to deploy about 3,500 more troops to Middle East","The US will deploy some 3,500 more troops to the Middle East as early as this weekend following the death of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani in an attack ordered by President Donald Trump, it was reported.

The additional troops from the 82nd Airborne Division will be deployed to Iraq, Kuwait and other parts of the region, Xinhua news agency quoted an NBC News report as saying on Friday.

The soldiers will join roughly 650 others already deployed to the region and remain for some 60 days, NBC News said in the report citing US officials as saying.

""As previously announced, the Immediate Response Force (IRF) brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division was alerted to prepare for deployment, and are now being deployed,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.

""The brigade will deploy to Kuwait as an appropriate and precautionary action in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, and will assist in reconstituting the reserve.""

The latest move by the Pentagon came just hours after Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Quds Force, and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed an airstrike near the Baghdad International Airport.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have vowed to retaliate strongly against the US over the Major General's death.

Friday's attack came after Iraqi protesters on Tuesday stormed the US embassy compound in Baghdad to protest the American air raids conducted on December 29 against five bases of Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria, claiming the lives of 25 people.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-to-deploy-about-3-500-more-troops-to-middle-east-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-to-deploy-about-3-500-more-troops-to-middle-east.html
238,04-1-20,Australia bushfire toll increases to 21,"Hundreds of bushfires continued to rage in Australia on Saturday amid ""catastrophic"" conditions in the south of the country where two more deaths have been confirmed, taking the total toll to 21.

The two deaths occurred on Kangaroo Island, some 112 km from Adelaide, South Australia, where more than 100,000 hectares have been razed, mostly in Flinders Chase National Park, which is home to 60,000 kangaroos and 50,000 koala bears, reports Efe news.

""This is taking a very heavy toll,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters, adding that more than 1,500 homes lost to fires across the country since September.

""Our condolences to those who continue to suffer and many of those who are left in absolutely disastrous situations as we speak,"" he said, and announced the deployment of 3,000 defence force reservists and the HMAS Adelaide navy ship to aid in the evacuation of those affected.

The Prime Minister added that in ""the next 24 to 48 hours are going to be incredibly difficult for bushfire conditions"", with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius and strong winds in the south and southeastern regions of the country, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) states.

Around 1,000 people were evacuated from Mallacoota, Victoria - where a state of disaster has been declared - aboard the HMAS Choules and MV Sycamore.

Meanwhile, thousands of others have tried in recent days to flee by road from the Victorian coast, and that of NSW to avoid becoming trapped by the flames.

Both Victoria and NSW have suffered fires that have this week killed 10 people, burned 500 homes and left thousands of people trapped.

On Thursday and Friday, the authorities created firebreaks, evaluated damages and carried out evacuation orders in Victoria where over 50 fires continue to rage and emergency alerts remain active in several areas.

In NSW, at least 60 fires are uncontrolled, one of which is near Sydney and a state of emergency for fires has been declared for the third time since September.

The Prime Minister said that AU$20 million had been allocated to lease four DC-10 water bomber planes, among other aerial measures, and will open military bases to temporarily accommodate those affected.

Morrison's announcement came after weeks of criticism - some refused to shake hands with him as he visited a fire affected area - over his lack of response on the fires and climate change.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-bushfire-toll-increases-to-21-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/australia-bushfire-toll-increases-to-21.html

Kanwaljit Singh and his wife Kamaljit Kaur own the Desi Grill in Bairnsdale in eastern Victoria where fires have destroyed homes and resulted in one death, The Daily Mail said in the report.

The couple and their staff have been cooking curry and rice which is being handed out by Melbourne-based charity Sikh Volunteers Australia to those living in temporary shelter.

Singh, who has lived in the area for six years, said he felt he had a ""duty"" to help his fellow Australians.

""It's terrible out there. People are severely affected and they need food and shelter. It's our duty to serve them when they need us the most,"" he told the media.

240,04-1-20,Thousands in shelters as Indonesia flood death toll hits 53,"Tens of thousands of Indonesians were still unable to return to their waterlogged homes Saturday after flooding hit the Jakarta capital region, killing at least 53 people, authorities said.

More than 170,000 people took refuge in shelters across the massive urban conglomeration -- home to some 30 million -- after whole neighbourhoods were submerged.

Torrential rains that started on New Year's Eve unleashed flash floods and landslides in the region and neighbouring Lebak at the south end of Java island.

On Saturday, Indonesia's disaster agency said the death toll had climbed to 53 with one person still missing.

""We've discovered more dead bodies,"" said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo.

Officials would be visiting the homeless Saturday in the hardest-hit areas, he added.

Shelters filled up with refugees, including infants, resting on thin mats as food and drinking water ran low.

Some had been reduced to using floodwaters to clean themselves and dishes.

""We badly need clean water in this shelter,"" Trima Kanti said from one refuge in Jakarta's western edges.

""We're cleaning ourselves in a nearby church but the timing has been limited since it uses an electric generator for power,"" the 39-year-old added.

In hard-hit Bekasi, on the eastern outskirts of Jakarta, swampy streets were littered with debris and crushed cars lying on top of each other -- with waterline marks reaching as high as the second floors of buildings.

The government said Friday it would start cloud seeding to the west of the capital -- inducing rain using chemicals sprayed from planes -- to prevent approaching rainfall from pounding the region.

Waters had receded in many areas and power was being restored after being cut off in hundreds of districts.

The health ministry has said it deployed some 11,000 health workers and soldiers to distribute medicine, disinfectant hygiene kits and food in a bid to stave off outbreaks of Hepatitis A, mosquito-borne Dengue fever and other illnesses, including infections linked to contact with dead animals.

Around Jakarta, a family -- including a four- and nine-year-old -- died of suspected gas poisoning from a portable power generator, while an eight-year-old boy was killed in a landslide.

Others died from drowning or hypothermia, while one 16-year-old boy was electrocuted by a power line.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during the rainy season, which started in late November.

But this week's disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when dozens were killed after the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Urban planning experts said the disaster was partly due to record rainfall. But Jakarta's myriad infrastructure problems, including poor drainage and rampant overdevelopment, worsened the situation, they said.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo has announced a plan to move the country's capital to Borneo island to take pressure off Jakarta, which suffers from some of the world's worst traffic jams and is fast sinking due to excessive groundwater extraction.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/thousands-in-shelters-as-indonesia-flood-death-toll-hits-53-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/thousands-in-shelters-as-indonesia-flood-death-toll-hits-53.html

This is not the first time that Multi-billionaire tech mogul Musk has shown his willingness for the same.

Last month in another conversation on Twitter gave the same signal when a Twitter user asked Musk if the next Falcon Heavy will carry a Cybertruck, to which Musk responded ""Maybe on Starship? It's def got the payload capacity…""

According to Teslarati, the Cybertruck has also been likened to NASA's Mars Concept Rover unveiled in 2017. If the Cybertruck has been designed to play another role is not a far possibility since these electric vehicles can run on Mars since they don't need oxygen like internal combustion engines.

In February 2018, SpaceX launched its reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle -- Falcon Heavy for the first time along with a cherry-red Tesla Roadster with a mannequin called ""Starman"" behind the wheel.

Coming back to Cybertruck, it is inspired by ""Lotus Esprit S1"" from the Bond film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".

The truck will come in three versions with 250 miles, 300 miles and 500 miles of range, respectively.

The base version of the truck will start at $39,900, while the prices for the top end Tri Motor All-Wheel-Drive version of the Cybertruck start at $69,900.

The most expensive version of the truck, the Tri Motor AWDrive, will be able to carry 3,500 pounds, tow up to 14,000 pounds and go from zero to 60 in 2.9 seconds.

It comes with six seats and features armoured glass and ultra-strong panels that are made of the same alloys found on spacecraft.

Additionally, using an adaptive air-suspension system, drivers will also be able to adjust the ride height of the truck, for when they are on the highway or off-road.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/after-tesla-car--musk-could-send-a--cybertruck--to-mars-2020-01-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/after-tesla-car--musk-could-send-a--cybertruck--to-mars.html
