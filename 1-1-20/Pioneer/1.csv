0,01-1-20,Taxation reforms crucial,"Taxation has been a weak area for the Central Government. Statutory compliances have reached a saturation level and some relaxation is needed in 2020

The year 2019 started with all political parties in election mode due to the general elections and has ended with large-scale protests due to the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The economy and taxation usually take a back seat when the country has such a volatile environment and this is exactly what happened in India. By and large, 2019 was not good on the economic front and the fiscal situation was in such a state of turmoil that it forced the Finance Minister to review the situation every week and come up with stimulus packages.

Taxation has been a weak area for the Narendra Modi-led Government. Statutory compliances have reached a saturation level and some relaxation is needed. Till now the Government has paid heed more to the bureaucracy than the professional fraternity on this front. As we enter a new year with a pall of economic gloom hanging over it, full-fledged economic and taxation reforms are the need of the new decade. Here are some reforms the Government could consider in the days ahead.

Direct tax reforms: India faced weak demand in 2019 that led us to the economic slowdown. The Central Government reduced corporate tax rates up to 10 per cent, the biggest cut in the last three decades. As per estimates, this cost the exchequer around Rs 145,000 crore. The Government reduced corporate tax in anticipation that after the cut businesses would have a better cash flow and they would invest it further, resulting in employment generation and creation of demand. The results of this cut are expected in 2020. If the excess investments meet the Government’s expectation then they would ease the pressure of rising unemployment. But, if this calculated move backfires then it would be a setback to the Government because it promised a lower corporate tax rate. If even after sacrificing revenue the Government is unable to recover money, then it would work on reducing other deductions and so on.

Cut in individual income tax rates: The economic deceleration was due to weak demand. The Government slashed corporate tax and increased supply — which was already abundant — whereas the requirement was for increasing demand. Therefore, to create demand the Government could reduce income tax rates and create some more sub-slabs. For instance, the current tax rate is 20 per cent for the Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh slab. This could be reduced to 10 per cent and a new slab of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh could be created with a 20 per cent tax rate.

Direct tax code: The current Income Tax Act was introduced in 1961 and since then the business environment has changed. It needs a total revamp so that a Direct Tax Code (DTC) is required. The UPA Government had proposed a DTC but due to differences between P Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee, it never saw the light of day. In August the Akhilesh Ranjan task force submitted its report along with a new draft for the DTC and recommended its implementation.

Tax profits by multinationals operating in the digital space: India has raised apprehensions at global forums, particularly at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), about profit-sharing by multinationals operating in the digital space. Currently, the entity is taxed in the country where it has a physical presence. “Base Erosion Profit Shifting” Project (BEPS) will be addressing the core issue of such taxation. In the digital world, there is no nexus between physical presence and revenue generation. While traditional taxation statutes take into account things like assets and employees located in the country, in the digital world these have become irrelevant to some extent. So perhaps this principle should be modified to a large extent. The introduction of “equalisation levy” was the first baby step towards such taxation and thus much more comprehensive tax may be levied on this in the next Union Budget.

GAAR to SAAR: General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) are aimed at curtailing tax avoidance and empower authorities to deny benefits to arrangements not having any commercial substance other than achieving tax benefit. Tax avoidance is legal but large-scale revenue loss can occur due to aggressive tax planning. To counter this, GAAR provisions were introduced recently. India also has Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with many countries and these will override the GAAR except when there are Impermissible Avoidance Arrangements (IAAs). India could also introduce Specific Anti Avoidance Rules (SAAR), aimed at individuals on case by case provisions.

Reforms expected in Goods and Services Tax: While being introduced GST was called the “Good and Simple Tax” but unfortunately due to the compliances and complications it is neither simple nor good. Falling GST collections and increasing compensations to States have further complicated the problems. The Government’s priority should be to sort out the mess GST has created.

E-Invoice, Q-R codes and invoice reference number: Electronic Invoice (e-Invoice) is a system in which “Business to Business” (B2B) invoices are authenticated electronically by GST Network (GSTN) for further use on the common GST portal. Under the proposed electronic invoicing system, an identification number will be issued against every invoice by the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) to be managed by the GSTN. E-invoicing will be mandatory from April 1, 2020, for businesses having a turnover of Rs 100 crore or more. It will start on a voluntary and trail basis from January 1, 2020, if the turnover is Rs 500 crore or more and from February 1, 2020, if it is Rs 100 crore or more. It is applicable for B2B invoices only and the QR code is required to be mentioned on B2C invoices. It is applicable on domestic B2B sales, export sales and sales to SEZ units. Web portals for the same have been notified recently.

New GST returns: In the GST Council meeting held on May 24, 2018, on the recommendation of the Group of Ministers on IT simplification, the GST Council vowed to introduce New Simple Returns for GST compliances. The formats of the new returns like ANX-1, ANX-2, RET-1/2/3 are in the public domain and would be available for trial from January. But as ANX-1 and ANX-2 are equivalent to GSTR-1 and GSTR-2 it would be interesting to watch whether these new returns will ease off the burden of compliance from the taxpayers or further complicate the current problem.

New GST Annual Return forms: If someone has to understand the mess created by GST compliances then one has to see the position of GST Annual Returns. GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, and for the Financial Year (FY) 2017-18 returns were to be filed by December 31, 2018. Now the date has been further extended to January 31, 2020. Three years after GST was introduced, the Government is yet to provide a simple form for Annual Return. Till the third week of December, the Government was working on providing a new utility/form for returns for FY 2017-18. So when will returns for FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 be filed?

Real-time availability of ITC: Input Tax Credit (ITC) is the spirit of GST and seamless credit is its backbone. But the falling GST collections forced the Government to introduce provisions against the spirit of GST by restricting 20 per cent credit over and above the matched GST (GSTR-2A) in November and then to 10 per cent in the December 18 GST Council meeting. If the economic slowdown keeps on reducing GST Collections then the Government would allow only Real Time-matched GST. This may force corporates to deal only with large enterprises and may be detrimental to the MSME sector.

Compensation to States: When GST was introduced the Centre promised States compensation for losses, if any, for collection of indirect taxes viz-a-viz GST. Growth at 14 per cent was promised and agreed upon. In the GST Council meeting, the Government asked States to agree to a growth rate of 10 to 12 per cent. This is lower than the promised compensation. Will the States agree to this or not would be seen later. Also, the Centre is not regular in its payments to States and the August compensation was released just a few days before the council meeting. The Government has largely missed its GST revenue collection target.A new year comes with new hopes and expectations for everyone but for the present dispensation at the Centre it has come with more challenges and complications on the taxation front.

1,01-1-20,Improve your financial health,"Make financial resolutions for 2020 by all means but set small, realistic financial goals in order to be able to achieve them

A new year is always the epitome of hope, new promises and a reflection on last year’s decisions and resolutions. Did you make any financial resolution in January 2019? Were you able to keep them or were they just washouts? Whatever position you are in, today is a good time to assess your financial tally for the last year and look for ways to improve it. According to research in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, only eight per cent of the people who make New Year resolutions achieve them. This New Year, which is also the beginning of a new decade, gives us another opportunity to make some financial resolutions and be among the eight per cent achievers of the world. Here are some New Year resolutions that are not too difficult to keep and might help improve your economic outlook.

Determine your net worth: If you have not done it already, the year ahead is a good time to assess your net worth, which can give a clear idea about where you currently stand in terms of assets and liabilities. It will also give you an idea of how to improve your financial standing by spending less, reducing liabilities and improving savings. So, this year, begin by recalculating your net worth, keep a close watch on your progress towards achieving financial goals and correct any past mistakes.

Out of sight, out of mind: Having funds in your account can lead to temptation as mostly our expenses increase to meet the account balance. To save money, it is very important to earmark some of the surplus funds and transfer them into a separate account that is not easily accessible, making it less tempting to spend the cash that you have managed to save.

Bring down your debt: Uncontrolled debt can lead to financial distress in case you have difficulties in paying regular interests. This situation can easily lead to bankruptcy or insolvency. This year contemplate on your strategy to pay personal or home loans. Once in awhile, plan for an extra payment towards your home loan.

Reduce your credit card outstanding: In case you have an outstanding on your credit card, the beginning of the year is a good time to calculate how much you can afford to pay off realistically during the ensuing months. Try not to charge additional purchases on those cards while you're trying to pay down what you owe. If you have high-interest credit card balances it would be more beneficial to pay off those high-interest debts than to add to your savings.

Examine your credit report: It is important to maintain your CIBIL score so that your credit record is impeccable. If your score is less, take steps to repair any negative aspects. A poor credit report could increase the interest rates on any future loans that could eat into your potential savings.

Diversify your portfolio: Diversification is an important strategy to insulate your investments against market volatility and rebalance your portfolio to include several asset classes. This strategy will increase the variety in your portfolio.

Change, if you have outgrown your investments: The type of portfolio that you build and the type of investment avenues where you put in your money will change with time, age and the phase of your life. A young, unmarried investor’s portfolio would be much different from that of a newly-married investor or an investor with grown-up children. So whatever your phase of life is, check if your investments till meet your financial goals.

Spend sufficient time in portfolio review: Spending enough time to review your investments is a good strategy to overcome any sudden changes. Review investments at least once a quarter and never leave investments on autopilot.

Look at the big picture: Do not get involved in micromanaging your investments and day-to-day movements of the stock markets. Always be focussed on the long term as short-term ups and downs get smoothened over time. Don’t panic and churn your investments by following a herd mentality. Have patience and give time to your investments to work and generate returns for you. Stay committed to your existing strategy, with a touch of flexibility, to be able to adjust according to changing market conditions.

Get Organised: It is important to understand whether you are impulsive or methodical in your investment style. Are your investments sporadic or do you follow a regular pattern? If you find that your organisational skills are lacking, do something about it. You can set up regular investing, like a systematic investment plan; or you can set reminders in your calendar each month or a few times a year to take a look at your account. The bottom line is that to be able to stick to your financial resolutions this year to accomplish great financial health in the future, you must set achievable, realistic financial goals. Take this day to chart out simple financial resolutions and maintain a checklist to keep track of how you are doing throughout the year so that you can make any necessary modifications. Through careful and concerted steps, let’s resolve to improve our financial health in 2020.

2,01-1-20,All eyes on Delhi polls in new year,"The lower and middle classes are happy with the AAP Government as they are satisfied with the way their bread and butter issues are tackled. While it is too early to predict anything, it is likely to be advantage AAP

After the just-concluded Jharkhand Assembly polls, all eyes are now on Delhi where Assembly elections are likely to be held soon. The present Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government’s term ends in February 2020 and the fight for Delhi is going to be fierce as it is crucial for all players in the fray. They have already sounded the poll bugle, though polling dates for the elections, that are set to be the first in the new year, are yet to be announced.

It will be a three-dimensional fight as the nature of the poll battle in the Capital has changed in the last few years with the entry of the AAP in 2013. Earlier it used to be a direct fight between the Congress and the BJP.

Whether the BJP will be able to gain ground after its thumping victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls remains to be seen. The BJP won all the seven Lok Sabha seats but if the Congress and the AAP had come together the saffron party would not have won all of them. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when the Modi wave swept the country, the AAP got 33.1 per cent votes while the Congress got 15.1 per cent. Their combined vote share was two percentage points more than that of the BJP.

Though Delhi is a small State the upcoming polls are crucial as it is the Capital of the country. The Congress too is hoping to improve its position in Delhi where it had ruled for three continuous terms before losing power to the AAP. Unfortunately for the grand old party, it is facing a leadership crisis not only at the national level but also at the State level, with indiscipline and groupism dogging it. It appears to be the weakest among the three parties in the fray.

The polls are taking place in a charged atmosphere amid agitations against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). These agitations might continue at least until the Delhi elections are conducted. The agitations have spread all across the country with the North-east and Uttar Pradesh witnessing not only unrest but also violence. The students had jumped into the fray after the highhanded behaviour of the Delhi Police at the Jamia Millia University recently. They have the support of many other universities not only in India but also abroad. Added to that, the economy of the country is on the slide and normalcy is yet to return to Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 in August.

The AAP Government and the Centre are also facing flack on the high level of pollution choking the Capital. While Kejriwal is defending his throne, the BJP is keen to come back to power in a State where it was strong in the past. In the last two Assembly elections, in 2013 and 2015, the AAP polled 29.49 per cent and 54.3 per cent votes respectively, with the latter giving it an unprecedented majority of 67 seats out of 70. However, since then, things have not been smooth for the AAP. Many senior party leaders have been expelled and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been repeatedly accused of being authoritarian.

In the fight for Delhi all the players are using social media, holding public meetings and running campaigns to target each other. They have understood the power of advertising in wooing voters and are also reaching out to the electorate with their roadshows, door-to-door campaigns, and so on. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself led the BJP’s campaign last Sunday as the party is depending on him to capture Delhi after a gap of three decades.

The Central Government and the Delhi Government have been at loggerheads on many issues and disagreements over air pollution may set the tone for the upcoming Assembly polls. Delhi elections will be fought on local issues surrounding schools, hospitals, power, water, dengue, pollution, security and so on and also the NRC, CAA and the National Population Register.

The local BJP is hoping to make use of the recent passage of a Bill for regularisation of illegal colonies, which will benefit lakhs of slum dwellers and poor people.

In 2008, the Congress Government in Delhi had stormed back to power after it distributed provisional certificates to 1,218 unauthorised colonies.

The BJP has a support base among the traders and the middle-income groups in Delhi. While the AAP and the BJP are running their campaigns at different levels the Congress is lagging. The AAP and the Congress share a vote base — Muslims and marginalised sections of society.

The AAP has launched its poll campaign, with the slogan of “Acche beete 5 saal, lage raho Kejriwal (the last five years have been good, keep going Kejriwal).” The party is ahead in terms of its reach in unauthorised colonies and slum clusters. In the last five years, the Delhi Government has made massive investments in creating health, education and civic infrastructure in these areas. The lower and middle classes are happy with the AAP Government, as they are satisfied with the way their bread and butter issues are tackled. While it is too early to predict anything, it is likely to be advantage AAP.

3,01-1-20,Arrest the widening gulf,"2019 is ending on a sombre note — the economy is in a shambles and the nation is polarised as never before. The Modi-Shah duo must discard its Hindutva projects for a better year ahead

Looking back at 2019, the defining image of the year captured by The Indian Express was on its front page, ironically on Vijay Divas, of the Delhi Police brandishing thick wooden rods against hijab-clad students trying to protect a male student outside the Jamia Millia Islamia university. The picture brought back to memory iconic images of Qutubuddin Ansari pleading for mercy with a sword-wielding Ashok Mochi alongside during the Godhra riots. The month of December saw a tsunami of protests over the utterly hasty and misguided Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The lid on the pressure cooker blew off following a history of lynchings, negation of Article 370 and the reduction of Jammu & Kashmir to a Union Territory, the passage of the triple talaq Bill, the victory at Ayodhya — all targetting Muslims — concurrent with the youth’s anger over joblessness and a plummeting economy.

Even as more than 20 people were killed across the country during anti-CAA protests and riots, neither Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor Home Minister Amit Shah uttered a word on the offending CAA. Instead, Modi waxed eloquent over India aspiring to become a $5 trillion economy. Earlier, Shah had said, “You can keep protesting…CAA-NRC will be implemented.” Insensitively, Yogi Adityanath, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the State which became the fulcrum of protests and maximum casualties, tweeted: “We will take revenge.” In pursuing religious agenda, the Government is hurting the social fabric of the country, which could lead to serious fissures in internal security that can diminish national security in turn.

In February, the Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted surgical strikes, claiming without any convincing evidence, that nearly 300 Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists were killed in Balakot. The mere fact that the IAF had entered the Pakistani air space and bombed Balakot was commendable. But the Government milked the Balakot strikes to win the 2019 elections, like it had utilised the Uri surgical strikes of 2016 to win several State elections. The Government fought the federal elections over national security, nationalism, Pakistan-bashing and deifying the soldier when the reality on defence and national security is otherwise: Absence of institutional defence reforms and scant attention to military modernisation due to negligible funding, complex arms procurement procedures and an ill-though concept of “Make in India.” To the Government’s credit are the construction of the National War Memorial and the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), another box it will tick in its election manifesto. Whether or not a CDS will better the uneasy civil-military relations and streamline defence planning, decision-making and defence preparedness is yet to be known. Only additional defence reforms and budgets can ensure the same.

Kashmir has been in lockdown for five months now without internet, restricted access to cellphones, the entire political leadership is under detention and there’s a silent civil disobedience movement. Digital India will soon bag the “world internet shutdown prize.” In 2018, it claimed records in highest frequency, longest duration and 68 per cent of the world’s shutdowns. The shutdown and lockdown have cost the State Rs 20,000 crore. Former State Jammu & Kashmir’s downgradation to a Union Territory is held together by an overwhelming presence of security forces, who will feel the heat when an alienated Kashmir reawakens from its hurt and anguish.

New Delhi is crafting new laws to alter the electoral arithmetic in Jammu & Kashmir so that Muslim-majority Kashmir does not call the shots in the re-engineered Union Territory. The Army, which is now permanently in aid to the civil authority in the former State, will probably spend another generation holding it together following the missteps of abrogating Article 370 and 35 A and the reorganisation of the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which are all under judicial scrutiny.

The fear of CAA in National Register of Citizens (NRC)-implemented BJP-ruled Assam and the consternation and protests that have followed in the North-east have rekindled the ghosts of the past. After suffering from the ravages of insurgencies, the North-east, except Manipur and now Assam, has been peaceful. The Nagaland Peace Accord of 2015 was scheduled to be sealed and signed on December 11 at Kohima in a full and final settlement of the Naga political question, marking a closure to the mother of all insurgencies.

This did not happen probably for two reasons: The protests in the North-east prevented Prime Minister Modi from travelling to Kohima; or contrary to claims, NSCN (IM) was not ready to sign the final agreement because of its demands for a separate flag and Constitution, two State symbols taken away from Jammu & Kashmir. NSCN(IM) has the potential to fish-in troubled waters in the North-east. Even without its messing around, the North-east will remain politically disturbed. It is strategic absurdity to keep two frontier States in unrest and dissonance.

On CAA, India has ruffled feathers of abiding friends in the neighbourhood, especially Bangladesh. EU countries, the US and human rights bodies have pointed fingers over religious distinctions made in India and human rights violations in locked-down Kashmir. India’s foreign policy orientation has visibly shifted from non-alignment to issue-based multi-alignment, maintaining strategic autonomy. Focus on “Neighbourhood First” and “Act East” has dissipated to the nebulous Indo-Pacific in a bid to contain China rather than concentrating on the Indian Ocean Region.

The postponed 22nd round of India-China border talks were not held in Agra as planned but in New Delhi due to CAA protests, which also took down India-Japan talks. Since the boundary question has been off the table for some time, the Wang Yi-Doval dialogue is more about maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border, based on the Wuhan strategic guidelines. Mandarins in South Bloc have pretended that Pakistan does not exist in the neighbourhood but its reckless Pakistan- bashing has willy-nilly re-hyphenated India with Pakistan.

The CAA has brought the identity issue at the centrestage. The Army was called into Assam and Tripura for flag marches. Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat and Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen Anil Chauhan endorsing the Government’s hard policy decisions was beyond their remit.

The military is one institution that has remained apolitical, professional and secular. The lessons from Blue Star in Golden Temple and the demolition of Ayodhya are not forgotten. The Army has sizeable number of Muslims, who have proved their loyalty to the tricolour. It is motivated by regimental and generational loyalties, derived from izzat, dastur and iqbal (honour, tradition and welfare). Nationalism is only a later addition.

This last column of 2019 ends with a somber signal. The economy is in a shambles and the country is polarised as never before. On the external security front, India faces a two-front situation. The Government’s partisan agenda has created two internal security situations in Kashmir and the North-east. Looking ahead, one hopes Modi and Shah will act like Vajpayee and Advani and discard their Hindutva projects to usher in a happier 2020.

4,01-1-20,A new ideology,"What started as a mass movement may fizzle out as an unruly, sporadic mob sans lofty ideals, a steady direction or credible leadership

As 2019 drew to a close, India came perilously close to becoming a volcano, threatening to erupt any moment but stopped just short of accumulating the necessary amount of steam. This has happened earlier, too, notably during the Mandal protests of 1989-90. Those with longer memories would recall the earlier Angrezi Hatao campaign engineered by Socialists such as Ram Manohar Lohia as well as Bengal Leftists, mostly rebels without a cause or pause but with oodles of raw vocal power and ideas, since stone-pelting power had not flowed into the hands of callow youth of that generation.

But most such agitations petered out without leaving a lasting impact and Angrezi continued its domination over the higher echelons of academia and babudom. Between the 1980s, 1990s and 2019, Indian students were mostly driven by ideologies, particularly Right-wing, such as Ram Mandir, or became self-seeking careerists, eschewing old, liberal, socialist ideals. Bohemian lifestyles made way for exam orientation, pursuit of the green card and worship of Lakshmi over Saraswati even in university campuses. Sartre and Camus were passé, Althusser was relegated to the dustbin; only Ayn Rand survived furtively as an icon of self-serving materialism. Progressively, the tacky but animated Indian Coffee House wheezed to a smoke-asphyxiated death. A celebrated Bengali song by Manna Dey (Coffee Houseer shei addata aaj aar nei), vividly encompasses the painful transition to today’s soulless times.

It is not surprising, therefore, that in this cloistered atmosphere, ideological creativity is at a discount and identity politics occupies the front seat. And identity covers virtually every aspect of life — caste, class, religion, language, attire, cuisine, level of education, job aspiration and social standing. That explains why unheard of elements such as Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) assumed such wide recognition nationwide. But assertion of identity cannot be an end in itself. Already the Government seems to have tired out the agitationists and its hired mobs masquerading as intellectuals onto the streets. What started as a self-starting mass movement may soon fizzle out as a ramshackle, unruly, sporadic mob without lofty ideals, a steady direction or credible leadership.

Yes, this could be a collective expression of despair and anger, one which has even drawn out civil society, usually a silent observer, on to the streets. But it needs more than a force of nature to keep it together. It is not enough to just cotton up numbers without a commonality of commitment to keep it going, not enough to revive the literary genre of protest poetry but resort to more convincing ways that work with the common man, good enough to convince them that they can be the David taking on Goliath. That dharma is about the action they take as a worthy people, not meant to be assigned away to self-proclaimed keepers. That they need to rise above the trap of identity politics that the establishment has set, that the surging emotions over religion are no substitute for the slipping development indices that we should be worried about. No idea of India can work till we rework our priorities based on respect and dignity of life, not eroding it.

Most important of all, leadership, singular or collective, will have to be understood as a responsibility of execution than a conflict of egos, something which has already been proven by the failure of the India Against Corruption movement. There are two devils at work, a democratic squandering of ideas and State repression of the militaristic kind. And in a polarised context, there is need for some sort of an organised leadership. Politics cannot be cleansed till we participate in it and that is the only way to reclaim the system. So where does the class of 2019 go from here?

That depends on the direction politics takes in the next couple of years. The euphoria generated by the persona of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the high noon of the BJP regime is evidently drawing to an end as successive State elections demonstrate. Speculators believe Modi is no easy quitter and won’t retire into the BJP margdarshak mandal in a hurry. But in case he faces a decisive debacle, he may have no option. In that event, India may face another spell of political uncertainty similar to those that followed strong Governments in the past.

Modi’s critics say he has already run a quasi-autocratic regime and people will not approve of another spell of the same. The questions, therefore, are wide open: More democracy or less? In the nation’s interest more is always better than less.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-new-ideology-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-new-ideology.html

6,01-1-20,POSHAN spending: Odisha on 35th slot nationally,"The Union Government has pointed out that Odisha has not utilized Central funds released under POSHAN Abhiyan.

Official figures indicate that the release amount of the Central share for Odisha in 2017-18 and 2018-19 was Rs 51.72 crore, but the utilisation has been nil.

Latest performance analysis revealed that Odisha is 35th among the 37 States and Union Territories so far as POSHAN Abhiyan implementation is concerned.

While malnutrition has been a cause of concern for the State with Odisha Government spending over Rs 70 crore under its own Nutrition Action Plan, non-acceptance of the Union Government flagship programme has raised many eyebrows.

The flagship programme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development(MoWCD) aims at reducing the level of stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia and infant birth weight, said Secretary MoWCD Rabindra Panwar

Panwar has said that POSHAN Abhiyan was launched to achieve improvement in nutritional indicators of children, adolescent girls and women in a time bound manner.

Though the target to reduce stunting is at least two per cent per annum, it strives to achieve reduction in stunting from 38.4 per cent (as per National Family Health Survey-4) to 25 per cent by 2022.

Though the rate of stunting and wasting among children in Odisha has shown a marginal decline, as per the NFHS-4, at least 34.1 per cent children under the age of five are stunted in the State. In rural pockets, the stunting rate is higher at 35.3 per cent while it is 27.2 per cent in urban Odisha.

Similarly, the wasting rate has gone up from 19.6 per cent to 20.4 per cent. It is 20.9 per cent in rural areas and 17 per cent in urban pockets.

Once implemented, the POSHAN Abhiyaan will ensure convergence with various programmes like Anganwadi Services, scheme for adolescent girls, Janani Suraksha Yojana, National Health Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission, Public Distribution System and MGNREGS.

The MoWCD has detailed out several Special Focus Areas for implementation and Odisha is lagging in almost all cases. As the State Government has not presented Action Plan for 2019-20 Financial Year, Union Government has not released funds to Odisha in this regard. So the Union Government has requested the State Government to prepare and submit Convergence Action Plan for 2019-20.

There is hardly three months left in 2019-20 FY and the Centre has urged to improve utilizing the funds released earlier to the State in POSHAN Abhiyan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/poshan-spending--odisha-on-35th-slot-nationally.html

Family sources said he died due to old age-related ailments. He is survived by three daughters and two sons.

Swamy was elected to the Upper House of Parliament as an independent candidate on April 4, 2012 and he remained in office for a full term of six years till April 3, 2018.

10,01-1-20,‘Let us welcome dawn of 2020 with countless hopes’,"Let us welcome the dawn of 2020 with countless hopes, enthusiasm and positive energies. The year 2019 has gone down the memory lanes. Always be ready to learn from failures and note that failures are nothing but the outcome of efforts made half–heartedly. Always think that success is relative. Despite sincere efforts, it may be elusive. So, always be in search of excellence. I just recall a couplet from classical Urdu poetry in which great poet Hali says– 'Hai Justaju Ki Khoob Se Hai Khoobtar Kahan? Ab Thaharti Hai Dekhiye Jaa Kar Nazar Kahan?'

It simply means that always be in search of excellence and keep the relentless journey on for excellence. Don't be scared of failures and never be charmed by successes as they are impermanent. We fail only when we fail to keep pace with the changing Time, which is merciless. It never stops for anyone regardless of their Socio–economic status or geographical identities. This is the only precious thing, which everybody has but a few have the requisite wisdom to utilise it.

I recall the title of a famous painting of extremely talented Russian Jewish painter Marc Chagall which reads that Time Is A River Without Bank. So, if we want Time to flow in the desired direction, we have to embank the River of Time and this is the challenge all of us have to take up. No one can help us in this pursuit.

Those, who cultivate friendship with the Time finally reach their desired destinations and comfortably meet their targeted goals. There are certain things, which we can't purchase despite all our wealth like love, affection, knowledge, trust, sleep, smile, health, friendship and of course the powerful Time. We perish every moment if we waste it. In the New Year, take a resolve to be sensitive about the use of Time. Respect every moment and keep learning to manage the Time. We may be a judge of good or bad Times. We may envision brighter things for the future or we may be ahead of our Times in our thought processes but the truth is that we have to Walk with the Time whether you are a student, farmer, businessman, rich or poor, you have to follow the Time.

We cannot see the Time. We only experience it just as we can't see the air but we feel its velocity. The clocks, however, helps us but we experience the power of Time by the change we come across. Therefore, ancient wisdom goes that Time is a great healer. Every one of us has his or her own idea of Good Time. People buy comforts for joys and sleep, but to some, these come naturally without spending a single penni. We have to be sensitive about Time. So, always be on Time. Imagine the world without clocks, seconds, minutes hours, dates, months and years.

Even without them Time existed and will ever exist. Time is the most complex property of the earth and the cosmos. Never allow a single minute to go waste. Always attempt to do great things and be ready to contribute.

I always quote my favourite Albert Einstein who said–'A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labours of other

men, living or dead and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.' I am sure every responsible citizen subscribes to these golden words.

I wish all the citizens, a very happy, healthy and joyful New Year.

12,01-1-20,UP govt recommends ban on PFI,"The Uttar Pradesh government has recommended to the Centre to immediately ban Popular Front of India (PFI) for violent anti-CAA and NRC protests in the state. The letter of recommendation to ban the outfit was sent to the Centre by DGP OP Singh on Monday.

Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya told mediapersons on Tuesday that PFI activists were behind all the violent protests across the state. “Such organisations will not be allowed to flourish and will be banned. We have sent a letter to the Centre to ban this outfit,” the Deputy CM said.

He said many members of PFI were once associated with the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).

“During the police investigation, it was found that the PFI activists were behind the violence in different parts of the state, particularly in Lucknow. We are committed to crushing these anti-national forces at any cost,” he said.

The DGP said he had sent a letter to the Centre seeking a ban on PFI. The letter was sent in the backdrop of a probe conducted by the UP police that found PFI’s involvement in the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) that took place in the state on December 19.

PFI was founded on November 22, 2006. UP police have arrested three PFI members, including its state president Waseem Ahmad, after the violence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-recommends----ban-on-pfi.html
13,01-1-20,BJP indulging in appeasement politics for votes: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of indulging in appeasement politics only to win elections. Akhilesh Yadav also took to Twitter and wrote, “Don’t need NRC-NPR, we need employment.”

Flagging off a cycle rally of the party’s legislators from party’s headquarters to Vidhan Bhawan to register protest against the National Register of Citizens (NRC)/National Population Register (NPR) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Yadav said the Narendra Modi government had brought CAA to enforce the policy of discrimination on the grounds of religion in giving citizenship which is against the basic structure of the Constitution.

“No one from the BJP can decide whether we are citizens or not. If the need arises, I will be the first one who will not fill any form, but the question is will you support it or not? We will not fill the NPR form. What will you do? NRC and NPR are against the poor and minorities,” he said.

He added that people in the North-East and Assam were also unhappy with the CAA. Yadav claimed that the BJP was spreading fear among people of the country in the name of CAA and NRC.

The SP chief also attacked the Centre for its decision to start the work on NPR from April next year, saying when all the details were already provided in Aadhaar, what was the need to conduct the NPR exercise across India.

Yadav said his party was strongly against the CAA, NRC and NPR and would keep protesting against the same. The SP chief also targeted the government for failing to take effective measures to revive he country’s economy and said that the banking sector had collapsed and demonetisation had destroyed country’s economy.

He claimed that since the government had failed to create employment opportunities and revive the failing economy, it came up with CAA, NRC and NPR to divert the attention of people from real issues.

During the rally, the SP legislators of the SP, with placards around their neck, pedalled about one km to reach Vidhan Bhawan to attend the special session on Tuesday morning. The session was convened for the ratification by the UP Assembly for the 126th Constitution Amendment passed by the Parliament to extend the SC/ST reservation in the legislature for another 10 years.

The SP legislators raised slogans against NRP, NRC and CAA. The legislators were stopped from entering the Vidhan Bhawan for some time due to security reasons and then allowed entry after proper identification.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-indulging-in----appeasement-politics----for-votes--akhilesh.html
14,01-1-20,Yogi: Modi govt fulfilled Ambedkar’s dreams,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the Narendra Modi government had fulfilled the dreams of Dr BR Ambedkar and worked for all sections of the society. During a brief debate on the passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill extending the reservation for SC/ST in Legislature for another 10 years, Yogi launched a broadside at the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress as he coined an acronym ‘Sabka’ for the three parties.

“The Modi government developed ‘panch tirth’ of Ambedkar in Mhow, London, Delhi, Nagpur and Mumbai to honour the great leader,” he stated. Several opposition members stood up on their chairs to oppose the CM’s statement, saying he was speaking out of context.

However, Yogi countered the opposition, saying these people do not want to hear about the uplift of the Dalits and backwards and the works done by the Modi government. The CM said there are 84 members from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and 47 from Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities in Parliament and in state assemblies, there are 614 SC members and 554 ST members.

Training guns at the opposition parties, the CM said: “‘Sabka’ stands for the SP, BSP and Congress. They have been the biggest opponents of the Dalits and people from the deprived sections of the society,” he said.

“The BJP does not treat Dalits and people from deprived section as its vote bank but works to ensure that the government schemes reach everyone,” he added.

“Who changed the names of the memorials built in the memory of Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram during the Bahujan Samaj Party regime in UP?” Yogi asked.

“The SP government did not give scholarships meant for the children of SC/ST community and the funds released in April 2017 after the formation of the BJP government,” the CM said.

Yogi said his government gave the scholarships and claimed that the BJP had never discriminated against people on the basis of caste, community, religion and language.

Yogi pointed out that when the BJP-led government was formed in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said they would work for every section of the society, be it the Dalits, deprived people, tribals, backwards, forest dwellers and women.

The Chief Minister also listed the various welfare schemes implemented by the Centre like the LPG connection, free electricity connection, houses, toilets and health insurance cover. His words, however, did not appear to be palatable to the opposition whose members soon started raising slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Amid noisy scenes by opposition members before the podium, the resolution to extend reservation to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies for another 10 years was passed.

The reservation for SCs, STs and Anglo Indians given for the past 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies was due to end on January 25, 2020. Since the reservation for Anglo-Indians in the form of nomination is set to expire on January 25 as the bill does not extend the facility to the Anglo Indian community, some members urged that the matter be taken up at a later stage.

The UP Assembly witnessed some noisy scenes with SP and Congress members trouping into the well of the House demanding withdrawal of CAA and NPR during the zero hour, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House sine die, thus ending the third special session of the state assembly in 2019.

Before the House was adjourned sine die by Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit, it paid tributes to socialist leader Raj Narain on his death anniversary. The Parliament recently passed a constitution amendment bill in this regard and it has to be ratified by at least 50 per cent of the assemblies before it becomes a law.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi--modi-govt-fulfilled----ambedkar---s-dreams.html
15,01-1-20,UP ratifies Constitution Amendment Bill,"Uttar Pradesh Legislature on Tuesday ratified the 126th Constitution Amendment Bill, which extends the reservation to SC/ST in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies for another 10 years. It was approved unanimously in both the Houses of the UP Legislature with the support of all the political parties after a brief discussion.

In Assembly, the sitting continued for around 82 minutes during which the leaders expressed their views and suggestions on the Constitution Amendment. Opposition suggested that a separate resolution should be passed by the House to extend reservation for Anglo-Indians, which had been left out in the present Amendment.

Leader of the opposition and Samajwadi Party leader Ram Govind Choudhury suggested that reservation should be made on the basis of caste and other backward castes (OBCs) should also be given their due representation.

BSP leader Lalji Verma said the government should provide reservation in private sector too as the government is disengaging from the economic activity and most of the services and sectors are being privatised. Congress leader Aradhana Mishra also said that reservation to the Ango-Indians should continue.

Suheldeo Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) leader Om Prakash Rajhbhar said that backward castes, particularly the extremely backward castes (EBCs), were being ignored by the Yogi Adityanath government. He said the Chief Minister should place the figures in the house as to how many officers from the backward caste and EBCs have been posted in 1,400 police stations in 75 districts of the state. He said the political parties are using backward castes as their vote bank while nothing is being done for their political and economic empowerment.

Apna Dal (Sonelal) leader Neelratan, supporting the Constitution Amendment Bill, said the Speaker should also look at the reservation of political parties in the House. He said despite his party having more members than Congress and SBSP, it was allowed to speak only after the smaller parties.

Denzil J Goden, nominated member from the Anglo-Indian community, also pleaded for the inclusion of his community for reservation in Lok Sabha and state assemblies. He said the constituent assembly, after due deliberations, had decided to include the Anglo-Indian community in the list of reserved communities. Demanding inclusion of the Anglo-Indian community in the Constitution Amendment Bill, he said the biggest problem facing the community was the absence of the credible data about their actual population. He said ever since the first census in 1951, there was a separate column in the census enumeration for the Anglo-Indian community.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-ratifies-constitution----amendment-bill.html

17,01-1-20,Winds of Change In MP Farm Sector,"Sowing the seeds of change, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is leading the effort to expand croplands, enhance quality and quantity of yield to ensure fast development of farming communities in Madhya Pradesh.

Announcing a huge farm loan waiver even before assuming office a year ago, Nath has followed up with back to back schemes to bolster the farming sector which contributes nearly a quarter of the state GDP.

The schemes launched over the year have been met with optimism from farmers as the new systematic plan will help control spiralling production costs and thus ensure that the sector continues to remain profitable despite an upward trend in prices.

The farm loan waiver disbursements scheme is set to result in 12 lakh farmers benefitting to the tune of Rs 11,675 crore while its initial stage, concluded earlier this year, culminated with the state government writing off loans amounting to Rs 7,154 crore benefitting over 20 lakh farmers.

In an effort to bring down production costs the state government is now providing electricity at a 50 percent reduced tariff to farmers for the power consumed by agricultural pumps of up to 10 horsepower. Farmers developing their own seeds can now avail free of cost examination of their seeds. Farmers can further expect stable prices for their wheat produce even in case of a bumper crop in the State.

Profitability for Corn and Soyabean growers has also been ensured by extending to them the benefits of Bhavantar scheme which pays them the difference between the official Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Model Price at which the crops are sold. The current Bhavantar benchmark price is Rs 160 higher than that fixed by the central government.

Highlighting the efficiency of State Government efforts, officials at the state agriculture department point towards a considerable upswing in the sowing acreage during the Kharif season and are optimistic of the trend continuing in the Rabi season.

While the acreage of Kharif sowing grew from 132.97 lakh hectares in 2018 to 136.99 lakh hectares in 2019. Similarly, the target sowing acreage for 2019 Rabi season has been set at 119.18 lakh hectares, an increase of over 2.5 lakh hectares over the previous year.

Considerable expansion has also been recorded in the organic farming acreage which now stands at 2.13 lakh hectares with the same being promoted to 3,828 clusters and groups.

Organic cotton is a promising sector with Madhya Pradesh accounting for nearly 35 percent of the total organic cotton production in the world.

An ongoing pilot project is testing soil health from a model village in each development block, samples from nearly a lakh of villages have been analysed and soil health cards have been issued to around one lakh farmers.

All necessary steps have been initiated by the Kamal Nath Government to ensure a timely and steady supply of Urea and Fertilisers to farmers in the ongoing season.

Political observers in Bhopal say the Chief Minister’s efforts seem to be geared towards restructuring farm economics.

They exude confidence that sustained efforts in the direction may soon see the state reap a rich economic harvest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/winds-of-change-in-mp-farm-sector.html

The provision of reservation for other backward classes was increased from 14 to 27 percent by amending the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes Reservation Act 1994. Meanwhile, the economically weaker section was given 10 percent reservation in educational institutions and Government jobs.

In order to give priority to the youth of Madhya Pradesh in Government services, live registration of candidates in the employment office was made mandatory.

21,01-1-20,God save youths from cell phone madness!,"Sir,

These days, free internet and mobile phones pose more danger than cigarettes and alcohol. Cigarettes and alcohol make a person physically weak but this phone addiction is spoiling the entire personality of an individual, and, in turn, affecting the development of our country. Phones are stymieing the youth’s mind as he does not think outside this network of social media.

All this adversity created by so-called technology makes me feel a little worried and disappointed as even many elders have no time to guide the youths. Days are gone when one would wait for a trunk call or would walk miles to talk to someone in distance through STD. Now, everyone is easily accessible to the trending technology of mobile phones. The number of users is so high that it is a rare sight to see someone with hands free without a phone. And the addiction is not restricted to any age group but is seen right from children to older persons.

People are blindly following the trends but aren’t aware of the adverse aftermaths due to the excessive usage of mobile phones. A year-old kid swipes up the phone as if it’s a toy used for decades; and the worst part is that they are encouraged to do so by considering it as a work of talent. A few kids are given phones as an aid for easy galloping of food. Children are subjected to a situation where they sit idle for hours without any physical activity.

The issue doesn’t end here as it’s not only kids who are addicted to the use of mobile phones. Present youth generation are going ‘brainless’. They are misusing their precious time meant to gain knowledge, acquire skills and decide their career on which their daily bread and butter depend. God can only save us!

23,01-1-20,Animals sacrificed in Sulia Yatra in Balangir,"Hundreds of tribals on Tuesday observed the annual Sulia Yatra at Khairguda village in Balangir district sacrificing animals and birds despite appeal and awareness by the local administration to refrain from the age-old practice.

The tribals marched in a procession to the ritual site at Khairguda of Kultapada panchayat under Tusura police limits and performed the animal sacrifice in the morning to propitiate the presiding deity, Sulia.

The Sulia Yatra is held on the second Tuesday of Pousa month every year with sacrifice of hens and goats. The tribals believe that offering blood of animals and birds to the deity brings good harvest resulting in prosperity and happiness to their families and the community as a whole.

Notably, there had been a tussle between the district administration and the Zilla Adivasi Sangha in the past following the Orissa High Court’s order to abolish such practice and mass killing of animals. But after the Supreme Court’s verdict to respect tribal rituals and traditions, the district administration has kept itself away from opposing the animal offering. The administration only beefs up security during the festival to avoid any untoward situation.

Adequate security arrangement was made to maintain law and order situation this year as well. In absence of any prohibitory order, police limited its role to crowd control.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/animals-sacrificed-in-sulia-yatra-in-balangir.html

The SBI, in a statement issued on Tuesday, said that with the introduction of its OTP- based Cash Withdrawal Facility, State Bank ATMs have added another layer of security for cash withdrawals. OTP will be received on the customer’s mobile number registered with the Bank.

The One-time password (OTP) is a system-generated numeric string of characters that authenticates the user for a single transaction. This additional factor of authentication will protect State Bank card holders from unauthorised ATM cash withdrawals.

The OTP Based Cash Withdrawal System shall be active across all State Bank ATMs wef January 01, 2020 between 8 pm and 8 am.

The facility will not require any major change in the present process to withdraw cash from State Bank ATMs. However, this facility will not be applicable for transactions, where a State Bank card holder withdraws cash from another bank’s ATM, because this functionality has not been developed in National Financial Switch (NFS). In this process, once the cardholder enters the amount he wishes to withdraw, the ATM screen displays the OTP screen. The customer has to input / punch the OTP received on his mobile number registered with the Bank in this screen for getting the cash.

This will safeguard the customers against the risk of unauthorised transactions on account of skimmed / cloned cards, while withdrawing cash at State Bank ATMs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sbi-launches-otp-based-atm-withdrawal-for-transactions-above-10k.html

32,01-1-20,"Cong, BJP slam Govt for late night liquor sale","The State Government’s decision to relax liquor selling hours for the IMFL on shops and bars in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri cities till 1 am of January 1 drew flak from Congress and BJP on Tuesday.

Congress MLA Santosh Singh Saluja said to collect more revenue the Government double policy is one hand allowing the liquor shops to open beyond the midnight would lead to everyone consuming liquor and the result would be road mishaps. On the other hand, the Government is enforcing rules against drunk driving and would collect fines from the rule violators. The officers, who have taken the decision, should be arrested in place of the drunk drivers and Government should be held responsible for the road accidents, said Saluja.

BJP leader and Union Minister Pratap Sarangi said this is a very wrong decision and liquor sell should not be promoted. Former Chief Minister Nabakrushna Chaudhury had taken a decision to prohibit liquor in the State. But that decision has been thrown to the garbage dump.

In another development, demonstrations were held by the Students’ Congress and Milita Odisha Nishanibaran Abhiyan (MONA) in Bhubaneswar opposing the decision. The Students Congress activists squatted before the residence of the Excise Minister Niranjan Pujari. The agitators said the Government decision would encourage anti-socials and other lumpen elements who would make the streets for women unsafe.

The MONA held a demonstration at Master Canteen Square against the decision. Its leader Prahallad Sinha said the Government is talking about the ideals of the Mahatma Gandhi and on the other hand promoting liquor. This would lead to a spurt in crime and destroy the life of many youths. He demanded that the Government implement total prohibition in 2020.

However, Excise Minister Pujari said the decision was taken “only for a day”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong--bjp-slam-govt-for-late-night-liquor-sale.html

44,01-1-20,Govt allows peaceful protest against CAA,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that his Government would not stop students from protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and other controversial actions of the Central Government, but would not allow the State’s peace to be disturbed at any cost.

Referring to the proposed January 1 statewide protest by left aligned student unions against the CAA, as well as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), the Chief Minister said that protest was the democratic right of every citizen of India and people, including students, were within their right to stage peaceful dharna, march etc against these draconian initiatives of the Central Government, as long as such protests were conducted peacefully.

“Even my Government is totally opposed to CAA, NRC etc in view of the fundamentally divisive and discriminatory nature of the legislation or action initiated by the BJP-led Government at the Centre,” said Capt Amarinder.

He said: “In fact, during an anti-CAA dharna, organized by the Punjab Congress in Ludhiana on Monday, I had reiterated the Government’s decision not to allow the controversial legislation to be implemented in the State under any circumstances.”

There was, thus, no question, of barring students from coming out against these actions of the Central Government, said the Chief Minister, making it clear that as long as the protestors did not take the law in their hands in any manner, the police would not prevent them from carrying out their proposed campaign.However, the Chief Minister warned that “no violence or destruction of public property would be tolerated during the planned protest”.

“The police have been directed to come down heavily against any attempt by the protestors to vandalize public property or otherwise indulge in any violence during their protest,” he added.

Capt Amarinder also urged the student leaders to ensure that proposed protest is carried out peacefully, and to keep a check for possible infiltration of goonda elements among the protestors.

Notably, the peaceful protests in some other states had ended up in violence due to such infiltrations.

59,01-1-20,Infighting set to intensify in Uttarakhand Congress,"With the camp followers of former chief minister and general secretary of All India Congress Committee (AICC), Harish Rawat opening a front against leadership of state unit, the infighting within Uttarakhand Congress is bound to increase in the coming days.

Harish Rawat protégé and Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami has already fired a salvo by stating that he would not fight the next assembly election on Congress party symbol if the Harish Rawat is continued to be sidelined by the state leaders.

On his Face-book wall, Dhami said, “Honourable Harish Rawat is not merely a name but is an ideology. In a recent rally of the party some people with menial thinking tried to remove his name which is low grade activity.’’

Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat who is considered close to Harish Rawat also commented in support of Harish Dhami’s post. He said that name firmly remains entrenched in the hearts of people and no one can remove it. The Harish Rawat camp is furious at his neglect by the leadership of state Congress. In a recent ‘Samvidhan Bachao, Bharat Bachao’ rally, the names of Harish Rawat and former Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Kishore Upadhyaya were missing from the banners, posters and other material.

Political observers are linking the recent comment of Harish Rawat in which he had indicated that he is planning to retire from public life with his anger at being alienated in the scheme of things in the state unit of Congress party.

The seasoned politician that he is, Harish Rawat plunged himself in the protests the party organised in Assam, a day after expressing his interest to retire. Harish Rawat is the in charge of the Congress party in Assam.It is pertinent to mention here that at least eight out of eleven Congress party MLAs are considered to be close to Harish Rawat. It is an open secret that the Uttarakhand Congress is a sharply divided house with three major camps. One camp is of the leaders owing allegiance to Harish Rawat while other major camp is of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Pritam and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh. Third camp, though small in size is of supporters of former PCC president Kishore Upadhyaya.

In the state unit of the Congress party the supporters of the former CM, Harish Rawat are in considerable numbers.

The political observers are of the opinion that though battered badly in the assembly elections of 2017 when he lost from both assembly seats from where he contested and huge defeat he suffered in Nainital Udham Singh Nagar parliamentary constituency in Lok Sabha elections of 2019, Harish Rawat is still the tallest and most popular leader of Congress party in the state. They believe that by alienating him, the Congress party which is already in shambles would get further weakened.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/infighting-set-to-intensify-in-uttarakhand-congress.html
60,01-1-20,"BJP to work harder, expose Opposition in 2020","From the organisational point of view, 2019 was a very important year for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state. The year was also marked by various achievements of the BJP governments at the state and the Centre. In 2020, the BJP in Uttarakhand will intensify its efforts to propagate correct facts on various governmental schemes and expose the lies being spread by the opposition, said the BJP State president and MP Ajay Bhatt.

Addressing the media, Bhatt said that 2019 saw various important achievements of the BJP. He said, “We won various elections in the state.

We won 11 out of 13 district Panchayat elections, five out of seven mayoral elections and the for the first time in the state’s history won all the five Lok Sabha seats again. In the past no party had won from all the parliamentary seats for the second consecutive time.

We also won the Pithoragarh Vidhan Sabha bypoll. At the national level, we achieved abrogation of sections 370 and 35 A from Jammu and Kashmir, the effects of which are visible at the global level. While some nations are flummoxed by this, other nations have welcomed and supported this development.

The year 2019 was also very sad for us due to the demise of our senior colleague and then cabinet minister Prakash Pant. However, the state government worked exceedingly with various externally funded projects worth more than Rs 20,000 crore being approved for execution in the state.”

When asked about the party’s priorities for the new year, Bhatt said that the BJP will work harder to raise awareness on the governmental schemes and facts on various issues. “We will work harder to expose the lies being spread by the opposition as in the case of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The opposition has been acting in a very irresponsible and childish manner and we will strive to expose it. There is a difference between refugees and illegal intruders. The opposition wants to exploit Rohingyas as a vote-bank but a differentiation has to be made between genuine refugees and illegal intruders,” he stressed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-to-work-harder--expose-opposition-in-2020.html

70,01-1-20,Stephan Marandi sworn in as Pro-tem Speaker,"Former Deputy Chief Minister Stephan Marandi was sworn in as the Pro-tem Speaker of the fifth Jharkhand Assembly at Governor House in Ranchi on Tuesday. Governor Droupadi Murmu administered the oath to the senior Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader in the presence of Chief Minister Hemant Soren, JMM patriarch Shibu Soren and Cabinet Ministers Rameshwar Oraon and Satyanand Bhokta.

Marandi, as the Pro-tem Speaker, will preside over the inaugural session of the fifth Assembly and finish. “The Assembly Speaker will be elected on January 7. My tenure as the Pro-tem Speaker will end on January 8,” he said.

Marandi, who was among the leaders close to Shibu Soren during the Jharkhand Movement, made his return to the JMM in 2014 after leaving the party in 2005. One of the stalwarts of the party, Marandi had contested elections as an independent against junior Soren in Dumka and defeated him after the party denied him ticket in 2005.

Despite the strong Modi wave in 2014, Marandi had won the elections from Maheshpur on a JMM ticket. In between 2005 and 2014, he joined Jharkhand’s first Chief Minister Babulal Marandi-led Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) and also had a stint with the Congress party.

On Tuesday, the swearing in ceremony was held at Darbar Hall in Raj Bhawan, where the media was not allowed. The first Assembly session after the recently concluded elections will begin on January 6. The three-day session will be held at the old Vidhan Sabha building and Marandi will preside over the proceedings.

The session beginning on January 6 will also be the first ever Assembly session under a stable, non-BJP Government. Talking to a news channel, Hemant Soren on Tuesday said that he will focus on local issues and issues concerning the people at the grass root level.

Immediately after coming to power, the Soren Government took crucial decisions in its first Cabinet meeting on Sunday. The Government scrapped sedition charges leveled on Pathalgadi supporters by the former BJP-led Government and also withdrew cases that were filed against protestors during the anti-Santhal Pargana Tenancy and Chottanagpur Tenancy Amendment bill brought in by the Raghubar Das Government. The first Assembly session, too, is expected to see some major decisions, given the fact that the party is keen on fulfilling the promises it made in its election manifesto.

The oath taking ceremony of Hemant Soren also witnessed a never-seen-before unity of the opposition parties from across the country. Political gurus have predicted that Jharkhand may mark the beginning of a stronger and close-knit opposition in the upcoming elections. Soren’s swearing in ceremony was attended by political big guns such as former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Bannerjee.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stephan-marandi-sworn-in-as-pro-tem-speaker.html

76,01-1-20,‘Sahay’s experience could strengthen Cong’,"Senior leaders feel that the JPCC in-charge has been committing the same kind of mistake for which the BJP has already paid a heavy price in the State elections. They say that there can’t be a bigger fallacy than discrediting Subodh Kant Sahay for the victory. The senior leader has played a crucial role in reviving the State Congress unit and also in cementing the formidable alliance of Mahagathbandhan, they added.

Party insiders said CAA and NRC will serve as a trump card for the victory of the party and Sahay is the most apt person to lead it.

“Sahay was Minister of State for Home with independent charge in Prime Minister Chandrashekhar’s government 28 years ago. Those times were extremely turbulent. Panjab terrorism was at its peak; in Assam ULFA activities in Northeast India were disturbingly big; Turmoil in Jammu & Kashmir ; Mandal Commission disturbance; LK Advani’s Rath Yatra on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue had posed a challenging situation all over. The young Minister managed the situation carefully, resolved critical issues and did not let the matters go out of hand,” said a leader requesting anonymity.

“Right now, it would be a wise decision for the Congress leadership to devise a strategy and capitalise on CAA-NRC-NPR. This is an excellent opportunity to confront the Modi Government and embarrass it to the hilt. Those who are familiar with the student movement and the background of Sahay know how he spearheaded the strike. This is the right time for the Congress to work unitedly. Congress central leadership should take the benefit of the long 45 years of experience of Sahay,” he said.

81,01-1-20,CM misleading slum dwellers by giving false certificates: Javadekar,"Justifying Prime Minister Narendra Modi Government’s step to confer ownership rights to people residing in unauthorised colonies, Union Minister and Delhi State election in-charge Prakash Javadekar said the decision was taken to give property rights to them not to gain votes, ahead of Delhi Asssembly elections.

Hitting out Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP's) national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Javadekar said he is misleading the slum dwellers by distributing false certificates.

Pertinently, Chief Minister Kejriwal announced to distribute certificates under DUSIB survey.

According to Delhi government around 65000 slums have been identified as dwellers and Kejriwal handed certificates to them to ensure pucca building at their place.

Taking swipe on AAP, Javadekar said that Kejriwal has become enemy of slum dwellers by obstructing the scheme Jahan Jhuggi Wahin Makan.

Javadekar in the presence of other Delhi Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) leaders on Tuesday launched the campaign - Main Hoon Dilli.

""The decision of Modi Government to confer ownership rights to the people of unauthorized colonies is not a decision taken in view of the elections rather it is a decision to do justice to people,"" the Union minister asserted.

""Our government has erased the blot of unauthorized from the heads of 40 lakh people living in unauthorized colonies for the last 40 years,"" he added.

The Convener of Delhi Election Management Committee Tarun Chugh who was also there during the launch of above said campaign, said that we are facing an atmosphere of challenge these days because Aam Aadmi Party Government enjoyed the fruits of power for about 5 years but did not do anything for the people. It failed to fulfill the election promises.

""Delhi Government failed to implement the PMAY in Delhi under which the Jhuggi dwellers could have been provided houses. AAP wants to come to power again with the help of false promises. Our challenge is to expose this falsehood of Aam Aadmi Party.

""BJP will apprise the people about the Public Welfare Schemes of Modi Government and the failure of Kejriwal Government by making public contact. The people of Delhi will again vote for BJP in the upcoming Assembly Elections and will certainly form BJP Government in Delhi,"" he added further.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-misleading-slum-dwellers-by-giving-false-certificates--javadekar.html

83,01-1-20,Popular picnic spots ready to host revelers,"With the City gearing up to welcome the New Year 2020, Ranchiites are ready to throng picnic spots around the State Capital. Ranchi with its simple way of living and natural beauty is home to numerous waterfalls and scenic viewpoints located just within a few kilometers.

For the past few years, one of the most popular destinations with the city residents has been the Patratu Valley. The long winding roads overlooking a breath taking valley is what makes the drive perfect. One can stop by the Dam which makes for a great picnic spot and also go boating in the water body.

“While driving in the Patratu Valley, the hairpin turns are what add to the excitement. This is best time to visit the dam as it is during this time of the year where one can see migratory birds which is otherwise a rare sight in the city. At the time of sunset, the lake reflects the evening sky which is breath taking,” said Pooja Kumari, a city based resident.

The Rock Garden in Kanke is one of the most visited places in the city not just by the locals but tourists as well. Located in a small hill by Kanke Dam, small waterfalls, sculptures and statues add to the charm of the place.

“The best thing about this place is that even though it is located in one of the busiest localities of Ranchi, it still happens to remain secluded. One can always find a quiet corner here. Another good thing is the small rides which provide ample entertainment for children. Even though it will be quite crowded on January 1, I will still go there with my family for a fun filled day,” said Sanjay Singh another city based resident.

For the spiritual souls who want to start the New Year by worshipping God, the city has several temples in its vicinity. The Jagannath Temple which has a striking resemblance to the one in Puri is located at a distance of about 10 Kms from the main road.

“This place is my absolute favourite and I make it a point to come here as frequently as possible. After seeking the deity’s blessings, I always make it a point to spend some time enjoying the view of the city from the top,” said Manoj Kumar, a city based yoga instructor.

The Sun Templs and Pahari Mandir are other popular options for those planning for peaceful New Year celebrations.

Jonha Falls, Hundru Falls, Dassam Falls are some of the preferred waterfalls located around the City popular with picnickers.

“Even though it is visited by a number of tourists every day, it is never overcrowded and one can easily find a quite spot. The Hundru Falls offers the best views of the Chotanagpur Plateau. Owing to the increasing tourist traffic, a number of small eateries have opened around the area with local delicacies on the menu which makes the visit all the more exciting,” said Megha, who is planning to visit the place with her friends on January 1.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/popular-picnic-spots-ready-to-host-revelers.html

The Ministry of Home Affairs is mulling the option of doing away with the present procedure of routing applications for citizenship through the district magistrate in view of the strong opposition expressed by several States, including Kerala which on Tuesday passed a resolution in the Assembly demanding scrapping of the controversial Act.

“We are thinking of designating a new authority instead of the district magistrate and make the entire process of application, examination of documents and granting Indian citizenship online,” a Home Ministry official said.

If the process becomes completely online, there will be no intervention from a State Government at any level.

Besides, the home ministry officials are of the opinion that the State Governments have no power to reject the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act as the legislation was enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution.

“The States have no power to deny implementation of a central law which is in the Union List,” the top official from the Home Ministry said.

There are 97 items which are under the Union List that include Defence, External Affairs, Railways, Citizenship and Naturalisation.

According to the amended Citizenship Act, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

The Act says refugees of the six communities will be given Indian citizenship after residing in India for five years, instead of 11 years earlier.

The act also proposes to give immunity to such refugees facing legal cases after being found as illegal migrants.

The Kerala Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution demanding scrapping of the controversial Act, amid raging countrywide protests against the legislation.

115,01-1-20,"Raj Govt panel gives doctors clean chit, blames hospital facilities","A Rajasthan Government committee found that Kota's JK Lone Hospital is short of beds and its functioning needs improvement but cleared the doctors there of any lapses over the recent death of infants admitted there, an official said.

At least 91 infants have died at the Government hospital during the past month, triggering opposition criticism and a visit by a team from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

The three-member State Government committee of

doctors was sent to investigate the 10 deaths on December 23 and 24.

Earlier, the NCPCR had served as show cause notice to the State Government. “Pigs were found roaming inside the campus of the hospital,” its chairperson Priyank Kanoongo had said in it.

The State Government panel found that the hospital was short of beds, functioning at 150 per cent of its capacity, Rajasthan Medical Education Secretary Vaibhav Galriya told PTI on Tuesday.

But the committee ruled that the 10 infants who died on the two days were given the right treatment. “The committee submitted that eight out of the 10 infants were referred from other hospitals in a critical condition and two were born at the hospital itself,” Galriya said.

“Due treatment was given to all of them. The committee had checked medical records. Whoever was to be put on ventilator, the required treatment was provided,” he added.

Moreover, the 10 infants who died were at higher risk due to pre-term birth, he said.

Galriya said the committee was instructed not only to look into the cause of deaths but also the functioning of the hospital.

“The committee said the hospital is working at 150 per cent of its capacity. The number of beds is less than the flow of patients. Similar is the situation at the ICUs as well. There is a need to increase the number of beds,” he said. He said instructions have been issued to take samples to check infections at the hospital on a monthly basis, earlier done once in three months.

Directions have also been given to lay oxygen pipelines, instead of supplying it to the intensive care unit (ICU) through cylinders.

The official said the hospital superintendent was removed from the post as a lot of equipment lay unused due to the lack of an annual maintenance contract.

The AMC process has now been initiated.

He said that the committee considered both the treatment and the larger systemic issues at the hospital.

“We are working on both the aspects, and would be working on improvement of systemic part so that better treatment can be given at the hospital,” he said.

The State Government committee included Dr Amarjeet Mehta, Dr Rambabu Sharma and Dr Sunil Bhatnagar.

A panel of BJP MPs also visited the hospital on Tuesday. The group included Lok Sabha MPs Jaskaur Meena, Locket Chatterjee and Bharati Pawar, and Rajya Sabha MP Kanta Kardam. Two State BJP leaders also met the staff on Monday.

116,01-1-20,BJP slams CM for taking no notice of tragedy,"A BJP lawmakers' panel on Tuesday slammed Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot for deaths of infants at a Kota hospital, saying he preferred to visit Jharkhand for the swearing-in of thenew Government there instead of“wiping” tears of deadchildren's mothers.

The three-member parliamentary panel, comprising Locket Chatterjee, Kanta Kardam and Jaskaur Meena, on Tuesday visited JK Lon Hospital, where at least 91 infants have died in the past month.

Meanwhile, Congress workers lodged a protest against the visit of the panel by forming a human chain outside the hospital and alleged that the BJP was trying to politicise the issue. “While children were dying in the hospital, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot went to Jharkhand and was celebrating the formation of the Government there. Mothers of dead children are still weeping but the CM is not here to wipe their tears,” Chatterjee said.

She said none of the Congress workers has come here so far but the BJP MLAs in Kota have extended monetary assistance of Rs 50 lakhs for the maintenance of the hospital, she said.

She also attacked former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, saying while he visited other states to highlight the issues, then why he gave a miss to Rajasthan, a State where his party ruled.

121,01-1-20,India can pre-emptively strike at terror sources: Army Chief,"Maintaining that a strategy of “resolute punitive response” has been evolved to punish cross-border terrorism, new Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday issued a strong warning to Pakistan saying India reserves the right to preemptively strike at sources of terror threat if the neighbouring country does not stop State-sponsored terrorism. As for China, General Naravane said India will continue to improve capability building along the Northern border.

General Naravane assumed charge here as the 28th Chief of Army Staff from outgoing chief General Bipin Rawat who handed over the baton to his successor in a ceremony in South Block. He is the third Army Chief from the Sikh Light Infantry after VP Malik and Bikram Singh.

Naravane was serving as the Vice Chief of Army since early September. Prior to that he served as the Eastern Army Commander and Commander Army Training Command (ARTRAC).

“The Pakistan Army's proxy war design received setback due to elimination of terrorists and decimation of terror networks (by India),” he told news agencies after taking charge.

Asked how he will deal with Pakistan backed terrorism, he said, “Multiple options across the spectrum of conflict are on the table to respond to any act of terror sponsored or abetted by Pakistan.”

On security challenges along the 3,500-km border with China, Gen Naravane said the focus has shifted from the Western border to the Northern border as part of re-balancing priorities. “We will continue to improve capability building along the Northernborder so we are prepared when the need arises,” he said.

Referring to the appointment of a Chief of Defence Staff, he said it will greatly change the way the defence establishment operates and will bring about significant reforms in the entire military system.

He said his main focus as Army chief will be to make the Army ready to face any threat at any time. According to him, the bottomline for reform in the Army will be to increase efficiency and operational readiness.

An alumnus of the National Defence Academy(NDA) and the Indian Military Academy(IMA), Naravane was commissioned into the 7th Battalion, the Sikh Light Infantry in June 1980. He has commanded a Rashtriya Rifles battalion in Kashmir, served in the Assam Rifles and has been part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka during 'Operation Pawan'. He has also served as Defence Attache to Myanmar.

122,01-1-20,Army better prepared to face challenges on borders: Rawat,"Newly-appointed first-ever Chief of Defence Staff(CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday said the focus on Army restructuring, weapon modernisation and non-contact warfare were some of the highlights of his tenure as Army Chief. The Army is “better prepared” to face any challenge that may come up at India's borders with Pakistan and China, Gen Bipin Rawat said.

He demitted officer after retiring as the Army Chief and handing over the charge to incoming Chief M M Naravane. Some of the major artillery gun systems, including the M777 American Ultra Light Howitzers and the K-9 Vajra, and the Sig Sauer assault rifles were inducted into the force in his tenure.

“Till now I was Chief of Army Staff and my mandate was limited to the roles and responsibility I was assigned. Now when I am given a new responsibility, I will think and will work according to the new responsibility and vigour. If someone says that as Army Chief I was working towards whether I would be CDS it will be totally incorrect,” he said here after reviewing a ceremonial guard of honour outside South Block before retiring. He will assume the new responsibility on Wednesday. Rawat also said the army is better prepared to face any challenge from Pakistan and China.

It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself who broke the news to Rawat about his appointment as the CDS during the farewell dinner hosted by the former for the outgoing chief.

Ahead of his taking charge as the CDS, the Government has issued a notification setting up a new Department of Military Affairs (DMA) within the Ministry of Defence. The notification issued by the Cabinet Secretariat dated December 30, 2019 states that the CDS will head the DMA and function as a Secretary to the Government.

As per the guidelines approved by the Government last week, the CDS will be a four-star General and will also function as the Principal Military Adviser to the Defence Minister and as the Permanent Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC).

The DMA will be the first department in the defence ministry. The existing ones are Department of Defence, Department of Defence Production, Department of Defence Research and Development and Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare.

The armed forces will be brought under the ambit of the DMA headed by the CDS who will deal with issues relating to the three Services and procurement exclusive to the Services except capital acquisitions, as per prevalent rules and procedures. The broad mandate of the CDS includes bringing about jointness in “operations, logistics, transport, training, support services, communications, repairs and maintenance of the three Services, within three years of the first CDS assuming office.”

The mandate of the DMA includes promoting jointness in procurement, training and staffing for the Services through joint planning and integration of their requirements; facilitation of restructuring of Military Commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through establishment of joint/theatre commands and promoting use of indigenous equipment by the Services.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/army-better-prepared-to-face-challenges-on-borders--rawat.html
123,01-1-20,Govt has started on wrong foot on CDS appointment: Cong,"The Congress on Tuesday raised several questions over the appointment of Gen Bipin Rawat as the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), saying the Government has started on a “wrong foot” on the issue. The party also asked whether the country was headed on a portentous path. The Congress summed up 2019 saying it will be remembered for the betrayal of the people's mandate and attempts to rip apart the plural fabric of India.

Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said the Government has started on a wrong foot on the appointment and only time will unfortunately reveal the implications. “With great regret and fullest of responsibility may I say that the government has started on a very wrong foot with regard to CDS. Time alone unfortunately will reveal the implications of this decision,” Tewari said.

He also asked why the appointment of a CDS is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities. “What implications does nomenclature Principal Military Advisor to Defence Minister have in relation to the three service chiefs in terms of Military advise tendered to the government? Will the advise of the CDS override the advise of the respective Service Chiefs,” he asked.

Tewari wondered if the CDS as Permanent Chairperson of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee outrank the three service Chiefs. “Would the three Chiefs report to Defense Minister through Defense Secretary or through CDS now,” he asked.

“What will be the position of CDS qua Defense Secretary? Would the Defense Secretary in terms of Rule 11 of Transaction of Business Rules continue to be the administrative head of the Defense Ministry ? What is the remit/mandate of the proposed Department of Military Affairs?

“Would the CDS overide the Service Chiefs with regard tri Service agencies and organisations. What are the implications of the appointment of a CDS on Civil Military Relations- the equilibrium of which has been India's singular Success since 1947? Are we down a portentous path,” questioned the former Union Minister.

Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel said 2019 is coming to an end but the problems of NDA 3 are only beginning. “2019 will remembered for the betrayal of the people's mandate and attempts to rip apart India's plural fabric. 2019 will be remembered for the resilience of our students and common citizens who challenged an arrogant and a powerful government for its unconstitutional moves,” Patel said in a tweet message.

Patel also hoped that 2020 will see a resurgence and coming together of “pro-Constitution and pro-India forces and defeat this government's anti-Indian policies”.

Another senior party leader P Chidambaram said, “Our task is no less than the task accomplished by Abraham Lincoln in 1865 - to save the Constitution.”

He also said that their first greetings for the New Year must go to J-K leaders Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others detained since August 5 without any charge. “May the New Year bring them freedom and justice,” he tweeted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-has-started-on-wrong-foot-on-cds-appointment--cong.html
124,01-1-20,Didi sends cake to Guv as latter signs held-up Bill,"In an apparent indication of a meltdown in the tensed relationship between Raj Bhavan and Nabanna (State secretariat) Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday sent cakes and flowers to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar who has been involved in a twitter war with the Bengal Chief Minister and her Cabinet colleagues over a number of issues.

What seemed to be a quid pro quo for the “cordial gesture” shown on the part of the State Government the Governor signed the Municipal (Amendment) Bill within hours of receiving State Education Minister Partho Chatterjee who saw him at Raj Bhavan as a special messenger of the Chief Minister.

The Bill had been held up in Raj Bhavan for quite some time now in the wake of continuous war of words between the two sides when the Chief Minister accused the Governor of being an “RSS man” who was running a parallel administration in the State while the latter lambasted the State administration for failing law and order and lack of courtesy on a whole lot of issues.

“The meeting was cordial and a lot things were discussed,” Chatterjee later said adding the Chief Minister had wished him a happy year ending and a Happy New Year. “Some important issues concerning education were also discussed with the Governor,” he said.

Meanwhile in an unrelated development the State Government on Tuesday shifted 52 officers of the Indian Police Services cadre. The 52 officers included seven deputy commissioners of police from Kolkata, sources said.

The SPs of Murshidabad, Jangipur police district, South Dinajpur, Barasat, East Midnapore were also transferred, sources said adding some of the officers were given promotion too.

Elsewhere members of the opposition BJP on Tuesday staged a road blockade near Jadavpur University and Jadavpur Police Station protesting against the alleged misdemeanor of JU students against their leaders on Monday.

JU students allegedly had a tiff with the BJP activists near the University campus where the saffron leaders were holding a meeting to drive home the “essence” of the Citizenship Amendment Act.

JU students said during the face off one of their lecturers and some students were roughed up by the BJP men.

Prof Mansoor gave the assurance to students and their parents in an open letter written to them, nearly a week before the varsity is set to reopen on January 6 after its winter break.

“I want to tell you and your families that I regret what happened (on December 15),” the VC wrote.

Referring to the decision to call in the police on the night of December 15, he said it was taken in “good faith and a clear conscience” as it had become imperative to disperse the protesters who had become charged up over the rumour that two student protesters at Jamia Milia Islamia in New Delhi had been killed.

The vice chancellor made an impassioned appeal to students “to consider with an open mind” the circumstances which compelled him to take the unpleasant decision of inviting the police to enter the campus.

In his open letter to students, Prof Mansoor said he would “fully share” their concerns on any subject provided it is done “in a peaceful and democratic manner”.

He sought to assure them that he has “no intention whatsoever” of trying in any way “to subvert the right of students to protest peacefully against any legislation” which they find objectionable. “You are the future of our democracy and all citizens, especially the young, enjoy the right to share their views in the true spirit of a democratic society,” the vice-chancellor's letter said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/amu-v-c-regrets-dec-15-night-police-action-in-varsity--seeks-to-assure-students-of-safety.html
128,01-1-20,PMK which supported CAA says no to NRC,"The Pattali Makkal Katchi, which supported the amendment to the citizenship law in Rajya Sabha, on Tuesday came out against implementing the proposed NRC in Tamil Nadu, saying it will create “unnecessary apprehension and tension” among people.

Citing claims that the National Population Register was a pilot to the eventual roll out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the PMK, an ally of the ruling AIADMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu in which the BJP is also a constituent, demanded that the Centre dispel misgivings related to the two measures.

In a resolution at its special general council meet, the party said Tamil Nadu does not share land borders with any country and hence, there was no scope for people from other countries to illegally enter the state.

Besides, the Government has data of all the Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka and thus “there is no need for implementing the National Register of Citizens in Tamil Nadu,” the PMK resolution, copies of which were released to the media, said.

The meet, held at Omandur near here, said apart from such factors, if the NRC was prepared “it will create unnecessary apprehension and tension among the Tamil Nadu people.”

Therefore, “this meet urges the Central and State Governments to not implement the NRC in Tamil Nadu,” it said. The party's lone member in Rajya Sabha, Anbumani Ramadoss, a former Union Minister, had voted with the Government on the Citizenship Amendment Bill that provided for Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

PMK also urged the Centre to grant dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees.

It wanted the Union government to go in for a pact with the neighbouring island republic to facilitate the dual citizenship since Lankans will lose their citizenship if they were to become nationals of another country.

The PMK meet demanded 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes in the All India Quota for medical seats. In government sector colleges, 15 per cent of graduate medical courses and 50 per cent postgraduate seats fall under the AIQ. A caste wise census in Tamil Nadu and declaring Cauvery basin districts in the state as a protected farm zone were among the other resolutions that were adopted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pmk-which-supported-caa-says-no-to-nrc.html

Singh, Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries in the Narendra Modi Govenrment, alleged that agitations on CAA and NRC were being carried out at the behest of the opponents “to protect the infiltrators”.

“The Opposition and tukde tukde gang are not only making efforts to create panic in the country on these issues but also want to bring back the situation of 1947 in the country.

“They are trying to do things which even Mughals and Britishers could not do...,” Singh — who represents Begusarai Lok Sabha seat - told reporters here at a press conference.

“They (opposition parties) want to create a civil war like situation in the country by spreading confusion on the twin issues in the society,” he said.

“The Opposition is speaking the language of Pakistan besides treading Jinnah's path”, the Minister commented.

Akhilesh Yadav also took to Twitter and wrote, “Don’t need NRC-NPR, we need employment.”

Flagging off a cycle rally of the party’s legislators from party’s headquarters to Vidhan Bhawan to register protest against the National Register of Citizens (NRC)/National Population Register (NPR) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Yadav said the Narendra Modi Government had brought CAA to enforce the policy of discrimination on the grounds of religion in giving citizenship which is against the basic structure of the Constitution.

“No one from the BJP can decide whether we are citizens or not. If the need arises, I will be the first one who will not fill any form, but the question is will you support it or not? We will not fill the NPR form. What will you do? NRC and NPR are against the poor and minorities,” he said.

He added that people in the North-East and Assam were also unhappy with the CAA. Yadav claimed that the BJP was spreading fear among people of the country in the name of CAA and NRC.

The SP chief also attacked the Centre for its decision to start the work on NPR from April next year, saying when all the details were already provided in Aadhaar, what was the need to conduct the NPR exercise across India.

Yadav said his party was strongly against the CAA, NRC and NPR and would keep protesting against the same. The SP chief also targeted the Government for failing to take effective measures to revive he country’s economy and said that the banking sector had collapsed and demonetisation had destroyed country’s economy.

He claimed that since the government had failed to create employment opportunities and revive the failing economy, it came up with CAA, NRC and NPR to divert the attention of people from real issues.

During the rally, the SP legislators of the SP, with placards around their neck, pedalled about one km to reach Vidhan Bhawan to attend the special session on Tuesday morning.

The sector was badly impacted in December and will also be in January, two of the peak months for tourist inflow, Assam Tourism Development Corporation (ATDC) chairman Jayanta Malla Baruah said here.

The peak tourist season in Assam is from December to March and accounts for 48 per cent of the sector's contribution for the entire year, he said. “Due to the violent protests during December, we suffered badly.

We estimate that Rs 500 crore will be the loss to the sector for December and January each,” he told a press conference here.

The hotel industry alone suffered a loss of Rs 60 crore in 15 days since December 11, when violence erupted across Assam against the CAA.

Along with domestic tourists, the flow from abroad also took a hit after a number of countries issued travel advisories due to the ongoing protests, Baruah said.

The earnings of the State from the tourism sector is Rs 2,000-2,500 crore per annum.

148,01-1-20,Winds of change in MP farm sector,"Sowing the seeds of change, Chief Minister Kamal Nath is leading the effort to expand croplands, enhance quality and quantity of yield to ensure fast development of farming communities in Madhya Pradesh.

Announcing a huge farm loan waiver even before assuming office a year ago, Nath has followed up with back to back schemes to bolster the farming sector which contributes nearly a quarter of the Sstate GDP.

The schemes launched over the year have been met with optimism from farmers as the new systematic plan will help control spiralling production costs and thus ensure that the sector continues to remain profitable despite an upward trend in prices.

The farm loan waiver disbursements scheme is set to result in 12 lakh farmers benefitting to the tune of Rs 11,675 crore while its initial stage, concluded earlier this year, culminated with the state government writing off loans amounting to Rs. 7,154 crore benefitting over 20 lakh farmers.

In an effort to bring down production costs the state government is now providing electricity at a 50 percent reduced tariff to farmers for the power consumed by agricultural pumps of up to 10 horsepower. Farmers developing their own seeds can now avail free of cost examination of their seeds. Farmers can further expect stable prices for their wheat produce even in case of a bumper crop in the state.

Profitability for Corn and Soyabean growers has also been ensured by extending to them the benefits of Bhavantar scheme which pays them the difference between the official Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Model Price at which the crops are sold. The current Bhavantar benchmark price is Rs 160 higher than that fixed by the central government.

Highlighting the efficiency of state government efforts, officials at the state agriculture department point towards a considerable upswing in the sowing acreage during the Kharif season and are optimistic of the trend continuing in the Rabi season.

While the acreage of Kharif sowing grew from 132.97 lakh hectares in 2018 to 136.99 lakh hectares in 2019. Similarly, the target sowing acreage for 2019 Rabi season has been set at 119.18 lakh hectares, an increase of over 2.5 lakh hectares over the previous year. Considerable expansion has also been recorded in the organic farming acreage which now stands at 2.13 lakh hectares with the same being promoted to 3828 clusters and groups. Organic cotton is a promising sector with Madhya Pradesh accounting for nearly 35 percent of the total organic cotton production in the world.

An ongoing pilot project is testing soil health from a model village in each development block, samples from nearly a lakh of villages have been analysed and soil health cards have been issued to around one lakh farmers.

All necessary steps have been initiated by the Kamal Nath Government to ensure a timely and steady supply of Urea and Fertilisers to farmers in the ongoing season.

While a section of Congress leaders is upset over non-induction of the party loyalists into the new council of ministers, leaders of the Sena have expressed disapproval over party seniors and former ministers not finding place.

On Monday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray inducted a total of 36 ministers in his one-month-old coalition government comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.

Among the 36, 14 ministers (ten Cabinet and four MoS) belonged to the NCP, 12 to the Sena (eight Cabinet and four MoS), and 10 to Congress (eight Cabinet and two MoS).

Hours after the cabinet expansion on Monday night, NCP MLA from Beed district Prakash Solanke had announced that he will resign on Tuesday, saying he was “unworthy to do politics”.

However, on Tuesday, NCP leadership succeeded in making him change his mind.

Reports of some Sena leaders being unhappy after not being inducted into the new cabinet are also doing rounds.

Thackeray has dropped several ministers, including seniors like Ramdas Kadam, Diwakar Raote and Ravindra Waikar who were part of the previous BJP-led Government, in the new Government.

151,01-1-20,Eng might drop either Anderson or Broad for 2nd Test,"England coach Chris Silverwood has hinted that either of veterans James Anderson or Stuart Broad might be dropped for the second Test against South Africa to make room for a spinner.

A 107-run defeat in the series-opening Boxing Day Test in Centurion has once again spelled out England's red-ball troubles.

Adding to their woes, illness bout within the squad that laid low 10 people at various times has only compounded matters, with Dominic Sibley latest to join the long list of players to have been afflicted.

Spinner Jack Leach has now regained fitness and the coach said they are willing to take a hard call if need be. In the first Test, England went for an all pace attack.

“In Jimmy (Anderson) and Stuart (Broad), we have a wealth of experience and we’d be really stupid not to take that into consideration every game,” Silverwood was quoted as saying by ICC.

“But, equally, you want your youngsters to come through, and if we’re going to make room for a spinner, we’ve got to have a look at which seamers are right for this pitch. If there’s a big decision, we're not afraid to make it.”

The Newlands pitch is one of the few in the country that assists spin bowling, and Silverwood was well aware of that fact.”We’ve got to look at playing a spinner at Newlands,” he said. “We’ll go down there and do what we always do - look through the records, what features where, and who is going to have most impact on that game. We'll do our homework and go from there.""

England Test captain Joe Root also echoed these sentiments ahead of the second Test.

“It’s a fine balance. You’ve got to look at the surface and at an attack you feel is best going to counter that and best counter the opposition,” he said.

“I think the ideal scenario is to have people pushing them [Anderson and Broad] all the time, so that they’re constantly trying to improve themselves. They’ve got fantastic records behind them and they’ve produced fantastic things for England in the very recent past.

152,01-1-20,"DoT meets telecom operators, vendors to discuss 5G trials","A day after the government said all operators will be allowed to participate in the upcoming 5G trials, the Department of Telecom (DoT) held a meeting with various service providers and equipment vendors, including Huawei, to discuss the way forward. The meeting on Tuesday, chaired by Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, lasted for over an hour. An official with one of the telcos said that all operators attended the meeting.

A Huawei executive, who was present at the meeting, declined to comment on the proceedings. Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said the government will allocate airwaves to all telecom service providers for conducting trials of super-fast speed 5G networks.

As things stand today, India will not bar any equipment suppliers in the upcoming trials for 5G. Asked specifically about the status of Huawei in this context, the minister had said, “All players mean all players”. This stance is expected to spell relief for the Chinese gear maker, which is facing curbs in the US, and rivals western equipment makers such as Ericsson.

Many countries, however, have allowed telecom service providers to use Chinese gears. And now, India has also indicated its unwillingness to keep any company out of 5G trials. This implies that all operators, backed by equipment vendors they have decided to partner with, will be able to participate in the upcoming 5G trials in the country.

“I would like new innovations by Indian players in 5G. 5G is future, it is speed. Therefore, we will encourage new innovations in 5G,” the minister had said on Monday on the sidelines of a telecom event. Huawei India CEO Jay Chen had said in an e-mail statement to PTI on Monday that the company firmly believes that only technology innovations and high-quality networks will be the key to rejuvenating the Indian telecom industry.

Thanking the Indian government for their continued faith in the company, Chen had said, “We have our full confidence in the Modi government to drive 5G in India. We have our full confidence in Indian government and industry to partner with best technology for India’s own long-term benefit and also for cross-industry development.” Huawei is committed to India, the company said. The 5G trials are widely-expected to begin between January and March. Sources had recently said the government has received seven applications for 5G trials and added that all operators and vendors (including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE and Samsung) are keen to participate.

In September this year, Huawei had said it is hopeful that the Indian government will treat all foreign investments “fairly” and had urged the world’s largest democracy to make an “independent decision” on permitting 5G trials in the country. At that time, the Chinese firm had also sought to assure the Indian government that the company is fully compliant with regulations in India, and of addressing concerns around cybersecurity.

Earlier this year, the US had banned Huawei, the world’s leader in telecom equipment and the number two smartphone producer, over concerns of security and Washington had been pressuring other countries to restrict the operations of the Chinese telecom firm. The US President Donald Trump-led administration had placed Huawei and its affiliates on a blacklist, a move that banned the Chinese telecom equipment company from purchasing parts and components from American firms without the US government approval. However, it had subsequently relaxed some of the restrictions, to reduce disruption for its customers.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/dot-meets-telecom-operators--vendors-to-discuss-5g-trials.html
153,01-1-20,Draft recommendations issued on network testing norms for wireline services,"Telecom regulator Trai on Tuesday issued draft recommendations on ‘network testing before commercial launch of wireline services’ as it mooted a 90-day limit on the test phase involving trial subscribers in such cases. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has sought stakeholders’ views on the draft recommendations that are modelled on the lines similar to norms that it had previously prescribed in the case of mobile services.

“Most of the issues raised during the consultation process for the norms for network testing before commercial launch for mobile services, are equally applicable for wireline access services. “However, as per the reference received from the Department of Telecom (DoT), this consultation paper on draft recommendations is issued to solicit the views of the stakeholders for specifying the norms of network testing before commercial launch of services for wireline access services,” Trai said.

According to the draft recommendations, a telecom service provider should be allowed to enrol test subscribers in the trial phase to carry out the network testing before commercial launch of its services. “The authority recommends that there should be no restriction on the time-limit, if the network testing is conducted using wireline telephone test connections given to employees and business partners for test purpose only,” it said. The number of test subscribers that can be enrolled by an operator in a circle should be limited to 5 per cent of its installed network capacity for that area. “The service provider will submit the detailed capacity calculations of the network to DoT and Trai at least 15 days before commencing enrolment of test subscribers,” it added.

The draft recommendations also said that there should be a limit of 90 days on the test phase involving test subscribers. “However, if the TSP fails to conclude network testing due to valid reasons, it may make a representation to the licensor, seeking additional time for network testing giving detailed justification, which may be decided by the licensor on a case-to-case basis. The requisite norms to be followed for extension of timeline for network testing may be formulated by the licensor,” Trai said. The duration for network testing provided to the operator should not exceed 180 days, according to the draft.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/draft-recommendations--issued-on-network-testing--norms-for-wireline-services.html

Since August, the eight core industries are recording negative growth.

The output of coal, crude oil, natural gas, steel, and electricity declined by 2.5 per cent, 6 per cent, 6.4 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively, according to the data.

The eight core sectors had expanded by 3.3 per cent in November 2018.

The growth rate of cement production dropped to 4.1 per cent from 8.8 per cent in November 2018.

The output of refinery products and fertilizers increased by 3.1 per cent and 13.6 per cent respectively in November 2019 over the year-ago month.

During the April-November period, core industries recorded flat growth (zero per cent) against 5.1 per cent in the year-ago period.

Commenting on the data, ICRA Ltd said: ""We expect the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) to report a modest growth in November 2019 after having contracted since September 2019"".

These industries comprise 40.27 per cent of the weight of items included in the IIP.

155,01-1-20,Iraq warns US ties at stake after deadly strikes,"Iraq’s Government warned Monday that its relations with the United States were at risk after deadly American air strikes against a pro-Iran group sparked anger on the streets, with protesters torching US flags.

Baghdad said it would summon the US ambassador while Washington responded by accusing Iraqi authorities of having failed to “protect” US interests.

At least 25 fighters were killed in Sunday night’s attacks, which saw US planes hit several bases belonging to the Hezbollah Brigades, one of the most radical factions of Hashed al-Shaabi, a Tehran-backed Iraqi paramilitary coalition.

The attacks came as Iraq is caught up in mounting tensions between its allies Tehran and Washington while it also grapples with huge street protests against corruption and Iran’s growing political influence in the country.

The strikes “killed 25 and wounded 51, including commanders and fighters, and the toll could yet rise,” said the Hashed, which holds major sway in Iraq.

Victims were still being pulled from the rubble of bases near Al-Qaim, an Iraqi district bordering Syria, on Monday, it said.

The Hezbollah Brigades said they will hold a mass funeral ceremony on Tuesday in Baghdad near the high-security Green Zone, where the US embassy is located.

Iraq’s government, acting in a caretaker capacity following the resignation of prime minister Adel Abdel Mahdi in the face of street protests, denounced the strikes and warned they could affect ties with Washington.

“American forces acted on their political priorities, not those of the Iraqis,” a statement said, adding that such strikes “violate the sovereignty of Iraq”.

The attacks “force Iraq to review its relations and its security, political and legal framework to protect its sovereignty”, the government added.

The warning came as demonstrators torched US flags in the Shiite-dominated southern cities of Basra and Najaf as well as in Kirkuk, north of Baghdad, while lawmakers called for US troops to be booted out of Iraq.

In a phone call on Monday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “agreed that the Iranian regime and its proxies continue to be a destabilizing force in the region and that nations have a right to defend themselves in the face of these threats,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

Pompeo “underscored that attacks by the Iranian regime, or their proxies of any identity, that harm Americans, our allies, or our interests will be answered with a decisive response, as demonstrated yesterday.”

Dozens of lawmakers called on the government to review an agreement allowing the deployment of 5,200 US soldiers in the country, saying the strikes amount to a violation that renders the pact obsolete.

US Assistant Secretary of State David Schenker said the strikes were a “proportionate” response for the death Friday of a US civilian contractor in Kirkuk in a Hezbollah Brigades rocket attack.

“We don’t want an escalation here, we want a de-escalation,” he added however. Abdel Mahdi said he had been forewarned by US Defense Secretary Mark Esper that the US would carry out the attacks.

“He told me the United States would strike the Hezbollah Brigades and I told him it would be a very dangerous act that could lead to an escalation,” Abdel Mahdi said.

Tensions have soared between the United States and Iran since Washington pulled out of a multilateral nuclear agreement with Tehran last year and imposed crippling sanctions Iraqi leaders fear their country could become a battleground between Tehran and Washington.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iraq-warns-us-ties-at-stake-after-deadly-strikes.html
156,01-1-20,2019: India deepens strategic ties with SA,"The bilateral ties between India and South Africa further deepened in 2019 with the two countries stepping up their cooperation in the area of defence and developing a road map to enhance their strategic partnership.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26. The visit of Ramaphosa, the second South African president to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations, was of high symbolic value and was very special for both the countries as India celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, while South Africa observed the 100th birth anniversary of the anti-apartheid icon, Nelson Mandela.

Twenty-four years ago, shortly after the end of the Apartheid regime in early 1994, Mandela came to India as the Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade in 1995.

In 1997, India and South Africa signed the Strategic Partnership, called the Red Fort Declaration. Since then, the bilateral ties between the two countries have grown stronger with the two nations having MoUs in practically all areas.

During his 2019 India visit, President Ramaphosa renewed the Declaration with the three-year Strategic Programme of Cooperation (2019-2021), which aims at enhancing bilateral cooperation in a time-bound manner. The strategic programme will facilitate expansion of ties in several key areas such as defence, maritime security and trade and investment.

India and South Africa also resolved to work together to address the issue of fugitive economic offenders through international organisations and institutions, such as G20, Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and others.

The year 2019 also witnessed the first-ever joint India-Africa military training exercise, which was held in Pune in March and was participated by nine countries, including South Africa. The other countries which attended the Indian- Africa Field Training Exercise were Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania, Namibia, Mozambique, Uganda, Niger and Zambia.

The bygone year also saw many Indian companies expanding their businesses in South Africa.

While, global natural resources player Vedanta Resources Ltd — which has already invested Rs 3,000 crore in South Africa — announced a fresh investment of Rs 8,500 crore to expand its mining and allied operations, carmaker Mahindra & Mahindra —which is celebrating 15th year of its operations in the resource-rich country — has inaugurated its Special Fitment Centre in Gauteng.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/2019--india-deepens-strategic-ties-with-sa.html
157,01-1-20,Re-emphasise teaching goals,"Surabhi Goel lists digital trends that can be seen in the education sector this year

Technology continues to deeply impact every aspect of life and education is no different. The digital divide is shrinking steadfastly at a rate of five per cent annually and internet growth statistics show that by the year 2028, 100 per cent of the world population will have internet access. Access to internet coupled with other technological advancement will completely transform the way education has been imparted till now. Here are some trends of the immediate future.

Individualised learning plans

Thousands of years ago India had the gurukul system. Each child would get individualised learning as per their ability.Somewhere we lost this wonderful gift of teaching and learning. Till date students continue to learn at different speeds yet we churn them out of schools like factories would churn out goods. We all wish that we could run schools with a smaller student teacher ratio but unfortunately that is not always possible. Technology is helping put forward a customised approach which help students learn with techniques that interest them the most. The ILP will not only help students learn at their own pace, but also track and manage their learning needs. This is especially beneficial for students with learning difficulties who engage better via listening and speaking mediums.But most importantly by introducing a customised learning plan in discussion with the student, their buy-in is greater and the students develop self-reflective abilities.

Online assessments for tracking student performance

Online assessment platforms have transformed the way teachers evaluate the performance of the students. They are also used by classroom teachers to understand what percentage of the class has understood the didactic and therefore, plan lessons better.

Students will continue to have a place to express their feelings and thoughts

More and more youngsters are committed to bring about positive change at a large scale basis. Crowdfunding is possible at a click of a button. There are several platforms which gives a voice to students. They support a cause and feel like they are a part of a larger community and this has been possible due to technology.

Educators will have to be open to change and adapt to changing technology

Educators who aren’t willing to adapt to the technological revolution run the risk of becoming redundant. Upgradation of skills will enable educators to widen the technological knowledge pool of students and then leave the choice of utilising the skills up to them. They will have to upskill themselves to be able to keep pace with the learners.

Game based learning

There are several game based learning programmes for children as young as five to six years old which are helping children learn complex concepts in a simple and effortless manner. There is instant feedback given to the student player. Different levels help to track learning progress and gives students and teachers a clear learning pathway to go to the next level.

School management systems have changed the way the schools now connect with various stakeholders — parents, students and teachers

More and more schools are now adopting SMS to develop a comprehensive eco system where real time information of their childrenis available. It is also a very convenient tool for working parents. More and more schools will continue to digitise their communication which could even include sending out simple circulars via email instead of hard copies.

Schools spaces are evolving

There will be libraries with no books, just kindles and tablets. Think labs and innovative centres will be set up which will support robotics, artificial intelligence, and product designs using 3D printers. Use of virtual reality kits to simulate real life experiences will increase.

It will be up to instructional designers and educational technologies to make the most of the opportunities provided by technology to change education so that effective and efficient education is available to everyone everywhere.

While all these positive trends will be on the rise in the future, a dilemma will continue to plague education leaders.

On one end, schools with access to international pedagogies, bring your own device policies and latest gadgets such as VR sets and 3D printers, are wondering if they need to reduce screen time and introduce activities which build character and develop motor skills by introducing carpentry, gardening or Taekwondo, the other upcoming schools are bringing in interactive white boards and upgrading their ICT labs.

Technology is agreat equaliser and thus those who do not have access to it can be left behind. But like with everything in life, moderation is the key. The onus lies on both parents and educators to set boundaries on utilisation of digital media by children.

159,01-1-20,2019: Year full of development,"Last year saw AI, ML and data science as the flavours of the season. Hari Krishnan Nair lists the trends that ruled this year

The year 2019 was full of developments in the professional education space and upskilling platforms have fared in the bygone months. The key trends witnessed in the space in 2019 are as follows.

Trend 1: Revenue growth of ed-tech companies

The surge witnessed by ed-tech companies in the professional education space, over the last one year is phenomenal. We have seen significant growth over the past one-year with professionals increasingly opting for high-quality up-skilling programmes that can help them achieve career transitions. We generated around `150 crore in revenue in FY19, and expect to achieve a turnover of `400 crore by the end of this fiscal and `1000 crore by FY21.

Trend 2: Freshers opting for courses in Data Science, AI and ML

Industry expectations from freshers have changed drastically over the year. Corporates now want to hire professionals that are well versed in new-age skills like devops, data science, machine learning and cloud. We have seen great demand for our data science programme that is focused on fresh graduates looking to build a career in data science and analytics. Recently, about 60 per cent of our current batch has already been placed with an average salary package of `5.6 lac per annum (85 per cent more as opposed to the usual `3 to `3.5 lac per annum). Several students with one to two years of prior experience have infact even drawn a 100 per cent hike on their salary. This course has helped thousands of professionals to bag better roles and pay packages this year.

Trend 3: Tech companies increasingly partnering with edtech platforms

Re-skill is the current buzzword echoing off corporate walls as companies are driving large scale initiatives among the existing workforce to build a continuous learning culture. Skilling has become a priority for organisations. We have made rapid strides in delivering in-depth and quality pedagogy to the professionals through multiple learning models and are now working with corporates to deliver tailor-made programmes keeping in mind the roles and requirements within the organisation.

161,01-1-20,Make right choice,"Planning a career is a lifelong process, which begins by choosing the course stream of your choice, getting a job and growing in the job. It is important to think wisely while selecting the right career and arriving at the right decision. Embarking on a path which leads to a bright career in future is not accidental. In fact, the process of choosing a career is an introspective and important task.

It is important to begin early and to know and learn about options that lie ahead of you after school so that you can make an intelligent and calculated decision.

Considering there are about 9,000 career options in the world, the spectrum of choice is wide ranging from humanities to commerce, science to medicine and engineering, management to defence amongst others. A plethora of opportunities awaits students of Humanities stream. Designers (interior/exterior, jewellery, fashion/textile), fine arts, photography, print journalism, travel and tourism, law, mass communication, film making, advertising, public relations and hotel industry are a few options to be considered.

With the positive changing scenario around the world in the realm of economic activity, selecting Commerce as a career option is one of the best to grab. Commerce students get familiar with knowledge of business, trade, market fluctuation, basics of economics, fiscal policies, industrial policies, share market, stock markets and others. Considering the burgeoning activity of market, talented individuals are needed to make a balance between demand and supply.

Individuals with careers in science are responsible for many of the things we, as a society, benefit from every day — ways to prevent and cure diseases, new technology, and strategies to help control climate change.

The breadth of careers in engineering spans from mechanical to electrical, civil, environmental, software, chemical, aerospace, petroleum, geological and mining.

Medicine is the field of health and healing. Not only that, Medicine is one of the most innovative and profitable industries worldwide. It is one of the oldest and most respected professions.

Management is one of the largest, most varied, and most interesting areas of work in the global economy. Itincludes but is not restricted to consulting, entrepreneurship, human resources, general management. Non-profit areas and strategic planning are few others to come under its purview.

A career in defence promises one of the most prestigious and respected positions in the country. It makes a person not only disciplined and strong but also opens up many avenues of growth.

The choice is yours, choose wisely.

162,01-1-20,CAD narrows to 0.9 pc of GDP in Sept quarter on lower trade deficit: RBI,"India's current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.9 per cent of GDP, or $6.3 billion, in the September 2019 quarter, on account of lower trade deficit.

It had stood at 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), or $19 billion, in the corresponding quarter of 2018-19. On a sequential basis, CAD had printed 2 per cent of GDP, or $14.2 billion, in the June 2019 quarter. The current account deficit is the difference between foreign exchange inflows and outflows.

164,01-1-20,Fiscal deficit hits 115% of Budget Estimate till Nov,"The country's fiscal deficit hit 114.8 per cent of 2019-20 Budget Estimate at Rs 8.07 lakh crore at the end of November, official data showed on Tuesday.

The fiscal deficit or the gap between expenditure and revenue was at Rs 8,07,834 crore as on November 30, 2019, according to the data released by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA).

The deficit was at 114.8 per cent of 2018-19 Budget Estimate (BE) in the corresponding month a year ago.

The Government has estimated the fiscal deficit for the current financial year at Rs 7.03 lakh crore, aiming to restrict the deficit at 3.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).

In September, the Government decided to lower the tax rate for corporates and has pegged that it will have an impact of Rs 1.45 lakh crore on its revenue mobilisation.

Tax sops were intended to boost the investment cycle in the face of slowing GDP growth, which dipped to a six-year low of 5 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal. The GDP growth slipped further to an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter ended September.

Due to slowdown, the GST collection has also been subdued putting pressure on overall revenue mobilisation effort of the government.

Faced with a shortfall in revenue collection, the Government has initiated austerity measures by revising downwards the expenditure limit for the January-March period of the ongoing financial year. The Government has asked all departments to restrict the expenses to 25 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE) in January-March.

According to official statement, ""the Government of India has received Rs 10,12,223 crore (48.60 per cent of corresponding BE 2019-20 of Total Receipts) up to November 2019 comprising Rs 7,50,614 crore Tax Revenue (Net to Centre), Rs 2,32,600 crore of Non-Tax Revenue and Rs 29,009 crore of Non-Debt Capital Receipts.""

Non Debt Capital Receipts consists of Recovery of Loans (Rs 10,910 crore) and Disinvestment Proceeds (Rs 18,099 crore), it said.

For the entire 2019-20, the revenue receipts have been pegged at Rs 19.62 lakh crore.

It further said Rs 4,21,850 crore has been transferred to State Governments as Devolution of Share of Taxes by Government of India up to this period which is Rs 10,113 crore lower than the previous year.

""Total Expenditure incurred by Government of India is Rs 18,20,057 crore (65.3 per cent of corresponding BE 2019-20), out of which Rs 16,06,215 crore is on Revenue Account and Rs 2,13,842 crore is on Capital Account,"" it said.

The Government has pegged its total expenditure for 2019-20 at Rs 27.86 lakh crore.

Out of the Total Revenue Expenditure, Rs 3,41,812 crore is on account of interest payments and Rs 2,35,015 crore is on account of major subsidies.

The fiscal deficit figure in monthly accounts during a financial year is not necessarily an indicator of fiscal deficit for the year, as per the CGA.

Its data gets impacted by a temporal mismatch between the flow of non-debt receipts and expenditure up to that month on account of various transitional factors both on receipt and expenditure side, which may get substantially offset by the end of the financial year.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fiscal-deficit-hits-115--of-budget-estimate-till-nov.html
165,01-1-20,Infra spend can be trigger for boosting growth: ICRA,"At a time when the overall economic growth is slowing, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement of `102 lakh crore worth of investment in infrastructure projects over the next five years, can be a trigger for boosting growth, says ICRA.

According to the rating agency, the construction sector is likely to be a major beneficiary of this increased investment.

The finance minister on Tuesday announced the infrastructure project pipeline for the next five years that will help the country nearly double the size of the GDP to $5 trillion by 2025.

""Creation of the national infrastructure pipeline in a short span of time is a positive step. The distribution of the infrastructure investment is in line with our expectations with a major allocation going towards transportation, energy and water segments. The front-loading of capex is also positive for construction sector,"" ICRA's Senior Vice-President and Group-Head, Corporate Ratings Shubham Jain said.

According to the sector-wise break-up of projects, `24.54 lakh crore investment will flow in the energy sector, and of that `11.7 lakh crore would be in just the power sector, while road projects will account for `19.63 lakh crore while another `13.68 lakh crore would be for railway

projects.

Port projects would see spending of `1 lakh crore and airports another `1.43 lakh crore. `16.29 lakh crore would be spent on urban infrastructure and `3.2 lakh crore in telecom projects. Jain, however noted that while the target of scaling up investment in infrastructure is achievable, it would be filled with challenges.

""The Centre will require support from the state governments and the private sector to achieve this significant scale-up of investment as these two together have to undertake over 61 per cent of the investment,"" he said.

Further, reducing bottlenecks and resolving issues which have resulted in significant cost and time overruns will also be vital for efficient utilisation of the planned investment, Jain added.

Meanwhile, welcoming the move, Anshuman Magazine Chairman and CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa of CBRE, said the move reinforces the government's commitment towards making India a leading world economy.

Naredco National President Niranjan Hiranandani said the move dovetails with other positive moves that the government has recently unveiled, and the positive effects should be visible sooner rather than later.

""The importance of infrastructure development in GDP growth has been apparent, the world over we have seen governments giving a push to infrastructure with the aim of giving a fillip to economic growth. India has been working towards the agenda of giving infrastructure development it's due especially in the scenario where the economy needs a fillip,"" he added.

Knight Frank India Chairman and MD Shishir Baijal opined that the announcement has re-enforced the government's commitment towards infrastructure growth providing the requisite clarity.

""Apart from the fact that a robust infrastructure is one of the key conditions to overall growth of the economy, this will create a stable base for India's economic recovery soon,"" he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/infra-spend-can-be-trigger-for-boosting-growth--icra-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/infra-spend-can-be-trigger-for-boosting-growth--icra.html
166,01-1-20,US Embassy attacked in Baghdad,"Dozens of angry Iraqi Shiite militia supporters broke into the US Embassy compound in Baghdad on Tuesday after smashing a main door and setting fire to a reception area, prompting tear gas and sounds of gunfire.

An Associated Press reporter at the scene saw flames rising from inside the compound and at least three US soldiers on the roof of the main embassy building. There was a fire at the reception area near the parking lot of the compound but it was unclear what had caused it.

A man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying: “The message was delivered.”

The embassy attack, one of the worst in recent memory, followed deadly US airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The US military said the airstrikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that it had blamed on the militia.

Dozens of protesters pushed into the compound after smashing the gate used by cars to enter the embassy. The protesters, many in militia uniform, stopped in a corridor after about 5 meters, and were only about 200 meters away from the main building.

Half a dozen US soldiers were seen on the roof of the main building, their guns were pointed at the protesters.

Smoke from the tear gas rose in the area, and at least three of the protesters appeared to have difficulties breathing. It wasn’t immediately known whether the embassy staff had remained inside the main building or were evacuated at some point.

There was no immediate comment from the US Embassy.

The protesters hanged a poster on the wall: “America is an aggressor,” and some commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran joined the protesters. Among those was Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the state-sanctioned paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units, the umbrella group for the Iran-backed militias.

Yassine al-Yasseri, Iraq’s interior minister, also appeared outside the embassy at one point and walked around to inspect the scene.

He told the AP that the prime minister had warned the US strikes on the Shiite militiamen would have serious consequences.

“This is one of the implications,” al-Yasseri said. “This is a problem and is embarrassing to the government.”

He said more security will be deployed to separate the protesters from the embassy, an indication the Iraqi troops would not move in to break up the crowd by force.

Earlier, the mob shouted “Down, Down USA!” as the crowd tried to push inside the embassy grounds, hurling water and stones over its walls. They raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassy’s security staff who remained behind the glass windows in the gates’ reception area and also sprayed graffiti on the wall and windows. The graffiti, in red in support of the Kataeb Hezbollah, read: “Closed in the name of the resistance.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-embassy-attacked-in-baghdad.html
167,01-1-20,Baghdad failed to ‘protect’ Americans: Washington,"Washington has accused Iraqi authorities of having failed to “protect” US interests, the day after deadly American air strikes against a pro-Iran group sparked anger.

At least 25 fighters were killed in Sunday night’s attacks, which were in retaliation for the death last week of a US civilian contractor.

“We have warned the Iraqi government many times, and we’ve shared information with them to try to work with them to carry out their responsibility to protect us,” a senior US State Department official told reporters in Washington on Monday.

He noted that the US military and diplomats are in the country “upon the invitation of the Iraqi government.” “So it’s their responsibility and duty to protect us. And they have not taken the appropriate steps to do so,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Multiple attacks have in recent weeks targeted Iraqi bases where Americans are present. The United States has blamed the attacks on pro-Iran factions.

On Sunday, the US-led air strikes were directed at several bases belonging to the Hezbollah Brigades, one of the most radical factions of Hashed al-Shaabi, a Tehran-backed Iraqi paramilitary coalition.

The strikes “killed 25 and wounded 51,” according to the Hashed, which holds major sway in Iraq.

The attack was in retaliation for the death Friday of a US civilian contractor in Kirkuk in a Hezbollah Brigades rocket attack.

In a phone call on Monday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “agreed that the Iranian regime and its

proxies continue to be a destabilizing force in the region and that nations have a right to defend themselves in the face of these threats,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

Pompeo “underscored that attacks by the Iranian regime, or their proxies of any identity, that harm Americans, our allies, or our interests will be answered with a decisive response, as demonstrated yesterday.” Iraq’s government denounced Sunday’s strikes and warned they could affect ties with Washington.

The attacks “force Iraq to review its relations and its security, political and legal framework to protect its sovereignty,” the government said in a statement.

The warning came as demonstrators torched US flags in the Shiite-dominated southern cities of Basra and Najaf, and in Kirkuk north of Baghdad, while lawmakers called for US troops to be booted out of Iraq.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/baghdad-failed-to----protect----americans--washington.html
168,01-1-20,Trump expects Iraq to ‘use its forces’ to protect US Embassy in Baghdad,"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he expects Iraq to “use its forces” to protect the US embassy in Baghdad after pro-Iran protesters breached the outer wall of the compound.

“We expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!” Trump tweeted.

Iraqi supporters of pro-Iran factions attacked the embassy early Tuesday, breaching its outer wall and chanting “Death to America” in anger over weekend air strikes that killed two dozen fighters.

It was the first time in years that protesters have been able to reach the US embassy, which is sheltered behind a series of checkpoints in the high-security Green Zone.

Trump blamed Iran for organizing the attack and warned Tehran would be held accountable.

“Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible,” he tweeted.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-expects-iraq-to----use-its-forces----to-protect-us-embassy-in-baghdad.html

170,01-1-20,2020: on a high note,"Salaries in India are projected to rise 10% in 2020, marginallyhigher than the actual increase (9.9%) in 2019, according to the latest Q3 2019 Salary Budget Planning Report released by Willis Towers Watson, the global advisory, broking and solutions company. The report looks at a range of job grades across various industry sectors and is designed to provide companies with guidance for their annual salary forecasting for the year ahead.

While salary increases in India are stabilising around the 10% mark, they remain the highest in the Asia Pacific region.Indonesia is projected at 8%, China at 6.5%, Philippines at 6%, Hong Kong and Singapore both at 4%.

Sharing his perspective on the findings, Rajul Mathur, Consulting Leader- Talent & Rewards, Willis Towers WatsonIndia said: “Though salary increases in India still continue to be among the highest in the region, companies aretaking a cautious approach and do not intend to make any significant changes from previous years. Companies are beginning to make selective skill-based compensation adjustments to cater to requirements around automation and digitisation. Going forward,organisations should continue to re-examine the alignment between their business and talent strategies, as well as how to remunerate and reward different segments of the workforce considering their core contribution to business success.”

While most sectors like General Industry, Chemical, High Tech and Pharmaceuticalscan expect salary increases around average mark of 10%, Energy, Financial Servicesand Consumer Products sectorsstand out for the highest year on year growth. The Energy sector is expected to see a jump from 8.5% in 2019 to 9.3% in 2020, the Financial Services is projected at 9.7% in 2020 from 9% last year and the Consumer Products sectors is expected to see an increase from 9.5% in 2019 to 9.9% in 2020.

Median salary increase at the Executive level for 2020 is projected at 10.1%, a noteworthy increase from 9.6% in the previous year. For Middle Management, Professional and Support Staff, an increase from10.1 % in 2019 to 10.4% in 2020 is projected. The employee group of Production Manual Labouris also projected to receive a higher salary increase of 10.3% as compared to 10% last year.

Highlighting a continued shift towards variable pay, especially at senior management levels, the survey found that actual variable pay at executive level increased from 20.7% in 2018, to 30.7% in 2019.

On salary increases by performance levels, the survey found that on an average, 25% of the salary increase budget is being allocated to top performers, which represents 11.5% of employees in India. This implies that for each Rs 1 allocated to an average or below-average performer, Rs 2.16 is allocated to a top performer compared to about Rs 1.3 last year.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/2020--on-a-high-note.html
171,01-1-20,"Labuschagne believes in process, not results","Just below the “Big Three” of Virat Kohli, Steve Smith and Kane Williamson in the ICC Test rankings for batters, Marnus Labuschagne feels his secret to quicksilver success is focusing on the process and not thinking of the result.

Currently ranked fourth in the ICC Test rankings, Australia’s newfound No. 3 started the year in 110th place. But following scores of 63 and 19 in Australia’s 247-run win in the Boxing Day Test and with three hundreds already to his name in 13 Tests, there is no stopping for the 25-year old.

“I just keeping it process driven and not on results,” Labuschagne told cricket.com.au after the Pert Test against New Zealand.

“Making sure that every innings I come in with a clear mind and making sure I'm playing what’s in front of me and not what’s happened in the past and not what I want to achieve — it’s right in the moment.

“Apart from that I’m just loving it.

“It’s a great team to be a part of and the way we’re playing at the moment is really enjoyable.”

Labuschagne’s rise started from the Ashes when he was used as Test cricket’s first ever concussion substitute.

172,01-1-20,It all started from U-19 WC for players such as Kohli: Ntini,"Former South Africa pacer Makhaya Ntini feels the seeds of Virat Kohli’s stardom were sown at the U-19 World Cup back in 2008 when he captained the Indian team to the title.

“If you look at players like Virat Kohli and Kagiso Rabada, they all started playing U-19 cricket and representing their country in the U-19 World Cup, and look where they are today,” Ntini wrote in a column for the ICC.

“A lot of the big players now started in the U-19 World Cup, and that is where you can get noticed and be seen by the world.”

The next edition will be held in South Africa from January 17 to February 9.

“Cricket is one of the biggest games in South Africa, especially when it comes to the young fellows. They have got their heroes — you're talking about the likes of Quinton de Kock and Rabada,” said Ntini.

“These guys have not been picked from nowhere —they played in the U19 World Cup. The key for the guys playing at South Africa 2020 is to look at them and how far they've gone, and where they are now.

“Without a doubt, the U19 World Cup helps develop young players as people as well as just cricketers. At the age of 19 or younger, you’re still trying to understand how you can learn about the game, and the U19 World Cup helps them develop and learn to stand up for themselves.”

Ntini’s son Thando also played in the 2018 edition of the U-19 World Cup.

“I’ve got very fond memories of watching my son, Thando, play U-19 international cricket, and I was part of that age-group as well.

“The experience was certainly a delight, and it’s great that players can express themselves and become the heroes of the future for the countries they are representing.

174,01-1-20,Eng backs ICC plans to scrap five-day Tests,"The International Cricket Council has found a backer in England as the sport’s apex body plans to scrap five-day Tests from 2023 to ease player workload in a crowded calendar.

The ICC could make four-day Tests mandatory from 2023 as part of the World Test Championship, primarily to free up the crowded calendar.

“We believe it could provide a sustainable solution to the complex scheduling needs and player workloads we face as a global sport,"" an ECB spokesperson was quoted as saying in ‘Daily Telegraph’.

Tests have been played over five days through most of their 140-year history.

If four-day Tests are held during the 2015-2023 cycle, it would free up 335 days of scheduled cricket.

A four-day Test is not a new concept with the last one played between England and Ireland earlier this year. South Africa and Zimbabwe too played one in 2017.

“We’re definite proponents of the four-day Test concept, but cautiously so, as we understand it's an emotive topic for players, fans and others who have concerns about challenging the heritage of Test cricket.”

Indian cricket board president Sourav Ganguly has said it is too early to make a comment on the matter.

Last week, Cricket Australia’s chief executive Kevin Roberts said mandatory four-day Tests are “something that we have got to seriously consider”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eng-backs-icc-plans-to-scrap-five-day-tests.html

And on the last day of the year, I’m looking forward to everything that 2020 has to offer!” Bumrah wrote on his twitter handle along with a few pictures of his achievements in the year gone by.

In 2019, Bumrah not only emerged as India's pace spearhead in all three formats of the game, but also became one of the best bowlers of the world.

Bumrah, 26, finished 2019 as the numero uno bowler in one-day cricket while occupying the sixth spot in ICC Test bowlers rankings.

In the year gone by, he also achieved a rare feat, becoming only the third Indian to scalp a hat-trick in Tests after Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan.

176,01-1-20,SMS ushers Kashmir into New Year,"Facility starts at midnight; broadband net services restored at Govt hospitals, schools

The Government of Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir on Tuesday delivered a “good news” to lakhs of people of Kashmir Valley by deciding to restore short message service (SMS) on 40 lakh post-paid mobile phones from midnight on January 1.

The announcement was welcomed by the common people even as they continue to wait for the restoration of mobile internet services in the coming days.

The start of SMS will enable the common people to stay connected with their loved ones staying outside the Valley.

Addressing a Press conference in Jammu, Principal Secretary Rohit Kansal, who is the J&K administration’s spokesperson, said broadband internet services in all Government-run hospitals and schools were being restored from January 1 across different parts of Kashmir Valley.

Since August 5, the Government had disconnected mobile and landline phone services in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions.

In the wake of significant improvement in security scenario, the Government had restored phone lines but held back approvals to end the ban on internet and SMS.

Kargil, part of the Union Territory of Ladakh, got back mobile internet services last week after a gap of 145 days. But the facility has still not been restored in J&K.

Rohit Kansal said the process had started on December 10 when SMS was enabled on mobile phones to facilitate students, scholarship applicants, traders and others. They still could not send messages but could receive one-time passwords from machine-based connections such as banks.

“It has now been decided to fully restore the service throughout Kashmir from midnight of December 31,” Kansal said.

In the second week of October, post-paid mobile phones were restored in Kashmir Valley along with the SMS facility. The administration, however, pulled the plug on SMS services within a few hours reportedly after the security forces claimed terrorists were using them to mobilise people.

Over 25 lakh prepaid mobile phones and mobile internet services needed for messaging services such as WhatsApp continue to remain deactivated.

Meanwhile, security situation in Jammu & Kashmir has improved

Jammu and Kashmir DGP, Dilbag Singh, on Tuesday said that over all security situation in Jammu & Kashmir has improved significantly on ground zero in the recent months.

At the same time, the police chief warned that attempts were being made to target the security forces using IED and fabricated cars laden with explosives.

He said, “After the Pulwama attack, a few attempts were made where fabricated cars were used to target the security convoys”. “We have either neutralised or arrested all those behind these attacks. To prevent repeat of similar strikes we are maintaining a tight vigil and there is complete synergy between the security forces on ground zero”.

He also complimented the security forces for “tactfully” handling the situation and ensuring restoration of law and order.

Sharing details of prevailing security situation here at police headquarters, the DGP said the situation has improved as official figures show significant decline in total number of law and order incidents. He said compared to previous year even less number of infiltrators managed to sneak inside the Indian territory in 2019.

Addressing an annual Press conference here in the lawns of police headquarters, the DGP, flanked by senior most police officers said,” As per our record around 130 infiltrators managed to infiltrate this year, compared to last year’s figure of 143.” He further said that reports have shown that there has been a decrease in the number of local youth joining terrorist organisations.

He said, “Number of youths joining terrorist organisations has also gone down, 218 joined in 2018, this year it was 139.” He said the shelf life of a terrorist has also been reduced.

He also commented on the number of active terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir. He said, “Number of terrorists who have been active for a long time has gone down. Number of active terrorists has gone down from 300 to 250.”

Out of these, at least 100 are foreign nationals from Pakistan and around 150 are local terrorists, he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sms-ushers-kashmir-into-new-year-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sms-ushers-kashmir-into-new-year.html

179,01-1-20,Evolving work culture,"Customer relationship management plays an important role in an organisation since employees are the backbone of any entity, says Udit Agarwal.

Employees form the backbone of any entity, irrespective of the industry or vertical. Given the cut-throat completion in the current business landscape, employee engagement has been observed to result in enhanced productivity, reduced staff turnover, improved customer retention and increased revenue earnings. It is, therefore, the onus of any organisation to manage and cater to the requirements of its own workforce.

But, in today’s ever-evolving work culture, monetary compensations or a high employee-manager ratio are no longer considered testaments for an efficient employee management ecosystem.

Where does Customer relationship management (CRM) come in here? Contrary to popular belief, a CRM system can be used as an ideal employee management tool. Providing a greater sense of control to senior leaders and HR professionals, CRM is touted as a key ingredient of success of an organisation on a whole. Here are the top five technology trends in the CRM world for employee management.

Digitalisation

Employee activities are not always recorded in the system, which may later cause a discrepancy in workforce management. This explains the need for digitalisation of CRM to ensure organisations are harnessing the potential of employees across locations, thereby keeping the productivity high. This can be a differentiating factor for businesses considering today’s evolving job landscape where it’s becoming increasingly common for employees to work remotely.

Integration

In this age of digitalisation, organisations across industries are turning to a host of emerging technologies to achieve scalable growth. At the same time, CRM systems are constantly being updated to keep up with this explosive business growth. Unlike traditional CRM technology, the modern work culture calls for CRM integration with smartphones to enable businesses to keep a track on employees, transact, authenticate as well as report the business activities. This new approach allows companies to have access to real-time data, thus bringing a higher level of transparency.

Power of AI

AI-driven CRM activities are expected to boost global business revenues by $1.1 trillion and create 8 lakh net-new jobs by 2021, reveals IDC White Paper, commissioned by Salesforce.

The fact that an increasing number of companies are opting for AI-powered CRM tools further indicates a growing adoption of this trend. Whether by facilitating customer interactions through AI-based chatbots or by offering valuable insights into consumer behaviour, artificial intelligence will augment the performance of employees.

For example, SugarCRM has introduced an AI-powered tool named Hint that helps sales professionals to find leads and relevant contact-related information. More significantly, AI could automate and accelerate repetitive tasks, such as accumulating and analysing consumer data, tracking buying patterns, making reports, among others. This, in turn, will allow employees to focus on other tasks which require human expertise and insights.

Internet of Things

As predicted by Gartner, “CRM will be at the heart of digital initiatives in coming years as enterprises look to create more targeted interactions in a multichannel environment.” The research firm also billed Internet of Things as the fifth driver of CRM in the The Nexus of Forces. The explosive growth of connected devices in recent years can be contributed to the rising interest towards IoT.

Experts believe that IoT can open the door to a whole new world of opportunities for CRM. When it comes to employee management, the influx of IoT can allow companies to monitor effectiveness, measure productivity and evaluate the performance of employees in a seamless and fair manner.

User interfaces

Companies are now taking an all-encompassing approach to CRM. However, they are also realizing the importance of segregating their employees into different groups as per their roles and responsibilities. With technology’s invasion in industries, the USP of modern CRM lies in its ability to offer role-based interfaces that allow employees to manage their business activities and workload more efficiently. This role-based interface can be of particular importance when the projects are large and the stakes are high.

180,01-1-20,Reshaping learning in New Year,"There has been a sea change in recent years with innovations like role play, peer teaching, and gamification that are changing the present education system, says Meenal Arora

The recent years have witnessed a sea change in the education sector, especially in terms of increasing student engagement and improving learning outcomes. This development in the overall learning process can be attributed to innovations like online learning, smart classrooms, and audio-visual (AV) supplements, among others.

With these innovations coupled with a slew of other new-age concepts — be it role play, peer teaching, or gamification —it is clear how schools are actively taking education to new heights.

Here’s looking at some of these trends and innovations that are transforming education.

Full day schooling/ 9-6 school concept: A fresh approach to schooling, the 9-6 concept is designed especially for millennial working parents. While students spend their day indulging in productive after-school activities, parents can rest assured that their kids are in good hands. At 6 pm, after wrapping-up work, parents can conveniently pick up their children and head home as a family.

As homework and co-curricular activities are all taken care of at school, the family can then spend quality time together after having a remarkably productive day.

Smart classrooms: Catering to the tech-savvy students of today, numerous schools are creating smart classrooms to make the entire learning process more engaging, effective, and fulfilling.

Such classrooms comprise digital screens and smart whiteboards that help students visually understand concepts through rich and interactive multimedia content. This can include 2D-3D images, infographics or videos that truly interest students and boost retention.

Green classrooms: In the wake of skyrocketing pollution levels in most Indian cities, it has become critical for schools to change their classroom settings and make it safer for students.

To achieve this, many schools are planting indoor plants and succulent such as snake plants, aloe vera, rubber plants, etc. that act as natural air purifiers and help eliminate pollutants from the classrooms. This ensures that when they are in school, children can breathe easy.

Conceptual learning: The idea behind this approach is to eliminate the age-old practice of rote learning and encourage students to understand the subjects instead of mugging up the topics. It is high time for students to move beyond the idea of scoring well and focus on enhancing their intellect by understanding concepts.

Gamification: Gamification is a new fun concept that involves experiential learning and games - something that students of all ages would love to take part in. This is why schools are increasingly associating with technology players and other non-profit agencies that are into crafting interesting gamified projects that make learning more exciting than ever before.

School lockers: In a bid to lighten the burden of heavy school bags,numerous schools are creating locker facilities for students, thus allowing them to leave their text and exercise books safely in lockers after school hours. This need became mainstream when it was found that even Class II and III students were carrying bags weighing around or more than 4 kg, which can be harmful to their back posture at such an early age.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/reshaping-learning-in-new-year.html
181,01-1-20,MindIT,"A business slowdown or a general economic recession offers challenges in the lives of every entrepreneur. From seasonal slowdowns like holidays or specific off-season phases for a particular business to an overall slump on a national/regional level due to various factors, a slump can be a challenging and de-motivating time for businessmen, especially the first generation entrepreneurs.

Here are five effective ways to battle and emerge a winner from the slowdown.

Alter your product/value offerings

This is an important aspect and the first line of action for an entrepreneur, when trying to cope with a business slowdown. Depending on the overall market scenario, it is wise to modify ones product and service portfolio to match the consumer requirements at the time and this may vary from business to business. For e.g, for some businesses, it would be wise to include additional customer service as value-add so as to retain existing customers by giving them a little extra. While for others it may make sense to cut down on certain discounts or benefits which were previously affordable.

Re-negotiate contracts

Capturing the expenses and optimising resources is the second most vital step when bracing for a slowdown. However, it does not always mean completely cutting off certain essential business services or vendor contracts. Instead, in the times of the millennial entrepreneurs and disruptive technology innovations, there are several options available for optimising performance. From modifying exclusive or retainer contracts to as-and-when required services to ‘leasing’ services from various vendors when required, to outsourcing tasks etc. can help reduce costs without cutting down on essential business needs.

Network and collaborate

A slowdown for any set of business is an excellent time to meet other players in the industry, to reach out and network with them so as to understand the larger picture. This also offers excellent collaborative opportunities too, which apart from helping in business growth, also offer the much needed moral support and confidence needed to tide over a rough patch in business. Networking and collaboration during tough times brings out the best in entrepreneurs and may be the right time to make life-long friends or partners!

Personnel development

Business slump also offers an excellent time to introspect, analyse, observe, and improve oneself. From additional training session for the staff and employees to indulging in knowledge sharing with peers, this could be an excellent opportunity for gaining knowledge and personal development. One may also engage in short term business related courses (several are available on MOOCH sites like Coursera, which are free) or workshops that can help learn essential skills.

Plan for the future

As ironic as it may sound, a slowdown is the best time to chalk out a realistic growth plan, and sniff out profitable opportunities within the industry or in allied segments. These may include expansion of services to offer value and thus stay relevant or forge new partnerships to offer innovative solutions that can help beat the slowdown. A lot of business icons owe some of their most intelligent innovations to a slump period or an economic slowdown.

As an entrepreneur, one needs to be prepared for lull phases in business and also be vigilant and sharp to make the most of the favourable times. The most essential qualities for any successful entrepreneur mainly includes a keen sense of observation, an eye out for opportunities, passionate dedication to the business and an expertise in the craft, coupled with sharp intuition and people skills, all come to the fore to ensure you can not only survive but thrive the slowdown.

184,01-1-20,B’desh stops mobile services along India,"1 crore users to be hit; it comes after anti-CAA protests in India

The Bangladesh Government has suspended mobile telephone services along the borders with India, citing security reasons. The expression “in the current circumstances” in the order is being linked to anti-CAA protests in India. The decision will affect around 1 crore mobile phone users in the area, according to media reports.

The telecom operators suspended the networks on Monday within one kilometre of the borders with India, the Dhaka Tribune reported.

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), in its order to telecommunications service providers —Grameenphone, Teletalk, Robi and Banglalink — on Sunday, said network coverage in the border areas should be suspended until further notice “for the sake of the country’s security in the current circumstances,” it said.

“A high-level meeting of the Government took this decision, following which the instructions were issued,” BTRC Chairman Jahurul Haque was quoted as saying by bdnews24.

A BTRC official was quoted as saying in the Dhaka Tribune that closure of around 2,000 base transceiver stations would affect 1 crore users in 32 districts sharing border with India and Myanmar.

According to the report, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen expressed ignorance over the Government’s decision.

“I do not have any such information. Let me know about it first and then I will comment,” Kamal said.

Brig Gen (retd) SM Farhad, secretary general of the Association of Mobile Telecom Operators of Bangladesh, said, “Mobile network operators in Bangladesh are compliant with Government regulations; accordingly, the directive on border network coverage has already been implemented.”

This decision will certainly have an impact since a large segment of citizens in the border areas will be out of the range of the internet, voice and other services, he said.

The move by Bangladesh Government comes days after the Government here passed the Citizenship Amendment Act that seeks to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The CAA specifically seeks to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from the three countries till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there.

Reacting to the protests erupting in India over the CAA, Foreign Minister Momen on December 22 voiced concern that any “uncertainty” in India is likely to affect its neighbours.

He had said that Bangladesh has requested New Delhi to provide a list of Bangladeshi nationals living illegally in India, “if any”, to be repatriated.

He had also cancelled his visit to India beginning December 12, hours before he was to arrive in New Delhi on an official visit.

Bangladesh Home Minister had also cancelled his visit to India over the situation arising out of the passage of CAA.

Bangladesh was learnt to have been upset following the rollout of the NRC in Assam about four months back.

The NRC has been prepared to identify genuine Indian citizens living in Assam since March 24, 1971, or before, and identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants in the State.

Out of 3.3 crore applicants, over 19 lakh people were excluded from the final NRC published on August 30, 2019.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/b---desh-stops-mobile--services-along-india-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/b---desh-stops-mobile--services-along-india.html
185,01-1-20,Kerala Assembly passes resolution against CAA,"Centre mulls to grant citizenship online to bypass States’ role

The Kerala Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution demanding scrapping of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) even as Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Parliament alone has got powers to pass any law regarding citizenship and the Centre mulled option to introduce online process to grant citizenship to bypass the jurisdiction of States.

Setting aside their political differences, Kerala’s CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Opposition Congress-headed United Democratic Front (UDF) once again came together to launch a joint offensive against the Centre on the CAA.

While all the members of two fronts unanimously supported the resolution and vehemently criticised the Centre, O Rajagopal, the lone BJP MLA in the 140-member House, opposed the resolution, terming it as “illegal and unconstitutional”.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who moved the resolution and Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress, who seconded it, alleged that the CAA was an attempt to make India a religious nation.

Rajagopal rejected the charge, saying the Act was being “misinterpreted” and lies were being spread by the fronts for narrow political gains.

The Chief Minister said the implementation of the Act will lead to religion-based discrimination in granting citizenship, which was against the secular values enshrined in the Constitution.

Just because both Houses of Parliament have passed the CAA, it cannot be implemented as the Act was against constitutional values, the CPI(M) veteran said. The resolution was passed at the special session of the Assembly convened to ratify the extension by another 10 years the reservation for SC and ST community in the State Assemblies and Parliament.

Several non-BJP Chief Ministers like Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal and Amarinder Singh of Punjab have announced they would not implement the CAA but the State Assemblies have not approved any formal resolution yet.

Hours after the Kerala Assembly passed the resolution, Ravi Shankar Prasad said Parliament alone has got powers to pass any law regarding citizenship and not State legislatures, “including Kerala Assembly.”

“It is only Parliament which has got the powers to pass any law with regard to citizenship; not any Assembly, including Kerala Assembly,” he told a Press conference in Thiruvananthapuram.

The Centre, meanwhile, is likely to make the entire process of granting citizenship under the CAA online to bypass the opposition by some States, officials said in Delhi.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is mulling the option of doing away with the present procedure of routing the applications for the citizenship through the District Magistrates and designate a new authority.

The MHA officials said if the process of granting the Indian nationality becomes completely online, there will be no intervention of the State Government at any level in the process of granting Indian citizenship to anyone under the CAA.

Besides, the officials are of the opinion that the State Governments have no powers to reject the implementation of the CAA as the legislation was enacted under the Union List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution.

“The States have no powers to deny implementation of a Central law which is in the Union List,” the top official from the Home Ministry said. There are 97 items which are under the Union List of the 7th Schedule that include Defence, External Affairs, Railways, Citizenship and Naturalisation, among others.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress leader Mohammed Arif Naseem Khan said that as in Kerala, the Maharashtra Assembly should pass a resolution demanding scrapping of the CAA.

Khan, vice president of the Maharashtra State Congress unit and former Minister, demanded that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray convened special sitting of the Assembly for this purpose. The Congress is part of the Shiv Sena-led Government in Maharashtra. In Tamil Nadu, Opposition DMK urged the ruling AIADMK to follow the Kerala example.

“It is the overwhelming desire of the people of this country that every State Assembly should adopt such a resolution to guard the basic features of the Constitution,” the DMK chief said in a Facebook post.

Stalin urged Chief Minister K Palaniswami to adopt a similar resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly on January 6 when the House convenes for the first session of 2020.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kerala-assembly--passes-resolution--against-caa-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/kerala-assembly--passes-resolution--against-caa.html
186,01-1-20,Rs 102 L-cr infra push to realise $5 tn GDP goal,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday unveiled Rs 102 lakh crore of infrastructure projects, including Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed rail, in the next five years to help achieve the target of $5 trillion (around Rs 356 lakh crore) economy by 2025.

Addressing a press conference, she said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in his Independence Day speech spoken of investing Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure.

Subsequently, a task force headed by the Economic Affairs Secretary identified Rs 102 lakh crore worth of projects after conducting 70

stakeholder consultations in a short period of four months, she said.

The Minister said another Rs 3 lakh crore of projects will be added to this pipeline that includes Jewar Airport and Jal Jeevan Mission.

“However, even as we are talking, I’m happy to say that projects are coming in and in the next couple of weeks, we get additional projects of worth Rs 3 lakh crore... So in all I think we have about Rs 105 lakh crore in total of projects for Rs 100 lakh crore commitment we made,” the Minister told reporters here.

Of the Rs 102 lakh crore projects, Rs 42.7 lakh crore (43 per cent) projects are under implementation, Rs 32.7 lakh crore (about 33 per cent) worth of projects are at conceptualisation stage and Rs 19.1 lakh crore (about 19 per cent) worth of projects are under development, she said.

The projects are spread across 22 ministries and 18 States and Union Territories, she said, adding the Government also intends to launch NIP, National Infrastructure Pipeline, a coordination mechanism consisting of the Centre, states and also the private sector for information dissemination together with monitoring the implementation of this entire framework.

These projects are on top of Rs 51 lakh crore spent by the Centre and the States during the last six years, she said. With regard to investment, Sitharaman said that the new pipeline consists of 39 per cent projects each by the Centre and states and the balance by 22 per cent by private sector which could increase to 30 per cent by 2025.

Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty said projects worth Rs 13.6 lakh crore would be implemented during the current fiscal, followed of Rs 19.5 lakh crore in 2020-21 and Rs 19 lakh crore in 2021-22. In the remaining three years, he said, during 2022-23 it would be Rs 13.8 lakh crore, Rs 12.8 lakh crore in 2023-24 while Rs 11.1 lakh crore in the terminal year of 2024-25.

She said the projects identified are in the sectors of power, railways, urban development, digital sector, irrigation, mobility, education, health, and others. These sectors will form the bulk of the infrastructure investment under the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Sitharaman said.

Nearly Rs 25 lakh crore of energy projects have been lined up, the Minister said, adding that another Rs 20 lakh crore in road and nearly Rs 14 lakh crore spending in railway projects have been lined up. The Finance Minister said Rs 102 lakh crore National Infrastructure Projects will help make India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.

On the financing, she said, the Government will look at deepening of debt market and alternative investment funds which will provide bulk of the debt financing necessary for this. “We are looking at various steps to reform the PPP based contracts which have to be implemented. Dispute resolution related, enforcement of contracts which is a very critical component, all this is also being looked at when we’re talking about reforming the entire process as per the suggestion given by various sub-groups under the task force,” she said.

She also announced that the first edition of Annual Global Investors’ Meet will be held in the second half of the coming year to meet investors at a single platform. Union Minister for Railways and Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal welcomed the decision and said it will create jobs, propel growth and enhance ease of living.

“Welcome the decision taken under PM @NarendraModiji’s leadership to boost infra with Rs 102 lakh crore projects, including a Rs 14 lakh crore push to Rlys. Congratulate FM @NSitharaman ji as this will create jobs, propel growth and enhance ease of living,” Goyal tweeted.

Government think tank NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant in a tweet sid the initiative will impart a major impetus to infrastructure development and financing. CII DG Chandrajit Banerjee said the initiative will provide “much-needed impetus to the overall growth of the economy while also helping to reach the target of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy”.

CBRE (India, Middle East, South East Asia) CEO Anshuman Magazine said it is clear that the government is willing to do the needful and is ready to take the initiative by providing required funds.

“Infrastructure projects worth Rs 102 lakh crore for next five years under National Infrastructure Pipeline will provide opportunities to all the stake-holders engaged in areas such as urban development, renewable sector, railways, irrigation, mobility, education, health, water and digital and will pave the way for long term development in all other areas,” he said.

NIP, which includes economic and social infrastructure projects, will enable a forward outlook on infrastructure projects which will create jobs, improve ease of living, and provide equitable access to infrastructure for all, thereby making growth more inclusive.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rs-102-l-cr-infra-push-to-realise--5-tn-gdp-goal-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rs-102-l-cr-infra-push-to-realise--5-tn-gdp-goal.html
187,01-1-20,UP seeks ban on PFI for violence during anti-CAA demonstrations,"The Uttar Pradesh Government has sought immediately ban on the Popular Front of India (PFI) for violent anti-CAA and NRC protests in the State.

UP Police chief OP Singh said on Tuesday that they had written to the Union Home Ministry, seeking a ban on the PFI after its UP head, Wasim, and 16 other activists were arrested for allegedly masterminding the violence in Lucknow during anti-CAA protests.

“We have written to the Union Home Ministry, recommending that the PFI should be banned,” the DGP told reporters here.

Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said the PFI is the “incarnation” of the SIMI. The PFI’s role has been “established” in vandalism in UP, Maurya told reporters.

“The truth is emerging through the probe. If SIMI reappears in any form, it will be crushed,” he added.

When asked if the PFI will be banned, Maurya said, “The process is on. Such organisations will not be allowed to grow. If needed, they will be banned.”

Wasim was arrested for allegedly masterminding the violence, police had said last week. “We have got success in arresting the mastermind of the Lucknow violence. Wasim, Nadeem and Ashfaq of the PFI have been arrested. While Wasim is the state head, Ashfaq is the treasurer and Nadeem is a member of the PFI,” Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani told reporters here.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/up-seeks-ban-on-pfi-for-violence-during-anti-caa-demonstrations.html
188,01-1-20,km for ordinary from Jan 1,"On the New Year’s eve, the Indian Railways announced fare hike across its network, excluding suburban trains, effective from January 1, 2020, according to an order issued on Tuesday. While suburban fares remain unchanged, ordinary non-AC, non-suburban fares were increased by 1 paisa per km of journey. For AC classes, the fare has been raised by 4 paise per km.

In the Delhi-Kolkata Rajdhani, which covers a distance of 1,447 km, the hike at the rate of 4 paise per km will be around `58.

The railways also announced a two paise/km hike in fares of mail/express non-AC trains and four paise/km hike in the fares of AC classes. The fare hike is also applicable to premium trains such as Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto, according to the order.

According to the order, there will not be any change in the reservation fee and superfast charge and the hike in fares will not be applicable to tickets already booked.

The last such hike was announced in 2014-2015 when fares of all classes of trains were raised by 14.2 per cent and freight charges by 6.5 per cent. However, since then, the railways introduced the flexi-fare scheme which significantly raised fares on select trains and launched trains like Vande Bharat and Tejas Express which have relatively higher fares.

Trains with dynamic pricing like Suvidha Express were also introduced.

The railways in a statement said the revenue generated by the “marginal” increase in fare will be used for the modernisation of the network. “Indian Railways has continuously endeavored to augment passenger experience through modernization of coaches and provision of improved facilities over stations. Further, the burden of 7th Pay Commission on Indian Railway has necessitated rationalization of fares. In order to expand passenger amenities and facilities at various railway stations and trains, it has become imperative to increase the fare marginally without over burdening any class of passengers. Fast modernisation of Indian Railways will be achieved through this fare revision,” it said.

It also said the suburban passengers have been left out of the hike keeping the “affordability concerns of daily commuters”. This class constitutes 66 per cent of total passenger segment of the railways.

190,01-1-20,"Nitish says ‘all is well’ in alliance, soft-pedals Kishor-Sushil wrangle","Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday sought to scotch speculation of a rift with the BJP in the State, asserting “all is well” within the alliance, after JD(U) vice president Prashant Kishor pitched for more seats for his party than its saffron partner in the Assembly polls, due next year.

“Sab theek hai (all is well),” Kumar told journalists, who sought his response to Kishor’s demand, which prompted a riposte from BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who had on Monday dubbed Kishor as a person “engaged in the business of collating political data and coining slogans”, and benefiting the Opposition.

Kishor, an election strategist-turned-politician, has been a vocal critic of the Citizenship Act and the proposed nationwide NRC.

The JD(U) had voted in favour of the new citizenship law in Parliament but said it is against a pan-India NRC. Nitish’s comment came on the sidelines of an event to mark the 14th death anniversary of late Navin Kishore Prasad Sinha, a BJP leader and former State Minister.

Nitish, who is also the JD(U) national president, made the comment days after Kishor, in interviews to TV news channels, insisted on the JD(U) getting to contest more seats than the BJP since his party was the senior alliance partner in the State.

He also referred to BJP president Amit Shah who had said the alliance will face the Assembly polls with Nitish Kumar as its Chief Ministerial candidate.

Sushil took umbrage and blasted Kishor, reminding him of his “business” of an election strategist. “The 2020 Assembly polls in the State will be fought under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Seat-sharing will be finalised by top leaders of both parties at an appropriate time.

“No problems in that. But those, who have entered politics not driven by ideology but while engaged in the business of collating political data and coining slogans, are making utterances in violation of coalition dharma and benefiting the opposition in the bargain,” Sushil had tweeted on Monday.

Kishor, who has been roped in by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal to devise election strategy, hit right back. “It is pleasant to listen to discourses on political propriety and ideology from Sushil Modi who became Deputy CM by virtue of circumstances despite the defeat in 2015,” Kishor wrote on his official Twitter handle on Tuesday.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nitish-says----all-is-well----in-alliance--soft-pedals-kishor-sushil-wrangle-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nitish-says----all-is-well----in-alliance--soft-pedals-kishor-sushil-wrangle.html
191,01-1-20,Enjoy New Year! No cold wave till Jan 4,"The “worst period” of cold wave in Delhi is over for now and icy winds won’t continue from northwest for long due to “on and off” western disturbances, claimed a senior scientist at a private forecasting agency Skymet Weather.

On Tuesday, the sun shone bright and a layer of fog that enveloped Delhi dissipated, bringing some relief from cold that battered the city for over two weeks.

The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) said there would be “no cold wave in Delhi till January 4 and temperatures will rise”. However, weathermen forecast moderate fog in Delhi on Wednesday and very light rain on Thursday.

The prolonged cold and absence of adequate sunshine due had caused the mercury to plummet drastically, making December the second-coldest and Monday the coldest recorded day (with a maximum of 9.4 degrees Celsius) since 1901. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional centre, said Delhi witnessed another “cold day” on Tuesday.

With this, December has recorded 18 consecutive “cold days”’, the maximum after 17 cold days in December 1997. Easterly winds, gusting up to 14-15 kmph pushed fog towards Punjab and Haryana, making Delhi skies clear, Mahesh Palawat, a senior scientist at private forecasting agency Skymet Weather, said.

It caused the minimum temperature to go up from 2.8 degrees Celsius on Monday to 4.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The maximum also rose to 14.6 degrees Celsius.

“Only four times the mean maximum temperature for December has remained equal to or less than 20 degrees Celsius -- 1919, 1929, 1961 and 1997,” the official said.

The MMT for the month was 19.8 degrees Celsius in 1919 and 1929, while it was 20 degrees Celsius in 1962, the MeT scientist said further.

The IMD said a cold day is when the maximum temperature is at least 4.5 notches below normal. A severe cold day is when the maximum temperature is at least 6.5 degrees Celsius below normal.

In weekly weather forecast, the MeT said minimum temperature will hover between six degrees Celsius and nine degrees Celsius and maximum temperature will oscillate between 15 degrees Celsius and 18.

However, cold wave conditions persisted in northern states of the country on Tuesday, with Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur hitting the zero-degree mark and Sikar in Rajasthan recording a low of 1 degree Celsius.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/enjoy-new-year--no-cold-wave-till-jan-4-2020-01-01.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/enjoy-new-year--no-cold-wave-till-jan-4.html
