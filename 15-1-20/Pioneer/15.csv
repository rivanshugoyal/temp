0,15-1-20,The GOP problem,"Rising vegetable prices have driven consumer inflation to new highs. Get agricultural management back on track

The dramatic increase in vegetable prices this winter, particularly of core products such as garlic, onions and potatoes (GOP), is finally reflecting on inflation statistics. The Government’s own data, released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), has confirmed our worst fears of not just a slowdown but a guttural halt as retail inflation rose by 7.35 per cent last December, which is the highest since July 2014. This can be attributed to a significant rise in food prices, which saw a marked rise from 10.01 per cent in November to 14.12 per cent in December last year. This points to various problems for the Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The latter has little wiggle room for rate cuts and can do little to spur economic activity. This is actually the first time that the relatively new Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), that adjusts interest rates, will face such a challenge. Until now, the MPC has moved them downward in an effort to boost the economy. Already, banks are desperately trying to repair their loan books that are crippled by non-performing assets (NPAs) and consumers are not biting for real estate loans. Increasing rates to control inflation and spending will only drive consumer spending further downwards, putting the economy under even more pressure. But there is also that other issue of produce management. Over the past few years, the Government has for the large part stabilised food prices with smart management of produce ever since it got burnt by rising pulse prices a few years ago. But this year, the price of onion has seemed to belie expectations. There has been a four-fold increase in the rate of this staple food since June last. This, coupled with an equal rise in garlic and potatoes and other vegetables, has seemingly caught everyone — from everyday consumers to the Government — completely off the guard.

But the GOP problem, as we have termed the situation, is making a “bad” scenario even “worse.” With the economy in the doldrums, job creation at multi-year lows and consumer demand collapsing, the Government finds itself on a sticky wicket. While crop and produce management can be better managed in the coming seasons — the winter of 2019-2020 can be seen as an aberration — getting demand to pick up again is a challenge, particularly with the Government’s ability for limited spending. The Narendra Modi-led Government has ambitious social welfare schemes and they have cost money. Until the economy gets going again, the funds to keep such spending going will also be constrained. The Budget is on its way in a few weeks time. While bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry are working overtime, can the Government really afford an income tax rate cut, as many believe? There is a significant amount of anger in the general population, one that has manifested itself in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, which have for the large part been contained. But the Government and its advisors must be acutely aware that things are on a knife-edge. Pretending that everything is normal will not help. It will be of help if the Government seeks the advice of in-house experts on prevailing matters to get going. For now, it has to manage produce prices and understand that while spud prices may not bring the people on the streets today, tomorrow tomato prices or something else just might.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-gop-problem-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-gop-problem.html
1,15-1-20,Police commissioner system won’t check crimes: Akihlesh,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav flayed the Yogi Adityanath government for introducing police commissionerate system in the state.

“Nothing will change and the crime graph will not go down with new experiments on daily basis. The police commissioner system will make no impact in checking the crimes by merely changing and appointing new officers,” the SP chief said.

“It’s a confession of failure by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath that he has failed to check crimes even after three years in office. There is no let-up in heinous crime incidents like rape, murder, loot & dacoity, and abductions,” Yadav said.

Terming the police commissioner system yet another gimmick by the BJP government, Akhilesh said: “The BJP government has introduced the police commissioner system only to divert the attention of people who are at the receiving end of police repression.”

On Tuesday, Akhilesh met several delegations of sportspersons and political leaders. He asked them to pull up their socks for the victory of Samajwadi Party and enable it to form the government in UP after the 2022 assembly elections. He alleged that the sole agenda of the BJP was to divide the society on caste and communal grounds and cause polarisation of people on religious lines. He said time has come to get rid of the divisive politics of BJP and bring a new government which would work for all sections of the society irrespective of caste and creed.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-commissioner-system-won---t-check-crimes--akihlesh.html
2,15-1-20,Police commissioner system a gimmick: Lallu,"Uttar Pradesh Congress president, Ajay Kumar Lallu on Tuesday flayed Yogi Adityanath government’s move to introduce police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida terming it yet another step to hide the failure of his government on the law and order front.

“Besides the rising cases of crime against women with UP almost on top in terms of cases of sexual assault against women, the manner in which the state government failed to control violence during the recent anti-CAA protests and Lucknow witnessing arson and stone-pelting, it is evident that the government has completely failed to deliver on the law and order front,” Lallu said. He claimed introducing police commissioner system was a ploy to divert people’s attention from government’s failures.

Lallu further claimed that even the Supreme Court observed recently that there was ‘jungle raj’ prevailing in UP. “The blue-eyed officers of Adityanath holding key posts have been found to be indulging in sex chats, transfer-posting rackets and large-scale corruption, so the easiest way for the Adityanath government was to come out clean and hence the police commissioner system gimmick,” he alleged.

“The personal conduct of IPS officers is in question after the letter of former Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna, found involved in sex chat, pointed how some senior IPS officers were minting money in transfers and postings under government’s patronage”, Lallu said, claiming that instead of going for an in-depth enquiry, Yogi showed more trust in IPS officers and introduced new policing system in Lucknow and Noida.

Lallu claimed that until the political interference of the government ended, no system could deliver on the law and order front by mere transfer of some powers.

He also pointed out that even the police commissionerate system was just an eyewash as the power to issue excise and arms licences still rests with the district magistrates and only magisterial power related to law and order has been given to the officers posted in Lucknow and Noida.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-commissioner-system-a-gimmick--lallu.html
3,15-1-20,Newborn mauled to death by dog in hospital; probe ordered,"The district authorities in Farrukhabad have ordered a probe into a shocking incident in which a newborn was allegedly mauled to death by a dog inside the operation theatre of a private hospital on Monday.

District Magistrate Manvendra Singh said on Tuesday that an FIR has been registered and a probe ordered on the complaint of the newborn’s family.

Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Chandra Shekhar said the hospital has been sealed and a probe into the incident ordered. Family members of the neworn alleged that they noticed the hospital staff shooing away a dog from the operation theatre and soon afterwards, they were told the baby boy, born just two hours ago, was dead.

The aggrieved family members said they found the baby boy’s body on the floor and it had deep gashes around the neck and other parts. Sources said the hospital where the incident took place was unregistered and being run adjacent to a government hospital. As per the FIR lodged with Sadar Kotwali police, newborn’s father Ravi Kumar said he had admitted his wife Kanchan to the hospital on Monday and she was taken for a surgery the operation theatre.

After the delivery, Kanchan was shifted to the ward but the family was told that the baby would be shifted later. An hour later, the family was informed that the baby had died.

The family members then saw the hospital staff trying to chase a dog out of the operation theatre. They forced their way into the operation theatre and found the infant lying on the floor with several injuries on his neck. The police said that the baby’s body has been preserved for examination and autopsy.

Meanwhile, in two other sensational incidents, a brother duo were killed in Bijnore while a girl was allegedly raped by a teenager in Ballia and admitted to hospital in a critical condition. According to reports from Bijnore, Shivam (22) and Ashish (18) of Bankpur hamlet of Kiratpur in Bijnore disappeared under mysterious circumstances on Monday evening. Their father Devendra Singh and other family members searched for them and also reported the matter to local police. The matter took an ugly turn when on Tuesday morning, bodies of the brother duo were found lying in the nearby jungle of Gangawala.

The local police and family members rushed to the spot and found that one of the brothers had bullet injury while the other stabbed to death. The bodies of both the victims have been sent for the post-mortem and a team of forensic experts has been summoned to collect evidence from the spot. The family members were at a loss of words when asked about suspects. They claimed they had no major dispute with anyone.

In the Ballia incident, the victim had gone out to attend nature’s call on Monday when a 14-year-old boy raped her after taking her to a secluded spot, the police station in-charge said. She was admitted to a hospital where her condition was said to be critical. After the victim’s father lodged a complaint, an FIR was registered and efforts were on to nab the accused, the officer said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/newborn-mauled--to-death-by-dog--in-hospital---probe-ordered.html

5,15-1-20,‘Take advantage of Govt schemes to help society’,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday urged the ex-Servicemen to take advantage of the State Government’s schemes in the interest of the society as a whole.

Patnaik was addressing a meeting on the occasion of the Veterans’ Day. “I appeal to the veterans to take advantage of various schemes being offered by the Government of Odisha so that they can contribute to society as well as make their own lives better,” he said.

Calling the ex-Servicemen and veterans as an “extraordinary” community, Patnaik praised their selfless service to the nation at the prime of their age and sacrifices for ensuring the nation’s sovereignty and integrity.

This day has rightly been dedicated to Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first Commander in Chief of Armed Forces of Independent India, who is a guiding beacon for serving as well as veteran soldiers, Patnaik said. The Chief Minister also commended the contributions of the 120 Infantry Battalion for its exemplary relief work done in the aftermath of Cyclone Fani in May this year.

Patnaik also paid floral tributes at the Martyrs’ Memorial and felicitated widows of five veterans who had participated in World War-II. He said the State Government is committed for the welfare of the ex-Servicemen and make use of their rich potential in the service of the nation.

Brig BP Pattanaik (Retd) gave the welcome address in which he offered the service of Ex-Servicemen in working for the betterment of the State. He also stated that the Veteran fraternity is a huge repository of diverse skills and experience which can be tapped for the overall development of the society and the State.

6,15-1-20,‘Tanhaji’ declared tax-free in UP,"The Yogi Adityanath government has given tax exemption to Ajay Devgn-starrer period film ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’. Devgn and his wife & actress Kajol thanked the CM for this move.

A government spokesman said here on Tuesday that the order to exempt state GST on the film based on the great Maratha warrior had been issued. “The decision was taken after producer & actor Ajay Devgn requested the state government to make the film tax-free in the state,” the spokesman said.

“The movie is a grand display of cultural pride and historical grandiose of the Marathas,” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in a written statement. The Ajay Devgn-starrer details the ‘Battle of Sinhagad’ that was fought between Tanhaji Malusare, a military commander, under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Uday Singh Bhan for the Kondana Fort. After a bitter duel between Tanhaji and Uday Bhan, the fort was reclaimed by the Marathas in the year 1670.

It was in this battle that Tanhaji Malusare had laid down his life while fighting Uday Bhan. In his honour, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had renamed the Kondana Fort as ‘Sinhagad’.

The decision of the government has also kicked up a political controversy as people are questioning as to why the government did not make ‘Chhapaak’ tax-free even though it is a movie based on acid attack victims.

‘Tanhaji...’ and ‘Chhapaak’ released at the same time across India. Many states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh declared ‘Chhapaak’ tax-free last week. Deepika has portrayed the character of Laxmi Agarwal, who is an acid attack victim.

Acid attack victims operate Sheroes Hangouts in Lucknow and Agra. In one of these outlets, Laxmi Agarwal met director Meghna Gulzar and the idea of ‘Chhapaak’ clicked. Therefore, it is said to be UP’s film.

“The decision to give tax exemption to ‘Tanhaji...’ seems to be a political one. ‘Chhapaak’ was ignored because Deepika Padukone had supported anti-CAA protesters and taken part in a protest at JNU. ‘Chhapaak’ is UP’s movie and it deserves tax exemption because it highlights the plight of acid attack victims,” Amarnath Agarwal, a senior Congress leader, said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---tanhaji----declared--tax-free-in-up.html

8,15-1-20,Demolition of old deals,"If Kerala has to survive as God’s own country, then it has to protect its fragile ecosphere from illegal development

The sight of four gigantic residential towers, built across a rich coastal ecosystem in Kochi’s Maradu, crumbling down like a pack of cards, was not just about the grossest violation of law but a cruel joke on home buyers. For they had invested their money as their unscrupulous realtors, believed to be in cahoots with local Government officials and politicians, made them believe their dream of living on a marina. And 10 years into their settled and charmed lives, all was gone. Though timely evacuation and appropriate compensation by the Kerala Government have provided some succour, it cannot be denied that they have been cheated and become gullible targets of the builder-administration nexus. It is in this sense that the Supreme Court’s demolition order, which was complied by the Kerala Government this week, serves as a deterrent in the real estate sector in the country in general, besieged as it is by corruption and malpractice. It also marks a paradigm shift in the way we treat our environment vis-a-vis development and becomes a template on what we should not do hereon. For Kerala, which has consolidated its tourism industry around the virginal and natural appeal of “God’s own country,” one that has triggered waterfront development, is at its worst phase of biosphere destruction. It is, therefore, imperative that its fragile balance be protected and made sustainable. The towers were situated on the shores of the Vembanad wetland, which strictly falls in the restricted zone under the provisions mandated by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The limits set by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, which called for construction activities to be 50 metres away from the backwaters and mangrove forests and 20 metres away on islets, were flouted with impunity. According to the State Government’s own estimates, there are around 26,330 illegal buildings in 10 districts alone. As the dust of wrongdoings rises from the debris of the demolitions at Maradu, it’s not just the builders but political leaders responsible for the clearances, who must face the music.

The consecutive floods in the State have been indication enough of how illegal encroachments in the fragile backwaters have blocked the flow of natural waterways and forced a crisis every monsoon. This has already dented the tourism business badly, which contributes 12 per cent to the State’s GDP pie. The current demolition drive may force a number of projects to either scale down or shut shop altogether. With most resorts and hotels being built along river banks, they, too, may have to make changes. They must understand that undoing a wrong can prove more costly than a course

correction. And as much as land may be a challenge for the State, it just cannot afford shortcuts to jeopardise what sells most, its pristine coastline. The State seems to have got entangled in a web of its own making. A way has to be found out that involves reducing the over-dependence on tourism and looking at offsetting it with a boost to small and medium enterprises and setting up R&D and IT hubs. The alternative alone can wipe the grime of Maradu.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/demolition-of-old-deals-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/demolition-of-old-deals.html
9,15-1-20,Grow ideas to save farmers,"As suicides continue unabated, India needs fresh strategies for mitigating risk, enhancing productivity, income and strengthening market linkages for businesses and cultivators

Farmer suicides continue to plague the country. According to the latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 10,349 farmers committed suicide in 2018, which is only marginally less than the figures for 2016 when 11,379 cultivators took the extreme step. The figures for 2017 have been withheld in the report. Maharashtra leads the suicide list (17,972) followed by Tamil Nadu (13,896), West Bengal (13,255), Madhya Pradesh (11,775) and Karnataka (11,561).

Large swathes of cotton farms in central India have been the epicentre of a debt crisis that has gripped the rural population. For years now, this crisis has driven thousands of farmers to take their own lives. These suicides are not merely a loss of human lives, they are debilitating scars on our nation’s development canvas. While debates continue to rage on reforming the agricultural sector to improve the economic conditions of the growers, there has not been any attempt to focus on the possible psychological problems arising out of economic stress that may be leading to these actions.

For every cultivator who takes his own life, a family is hounded by the debt he leaves behind, typically resulting in children dropping out of school to become farm hands. Farmers’ suicides have to be tackled on several fronts and addressing mental health problems is just one of them but it is certainly a major part of the solution.

The lack of focus on marginal and sub-marginal farmers, tenants, sharecroppers, oral lessees and non-cultivator households has further compounded the agricultural conundrum. We need fresh thinking on strategies for mitigating risk, enhancing productivity and income and strengthening market linkages for businesses and farmers for better profits. Simplifying mortgage requirements and procedures, rationalising stamp duty for loans to small and marginal farmers and providing agricultural and business extension services in the farm and non-farm sectors respectively can go a long way towards providing resilience to the agricultural community.

Economic reforms and the opening of agriculture to the global market over the last two decades have made small farmers vulnerable to unusual changes and fluctuations. Small growers now have to compete with larger ones, who are well-endowed with capital, irrigation facilities and supplementary businesses to buffer them against any shocks. As a fallout, peasants are facing what has been called a “scissors crisis”, which is driven by the rising cost of inputs without a commensurate increase in output price.

Peasants take loans from moneylenders at exorbitant rates of interest in order to buy expensive transgenic seeds and high-cost fertilisers that allow them to merely feed themselves and their cattle. They hope for better yields in the future but this time never quite comes. Eventually, many farmers find themselves in a debt trap as they keep pursuing the vain mirage of a golden crop bonanza. Owing more than they earn, the steadiest of these workers have become gamblers at the highest of stakes, betting their land and their lives on a better crop. As debt mounts, many growers are now making a permanent escape from the physical and emotional pain by ingesting deadly pesticides.

There is an inextricable link between small holder farmers and the health of our planet, just as there’s a link between us and these small holder cultivators. They play a highly critical role in protecting the environment. Many small holder growers lack the resources they need to sustainably cultivate high-yielding, nutritious and marketable crops. The pressure to feed their families and sell their crops to pay off other debts means the soil is often overworked.

These cultivators have to be taught smart agriculture practices, like harvesting rainwater, using organic fertilisers and undertaking intercropping to preserve their soil. They must have access to more resources like small farm loans, real-time weather and pest updates. Information on accurate market prices for their crops can help them make the most of their farms all year-round.

Despite their vast numbers, small farmers are not a solidified group and have not developed their negotiating power. Social divisions among the rural population have been the main reason why rural voters have failed to push for policies that boost their incomes. The large size of this population and its heterogeneity limit its influence on public policy. Farmers’ refusal to give precedence to their economic interests over their other ethnic and caste loyalties have limited their influence over public policies.

The Government needs to revamp its services so that growers have access to the latest technology and field practices. Agricultural universities must be involved in creating tailored educational programmes that serve the diverse needs of the rural population. Peasants need to learn how to work with limited land in a productive and environmentally friendly way. They do not only need better plant species but also up-to-date guidance on how to grow them. They do not need high-tech tractors controlled by satellites but they do need access to regional databases that provide information on soil quality. They also need access to affordable capital so that they no longer pile up unmanageable debt loads.

Loan waivers are both “bad politics” and “bad economics.” Indebtedness is the most acute problem faced by small and marginal farmers. However, their borrowings are primarily from moneylenders and hence a loan waiver is not going to make any sense for them. It is the richer farmers who are the real beneficiaries of such populist policies.

The problems faced by small farmers are complex and require a ruthless political will to address them. Their landholdings are below the economically viable threshold — the result is the cyclical appearance of bad loans and poor rainfall. Loan waivers have little to do with ending the conditions that lead to such problems.

Debt relief programmes fail to provide assistance to landless farmers, who do not have access to bank loans and some other growers, who depend on money-lenders. The write-offs are a disincentive to the banking system because people have expectations of future waivers as well.

The borrowers see value in strategic defaults. While it is important for banks to make credit available to farmers so that they can leverage and do better, it is also important to maintain credit discipline.

Loan waiver schemes vitiate the credit culture and make it tougher for banks to continue lending to these segments. They create moral hazards in the financial system by rewarding those farmers who default on their loans, offering nothing to those who pay. They do not take into account the loans growers have taken from the informal sector. There is also no distinction between voluntary and involuntary defaults, so it actually rewards those that have willfully defaulted. Additionally, the scheme does not take into account climatic conditions and fertility of soil. Farmers in certain areas face a higher risk of crop loss on account of weather conditions.

One of the ways to promote a farm revolution and overcome the challenges faced by primary producers among small and marginal farmers is to design a livelihood and development strategy that entails collectivising and strengthening them through Food Producer Organisations (FPOs) and integrating them into an inclusive value chain. It offers end-to-end support to small farm holders. These mutual aid organisations, whose members pool their expertise and part of their savings, become self-propagating in course of time.

As the value chain stabilises, it could be upgraded to have a more-complete ecosystem of private and public-sector actors at every link in the value chain. Throughout this process, it is necessary for the farmers and FPOs to create an improved ecosystem in which secure, independent livelihoods become attainable for marginalised small farmers.

The underlying principle that the value chain follows is similar to that of the full stack approach. This approach makes the sponsor responsible for every part of the experience. Uber, for example, handles everything from connecting people with a driver to managing payment and ratings. In the context of agriculture, the full stack approach includes helping farmers identify what to grow and how to grow it, what technology to use and when and where to sell at what price.

While farmers continue to work out strategies to keep their age-old bond with their land alive, the new generation finds farming unsustainable. This is the key reason behind its influx to cities despite the hard truth that the new utopian world the migrants hope to discover is a mere chimera. India needs to arrest this influx and inject the rural economy with new skill development programmes to generate local employment. That is the right way of saving both the cities and villages.

10,15-1-20,Maintain your credit-worthiness,"Boost your credit score by making timely payments and avoiding overspending. Financial discipline will help you stay out of a debt trap

Although money may not be the only important aspect of our lives, it is certainly a key one as it significantly lessens financial worries. This, in turn, enables us to have more control over our lives, freedom to carve our own path and fewer constraints on our choices. But many a time, we do not have enough finances to spare for some of our needs and that’s where banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) step in to bridge this gap through credit or loans. And the amount of loan that we can get is directly proportional to our credit-worthiness. In simple terms, credit-worthiness is the extent to which a person or a company is considered suitable to receive financial credit, often based on their reliability in paying money back in the past.

Who measures credit-worthiness in India then? There are several credit bureaus or credit rating agencies (CRAs) that generate scores by maintaining historical information of the credits of an individual and business and generate reports. This information is gathered from different lenders and other financial sources and the reports generated by these CRAs have relevance for different banks and other financial organisations. This is because these reports help the banks and other lenders profile their customers and take better decisions before approving their loans or credit. There are six major CRAs in India, namely, Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), Equifax, Credit Rating and Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL), ICRA, Experian and the CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services Private Limited, registered under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Among all, CIBIL is one of the most popular credit rating agencies in India. Its popularity is such that individual credit rating is known as the CIBIL score and people are really interested to know their CIBIL report.

An individual is scored on the scale of 300 to 900, where 300 is the lowest rating and 900 the highest. The higher the CIBIL score of a person, the greater are his/her chances of getting loans and credit cards easily. Some of the products offered by CIBIL are Credit Information Report, CIBIL TransUnion Score, Market Insight and so on. For organisations, one can get CIBIL Bureau Analyser, Portfolio Reports, CIBIL Company credit information report and so on. Most of the times it takes only one week to process the credit report from CIBIL. For any individual, maintaining a good credit score is vital if he/she wants to apply for loans or credit cards and it is important to stay in good standing. Here are some tips to achieve this:

Always pay on time: Timely payments of your debts are most crucial for having a high credit score. To stay on top of your payments, set up a calendar reminder or enrol in automatic payments. The on-time payment goal applies to all bills, including utilities, rent and cell phone service. Any missed payments can have an impact on the credit score for several years.

Pay all loans equally: Both revolving debt, like credit cards and long-term debt like mortgages or home loans, have an effect on the credit score. It is recommended that we should not prioritise one type of repayment over the other. It has been seen that having a high balance on the credit card over a long period of time lowers your credit score.

Old is gold: If you have a good payment track record, it adds to your credit score. So be very careful in wanting to close your old credit cards.

Pay in full: Making minimum payments on your credit cards is not advisable as this tends to drag the whole process, which in turn can lead to high interest payments. Try to pay in full whenever it is possible. However, if the minimum is all you can manage, make sure you pay at least that every month, otherwise you’ll have late or missed payments on your report.

Optimise your credit utilisation ratio: This is the ratio of credit card balance to the credit card limit. And the general thumb rule is to stay below 30 per cent for each card and on the overall basis (total balance on all cards divided by sum of credit limits). Credit utilisation ratio can improve by reducing the balances owed and maintaining or increasing the amount of credit available.

Follow a 20/10 rule: On a yearly basis, the credit card debt should not be more than 20 per cent of the total yearly income after taxes. And your monthly credit card payments should not be more than 10 per cent of your monthly take-home pay.

Make a repayment plan: If your debt is rising, take concrete actions. Stop using your cards and develop a monthly repayment schedule and most importantly, stick to it.

Overall, to maintain a good financial health and not suffer any financial distress, a disciplinary approach is very crucial. Boost your credit score by making timely and consistent payments and avoiding overspending. Financial discipline will go a long way to help you stay out of a debt trap.

11,15-1-20,Collateral damage of political paranoia,"All these shoot-downs of civilian jets by trigger-happy militaries around the world are fundamentally a political phenomenon, not a technical malfunction or mere human error

One of the main causes of death of airline passengers in recent decades is being shot down by somebody’s military. Not the very biggest, of course: Accidents account for nine-tenths of all deaths in civilian airline crashes and terrorist attacks and hijackings cause most of the rest. But a solid 2.5 per cent of the deaths are due to trigger-happy people in military uniforms.

That’s 1,379 passengers killed in commercial airliners that were shot down because they were off-course or simply mis-identified, out of a total of 57,767 deaths in all the “major incidents” (more than 50 deaths) in aviation history.

The first was an El Al plane that strayed into Bulgarian airspace in 1955. The second was an off-course Libyan airliner shot down by Israel over the Sinai Peninsula in 1973.

The last of the military shoot-downs in which actual fighters were involved was an off-track Korean Air jumbo jet shot down by a Soviet fighter in 1983. All 269 passengers and crew were killed.

Since then, the killing has been done by surface-to-air missiles, with no visual identification. The first of these was in 1988, when the US Navy ship Vincennes, operating illegally in Iran’s territorial waters, shot down an Iran Air jet bound for Dubai with 290 people aboard in the mistaken belief that it was a fighter plane. All aboard the ill-fated aircraft died.

Ukrainian Air Force missiles shot down a Siberia Airlines flight over the Black Sea in 2001 during a military exercise, killing 78 passengers and crew. In 2014, Russian-backed rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine shot down a Malaysian Airlines plane and killed all 298 passengers and crew.

And now 176 people, the great majority of them Canadian citizens or residents, have been killed just off the end of the runway in Tehran by a young Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps technician who thought he was shooting down an American drone. At least his commander acknowledged his personal responsibility — “I wish I was dead” — but the Iranian Government lied about it for three days.

Technically, this kind of mistake is inexcusable. You don’t even need high-cost military technology: A free Swedish app called Flight Radar 24 will give you real-time flight data on your phone for all civilian airliners in the air in your vicinity. What we are dealing with here is mostly human error. But, this human error is driven by paranoid politics and huge time pressure.

You can’t do anything about the time pressure: Decisions really do sometimes have to be made in seconds if you suspect that you have a “hostile” incoming on the radar and you have to protect your turf.

The paranoia might be easier to address in principle but it’s equally inevitable in practice: All the shoot-downs happen in countries that are in acute military confrontations of one sort or another.

And that’s the point, really. All these shoot-downs are fundamentally a political phenomenon, not a technical malfunction or mere human error.

We live in a far more peaceful world than our distant ancestors did but our deepest cultural traditions are still tribal. Once a confrontation gets going, we quickly turn into Yanomami villagers.

You can’t imagine an “accidental” shoot-down of a civilian aircraft over Canada nowadays, for example. Back in the Cold Days, however, there were surface-to-air missile systems in Canada, designed to shoot down Soviet bombers but perfectly capable of making the same sort of mistake that killed a plane-load of Canadians over Tehran last week. Nobody is invulnerable and nobody is immune to the paranoia.

On the other hand, don’t despair. The great majority of the world’s people now live in countries where the risk of war is very low or entirely absent, and the cities are not surrounded by anti-aircraft missiles. We have already travelled a very long way from the time when every human society lived in constant fear of all its neighbours.

This is still a work in progress. The past century has seen the most destructive wars in history — which was inevitable, given the growth in technology, wealth and population. But it was also the first time that people ceased to see war as natural, honourable and potentially profitable. Latterly warfare has gone into a steep decline.

There could still be back-sliding, especially if the climate crisis overwhelms us, but so far the trend line is promising. The world’s population has more than doubled in the past half-century but the number of people killed in war is less than a tenth of what it was in the previous half-century.

However, the planes are much bigger, and there are now around a million people in the air at any given moment, so there are also more people being killed in shoot-downs.

It’s never any consolation to tell people that things are getting better on average when they have been devastated by a personal loss. But for what it’s worth, they are.

13,15-1-20,4-day ‘pathshala’ by Priyanka now from January 20,"The proposed programme of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to hold four-day ‘pathshala’ in Rae Bareli from Wednesday (January 15) to train the newly-appointed district and city presidents of Uttar Pradesh was postponed on Tuesday.

UP Congress Committee incharge (administration) Sidharth Priya Srivastava said here on Tuesday that the training programme had been postponed and it ould be held from January 20. Srivastava said there might also be a change and now in the first two days, Priyanka and other senior leaders including state president Ajay Kumar Lallu will reveal the strategy to city and district presidents hailing from eastern UP and on third day, city and district presidents from western UP and eastern UP, along with all the officer-bearers of UP Congress Committee will attend the ‘pathshala’. On the last and fourth day, leaders from only western UP will attend the training session.

Sources said that Priyanka would update the leaders of party’s blue print of taking up public and other social issues to expose the state and Central governments. Priyanka had already interacted with the leaders before appointing them as district or city presidents. So far, she has appointed 108 district and city presidents from UP. The remaining 21, which include four district and 17 city presidents, will be announced before the training camp begins.

She will now guide them on how to spread party’s policies and at the same time, how to hold demonstration and protest to expose the failures of BJP governments both at the Centre and in UP.

During the training, besides taking updates on other party-related issues and policies, Priyanka will also discuss the strategy for the upcoming panchayat and graduate constituency polls. Besides Priyanka, some other experts raising social issues along with other senior leaders will also train the district and city chiefs. Ajay Kumar Lallu will also attend the camp.

It may be mentioned that to give a complete new look to the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee preferring to go with the youngsters, Vadra already held a three-day ‘pathshala’ in Rae Bareli for the new office-bearers to spur revival of the party.

Interestingly, the entire committee consists of majority of names which were even unknown for the old Congressmen, so they are now terming it ‘Priyanka Gandhi or Lallu’s Congress’ in Uttar Pradesh. The new UPCC also, for the first time, got entry into the Gandhi bastion with the first training session and now the second ‘pathshala’ will be also conducted in Rae Bareli, the parliamentary constituency of party president Sonia Gandhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/4-day----pathshala-----by-priyanka-now--from-january-20.html
14,15-1-20,Govt slams Akhilesh for insulting doctor on duty in Kannauj,"The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday slammed former Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav for publically humiliating a senior doctor at Kannauj Medical College.

Yadav, who was in Kannauj on Monday to meet those injured in the bus tragedy, asked a doctor to go out of the room and termed him an agent of the RSS and BJP.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said it was an insult to the doctor who serves people. “The former CM’s act shows his upbringing and frustration, Sharma said on Tuesday. Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh also slammed the SP president for his outburst against the doctor.

“The SP president seems to have lost his mental balance. He appears to be suffering from a deep sense of frustration and it was the reason he insulted a doctor who was performing his duty,” the minister said.

Akhikesh had scolded senior doctor of Kannauj Medical College DS Mishra when the latter tried to explain that the government was giving orders to treat the injured. Dr Mishra also informed the former CM that the compensation announced by the government had been given to the patients.

When a patient said he didn’t get a compensation cheque, Dr Mishra tried to say the cheque had, in fact, been given. That was when Akhilesh lost his cool and asked the doctor to get out.

“You don’t say anything as you are a government servant. You are a small officer and you could be a RSS or BJP worker. But you can’t run away from your responsibility. Go away. Get out of here,” Akhilesh had told the doctor. Dr Mishra said he was in the room to treat patients.

A video showing Akhilesh scolding a doctor on emergency duty in Kannauj Medical College has gone viral on social media and some are calling out what they term arrogant behavior by the former UP Chief Minister.

At least 20 people were killed and several others injured when a private double-decker bus went up in flames after colliding with a truck in Kannauj last week. The government had announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the kin of those killed and Rs 50,000 each to the grievously injured. Akhilesh said the families of those killed in the bus tragedy would receive Rs 20 lakh if the Samajwadi Party was voted to power in 2022 UP Assembly elections.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-slams-akhilesh--for-insulting-doctor-on-duty-in-kannauj.html

19,15-1-20,Naxals killed former associate’s brother,"Naxals killed the younger brother of a former associate who is now working with police in Chhattisgarh's Dantewada district, police said on Tuesday.

Laxman Mandavi (26), a resident of Duvalikarka village, was stabbed to death with sharp weapons by ultras at his native place late Monday night, Dantewada Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava said.

Mandavi's brother quit the outlawed CPI (Maoist) last year and joined the police force, which apparently angered the rebels, he claimed.

As per preliminary information, over a dozen Naxals reached the village and then sent some lower rung cadres to bring Mandavi out of his house before killing him in a nearby forest, he informed.

Some villagers spotted the body on Tuesday morning and alerted the police who rushed to the forest. The body was sent for postmortem and later handed over to relatives, the official said. A manhunt was launched to nab the assailants, he said.

The deceased's elder brother Baman Mandavi, who was associated with Maoists since 2008, surrendered before police in October last year.

He was active as deputy commander of a military platoon of Maoists at that time and was carrying a reward of Rs three lakh on his head, the official said, adding that he later joined the police force in Dantewada.

""Naxals are losing their foothold and the trust of tribal people. Therefore, they are committing such crimes out of desperation and targeting relatives of their associates who have surrendered,"" Pallava said.

Some Maoist pamphlets were also recovered from the spot in which ultras warned to avenge the killing of their senior cadres - Varghese and Linga - in encounters by security forces, he said",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/naxals-killed-former-associate---s-brother.html

A one-day session of Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly (CLP) has been convened on January 16 for the ratification of bill to extend reservation for the scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. The Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha had passed the bill last month that required approval from at least 50 per cent states.

The reservation for both the categories is slated to end on January 25, 2020.

Being the first session of the calendar year, it would begin with the customary address of Governor. According to the business listed for the day in the Chhattisgarh assembly, the House would take the motion of thanks to Governor’s address and pass it the same day besides ratifying the Constitution (126th amendment) Bill 2019.

“The BJP has reservation over the period of session convened by the Congress government as discussion on motion of thanks to Governor’s address and passing it could not take place in one day,” senior BJP leader and former state’s parliamentary affairs minister Ajay Chandrakar said.

Since the opposition had to bring cut motion that would be printed and circulated, passing the motion of thanks in one day would not be practical, Chandrakar said. The party had demanded that the session should be extended. Though in most of the BJP-ruled states, a single day session was convened and ratified the bill.

29,15-1-20,"6 months post polls, BJD still ahead of BJP, Cong","As the New Year 2020 unfolds, the BJD and the BJP are busy giving final shapes to their organisational election processes. The Congress is yet to take a call on party restructuring though the PCC president had hinted to take up the process in January.

The BJD is ahead of others in membership drive. For the first time, the party has adopted a deeper grass root cadre development approach. It has been identifying caders from the ward level and digitally documenting them. Huge work is going on at Assembly constituency levels. The BJD wants to make the party cader based and has targeted one crore membership. Party is forming its leadership structure form the ward, GP, Block/NAC, district to State cum Central Executive Body level.

Though party supremo and CM Naveen Patnaik shall be re-elected as the party president, there shall be competition for the State level vice president and general secretary posts as well as for the district level president posts. The BJD is likely to give important portfolios to its young generation.

However, Patniak, continues to be the only leader of the BJD on whose image the party survives. There is not yet emergence of any second line leadership in the BJD, who can win the trust of the voters.

Like the BJD, the BJP has almost completed its organisational election process in the State. Since it’s a national party, there is competition in the party for the State president post. The party has undertaken membership drive at grassroot and has completed its mandal and district leadership elections on consensus basis. The Central observers have visited the State and have taken feedback on the State president election.

The 2016 State party president election was west Odisha-centric and MLA centric. It is believed that the Central BJP leadership shall not repeat the incumbent for the State president post but shall give preference to a new leader.

There is obvious inquisitiveness about the new State BJP president. The party shall unlikely to spare its two senior leaders and Union Ministers, Dharmendra Pradhan and Pratap Sarangi for the president post now. It is not yet clear whether the Party shall give the post to a MP or a MLA or formet MLA or an organisational leader. Names of Suresh Pujari (MP), Aparajita Sarangi (MP) , Samir Mohanty (State VP), KV Singh Deo (former president) are making rounds for the State ’s top post. The party might choose a State leader who shall not only be able to expand the party’s organization network at grassroot but shall be able to operate in tune with the BJD-BJP mercurial relationship. The BJP shall also have to accommodate its new comers in various State and Central office bearer portfolios to check the repeat of Damodar Rout like incidents. Regional consideration may not be a priority this time.

The Congress had finished third in the last general election. The Assembly vote share of the party dropped from 25.7 per cent to 16.1 per cent. Many of its leaders defected to the BJP and the BJD. Even one of its working presidents left the party and joined the BJD during electioneering. Thus the last election destroyed the grassroot leadership system of the Congress in the State. The party needs full restructuring. It is not clear whether the Central Congress leadership shall allow the sitting PCC president to conduct the party restructuring process or shall put a new OPCC president to strengthen the party.

After the clean sweep of the BJD in the 2019 Assembly poll, the Opposition again got two opportunities to defeat the BJD in Patkura and Bijepur by-elections. But the BJD won these two polls. The BJD’s win in Bijepur Assembly by-election was important ,as the BJP had won the entire west Odisha Lok Sabha seats in the last general election. The by-elections re-established Patnaik’s popularity.

Today, six months after the general election, the BJD is still in a comfortable lead position in the State. There are two main reasons. First, the BJD is going ahead with new Government programmes. The BJD Government has lunched “ Mo Sarkar”, “5T”, “Mo Parivar” programmes to improve the quality of public service-administration. The State Government is also appreciated for not implementing the newly amended harsh MV Act in the State. The most popular programme of the State Government is its Jagannath Temple reform programme, lauded as” historic” by the Gajapati of Puri and millions of common people. The BJD Government has also undertaken a drive to remove the corrupt and inefficient officials from the State Government while awarding the good officers.

The second reason for the BJD’s dominance over the opposition parties is the party’s huge strength. The first contributing factor to the strength of the BJD is its internal discipline. Even, Prime Minister Modi has appreciated the discipline in the BJD. The dismal political fate of several dropped rebel leaders prevents the BJD leaders to undertake any divisive activities in party. The second factor for the growing strength of the BJD is its demand in the political market due to its repeated electoral success.

During the last election, the Congress and the BJP leaders who defected to the BJD, not only won the poll but also became Ministers in Patnaik’s Ministry whereas the leaders like Damodar Rout, Raghunath Mohanty and Baijayant Panda lost the 2019 election after leaving the BJD. The third factor for BJD’s growing strength is its presence at grassroots panchayat or ULB ward levels.

The fifth consecutive term pro-incumbency mandate for the Patnaik Government in Odisha shall be written as one of the regional political wonders in the political history of India. It should trigger a soul-searching exercise for the Opposition and the anti-BJD Government civil groups in Odisha.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/6-months-post-polls--bjd-still-ahead-of-bjp--cong.html
30,15-1-20,Hooda lashes out at BJP-JJPGovt for not declaring CMP,"Former Chief Minister and the leader of opposition in the Assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Tuesday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) -led coalition Government for not declaring its Common Minimum Programme (CMP) even after more than two months have passed after the formation of the government in the State.

Hooda alleged that coalition government in the State is directionless in the absence of CMP.

""Why is the coalition government in Haryana misleading the people by not declaring its common minimum programme,"" he asked.

Referring to Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena- led coalition government in Maharashtra, the senior congress leader said that soon after the formation of the government in the State, the coalition government in Maharashtra had released its CMP.""Commo minimum programme of coalition government gives clarity in governance, he said"", alleging that BJP-JJP led coalition government in Haryana is struggling to run the government effectively.

""They have failed to establish coordination among ministers... Ministers here are fighting over allocation of departments.” It seems there is no coordination inside the government.

This leads to confusion in governance and this coalition government may not continue for long time"", he added.

The senior congress leader said that the party has decided to support the State government employees of their demand of implementation of old pension scheme.

Hooda said that he would raise this issue in the floor of Vidhan Sabha.

33,15-1-20,Schools caution against touts in Jamshedpur,"Schools in the city are warning parents to beware of touts this admission season. Leading English medium schools have said that they are receiving complaints of parents falling prey to rackets involved in admission lure.

Admission touts are not uncommon in the city, where most reputable schools receive a far greater number of applications than they can accommodate. According to information, touts look for preys and promise admission saying they know certain ‘important’ people in the school and they can get admission. They ask for money (any amount ranging from 1 lakh to 5 lakhs) to get the admission done through the back door.

“We have witnessed cases where they print notices on false letterheads (supposedly given by the school ) giving information about interview dates, sale of books and uniform, orientation etc. These notices are forged and when parents go to the school for an interview or to buy books the school authorities deny them permission even to enter the school. Letters purportedly signed (forged) by the Principal, Secretary of the Managing Committee, bearing the school stamp are given to the parents. Needless to say these are all fraud,” said a school principal, who wished not to be quoted.

She said that feeding on the despair of anxious parents to secure admission in a good school for their child, there are a few touts/middlemen/fraudsters who take advantage of the situation to make a quick buck.

In a few cases, the child gets into the admission list by pure luck. But the touts tell the parents that it is because of their intervention that they have got the admission. The innocent parents are happy that their money has secured them admission. This is absolutely not true.

In a few rare cases the touts return the money (mostly it is not all, only a part) to the parents after three or four months when they are not able to secure admission for the child.

Father Pius Fernandes, principal, Loyola School said that the parents need to be careful. All the schools in the city follow a standard procedure for admission and the parents should not get lured to the touts.

“ Let me clear to the parents that no school takes money for admission. Therefore never ever give money to any middleman who promises admission. Even if he/she assures you that there is a 100 % chance of getting admission, do not believe him/her. All schools put up important information regarding admission on their school website. Therefore do not trust notices which do not have letterheads. Schools will not send notices through middlemen. Any notice will be given directly by the school office,” said an official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/schools-caution-against-touts-in-jamshedpur.html
34,15-1-20,PIB holds workshop for orientation of folk artistes,"A day-long orientation workshop for folk artists was organised here today with a view to spread wide publicity to promote Phase-2 vaccination of intensive Mission Indradhanush in various districts of Jharkhand by the Public Outreach and Communications Bureau, Ranchi, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The workshop was inaugurated by Chief Guest Shailesh Kumar Chaurasia, Director, Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Jharkhand and Arimardan Singh, Additional Director General, Public Relations and Communications Bureau, Ranchi.

Chaurasia said, on the occasion, that malnutrition is very high in Jharkhand, vaccinating children will bring out the State by its vicious cycle. A healthy society is the first condition of the vision of a prosperous and strong country. He described folk artists as understanding the nuances of society, which keeps the complex matter between people in a simple and powerful way by communicating in the same language. He expressed confidence that the artists would play an important role in making the Rainbow Mission a success.

Arimardan Singh said that healthy children are successful human resources for the country, so keeping the health of children paramount, the government is running Mission Indradhanush at a broad level. He provided detailed information to the artists about various diseases related to the newborn like tetanus, rubella, measles, polio, tuberculosis, smallpox, plague etc. and related vaccines so that these can be included in their presentation and tell the people. He explained how vaccination is compulsory for all children as these diseases are spread by infection, so “if one child is left, the safety cycle is broken” is an important goal for this campaign.

The Immunization Officer of Jharkhand, Dr. Amar Mishra, informed that when the State was separated from Bihar, only 9 per cent vaccination was done here, which has increased to more than 90 per cent today. He said that in the Intensive Rainbow Mission Phase-2, it is the effort of the State that children and pregnant mothers, who are still deprived of vaccination should also be protected under it, so that the State can achieve the goal of 100 percent vaccination. The campaign was launched in four phases in the State on 2 December 2019. Each phase will be run for 7 days. The last phase will begin on the first Monday of March 2020. In the first phase, this campaign was carried out in 12,829 places, while in the second phase, vaccination campaign has been carried out in more than 8000 places so far.

At the same time, Dr. Vanesh Mathur of UNICEF elaborated on how to present the mission information to the people in a simple way. He said that 8 lakh children are being born every year in the state and there are around 9 lakh pregnant women, out of which about 20 per cent i.e. more than 1.5 lakh mother children are still out of this campaign, which is a serious issue. He gave information about various vaccines to be held in the Rainbow Mission.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pib-holds-workshop-for-orientation-of-folk-artistes.html
35,15-1-20,Baleswar urban traffic management in disarray,"When the Road Safety Week is underway, the traffic management mainly in the Baleswar headquarters town and other urban pockets is in disarray.

In the headquarters town while none of traffic light posts is functioning for over 5 years, there is no proper marking for dividers or zebra crossing although traffic is being manned regularly in the busy hours at FM Golai, Station square , Police Line Square, ITI Square and Cinema Square.

As a result, the commuters face lots of inconveniences in the want of automatic traffic signaling. More difficulties are experienced by the denizens when there is load shedding during evening hours as the traffic police manning the traffic with manual signal with the marshaling wand is hardly visible.

Similarly, difficulties also arise for the traffic regulators when there is rain as the posts have no shed to accommodate the policemen.

Besides the infrastructure difficulties, the other bottlenecks are the parking and encroachments.

Sadly, an English medium school in the heart of the town causes traffic chaos as the district administration continues to desist from taking any actions against the school despite several complaints for years to successive district Collectors and other concerned authorities.

""The authorities not only take a lenient view, but also favour the school as their children read in the school,"" alleged a resident.

The school, St Vincent Convent School, on the Vivekananda Marg, while accommodates over 2,500 students, it creates traffic chaos during school opening and closing hours.

Majority of the students while belong to affluent class and wards of high Government officials, they come to school or go home mainly in four wheelers. The parking of these vehicles on the road that leads to the District Headquarters Hospital, town police station and collectorate, besides connecting banks and insurance companies and other major business establishments creates serious inconveniences for the patients, movement of ambulance and commuters.

More so, there is every possibility of accident because of congestion and movement of tiny children crossing roads from one side to the other.

Traffic officer-in-charge, Prasant Ransigh, however, admitting the fact, said, “ There are lots of complaints against the school. The district Collector has issued an instruction to the school as well as to traffic police which would be enforced within a couple of days and the parking of vehicles near the school won’t be allowed anymore.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/baleswar-urban-traffic-management-in-disarray.html

Fearing further attack, the family abandoned the village. However, no district official could be contacted to comment on the matter till last reports came in.

37,15-1-20,SC clears way for their appointment,"Buoyed by the positive decision of the Supreme Court (SC), in the guest teachers’ case, the Uttarakhand Government has decided to start the process of recruitment of guest teachers on the vacant posts.

The SC on Tuesday allowed the Uttarakhand government make appointment of guest teachers on vacant posts. Welcoming the decision of the SC, the Education Minister Arvind Pandey told The Pioneer that the decision is positive.

He said that the process of recruitment of guest teachers in the vacant posts would start from Wednesday. The minister said that he was regularly in touch with Attorney General (AG), Mukul Rohatagi on the issue. He said that the education department is committed to provide teachers in all the schools of the state.

It is learnt that recruitment of guest teachers would be done on the basis of district wise merit list. In districts, a committee headed by district magistrates would make appointments of guest faculty.

A stipend of Rs 15000 per month would be paid to the guest teachers and at the time of appointments the candidates would have to submit an undertaking that they would not make any demand for permanent appointments.

More than 5500 posts of LT and Lecturers are at present lying vacant in the government schools of the state. As the process of permanent appointments is time consuming, the state cabinet decided to fill these posts by guest faculty as an immediate though temporary measure to provide teachers in schools.

However some of the former guest teachers challenged the drive in the SC which issued a stay on the appointment of guest teachers. The issue was pending before the SC since then.

Last year, the hearing of the case was delayed as the case earlier was listed in the court of then Chief Justice of India (CJI), Ranjan Gogoi. However the case could not come up for hearing as the constitutional bench of SC consisting of five judges headed CJI was engaged in a day to day hearing of the politically sensitive Ramjanambhoomi- Babri Masjid land dispute case. After the superannuation of CJI, Gagoi, the case came up for hearing in another bench of SC which gave its verdict on Tuesday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sc-clears-way-for-their-appointment.html

39,15-1-20,Those backstabbing party cannot be referred to as Taksalis: Sukhbir,"Launching a frontal attack on the Dhindsa father-son duo, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Tuesday minced no words to say that those backstabbing the party cannot be referred to as Taksalis (traditional Akalis).

“Those, like MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who are backstabbing the mother party, which has given them so much honour, could not be referred to as Taksalis as they are trying to weaken the panth,” said Sukhbir, addressing a massive congregation while paying rich tributes to the 40 ‘Muktas’ who sacrificed themselves for the ‘kaum’.

Sukhbir said: “A Taksali is someone who is loyal to his party and never disobeys it.”“Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa lost all elections but one in the last 35 years, but he was consistently accommodated by Parkash Singh Badal by being made chairman of a State Board or given a Rajya Sabha ticket. This happened even when he lost by a margin of three lakh votes. SAD and Sardar Badal were not bad for him then,” said Sukhbir.Stating that Dhindsa was questioning SAD’s contribution towards the panth and Punjab by stating that he wanted to free the SAD of the Badals, he said that Sardar Badal was known for his service to the people.“In public service it is the people who decided the fate of their leaders.The people have reposed their faith in Badal Sahab on numerous occasions and he has been winning elections since 1965 and is also a five-time chief minister. In direct contrast, those who are not liked by the people, face defeat in repeated elections,” said Sukhbir.Speaking about former minister and party MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa, SAD president said that he was like a younger brother to him. “I have always tried to accommodate him. He came to me to change his constituency. I agreed. Sukhdev Dhindsa requested for a ticket for his bureaucrat son-in-law from Mohali.I agreed to that too. It pains me that they are calling me a dictator now. They did not earlier,” he said.

Speaking about his own conduct, Sukhbir said that Sukhdev Dhindsa is my elder. “I touch his feet.

I have played in his lap. I also know, as a fact from my 35 years in politics, that Badal Sahab never said no to Dhindsa. Despite this, Dhindsa has now made it his aim to take on the Badal family. I want to tell him that we won’t win or lose as per your will but by the will of the people,” he added.Also taking on the Punjab Government and the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the burning issues of the State, Sukhbir said that the people had been burdened with unbearable tariff hikes which had affected each and every person and was making the industry unviable.SAD president accused the Chief Minister of releasing fake advertisements saying that the Government had created 10 lakh jobs. Stating that rule of the jungle was prevalent during Congress rule, he said that the Congress Ministers and MLAs were using gangsters to terrorize their political opponents as well as the common man.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/those-backstabbing-party-cannot-be-referred-to-as-taksalis--sukhbir.html

Special vigil would also be held at crowded places which witness cockfights to avoid any law and order situation. For those office going professionals who avoid street food and prefer to binge at eateries inside the market areas will have to compromise.

The tribals in and around the city are gearing up to celebrate Tusu, the harvest festival, with traditional fanfare and gaiety. Various social and cultural organisations are set to organise Tusu Mahotsav at places like Domuhani, Sonari (the meeting point of Subarnarekha and Kharkai) and Itagarh.

44,15-1-20,Solid waste management in shambles in Bokaro,"Cleanness drive seems to have failed to leave a mark in Bokaro with several nooks and corners found chunked with garbage and solid waste across the steel city Bokaro. Pick-up of garbage and waste is stopped for the past 45 days. City has a population over 6 lakhs, and Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) management has the primary responsibility of cleaning the township area.

In the middle of the bad odour rising from the waste, the residents are forced to reside. We are finding a very hard time, said Poonam Sinha, a housewife and a resident of Sector 3. “The situation would become more frightening if the lifting of waste will not start soon,” she added.

Another resident Vinod Kumar said, if the situation persists few more days the population may come in the grip of several diseases. “It is estimated that more than 3000 tonnes of garbage is lying in various sectors of the city in past one month, spreading bad smells as well as germs in our locality,” added Kumar.

About 80 tonnes of garbage is increasing day-by-day which was getting dumped at different areas, nooks and corners in the township areas. The Public Health Department of BSL in the township is responsible for the pickup and disposal of waste, an official said requesting anonymity.

In the year 2017, BSL outsourced this work to M/S Utility Powertech Limited for one and a half years for Rs 6.5 crores and the company started a door-to-door collection of waste from various sectors and used to dump near Sector 11 in the landfill site, said the official.

47,15-1-20,Paddy procurement stopped; Balangir farmers suffer,"Balangir farmers are facing a big problem due to sudden stoppage of purchase of their paddy as the target given by the Government to the district has been achieved.

Other factors like lack of adequate infrastructure to purchase paddy at Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS), irregularities in issue of token to farmers at the State level and deduction of at least 5kg per bag of paddy in the name of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) ,which is popularly known as "" Katni and Chhatni"" too have overshadowed the paddy procurement in the district. Balangir district was given a target of 19 lakh tonnes. This year, the district has a good paddy production. As a result, the target given by the Government was achieved by December 28 last.

Consequently, the farmers who are yet to dispose of their paddy are waiting.

BJP district president Sibaji Mohanty told mediapersons that the party had submitted a memorandum to the district administration to take remedial measures in this regard.

""Let the Government purchase paddy from farmers without further delay, besides improving infrastructure at PACS level,"" demanded Mohanty. He also demanded issue of P pass system at the PACS level, rather than at the State level.

""We are getting reports that additional seven lakh metric tons of paddy procurement target has been allocated to Balangir district. But the Balangir district administration is issuing target to PACS arbitrarily. While some PACS are getting higher target,other PACS are getting less. We demand an inquiry into this. Moreover, the millers are also purchasing paddy from farmers, contrary to High Court order,"" Mohanty alleged.

In a related development, Loisingha MLA Mukesh Mahaling, BJP leader Pradeep Purohit and others on Tuesday staged a demonstration before the collectorate here, protesting against the deduction of five to seven kg of paddy from the farmers at PACS level, saying it did not conform with FAQ standard set by the Government.

Besides, farmers of Nagaon(B) of and Bidighat led by Zilla Krushak Mahasangh president Sudhir Parischha on Tuesday staged a demonstration before the Civil Supplies office, demanding purchase of their paddy and transparency in procurement at PACS level. Their dharna was withdrawn after the authorities assured to take measures.

""If remedial action is not taken within seven days, the farmers would gherao the office once again,"" threatened Parischha.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/paddy-procurement-stopped--balangir-farmers-suffer.html

67,15-1-20,Ashwani Sharma likely to be Punjab BJP chief,"Ashwani Sharma, who took the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to strong footing during the 2012 Punjab Assembly polls, is all set to take up the party reins in Punjab once again. It has been learnt that Sharma’s name has received a green signal from the party high command, and its formal announcement would be made on January 17.

Sources informed The Pioneer that the BJP organisational election in-charge for Punjab Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, has reportedly submitted his report to the party high command, which has approved Sharma’s name for the coveted post.

However, the election for the State party president would be held as per schedule on January 17, when the formal announcement would be made.

Even as several party leaders were eyeing the post, continuous efforts were being made to elect the new president unanimously.

Besides Sharma, incumbent State chief Shwait Malik, former MP Avinash Rai Khanna, national general secretary Tarun Chugh, former Cabinet Minister Manoranjan Kalia, former Cabinet Minister Anil Joshi, party’s state vice-president Narinder Parmar, among others were in the race for the top post.

Since long, talks regarding replacing the incumbent Shwet Malik as the state unit president have been doing the rounds on the grounds that he was not making enough efforts to revive the party fortunes in the State. He was also criticised by a section of party leaders for not taking everyone along, besides winning the party’s senior leadership’s faith in party’s routine affairs.

Notably, Chauhan had met the party delegates from different constituencies of the State, besides the heads of various wings of the party in Ludhiana. On the basis of the same, he had prepared a report on the likely candidates. Along with that, all out efforts were being made to zero in on one name, as per earlier instances.

Sharma, the Punjab BJP’s former president, had earlier served the state unit between 2009 and 2012. A former MLA from Pathankot, Sharma reportedly enjoys the backing of RSS-appointed state organization secretary Dinesh Kumar besides other leaders.

It has been learnt that Sharma also managed to get support of some key leaders who were seen as members of the faction led by Kamal Sharma who passed away in November last year.

The party’s ideological mentor, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), has been reportedly throwing its weight behind Narinder Parmar, a little-known face in the State’s political circles.

The new party chief would be tasked not only with the challenge to revitalise the party in the state, but also to maintain cordial relations with the alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). It will be the new party chief under whose leadership the BJP would contest the next Assembly polls in 2022.

Considering the same, it seems that party has reposed its faith once again in Sharma, under whose leadership the party, in coalition with the Akali Dal, created a history by securing the second consecutive term in Punjab in 2012.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ashwani-sharma-likely-to-be-punjab-bjp-chief.html

74,15-1-20,Whitetopping optimal solution for durable road,"Daily commuting for the citizens of Bhopal continue to deteriorate due to the increase in potholes and the lack of road maintenance. Worsening road infrastructure intensifies the negative impact on the residents’ lifestyle with the rise invehicular traffic and road accidents.

This predicament prevails not only in Bhopal but all across India, with a number of accidents and deaths reported due to potholes on a regular basis.

Crucial stretches such as Minal to towards Raisen (JK Road) or Suraj Nagar Chouraha to Nilbad-Ratibad in Bhopal, are a few examples that repeatedly faces unpleasant commuter experience due to reoccurring of potholes and unsafe roads.

Hence, it becomes vital to implement a technology that is durable and sustainable in nature and facilitates an enhanced commuter experience, whitetopping, in this respect, is the optimal solution to ensure safer and durable roads with minimum repairs over its entire lifecycle of 20 years.

Stretches such as VIP Road or the side roads of BRTC Corridor (DB Mall to Misrod) are case studies that have been refurbished with whitetopping technology which has facilitated a smoother and safe commuter experience for the citizens.

The technology has gained widespread popularity and public acceptance due to its holistic benefits, such as being environmentally friendly and highly economical during its lifecycle, which provides pothole free roads for over 20 years.

Whitetopping requires much less maintenance and as such involves much less frequent lane closures of road, as compared to bituminous surfaces.

This solution has been implemented across major cities in India, which has proved to be a significant game changer for ensuring pothole-free roads.

Across India, over 1000km of Whitetopping projects have been successfully completed, including construction in major cities such as Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Pune, Bengaluru, Kanpur among others.

Bhishma Kumar Chugh, National Level Project Monitor, Govt. of. India - Ministry of Road Transport & Highway; Former Director General, CPWD, Union Ministry of Urban Development, “Whitetopping is widely known to be highly sustainable and economical in nature. With a lifecycle of over 20 years, whitetopping facilitates pothole free roads with minimum repair required.

This has been one of the main reasons behind the high degree of acceptance by the citizens for the technology, given the holistic benefits on offer. With vehicular population increasing on a gradual

basis, whitetopping provides a complete solution to India’s poor urban road infrastructure.”

Er MK Gupta, Retd E-in-C, MP Rural Road Development Authority Bhopal, shared, “As per the new technology whitetopping provides pothole free roads and good riding surfaces, it also has a lesser burden on natural resources with reduced utilization of aggregates and minimum repair required over its 20 year long life cycle.

Highly sustainable and durable in nature, whitetoppedroad’s quality remains consistent and provides a definitive solution for a good quality roads for long period. It is idealfor rapidly urbanizing India.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/whitetopping-optimal-solution-for-durable-road.html
75,15-1-20,Cabinet seeks disciplinary action against Bajwa,"A day after Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa raised a banner of revolt against Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, all the state Cabinet Ministers on Tuesday demanded “in one voice” disciplinary action by the party leadership against him.

As per the government’s official statement, the issue came up for informal discussion just before the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening.

It stated that there was consensus among the Ministers on the need for “action against Bajwa”.

The demand for action against Bajwa came in the wake of his latest remarks, declaring that he would not support Capt Amarinder’s leadership for a second term unless action is taken in the sacrilege cases.

“The Chief Minister had made it clear from the outset that he is committed to bringing the culprits of the sacrilege incidents to book, but would not indulge in vindictive politics.

Bajwa’s stand smacked of vendetta and has no place in a principled party like the Congress,” said the Ministers.

The Ministers pointed out that despite repeated pleas asking him to express his opinions within the party forum, Bajwa continued to criticize Capt Amarinder and his Government in media and other places.

“The MP has gone so far as to seek a change at the helm of the government,” they noted with dismay, terming it an act of sheer indiscipline and urging the party leadership to take immediate action against the former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief.

The Ministers accused Bajwa of playing into the hands of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by pitching himself against his own party leadership, especially at a time when the entire opposition was in a state of disarray, posing no real challenge to the Congress in the State.

“Such rebellion, if not nipped in the bud, could send the wrong message down the rank and file of the Punjab Congress, which has been on a high since taking over the State’s reins around three years,” said the Ministers.

The Ministers added, while the Congress was run on democratic principles, where every member had a say, such public display of difference of opinion and mutinous declarations from a senior member were detrimental to the interest of the party, and under no circumstances, could this kind of behaviour be tolerated or allowed to continue.

Sports Minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi stressed that it was absolutely imperative to act against Bajwa as such behaviour would weaken the party.

“We cannot allow this to become a free for all,” said Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.

The Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra wanted the Chief Minister to take up the issue with the Congress high command in Delhi, adding that any dissent should be discussed and resolved within the party forum.

Finance Minister Manpreet Badal pointed out that history showed dissension of any sort had always harmed the Congress. “We succeeded in winning so many seats in Punjab only because we were united,” he said, adding that this unity could not be allowed to be destroyed at any cost.

Medical Education Minister Om Prakash Soni, Forest Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, and Rural Development and Panchayats Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa were also quick to point out that Partap Bajwa’s actions were extremely damaging for the party, and urgent and immediate action was needed against him.

Other Ministers — Aruna Chaudhary, Razia Sultana, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Sukhjinder Singh Sarkaria, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Vijay Inder Singla, Sunder Sham Arora and Bharat Bhushan Ashu — were also in total agreement with their colleagues in seeking urgent intervention by the party high command in the matter.

Terming as “shocking” Bajwa’s remarks that Punjab Congress could only survive without Capt Amarinder, the Ministers pointed out that the Congress, under the present government, had swept all elections in the State since the 2017 Assembly polls, which clearly showed the people were happy and satisfied with his style of functioning, and the party was doing immensely well with him as Chief Minister.

Further, they pointed out, that under Capt Amarinder’s dynamic leadership, Punjab had witnessed major resurgence on all counts and was progressing at a significant pace, despite the poor economic legacy inherited by the government.

“But Bajwa is clearly not interested in development and only wanted to make a political point to promote his self-interest, with his frequent diatribes against the Chief Minister,” they added

Pointing out that Capt Amarinder had himself, on several occasions, stressed the need to hand over the baton to the younger generation, the leaders, however, said that the time was not ripe for such a move in Punjab, which had suffered major problems under the SAD-BJP regime.

Punjab needed the visionary leadership of Capt Amarinder and clearly did not want someone like Bajwa, who seemed to spend all his time indulging in negative and destructive politics, at the helm.

Describing as unfortunate Bajwa’s comments on employment, the Ministers lambasted him for focusing on petty politics instead of strengthening the Chief Minister’s hands in his efforts to ensure jobs for all and progress for every citizen of Punjab.

“At a time when every member of the party should be involved in reviving the state’s economy and powering its growth, Bajwa seemed bent on pulling the party and the government down,” said the Ministers, demanding immediate action against the MP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cabinet-seeks-disciplinary-action-against-bajwa.html

77,15-1-20,Heritage items as ‘art treasures' in Chandigarh,"The heritage items in Chandigarh will get the status of “art treasures”, if the Chandigarh Administration’s proposal to give legal protection to such items turns into a reality.

In a bid to preserve heritage items in the city, the Chandigarh Administration is mulling over notifying them as “art treasures”.

The Administration has so far miserably failed to stop the theft of heritage items from Chandigarh and its auction being held by foreign based auction houses.

According to the inventory prepared by the UT Administration in the year 2012, Chandigarh has ‘12793’ heritage items designed by city’s creator French Architect Le Corbusier or his team associated with the founding and planning of the city in 1950s and 60s.

There are 190 different categories of the heritage items including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs, tables, among others.

The Administration has also proposed to carry out “physical verification” of identified heritage items by experts to ascertain its “genuineness”.

As per the action plan chalked out for the restoration and preservation of heritage items, the Chandigarh Administration will approach Union Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), after consulting its Legal Department for giving legal protection to the heritage items.

“For the preservation of heritage items, we are exploring the option of declaring it as art treasures. It is proposed to approach ASI to notify Chandigarh’s heritage items as art treasures,” said a senior officer of UT Administration while talking to The Pioneer.

The proposal was discussed by Chandigarh Heritage Protection Cell. It was also recommended to collect data on previous instances of items being declared “art treasures” under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, the senior officer said.

Pursuant to the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, the Union Ministry of Education and Social Welfare had promulgated the Antiquities and Art Treasure Rules, 1973. The rules state that the Central Government before declaring any human work of art as an “art treasure” may constitute a committee of at least three members to submit a report on the artistic and aesthetic value of such human work of art.

“Art treasure” means “any human work of art, not being an antiquity, declared by the Central Government by notification in the official gazette, to be an art treasure for the purposes of this Act having regard to its artistic or aesthetic value, provided that no declaration under this clause shall be made in respect of any such work of art so long as the author thereof is alive.”

The UT officer said that by giving a legal status to the heritage items, the Chandigarh Administration will be able to protect these items and take legal action in matters of theft or damage to heritage items.

Notably, the UT Administration had in 2014 also approached ASI seeking assistance in establishing the “genuineness” of heritage items, identified during the finalization of heritage inventory made in 2011 and 2012 here. However, the ASI had turned down the Administration’s request.

Quoting “The Antiquities And Art Treasures Act, 1972”, the ASI had in 2014 stated ‘antiquities’ which have been in existence for not less than 100 years viz. sculptures in stone, terracotta, metals, ivory Painting in paper, wood, cloth, skin etc and manuscripts are covered under the Act while the heritage items in the city are less than 60 years old.

Hence, the ASI will not be able to assist the Administration in conservation works of heritage belonging to Chandigarh, stated the ASI in its letter.

Among various departments in Chandigarh, the UT Government Museum and Art Gallery has a possession of large number of heritage items including furniture, drawings, murals, models among others made by renowned architect Le Corbusier and his other associates. Besides, Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat, Punjab and Haryana Vidhan Sabha, Punjab and Haryana High Court also have huge stock of heritage furniture including chairs, sofas and tables.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/heritage-items-as----art-treasures--in-chandigarh.html
78,15-1-20,"After expensive housing scheme, CHB reduces price of flats","Considering the lukewarm response to its costliest housing scheme in Sector 53 here, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) on Tuesday decided to further slash the cost of the flats.

The Board members of CHB, who met on Tuesday to decide the fate of the housing scheme decided to reduce the cost of the flats in the proposed housing scheme at Sector 53. Besides, the last date for submission of online application for the scheme has been extended upto February 23, 2020.

Around 148 people had applied under the housing scheme offering 492 flats in Sector 53. Under the housing scheme, the CHB intends to construct 192 HIG flats, 100 MIG flats, 120 LIG flats and 80 EWS units.

During the Board meeting, it has been decided that the CHB will not charge any profit in either category of the dwelling unit, said a senior officer of CHB.

The revised price of the flats under the proposed housing scheme is Rs 1.50 crore for a flat with three-bedroom, hall and kitchen (HIG-BHK), Rs 1.28 cr for 2 BHK (MIG), Rs 86 lakh for one BHK (LIG). The price of the economically weaker section (EWS) flats has remained unchanged at Rs 50 lakh.

This is for the second time that the CHB has revised the price of flats after launching the scheme in July 2019.

Earlier, the price was reduced in November after a demand survey was conducted to check whether there was a demand for the general housing in the city or not.

In July last year, the CHB had proposed a HIG-BHK flat for Rs 1.80 crore, MIG flat for Rs 1.47 crore, 1 BHK (LIG) for Rs 95 lakh and EWS units for Rs 50 lakh, receiving a lot of criticism from various sections.

The CHB’s senior officer said that it has also been decided that the allottees will be allowed to pay cost of the flats in five equated installments (each of six months) spanning over 30 months subject to payment of interest at the rate Rs 12 percent per annum.

After launch of the scheme, for speedily construction of the dwelling units, the construction work will be awarded to two or three agencies, he said.

The last date for submission of online application has been extended upto February 23.

However the window for online submission of application will be opened from next week and a public notice with required details will be issued separately, he added.

The deadline for applying under the scheme had ended on December 31.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after-expensive-housing-scheme--chb-reduces-price-of-flats.html
79,15-1-20,17-yr-old Pakistani boy sent back home after almost 2 years,"A 17-year-old Pakistani boy was sent back home on Tuesday to the neighbouring nation, two years after he inadvertently crossed over to the Indian territory in 2018 following a tiff with his family.

After he was released from a juvenile home in Punjab''s Hoshiarpur district on Tuesday morning, Mubashar Bilal, a resident of border village Wazirpur of Pakistan''s Kasur district, was taken to the Attari-Wagah border in Amritsar where he was handed over to Pakistani authorities, officials said.

Bilal, who is also known as Mubarak, was handed over to the Pakistani Rangers by the Border Security Force (BSF) personnel around 1:30 pm, they said.

Bilal said he had left home in a huff following a fight with his family members.

""There was a bit of a fight at home and I left it in anger. I could not come to know (entering India) and then I was caught by the BSF personnel,"" Bilal said, adding that he spent almost 20-22 months here.

Bilal crossed over to Pakistan on the basis of the ''Emergency Travel Certificate'' issued by the Pakistan High Commission.

Talking to reporters at Attari, Bilal said he was ""very happy"" to return to his family in Pakistan.

""I am very happy today (to return home),"" said an elated Bilal.

He also praised Indian authorities for treating him well and said he was indebted for that.

""I have a mother, brother and sister there (in Pakistan),"" he replied to a question.

Asked whether he will come to India again if he gets a visa, he replied, ""surely.""

Earlier during the day, Hoshiarpur Deputy Commissioner Isha Kalia said Bilal was released from a juvenile home at 7 am on Tuesday.

An order pertaining to his release from the Centre was received five to six days back, Kalia told PTI.

He had been kept in a juvenile home in Hoshiarpur after he was held by the BSF in February 2018.

Bilal had inadvertently entered Indian territory. He was held from Khemkaran village of Punjab''s Tarn Taran district and was later booked under relevant sections of the Foreigners Act and the Passport Act.

He was acquitted of all charges by the Juvenile Justice Board in September 2018.

Hailing from a poor family, his father Mohammad Akbar was reportedly a daily wager in Pakistan and was longing to have a glimpse of his son ever since he left home.

Bilal''s father reportedly had even raised the demand for repatriation of his son in the Pakistani media. Later, various social activists in India had launched a campaign for the release of Bilal and his repatriation to Pakistan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/17-yr-old-pakistani-boy-sent-back-home-after-almost-2-years.html
80,15-1-20,Kandhamal MP’s unique initiative to provide employment,"It was the time of general elections in 2019. People were putting their demands on the table. The political parties were working on their manifestos and politicians were on the streets meeting and listening to people.

An internationally-acclaimed social worker and educationist, Dr Achyuta Samanta, who had recently entered politics, was declared Lok Sabha candidate from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) by its supremo Naveen Patnaik

Dr Samanta earned his position among the respected and decorated social activists and educationists of the world by uplifting more than 50,000 indigenous children who studied or were studying free of cost at the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), Bhubaneswar, the world’s largest indigenous residential institute established by him. Knowing that they had got an exemplary candidate, people’s expectations were high in the Kandhamal constituency. Some of the most critical issues in the constituency identified by the Niti Ayog’s most backward and Aspirational Districts were “poverty, underdevelopment and unemployment”.

Dr Samanta could come up with an idea with relative ease on the strength of his three-decade-long track record in the field of poverty eradication. He understood that unless per-family purchasing capacity or disposable income is improved, the constituency and its people won’t come out of their predicament ever. He got elected with a thumping majority and started his work right away.

Amongst other initiatives, he took upon himself a target to provide meaningful employment to at least 10,000 youths of the constituency every year. It was an uphill task given the declining GDP and record unemployment rate in the country. However, he made a start, forming a team of 100 people from his own organisation who conducted a detailed survey to obtain details of every unemployed youth. The task, although a tedious one due to the hilly terrain, was completed within a couple of months. The data gathered had individual details including the qualification and preferred career option.

He then engaged his team to contact all the quality organisations in his knowledge and identify their manpower requirements that these youths could meet. Out of the hundreds of organisations contacted, around 80 were found to be a match. But most of the youths were under-matric; so, some basic skill training had to be provided before they could become employable. To bridge this gap, he set up two new Skill Training Centres with his own resources. His team went out on the field again. They gathered the youths from every block, counselled them, and brought them to the skill centres for basic training.

Two mega job fairs at Phulbani and Boudh were held to bring the shortlisted organisations and youths together. The district administrations of both the districts also joined hands. Bringing officials from 80 organisations and around 10,000 youths from both the places was a logistic nightmare. But the “never give up” attitude of Dr Samanta kept the team going.

81,15-1-20,Commercial consumers to be targeted in 1st phase,"The mass disconnection of electricity supply by Central Electricity Supply Utility (Cesu) would begin from January 16 with defaulting commercial consumers facing termination in the first phase.

In the second phase, the financially strong domestic consumers, who despite having the capability to repay the bills have withheld the payment deliberately, would be targeted, said Cesu Senior General Manager Manoj Singh on Tuesday.

Singh reiterated the Cesu’s resolve to start the disconnection drive from January 16, 2020 and said, “413 squads have been formed to carry out this exercise in nine districts under the jurisdiction of Cesu. The squads will move in their assigned route and disconnect the power supply of defaulting consumers.”

“Reports that thousands of villages will go dark are untrue as only the identified defaulting consumers will lose power supply,” he added.

Notably, Cesu Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Arun Bothra had announced the decision on December 10, 2019 and provided the deadline of January 15, 2020 for the defaulting consumers to clear their dues.

However, the Opposition BJP and Congress attacked the Government terming the Cesu’s drive unconstitutional.

BJP State general secretary Lekhasri Samantsinhar said “The data given by the State Government in the Assembly revealed that power distribution companies (discoms) operating in the State owed a whopping Rs 7,657 crore to Grid Corporation of Odisha Limited (Gridco). However, it is unfortunate that the Cesu is going to force 11, 397 villages into darkness for defaulting payments.”

Congress MLA Suresh Routray said, “We have requested Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and the Energy Minister not to interrupt examination preparations of students by disconnecting power supply. If the Government interferes in their study, we will not tolerate it and give a befitting reply by launching a massive protest,” Routray said.

“If the Government is concerned about the pending bills, it should collect the dues from the industrialists first,” he added.

Samajwadi Party State president Rabi Behera demanded the Chief Minister’s intervention to roll back the decision. Behera, in a letter to the CM, said people should be given time till March 31 to pay their pending dues.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/commercial-consumers-to-be-targeted-in-1st-phase.html

105,15-1-20,Doon audience divided between Chhapaak and Tanhaji,"Two recently released Hindi movies - Chhapaak starring Deepika Padukone and Tanhaji starring Ajay Devgn elicited varied reactions from the viewers in Dehradun. Most of them preferred the Devgn starrer to the movie starring Padukone.

For some people, the selection of the movie was also influenced by the current political scenario.

“I always watch Deepika Padukone’s movies but after her PR stunt to support one side of the protesters in JNU, I chose Tanhaji. You cannot use something as sensitive as JNU violence to promote your movies. Besides, Tanhaji is a must watch,” said college student Chandan Bharti. Some people just want to watch good cinema. “I watched Tanhaji first day first show and then I watched Chhapaak. Both the films are based on totally different subjects and both are incredible.

Of course, Chhapaak is more emotionally draining than Tanhaji and that’s why I watched Tanhaji first,” said Divya Chaturvedi. “Though I am a big Ajay Devgn fan, I wanted to see Chhapaak as there is no Hindi film as far as I remember that explored the subject of acid-attack victims. There have been documentaries and short films but no mainstream movie. It’s a good film,” said Ekta Kumari after watching the film.

Another admirer of the film Sudhanshu Kohli added, “I have heard and seen a lot about the struggle of acid attack victims but Chhapaak really brings you close to the subject and makes you think about it.”Another movie goer Anshu Kothiyal said, “I wanted to watch Tanhaji for Saif Ali Khan.

His character is so dark and yet so charismatic. I liked his acting in Tanhaji.” Priyanka Mishra, a medical student stated, “Chhapaak gives you a firsthand experience of how an acid-attack victim is humiliated again and again by society instead of being supported and empathised with.” Adding to her friend’s statement, Geeta Kumari said, “There are unnecessary controversies surrounding the movie.

The movie is a beautiful tale of a beautiful girl who is brave, fearless and strong.

Why can’t people just watch the movie if they want to and stop judging it without even watching it?”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/doon-audience-divided-between-chhapaak-and-tanhaji.html
106,15-1-20,‘Cocktail’ party at RIMS: Ploy to tarnish Director’s image?,"A set of doctors, facing heat from the Director of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for practicing in private, had deliberately spread rumours about consumption of liquor at a New Year party in the premiere medical institute in a bid to tarnish the image of the institute’s Director Dr. DK Singh, RIMS faculty members said on Tuesday.

Rumours about liquor being served and consumed at a New Year party in the administrative building of the hospital had hogged media attention lately. Some pictures of the party also surfaced on social media, with captions slamming the administration for violating rules.

“The news was planted. It was a deliberate attempt to tarnish the image of the Director in a bid to get him ousted from the top position in the medical college,” said a doctor, who had attended the party. “Dr. DK Singh has tightened the noose around such doctors who practice in private. They want him (Singh) to land in soup, so their private practice continues unabated,” he added.

Singh rubbished the allegations of liquor being served at the party, and seconded the aforementioned faculty member.

“The allegations are baseless. Some people cannot handle discipline and action against their corrupt practices. They are trying to tarnish the image of the institute to get away with their practice of seeing patients in private and making extra bucks,” said Singh.

In the past one week, RIMS administration has found itself in the crosshairs of media, social activists and health professionals. A picture of a woman patient eating raw pigeon in the hospital also did the rounds on the internet. “The doctors who are facing heat from the Director are repeatedly trying to come up with some or the other reason to question his efficiency and credibility,” said another RIMS faculty member who did not wish to be named.

Singh’s ways of ensuring discipline among doctors has not gone down well with many senior doctors here. Many of them threatened to take mass voluntary retirement last year citing his alleged dictatorial rules as a reason.

The doctors were been asked to report at 9 am and work till 5 pm – a decision that made the doctors see red. The hospital’s administration also shot showcause notices to doctors who practiced in private.

Lately, the RIMS administration conducted raids at establishments where the doctors ran private practice – a development that has left many doctors complaining. Singh had also warned the doctors that if they are caught practicing in private, they might have to lose their job.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---cocktail----party-at-rims--ploy-to-tarnish-director---s-image-.html
107,15-1-20,Power cuts hit life,"Power failure has affected many areas of the State capital, including the VIP localities such as Kanke Road, in the past few days. However, the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) has denied any major lapses in the supply system, claiming that the power supply was obstructed only on Tuesday due to maintenance in Hatia Grid 2.

“The Hatia Grid 2 was under maintenance from morning till 5pm on Tuesday. This affected power supply in areas such as Kanke Road and some other localities,” said MP Yadav, Public Relations Officer of JBVNL. “No major lapses were reported in the past one week. Isolated glitches may have causes power failure in some localities,” he added.

However, there was a striking contrast between the JBVNL’s take on power supply situation and the reactions of Ranchi-ites. “There was no electricity supply for several hours on Friday and Saturday. Our area suffered from a power failure from around 9am till 2pm,” said Rekha Tripathi, a resident of Jawaharnagar in Ranchi.

Poor electricity supply also haunted residents of Upper Bazaar – the commercial hub of Ranchi – in the past one week or so. Many residents and shopkeepers in the area had to rely on generators and invertors as hours of power crisis, mostly during the day, disrupted life. “There was no power supply from 7am to 11.30am today (Tuesday). The problem is becoming bad to worse by the day,” said Subhash Kumar, a resident of Upper Bazaar.

Other busy residential areas such as Ratu Road, Morhabadi, Harmu and Ashok Nagar also faced major power crisis on Tuesday, residents said. Vaibhav Vishal Singh, a city-based professional who stays at Ashok Nagar, said that intermittent electricity supply has forced him and his parents to rely on generators even during the day. “Such poor electricity supply is not acceptable at any cost,” he said.

Power failures also affected many residential areas during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. Residents of Kanke Road, Morhabadi, Idalhatu, Harmu, Ratu Road and parts of Argora had to suffer in absence of electricity in the night. Usually, power failures hit the city during summers due to the additional burden of air conditioners. The untimely and unexpected power crisis during winter has become a cause for concern among residents here.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/power-cuts-hit-life.html
108,15-1-20,Winter rain hikes vegetable prices,"The price of vegetables has increased in the State as per the vegetable vendors. Winter rain in early January has caused such inflation due to which the vendors are facing trouble. The downpour has brought supply crunch across the market. Vegetable prices are heating up and are weighing high on customers’ wallet.

The commonly used vegetables such as potato is being sold at Rs 25- 30/ kg as per market rate, which was Rs 10-15/ kg last year during the same period. As far as the price of onion is concerned it is Rs 50/kg as per now which was Rs 120 few days back.

“Rains in early January in Jharkhand and elsewhere have affected the prices of cabbage, tomatoes and radish. Edible oils and Pulses are also affected by the price. Customers are buying half the quantity than the regular purchase,” said Mehmood, a vegetable vendor.

“The price of vegetables has gone high and it is quite difficult for us to increase the sale. We cultivated these veggies in our village in Pithoria. As per now the price of cabbage is Rs 30/kg, Radish Rs 10/ kg,” said Chandranath Sahu, a vegetable vendor near Nagababa Khatal.

“Vegetables such as carrot, cauliflower and cabbage are Rs 30/kg, Rs 40/kg and Rs 30/kg respectively, which is comparatively higher than the last year. It is quite difficult to manage with overall budget of the family,” said Neelema, customer at the vegetable shop.

“Leafy vegetables such as lettuce, parsley, celery, basil, are Rs 300 - 500 per kg and are exported and hence costly. Other than this capsicum and peas are attaining a height of Rs 50 and Rs 40 respectively,” said Arvind Oraon, retail owner of vegetable shop.

According to the traders, early vegetables got damaged due to rains. As the prices of most of the vegetables are high, consumption has not yet gone down.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/winter-rain-hikes-vegetable-prices.html

110,15-1-20,City girl crowned best makeup artist at Golden Wings Award,"Ranchiites are making their mark all over the world be it in the films, fashion industry, social work or any other profession. One such example is of city based 32- year old Priyanka Jaiswal, who has won accolades for her work as a makeup artist.

Jaiswal was adjudged as the Best Makeup Artist at Golden Wings Award on January 5 in New Delhi while competing with about 40 other participants.

“I was asked to recreate Deepika Padukone’s wedding look on my model in a time span of two hours. Right from doing her makeup to setting her hair and draping her outfit, what generally takes three to four hours, had to be done in almost half the time. The judgment was on the basis of how close one is in recreating the actual look,” said the beautician.

Starting her career as a city based makeup artist in December 2017, Jaiwal- a freelance beautician in a short span has dolled up about 300 women so far. She charges something between Rs 3,000 to Rs 15,000 for bridal and party wear makeup.

From her younger days Jaiswal has always been a very creative person and would love to play dress up. She even did a diploma course in beauty science from Vedaansh School of Art and School in Ranchi after her 10th boards.

“While I was growing up, women in my family would not use too much makeup owing to their healthy and flawless skin. But from the beginning I always wanted to wear makeup when going out and also did a course in beauty science just for myself. I had very thought of making a profession out of it, that just happened by chance,” recalls the makeup artist.

Always focusing on academics, there was also a point when Jaiswal was keen to take the UPSC exams and had also worked as a teacher in local playschool for a couple of years. But destiny had something else in store for her.

“While chatting with a school friend, I just happened to mention preparing for competitive exams which not just shocked her but also made me realize that my potential lies in something else,” said Jaiswal.

Jaiswal then did a basic to advanced course from Babli Jaiswal in Kolkata followed by a master class from Amit Kumar, a renowned makeup and hairstylist based in Delhi. She has attended a transformation tour master class under Goar Avetisyan from Moscow in Delhi.

“Even before I started doing it professionally I would always look up to Meenaksho Dutta in Nagpur and follow her You Tube tutorials. Recently, I got an opportunity to attend her master class and it was nothing less than a dream come true for me,” said an ecstatic Jaiswal.

Born and brought up in Ranchi, Jaiswal is a resident of Ratu Road and did her schooling from Bishop Westcott Girls School and later from Cambrian Public School. She holds a post graduate degree in Masters in Commerce with Accounts honours from Doranda College.

“Juggling between my professions and managing my family is definitely a challenge. Being a freelance makeup artist, my work makes a travel to nearby places. I make it a point to spend time with my husband and daughter as much as possible. It was my husband who pushed me to start my own business and both my mother and mother in- law are immensely supportive,” she added. Her husband Abhishek Prasad is in a private job in Ranchi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-girl-crowned-best-makeup-artist-at-golden-wings-award.html

112,15-1-20,Sisodia: BJP will stop AAP freebies if it wins,"Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the BJP over economic slowdown and retail inflation, which is at a five-and-a-half-year high, saying that each vote cast for the saffron party in the Delhi polls will be for inflation.

Sisodia said a vote for the BJP will mean a vote for expensive electricity, education, health and public transport. ""The BJP is a party that will make everything expensive if voted to power. They will stop all the free welfare schemes introduced by AAP Government and impose huge financial burdens on the people of Delhi,"" he said.

He said that mismanagement of the economy has made it difficult for people to run their households and the only relief is provided to them by the AAP Government's welfare schemes.

Quoting figures released by NSSO on inflation, he said people are worrying not just from the perspective of economic slowdown or unemployment but because it has become difficult for the common man to sustain even basic household expenses. ""This is BJP's gift to people in the last 6 years. Prices of essential commodities have been constantly rising since the BJP came to power as inflation increased from 2.1 per cent to 7.4 per cent in just one year and the prices of vegetables increased by 60 per cent across the nation in just one year,"" he added.

He further said that even in the face of these troubling statistics, BJP leaders are busy making statements which are akin to applying salt to wounds. ""On the one hand, the Delhi Government is sustaining people's lives by subsidizing electricity, public transport, school fees and health services without which they would have found it difficult to survive and on the other hand, BJP has been proclaiming that all these facilities shouldn't be given for free and that they are against subsidies,"" he added.

Sisodia said ""BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma said that if the BJP comes to power in Delhi, they will stop all subsidies. I want to ask the BJP- what exactly is their problem? Kejriwal's Government is doing all to provide relief to people. We will keep continuing subsidy after coming back to power,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sisodia--bjp-will-stop-aap-freebies-if-it-wins.html

Irfan Ansari has exposed his political culture by making petty remarks on a personal level. He said that Irfan Ansari also comes from a party, which has been known to do politics of appeasement. Earlier, Irfan Ansari has also made unwarranted allegations against nationalist ideological organizations like RSS to appease minority votes.

Pratul said that it seems that Irfan Ansari has started to understand himself less as an MLA and more as a spokesman for Bangladeshi infiltrators. He said that politics has its place, but when you make a poor and low level personal accusation on the Prime Minister of the country, it becomes clear that either your mental state is not good or you are deliberately doing it for appeasement. “This time, he has crossed all limits. Actually, Irfan Ansari makes such statements to please a few contractors of religion. The Congress high command has not shied away from this statement of Irfan Ansari and has shown his right face to the public,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ansari-considers-himself-spokesperson-of-bangaldeshi-infiltrators--shahdeo.html
118,15-1-20,JVM merger likely with BJP after Jan 16,"The final decision on Babulal Marandi’s party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) merger with BJP will be taken after January 16, once Marandi returns the State Capital. Marandi after coming back will first constitute the dissolved State working committee electing new office bearers and members.

Sources said that the constituting of new working committee will gain importance as majority of new members elected on the consent of Marandi, will back his decision to merge party with BJP. Sources said that once party working committee decides to go with party chief Marandi’s decision to merge with BJP, merger will automatically occur even though party MLAs are opposed to working committee decision.

A senior JVM (P) leader requesting anonymity said, “Once working committee decides to merge the party with the consent of Marandi there will be no obstructions. The second stage is merger of party in House. If any two MLAs either Pardeep Yadav or Bandhu Tirkey decides to go with Marandi the merger of party in House too will be done smoothly, however, if two MLAs decides to go against than also Marandi will go ahead with the decision and will announce to quit the membership of House.”

The JVM leader’s statement assumes importance, as in 2006, Marandi resigned from both Kodarma (Lok Sabha constituency) seat and the primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party in 2006 floating Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (P).

Sources said that if two MLAs decide to go against Marandi’s views as anti-party activist the two MLAs will dismissed from party and these two will act as independent MLAs.

Sources said that Marandi is very much interested to join BJP after he came to know that two of these MLAs (Yadav and Tirkey) were planning to join Congress. Both Yadav and Tirkey have openly opposed the merger of JVM with BJP. Few days back, Tirkey had said that he will never join BJP as his politics revolves around opposing BJP and will never join BJP at any cost.

Sources said that it will be win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats. The JVM (P) in the just concluded Assembly election won Dhanwar, Poraiyahat and Mandar seats, but in later two seats personnel charisma of candidate was more important than the party which they belong.

Marandi is a former RSS leader who resigned from his job as a teacher to work for the organisation. In 2000, he became the first chief minister of newly created State of Jharkhand. But, he had to resign in 2003 and Arjun Munda became the chief minister. In 2006, Marandi formed his own party and since then he has been trying to find a base in the State.

In 2009, his party won eleven Assembly seats, which were reduced to eight in 2014. In 2019, his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm-merger-likely-with-bjp-after-jan-16.html

125,15-1-20,Cong sees larger conspiracy behind Davinder arrest,"In the wake of arrest of Jammu & Kashmir DSP Davinder Singh, Congress on Tuesday stated that question will certainly be raised as to who were the real culprits behind the gruesome Pulwama incident and which now needs a fresh look on it.

“There is a larger conspiracy behind Davinder Singh's arrest. We demand the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to order a thorough probe,” Congress said. The party said now, the question will arise who were the real culprits behind the Pulwama attack. The terror strike in Jammu & Kashmir's Pulwama had left 40 CRPF personnel dead on February 14 last year.

The Opposition party claimed that Singh “cannot be a stand alone carrier”, with the Congress' leader in LoK Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, saying the question will now arise who were the real culprits behind the last year Pulwama attack.

Taking a swipe at the RSS, Chowdhury said had police officer Davinder Singh been “Davinder Khan”, the reaction of the “troll regiment of the RSS” would have been different.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “There is a larger conspiracy. At whose instance was Davinder Singh acting and bringing terrorists to Delhi, as reported.” “Are there any people who are in the echelons of power who are involved with him (Singh). Is there a larger conspiracy? Is he only a pawn or a carrier in the larger conspiracy that is unleashed?” he asked.

Police on Saturday had arrested Singh, a deputy superintendent of police, at Mir Bazar in Jammu & Kashmir's Kulgam district, along with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Baba and Altaf, besides an unidentified lawyer who was working as an overground worker for terror outfits.

Surjewala said these are questions that Prime Minister and the Home Minister need to answer, as Davinder Singh “cannot be a stand alone carrier”.

He also asked who Singh was, who was he linked to and what connection he has with the Hizbul Mujahideen and other terrorist groups. “I find this story preposterous and I find his explanation a hogwash,” he said.

“For how long has he been acting as a conduit for J&K terrorists and other terror factories? Was Davinder Singh connected to the 2001 Parliament attack. What is Davinder Singh's connection with the Pulwama attack, where he was posted as DSP, and 42 of our soldiers lost their lives,” the Congress leader asked.

“What is this conspiracy is what the nation wants to know,” Surjewala asked, alleging that Singh was the same officer who was posted in Pulwama when the attack happened. He also asked as to where did the RDX in Pulwama attack come from?",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-sees-larger-conspiracy-behind-davinder-arrest.html
126,15-1-20,"CBI files FIR against 17 individuals, companies","The CBI has booked 17 individuals and companies, including three Mumbai-based senior Customs officials, for allegedly being part of a trade-based money laundering racket using over-invoiced import of diamonds worth more than Rs 156 crore.

The case was referred to the CBI after a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence probe found alleged involvement of Customs officials in the conspiracy, according to the FIR.

The DRI probe had alleged that Hong Kong-based businessman Girish Kadel had imported rough diamonds from Switzerland to Hong Kong in the name of his four companies.

Kadel, who had business interests in India, had exported some of these diamonds to India through 14 consignments in the name of two companies Antique Exim Pvt Ltd and Tanman Jewels showing over-invoiced value of Rs 156.28 crore.

The DRI had found during revaluation that actual value of the consignment was Rs 1.03 crore instead of falsely declared value of Rs 156.28 crore, they said.

The CBI has alleged that Kadel used Import Export Codes (IECs) of Antique Exim Private Ltd and Tanman Jewels through his aide Atul Paldecha for siphoning off the money outside India through import of overvalued diamonds, details the FIR registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau of CBI in Mumbai.

Rough diamonds were imported at “highly exaggerated value” to siphon off excess foreign exchange overseas to cover the differential cost of other imports and park money abroad for unlawful activities. It is alleged that the then Commissioner APSC Mumbai, Vinay Brij Singh, influenced subordinate officers to give favourable report, the FIR alleged.

The agency has alleged that Singh ordered investigation into the matter and after a few days called a subordinate deputy commissioner to write new noting and destroyed the note sheet and changed his earlier directions of further investigation, it said.

The agency has booked Singh, Deputy Commissioners Chandravanshi Y Manikanhaiya and Ashiquzzaman along with Kadel, Paldecha, Antique Exim, Tanman Jewels, Impress Clearing and Forwarding Pvt Ltd, among others.

“This illegal attempt was made possible with the abetment of Vinay Brij Singh, the then Commissioner, Chandravanshi Y Manikanhaiya, and Deputy Commissioner Ashiquzzaman, Deputy Commissioner, all officers of Custims Mumbai,” the FIR alleged.

The agency has booked the accused persons and entities under Indian Penal Code Sections relating to criminal conspiracy, cheating and forging documents and presenting them as genuine besides relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-files-fir-against-17-individuals--companies.html

Speaking at an event on the Armed Forces Veterans Day here, he said the proposed special pension will be like Swantantra Senani Samman Pension Scheme. Naravane also said the proposal in this regards is with the Defence Ministry.

The need for this pension was felt as the Emergency and SSC officers do not get pensions as they served and retired much before completing pensionable service.

There are nearly 2,000 such officers and given their role during those two wars, the Army Commanders Conference last year discussed this issue. A proposal to grant them Rs 30,000 monthly pension was then mooted.

The proposal was with the Defence Ministry since March last year and it sought some clarifications, sources said.

Meanwhile, addressing the veterans on Tuesday the Army chief also said veterans, “Veer Naris” and their wards are an inseparable part of the Indian Army and assured veterans that the force will continue to make efforts towards their welfare. He said the National War Memorial dedicated to the Armed Forces by the countrymen was a tribute to their sacrifices.

Underlining some measures taken for the veterans last year, Naravane said

Army welfare placement organisation was successful in helping retired 240 officers, 11,500 JCOs and other ranks (ORs) in getting a job.

The Army Chief also said a proposal was with the Defence Ministry under which 20 per cent more vacancies for JCOs for the honorary commission will be approved.

Participating in the event, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh asked veterans to use their respect in society to counter incorrect perceptions about the services on social media.

The recipient of the medal was another officer with the same name, it said.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) Singh was arrested on Saturday in Kulgam district's Mir Bazar while he was ferrying the two terrorists — Naveed Baba and Altaf — in a car. A lawyer, who was working as overground worker for terror outfits, was also in the vehicle.

Some media reports have claimed that Singh was awarded the police medal for meritorious services on Independence Day last year.

137,15-1-20,BJP slams AIADMK for poor law and order in TN,"nPongal Celebrations began in right earnest in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday as allies AIADMK and the BJP clashed over the law and order situation in the State. Former Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan, who is also the former Tamil Nadu BJP chief lambasted the Edappadi Palaniswami Government for its lackadaisical attitude towards extremist elements operating from the State while D Jayakumar, Tamil Nadu Minister for fisheries, ‘returned the compliments’ in a vehement manner.

The AIADMK-BJP ties are at a low ebb following the Dravidian party aligning with the DMK and derailing the possibilities of the Hindutwa party’s hopes of winning the Rajakkamangalam Panchayat union where the BJP was the single largest party. The murder of Wilson, a special branch inspector of Tamil Nadu Police came in handy for the BJP leader as he blamed the State Government for the gruesome act.

“We have been warning the State Government for the last five years that Tamil Nadu has become a safe haven for terrorists and extremists. Islamic terrorists and Maoist extremists have made Tamil Nadu their safe home and operate from the State with impunity. The murder of Wilson is due to the indifference of the State administration towards the warnings by central agencies,” said Radhakrishnan, who was defeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Kanyakumari.

Inspector Wilson of the Tamil Nadu Special Branch Police was shot dead allegedly by Islamic terrorists on Wednesday night at Kaliyikkavila, a border point between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The images captured from CCTV cameras have helped the police to identify the perpetrators who escaped since then to Kerala. Though some suspects with close contacts have been taken into custody by the Tamil Nadu Police, no breakthrough has been made till now as the murderers are believed to have reached safe havens.

“The Central Government itself has said that the law and order situation in Tamil Nadu is good. The National Crime Records Bureau too has stated in its annual report that Tamil Nadu is very safe. We do not know what is bothering Radhakrishnan,” said Jayakumar while speaking to reporters on Tuesday. He said Radhakrishnan’s outbursts could be due to frustration arising out of not being considered for any position by the Centre. The Tamil Nadu minister also pointed out that the State has not received any favours from the Center other than what was due to it.

The AIADMK-BJP ties has not done any good for both the parties, if the past records are any indication. Barring the 1998 alliance for the Lok Sabha election, the parties could not register any wins in the subsequent elections to the assembly and parliament.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-slams-aiadmk-for-poor-law-and-order-in-tn.html

141,15-1-20,Need to break tradition of not condoling infant deaths: Pilot,"In a jibe at Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot over the Kota hospital row, his deputy Sachin Pilot on Tuesday said the tradition of not condoling the deaths of children should be broken.

Deputy Chief Minister Pilot did not name Gehlot but he appeared to be referring to the CM's reported remarks recently that there was “no tradition” to condole infant deaths.

The remarks reflect a continuing rift between the two leaders, both of whom had sought the CM's post after the Congress won the Assembly polls in 2019.

Pilot had visited Kota, where over 100 infants died at J K Lon Hospital in December, and blamed his own Government for being not sensitive enough to the deaths.

Gehlot, however, has not visited Kota.

“We talk about changing the wrong tradition. We talk about avoiding 'ghoonghat', which is a good thing, but at the same time if there is no tradition to wipe tears of those who lost their children then that tradition should also be broken,” Pilot told reporters.

“God forbid, children should not die...There is no programme to mourn deaths of children but it is the responsibility of all of us to wipe tears of grieving parents...We all should collectively discharge this responsibility,” he added.

His remarks has come after the Women and Child Development Department launched a campaign against the practice of “ghoonghat” on a call given by Gehlot, who had said in November that it was high time that the practice be shunned so that women could progress.

Responding to criticism by Pilot, Gehlot had earlier said it was his right to question the government.

“Pilot is the Pradesh Congress Committee president. It is his right to say this about the government. It is not the opposition only, which could ask questions. People from the government could also ask questions,” Gehlot had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/need-to-break-tradition-of-not-condoling-infant-deaths--pilot.html

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said this after perusing a note received on October 16, 2019 from Justice (retd) Radhakrishnan expressing “some difficulty in continuing as the chairman of the committee in question”.

The bench said according to the note placed before it by advocate Gaurav Agarwal, who is assisting the top court as an amicus curiae in the matter, former secretary of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways S Sundar has found it difficult to continue as a member of the committee due to ill-health.

“In the circumstances, we consider it appropriate to pass the following orders: Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre, former judge of this court, will be appointed as the chairman of the aforesaid Committee on Road Safety. Justice K S P Radhakrishnan, former judge of this court, will be relieved of responsibility of chairing the aforesaid committee,” the bench, also comprising justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said.

“S Sundar, former secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, will be relieved of his membership of the aforesaid committee.

155,15-1-20,Yogi dubs protests a conspiracy aided by Opp,"The countrywide anti-CAA protests are a “conspiracy” hatched from afar by those resentful of a united and grand India and these are being aided by a “crooked” opposition, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleged here on Tuesday.

Addressing a rally organized by the BJP in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was passed less than two months ago, the firebrand BJP leader charged that those opposing the legislation were committing the “paap” (sin) of working against national interests.

Sushil Kumar Modi (Bihar Deputy CM) and Sanjay Jaiswal (state BJP chief) have very well articulated how the CAA is about granting citizenship to persecuted refugees and not about taking it away from anybody, he said.

“For taking such a step, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah deserve acclaim. Instead they are being attacked”, Yogi lamented.

“Protests are taking place across the country and a ‘kutil’ (crooked) opposition is adding fuel to the fire. But the people of the country need to understand that it is a conspiracy hatched from afar.

“The strings are being pulled by those who are resentful of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ (united India, grand India) which is becoming a reality under Modi”, he claimed.

Seeking to underscore that the Modi government did not discriminate against people on the basis of their religious identity, Yogi asked so many people have benefitted from the welfare schemes like Ujjwala Yojana and the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

“Was anybody asked, before being included as a beneficiary, as to what is his or her religion or caste?”, he remarked. But those feeling threatened by the new India keep looking for an opportunity to thwart Modis efforts to build Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat, he said.

“This new India does not cower, like the Congress did, before Pakistans atomic power.

“The neighboring country is today fearful that it may end up losing even the PoK, after the Article 370, which Jawaharlal Nehru wrongly introduced, was abrogated”, the UP CM said evoking wild applause.

The monk-turned-politician, who also heads the Gorakhnath Temple, began his speech recalling his spiritual ancestors deep links with Gaya and the ancient links between eastern UP and this central Bihar town pointing out that Lord Buddha came from Kapilavastu situated in Siddharthnagar district in the adjoining state and attained Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yogi-dubs-protests-a-conspiracy-aided-by-opp.html

157,15-1-20,Cops enter Guj Vidyapith campus holding anti-CAA kite-flying event,"Police entered the Gujarat Vidyapith (GV) campus in Ahmedabad on Tuesday where students had organised an event to fly kites bearing anti-citizenship law messages.

While students claimed that police disrupted the event, a senior officer said they entered the campus as part of “routine patrolling” on inputs that some members of rival student outfits, NSUI and ABVP, might confront each other over flying of anti-CAA kites.

Some students of the varsity said a group of police personnel entered the campus, located on Ashram Road in the city, while they were preparing to celebrate the Uttarayan Festival by flying kites with messages like “India Against CAA”, “No NPR, No NCR”.

They claimed that police personnel also demanded their identity cards.When confronted by us, the police personnel told us they had the right to enter the campus without taking anyone’s permission, claimed some students in video clips shared with media persons.

“They stopped us and asked us to show identity cards. If required, I would show my I-card to the varsity guard, but why to policemen when we are already inside the campus? They didn’t tell us who allowed them to enter the campus,” an agitated student said.

The students had organised the kite-flying event with anti-CAA messages printed on them to express solidarity with their counterparts in the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi.

While police had allegedly entered the JMI during anti-citizenship law protests in December, JNU had witnessed violence by masked people on January 5.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cops-enter-guj-vidyapith-campus-holding-anti-caa-kite-flying-event.html
158,15-1-20,PETA seeks strict action against ‘fox jallikattu',"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals India Chapter has written to the Tamil Nadu Government seeking strict action against organisers of a 'jallikattu' type of event using a rare breed of foxes in Salem district.

PETA India Chapter CEO Manilal Valliyate said they have sought preventive measures against conduct of the event, popularly known as 'vanganari jallikattu'.

“We have also approached them last year and this year too we have written to them. We seek strict penal action against the organisers and participants of such events which is illegal,” he told PTI.

The Salem district forest administration has stepped up awareness campaigns not to use the rare 'Wanga' breed of foxes, according to officials.

These foxes are tied using ropes and chased across the streets by the villagers on 'Kaanum Pongal', the last day of the annual harvest festival, on the lines of the popular bull taming sport jallikattu.

The foxes are illegally captured using wild traps and their mouths gagged, he said.

He said the event was held in places like Chinnamanicken palayam, Gopalapuram, Kottavadi, Mathur, Melavaram, Periyakrishnapuram and Rengar in Salem district during the Pongal harvest festivities.

According to him, the Indian fox (Vulpesbengalensis) and red fox (Vulpesvulpes, Vulpesvulpesmontana, Vulpesvulpesgriffithi and Vulpesvulpespusilla) are found in Tamil Nadu and are protected under the Part II of the Schedule II of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the hunting of foxes and Section 2(16) refers not only to killing or poisoning an wild animal but also “capturing”, he said.

“It is the same people who conduct such events every year... It is a superstitious belief among villagers that the fox will bring something good for them.We need strong action against these people. These are highly protected species and the offenders should be punished,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/peta-seeks-strict-action-against----fox-jallikattu-.html
159,15-1-20,Kerala first to move SC challenging Act,"The CPI(M)-led Kerala became the first State to challenge the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in the Supreme Court and sought that it be declared as violative of the basic structure — principle of equality, freedom and secularism.

The Kerala Assembly was also the first in the country to pass a resolution against the Act.

The CAA, which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian — who migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.

The Kerala Government has said in its suit that there is no rationale in grouping together the three countries —Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh— for the purpose of the CAA and rules and orders.

“Such grouping is not founded on any rationale principle justifying a separate special treatment for the irrationally chosen class of religious minorities facing persecution on the basis of religion therein,” it said.

The Kerala Government has sought from the apex court that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 be declared as violative of Articles 14 (Equality before law), 21 (Right to life and personal liberty) and 25 (Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion).

It also said that CAA is violative of the basic principle of secularism enshrined in the Constitution.

Besides, the plea has stated that the Passport (Entry to India) Amendment Rules, 2015 and Foreigners (Amendment) Order are ultra vires the Constitution and be declared void.

It said the CAA, the amended Passport Rules and Foreign Order are class legislations harping on the religious identity of an individual, thereby contravening the principles of secularism, which has been recognised by the court as a basic structure of the Constitution.

The suit claimed that these amendments make religion and a person’s country of origin a criteria for grant of citizenship and result in classifications based on religion and country, which are discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable and have no rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved.

“The religious classification brought forth violates the twin test of classification under Article 14, the protection of which is not limited or restricted to citizens alone and extends to all persons,” it said.

The plea added that the CAA and rules and orders are bereft of any standard principle or norm in discriminating migrants from other countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan, which are sharing international borders with India and to which and from which there has been trans-border migration.

It said if the object of the CAA is to protect the minorities who faced religious persecution in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, then the Ahmaddiyas and Shias from these countries are also entitled to treatment equal to that being now extended to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities.

“In accordance with the mandate of Article 256 of the Constitution, the plaintiff state (Kerala) will be compelled to ensure compliance of Impugned Amendment Act (CAA) and the Rules and Orders, which are manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational and violative of fundamental rights.

“Thus, there exists a dispute, involving questions of law and fact, between the plaintiff state of Kerala and the defendant Union of India, regarding the enforcement of legal rights as a State and as well for the enforcement of the fundamental, statutory constitutional and other legal rights of the inhabitants of the State of Kerala.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-first-to-move-sc-challenging-act.html

162,15-1-20,Mamata: CAA ploy to give citizenship to those who funded BJP,"Lashing out at the BJP for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), West Bengal Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday alleged it is a “ploy” to take away citizenship from those who hold it legally and give it to foreigners who have funded the saffron party.

Banerjee, who is a strident critic of the BJP and has opposed the contentious piece of legislation from the beginning, said those helping the party get foreign funds and turn black money into white are being given citizenship.

“Is this Act a ploy to take away the citizenship of those legal citizens and giving it to those foreigners who have funded the BJP ?” she said speaking from the dharna manch of the Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad, her party’s student wing against the CAA, here.

Apparently referring to the killing of Bengali labourers at Kulgam in Kashmir by terrorists in October 2019, the TMC supremo said the people of other states face no threats and are safe in Bengal.

She hit out at the BJP saying, “Do they (BJP) have any understanding with Pakistan or are they brand ambassadors of Pakistan”.

“We know how to respect our guests, we even show courtsey to our enemies, but that doesn’t mean our party leaders won’t be allowed to enter Jammu, Guhawati and JNU,” Banerjee said seemingly referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Kolkata and the turning away of TMC delegations from various places.

164,15-1-20,Cong asks PM to convene Opp meeting on inflation,"The Congress on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convene a meeting of Opposition leaders and tell them about the Government’s roadmap to contain inflation which is an all time high after the UPA left the power in 2014.

The Congress accused Modi of indulging in politics of hatred and division, and urged him to focus on the development of the country. “We demand that the PM should come forward and convene a meeting of all parties and present a roadmap for tackling prices of essential commodities in the next 30 or 60 days,” said Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala at AICC press conference.

The party also questioned Modi's silence over the “unprecedented” increase in prices of food items, saying this has hit the common man.

Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi said rising prices of essential commodities and unemployment have thrown the country into a state of “financial emergency”.

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram attacked the government over the state of the economy, saying if unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is a danger of youth and students “exploding in anger”.

“The nation is engrossed with the anti-CAA, anti-NPR protests. Both present a clear and present danger,” Chidambaram said. The sliding economy is an even greater threat to the country, the former finance minister said in a series of tweets.

“If unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is the danger of youth and students exploding in anger,” he said.

Chidambaram also attacked the Government over the rising consumer price index (CPI) inflation. ""The circle of incompetent management is complete. Mr Narendra Modi's Government started in July 2014 with CPI inflation at 7.39 per cent. In December 2019, it was 7.35 per cent,” Chidambaram said.

“Food inflation stands at 14.12 per cent. Vegetable prices are up 60 per cent. Onion prices are over Rs 100 per kg. This is the 'achhe din' promised by the BJP,” he said.

While Rahul accused the Prime Minister of “snatching away” the poor man's bread and “breaking into pieces” the domestic budget of Indians, Priyanka accused the

Government of picking pockets of the common man and also taking away their livelihood.

“The prices of vegetables and other edible commodities is getting out of reach of the common man. What will the poor eat when vegetables, oil, pulses and flour turns expensive. The poor are not even getting employment due to the economic recession. The BJP government has not just picked the pockets of the poor but also kicked on their stomach,” Priyanka said.

“Back-breaking inflation, life-threatening unemployment and falling GDP has created a state of 'financial emergency'. Rise in prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oil, LPG gas and other food items has snatched away the poor's bread and butter. Modi ji has broken the domestic budgets of countrymen into pieces,” Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-asks-pm-to-convene-opp-meeting-on-inflation.html

168,15-1-20,ED detects multiple FEMA violations in Amrapali case,"The ED has detected over half-a-dozen alleged forex law violations by the Amrapali Group and found that homebuyers’ funds worth over Rs 55 crore were laundered and sent abroad using shell firms, official sources said on Tuesday.

The federal probe agency also wants that JP Morgan, a US-based investment banking firm, embroiled in the case be legally “directed” to remit back funds worth about Rs 140 crore that were “unauthorisedly” sent abroad so that they can be confiscated, they said.

At least seven “serious contraventions” under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and its regulations have been detected by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the Amrapali Group’s two companies — Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt Ltd (AZDPL) and Amrapali Silicon City Pvt Ltd (ASCPL), according to the sources.

The alleged forex violations pertain to an unauthorised assured return of Rs 85 crore to the foreign investor under FDI (foreign direct investment), wrong-end use of FDI funds worth Rs 78.5 crore, unauthorised borrowings in the guise of FDI worth Rs 85 crore, wrong transfer of shares by AZDPL by the foreign investor to two Indian companies and illegal remittance by the Indian companies, among others.

The ED also found that the discounted cash flow (DCF) method (of valuing a project, company, or asset) deployed by the promoters of the firm was a “deliberate ploy” to falsely justify premium on re-purchase of shares when it did not exist.

It was detected, as per probe records accessed by PTI, that the DCF method was “incorrectly applied” in this case and was “without any basis”. ED’s Lucknow Zone Joint Director Rajeshwar Singh had on Monday apprised the Supreme Court about these facts and the progress made in the case. After this, the court asked the agency to ensure that the guilty are brought to book.

According to the sources, the ED has recently filed FEMA complaints for adjudication against AZDPL and ASCPL, before the competent authority of the case (a special director of the ED).

Apart from seeking a hefty penalty for the accused, it has sought directions to JP Morgan to remit back funds worth about Rs 140 crore so that they can be “confiscated” under the said law. The probe records also said the Amrapali directors allegedly created shell companies and appointed dummy directors “in collusion” with JP Morgan and took away Rs 55 crore of the homebuyers’ money.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ed-detects-multiple-fema-violations-in-amrapali-case.html
169,15-1-20,Budget may offer flat tax rate sans exemptions to individuals also,"The Government is considering a proposal to extend further incentives to salaried taxpayers in the upcoming budget. The Finance Ministry may allow individual taxpayers to pay a lower flat rate of tax if they forego all exemptions.

The new structure would be similar to tax rates proposed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman late last year where the base corporate tax rate was reduced to 22 per cent from 30 per cent for companies that agreed to forgo all exemptions and incentives. The tax was kept at even lower rate of 15 per cent for new manufacturing companies.

“After tax sops for corporates last year, the Government is looking at ways to incentivise the individual taxpayers that form a major source of revenue for the Centre. While major changes in tax slabs could wait for some time, a scheme similar to the one implemented for the corporate sector is being examined for individuals too,” said a source privy to discussions on the issue in the Government.

At present while individual income upto Rs 2.5 lakh per annum is exempt from tax, a 5 per cent tax is levied for income between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh. A higher 20 per cent slab is for income between Rs 5 lakh and 10 lakh while a 30 per tax rate is applicable for income above Rs 10 lakh. In addition, the Government also levies a surcharge in slabs on super rich for income above Rs 50 lakh.

The source said though there is broad understanding on implementing a flat income tax rate for individuals, discussions is still going on its quantum and how it could fit a tax structure that has three to four different slabs.

Tax experts who did not want to be named on the issue told IANS that the Government could look at a flat rate somewhere in between the 5 and 30 per cent income tax rates.

The ideal would be around 15-18 per cent rate that would be lower than the peak rate of 30 per cent and the second rate of 20 per cent. Also, the new lower flat rate of tax may be applicable only for annual income of upto Rs 50 lakh.

Sources said that a higher flat rate is also being looked at for the super rich but discussions on this have remained inconclusive.

At present, an individual can save upto Rs 1.5 lakh per annum under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act by making investments in insurance plans and few other specified instruments including buying a pension plan run under the NPS.

An additional self contribution (up to Rs 50,000) under section 80CCD (1B) is available as NPS tax benefit. In addition, there are deductions for contributing towards paying premium for health insurance and for paying installment for homes bought on loans.

While the flat rate of tax may be attractive to a certain category of taxpayers that want a higher share of their monthly earnings in hand, experts say the move could also dissuade people from increasing their contributions towards savings. India’s household savings has dropped to 17.2 per cent level in 2017-18 from 23.6 per cent in 2011-12. Data for FY 19 is not available.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is also the chairman of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), will launch the erection of the first girder of this project at the Shewri end of the MTHL at 10 am on Wednesday. The girder weighs 1000 metric tonnes and lifting capacity of launching girder is 1400 metric tonnes.

The project involves construction of a 22 km six-lane bridge with three lanes on either side of the bridge. An approximate 16.5 km of the bridge will be in sea while 5.5 kms is on land. In other words, it will be at least 16.5 km long creek bridge with 5.5km via ducts on land on either side.

The MTHL will cut down the travel time from the Island City to Navi Mumbai by 30 minutes. The sea bridge will be 27 meters in width, in addition to edge strip and crash barrier.

This bridge will have two interchanges at Shivaji Nagar in Shweri and another at village Chirle near national highway 4B.

Apart from de-congesting the Island city of Mumbai, the MTHL will provide connectivity to Mumbai and JNPT ports and afford quicker access to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.

The MTHL will also connect Mumbai to the Nhava Sheva Port, the Pune Expressway and the Goa Highway. It will provide connectivity to commuters traveling towards Thane-Nashik, Navi Mumbai, Panvel-Pune and further to southern India.

Japan is a partner in the mega-project with a commitment of Rs 90 billion or nearly 80 percent of the estimated project cost of Rs 14,260 crore, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

The MMRDA appointed internationally reputed project management consultants in December 2016. The project is being awarded in 3 packages and is being executed by three contractors with one intelligent transport system since March 23, 2018. “Till date about 19 percent financial progress is achieved,” a senior MMRDA official said.

The work of piling and pier construction is in progress along with construction of /temporary bridge with casting of segments. The state-run MMRDA has set up a casting yard and constructed temporary jetties for movement of equipment needed for construction.

176,15-1-20,Report: Retail inflation may force RBI to hold rates,"Retail inflation, which accelerated to 7.35 per cent in December and could breach 8 per cent in January, may force the Reserve Bank of India to hold rates in the monetary policy review next month, according to a report.

Consumer price index-based inflation in December rose to about five-and-a-half year high of 7.35 per cent from 5.54 per cent in November, mainly driven by high vegetable prices.

It breached the upper end of the RBI’s comfort level of 4 per cent plus-minus 2 percentage points.

“RBI did not cut the rate in December when October 2019 inflation rate was 4.62 per cent. Now that CPI inflation has surged to 7.35 per cent in December and January inflation is also expected to remain above 8 per cent, the RBI is likely to hold rate in the next policy,” an SBI research report Ecowrap said.

The RBI, which mainly factors in the CPI based inflation, is scheduled to announce its next bi-monthly monetary policy on February 6. After cutting repo rates for five consecutive times by 135 basis points between February-October 2019, the RBI left the repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent in the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy announced in December.

The report also emphasised on relooking of the CSO data methodology for estimating the CPI. “Unfortunately, CSO methodology of using CES survey data has resulted in CPI being overstated by 200 bps. Its high time we question the CSO methodology of CPI estimation as it results in erroneous policy decisions,” it added.

The report said inflation is expected to remain high in the remaining months of this fiscal year, close to 7 per cent thus averaging to 5 per cent for FY20. “We believe that the RBI will go for a long pause possibly throughout 2020 as inflation is likely to remain above 6 per cent till June-July 2020,” it noted.

Given the situation of low growth and high inflation (a possible situation of stagflation), the coming months are crucial for the RBI to decide on any action at rate front, the research report said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/report--retail-inflation-may-force-rbi-to-hold-rates.html

Its revenue from operations grew 2.7 per cent to Rs 15,470.5 crore during the period under review from Rs 15,059.5 crore in the same quarter last year (as per Ind-AS). Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was Rs 4.3 per share and grew 3.2 per cent year-on-year.

Wipro’s IT services segment revenue was at USD 2,094.8 million in the December quarter, a sequential growth of 2.2 per cent. This is in line with its outlook of USD 2,065 million to USD 2,106 million guided earlier.

“We have delivered a good quarter with secular growth across all business units, geographies and practices. We remain focused on deepening our customer relationships, converting our funnel and winning large deals,” Wipro CEO and Managing Director Abidali Z Neemuchwala said.

He added in financial services, Wipro saw a slowdown in growth rates due to continued softness driven by the macro-economic environment. “We however remain confident on winning the new deals that we are participating in leveraging our strong capabilities in digital,” he said.

Neemuchwala said “the overall demand environment has neither improved nor deteriorated, but we see some level of uncertainty due to the various geo political risks at play”.

While the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) segment has seen some softness, Wipro remains confident of the deal pipeline. The company added 4 accounts to over USD 100 million accounts.

The company has seen strong growth in the digital business. Contribution from Digital now stands at 39.8 per cent, up 22.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

178,15-1-20,Govt needs to pump economy to arrest slowdown: Ficci,"New Ficci President Sangita Reddy on Tuesday urged the Government not to worry too much about the fiscal deficit and try to pump the economy by increasing investments to arrest slowdown and accelerate growth.

“We need to infuse capital into the economy. The fact is that there is a slowdown of the GDP but to pump prime economy, adequate capital is really the need of the hour and therefore the preposition which we put forward is that we should not worry for a small expansion in fiscal deficit,” she said.

She said the Government should find a mechanism to infuse Rs 1.5 to Rs 2 lakh crore into the economy as it would help spurring consumption.

With the slowdown in economic growth, the government will face difficulty in adhering to the fiscal deficit road map laid down in the FRBM Act.”With the increased consumption or purchasing power of people, investments and the overall sentiment of the corporate India will improve and this will create a virtuous cycle, which grows the GDP,” she told PTI. When asked whether the government has enough fiscal space to infuse money into the system, Reddy said the government has the space because the fiscal deficit is still under control. “One mechanism to do this would be to raise money from the RBI,” she said, adding the government should also simultaneously pursue disinvestment programme in a time-bound manner.

Airtel has joined hands with Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson and Nokia for 5G trials in the country, while Jio has partnered Samsung, sources said.

Vodafone Idea has also filed its application for 5G trials and the company has partnered Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson and Nokia for the same, the sources added.

E-mails sent to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea remained unanswered.

Last month, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said the government will allocate airwaves to all telecom service providers for conducting trials of super-fast speed 5G network. India will not bar any equipment suppliers in the upcoming trials for 5G.

The stance had spelt relief for Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei, which rivals western equipment makers such as Ericsson and is facing curbs in the US.

Many countries, however, have allowed telecom service providers to use Chinese gears. Now, India has also indicated its unwillingness to keep any company out of 5G trials.

Huawei India CEO Jay Chen had earlier stated the company firmly believes that only technology innovations and high-quality networks will be the key to rejuvenating Indian telecom industry.

""We have our full confidence in the Modi government to drive 5G in India. We have our full confidence in Indian government and industry to partner with best technology for India's own long-term benefit and also for cross-industry development,"" Chen had recently said.

The 435-member House of Representatives, where Democrats enjoy a majority, last month charged Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanours” and impeached in vote that was based on bitter political divide.

Now, the 100-member Senate, where the Republicans are in majority, needs to put Trump on trial before he can be removed from the White House.

After holding it on for weeks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to send its impeachment to the Senate sometime this week and that could be as early as Tuesday. The impeachment in the Senate is unlikely to pass through given that GOP has majority in the 100-member Senate.

Top Republican Senator John Cornyn, who is also Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, on Monday told reporters that the Senate is likely to start the impeachment trial next Tuesday, January 21.

“Tuesday (January 21) is what it’s feeling like,” he said.

“We’d actually be glued to our chair starting Tuesday, I think,” he said in response to a question.

According to Cornyn, after House sends its articles of impeachment, the Senate will likely take a few days to deal with logistics of the trial.

Prominent among these include Chief Justice John Roberts and all Senators and sending summons to Trump’s team.

184,15-1-20,5K camels culled in drought-hit Oz,"Helicopter-borne marksmen killed more than 5,000 camels in a five-day cull of feral herds that were threatening indigenous communities in drought-stricken areas of southern Australia, officials said Tuesday.

Aboriginal leaders in South Australia state said extremely large herds of the non-native camels had been driven towards rural communities by drought and extreme heat, threatening scarce food and drinking water, damaging infrastructure, and creating a dangerous hazard for drivers.

The cull in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands — home to about 2,300 indigenous people in the arid northwest of South Australia — ended on Sunday, said APY general manager Richard King.

“We appreciate the concerns of animal rights activists, but there is significant misinformation about the realities of life for non-native feral animals, in what is among the most arid and remote places on Earth,” King said in a statement on Tuesday. “As custodians of the land, we need to deal with an introduced pest in a way that protects valuable water supplies for communities and puts the lives of everyone, including our young children, the elderly, and native flora and fauna first.” King said weakened camels frequently became stuck and died in water holes, contaminating water sources needed by locals and native animals and birds. “The prolonged dry period, while not difficult for native wildlife, leads to extreme distress for feral camels,” he said.

APY officials said the operation had removed more than 5,000 camels.

The cull came as Australia experienced its hottest and driest year on record in 2019, with the severe drought causing some towns to run out of water and fuelling deadly bushfires that have devastated the country’s southeast. Camels were first introduced to Australia in the 1840s to aid in the exploration of the continent’s vast interior, with up to 20,000 imported from India in the six decades that followed.

Australia is now thought to have the largest wild camel population in the world, with official estimates suggesting more than one million are roaming the country’s inland deserts.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/5k-camels-culled-in-drought-hit-oz.html
185,15-1-20,Personalise learning,"It is critical to use relevant tools in teaching through technology as it helps to address a wide range of learners making it more effective, says Prodipta Hore

Teachers work in and outside the classroom: preparing lesson plans, delivering content, creating assignments, grading, monitoring work, etc. Many teachers plan and execute their lessons and assignments professionally, successfully, and energetically. But sometimes, there aren't enough hours in the day or week to ensure that each student gets personalised instruction he/she needs to move to the next level.

If students are given some choices about the content that is being taught, then they feel valued and gain a real sense of connection with the instructor. This when followed by assessments that are goal oriented, actionable and geared mindfully towards developing skills, strengthens students’ approaches towards learning by creating relevant connection between the task and themselves. Mining students’ experiences can bring personal insights to any discussion that hasn’t been thought about. This makes learning truly personal and enriching. It is also noticed, if learning is placed directly into the students’ hands, then they try to craft challenges from real problems to real solutions using ‘Inquiry Based Learning.’

The most effective, and most fun is the concept of peer teaching for the ‘pull-out’ groups. Students are put in charge of their own learning and development lessons which they teach one another. The options are wide open as to how to deliver the information. The flip classroom concept, though it sounds crazy, the students love it when they are incharge. Not only does it develop their communication, leadership and instructive skills but also helps them improve understanding and comprehension. This process makes it interesting for students and they get excited to ask questions and solve doubts, making it truly meaningful. Children should be deemed as producers of knowledge rather than consumers of knowledge. They are not receptacles into which we pour in facts and data from a funnel. Helping them create and value their own experiences engages them and gives them responsibility for their own learning.

Educators must have heard this question from students very often; ‘When will I ever use this in the real world?’ And honestly, teachers should spend more time thinking about this and give a tweak to our lessons to give satisfaction to their students. Thus, relevant and meaningful activities that both engage students emotionally and connect with what they already know are what help build neural connections and long term memory storage. In the world of technology, it is critical to use relevant tools. Teaching through the usage of technology helps to address a wide range of learners and becomes very effective since it offers students the chance to connect to instruction through the tools and networks they find familiar and reassuring. Students require advanced skills that require collaboration with both physical and virtual worlds. Learning becomes more personalised when we give our students lots of room to be their creative selves and use media that speaks to their interest and abilities.

In order to make learning more meaningful we can incorporate real life and relatable examples into our teaching pedagogy. Teachers from various levels of experience and subject backgrounds can collaborate personally or virtually bringing fresh ideas and insights, which often become very effective. There is a quote - ‘Information without emotion is rarely retained’. Not only does it make learning more enjoyable, but also makes it more memorable.

187,15-1-20,‘Need to adapt to changing times’,"Education 4.0 is a response to industry’s needs and places student at the centre of the higher education ecosystem, says Siddharth Maheshwari

The remarkable growth of technology has for a while enthralled the world. Big data, analytics and artificial intelligence are the tiny facets that are leading to what the world refers to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution — Industry 4.0. What this revolution will entail is autonomous systems that will analyse data on their own with minimum human involvement. A solution-centric system that will ensure highly efficient manufacturing and industry processes in addition to collating information synchronically.

Effect of industrial revolution 4.0 appears to be wide reaching and reflecting in the advances taking place in various sectors, one of which is education. In a globally connected world, there are newer trends with Education 4.0 that will involve the best of both worlds in learning — traditional classroom teaching with digitised learning.The student will be placed at the very centre of the learning ecosystem where the role of the teacher will be limited to that of a facilitator.

This is a remarkable shift from Education 1.0, now a largely defunct model where the teacher-oriented classrooms followed a pedantic format of instruction. Information flowed in the form of textbooks and class notes where students wereabsorbing information but very rarely volunteering or contributing to the sources.

Change in workflow process in industries resulted in the transition from Education 1.0 to Education 2.0. As businesses introduced new ways of performing tasks — by involving employees and consumers in engagement processes, not limited for the top management — the arena of Education witnessed something similar. The interactions between students and teachers increased, forming a more creative and connected education space with networking, cooperative learning and global learning projects.

With the advent of Education 3.0 — the kind majorly practised today — there are cross-cultural opportunities in learning where the students play a pivotal role in contributing and building a strong knowledge base. Education is flexible and much reliable on the internet and open source platforms, information flows in all directions, and there is an increased use of virtual spaces.

Education 4.0 is a response to Industry 4.0 and now places the student at the centre of the higher education ecosystem. As students are becoming aware and exposed to a more connected world than ever, it’s imperative to develop a solid digital channel of communication for engaging them, understanding their learning needs and building their trust. This is where the importance of visual and textual content comes into play, by way of online study materials, student blogs, webinars, virtual sessions and personal contact programmes. With a secure and active internet connection, the students no longer relies only on notes or textbooks.

Students can get access to an improved and constantly dynamic information which is cost-effective and affordable for everyone. The internet is benefitting not just the learners but the teachers as well, who can impart information through the use of slides, images and animation.

Even as the future looks bright with Education 4.0, it can be deemed a success only when there is an overhaul of the stale system and both learner and facilitator adapt to changing teaching methodologies.

While many major universities have adjusted with changing times and are inculcating the changes into the curriculum, there are many educators who are apprehensive about this new format, and continue to follow age-old systems in teaching.

In essence, the future will favour those who are ready to welcome the newer technologies with open hearts.

188,15-1-20,"Under pressure, Iran makes first arrests over airliner downing","Iran announced on Tuesday its first arrests over the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner last week, as it struggles to contain the fallout from the disaster that sparked three days of protests.

The Ukraine International Airlines plane was brought down by a missile shortly after takeoff on Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board.

Iran has come under mounting international pressure to ensure its investigation into the tragedy is full and transparent.

The authorities’ handling of the air disaster has also angered some Iranians. Videos posted online Monday purported to show hundreds of protesters taking to the streets for a third consecutive night, apparently shouting slogans against the Islamic republic.

Protesters chanted “Death to dictator” on Sunday, Fars news agency reported, a rare move for a country where media usually refer to demonstrators as “rioters” and refrain from publishing such slogans.

The protests have been much smaller than nationwide demonstrations against fuel price hikes that turned deadly in November.

Tehran for days denied Western claims based on US intelligence that the Boeing 737 had been downed by a missile.

It came clean on Saturday when Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh acknowledged a missile operator had mistaken the plane for a cruise missile and opened fire independently.

At a televised news conference, the judiciary announced the first arrests had been made over the calamitous blunder, without specifying how many.

“Extensive investigations have been carried out and some people have been arrested,” said spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili. The announcement came shortly after President Hassan Rouhani said everyone responsible for the disaster must be punished. “For our people it is very important in this incident that anyone who was at fault or negligent at any level” face justice, Rouhani said.

“Anyone who should be punished must be punished.

“The judiciary must form a special court with a high-ranking judge and dozens of experts... The whole world will be watching,” Rouhani said.

“It cannot be that only the person who pressed the button is at fault. There are others, and I want this to be explained to the people explicitly.”

The Kiev-bound plane was shot down at a time when Iran’s armed forces were on heightened alert after launching a volley of missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/under-pressure--iran-makes-first-arrests-over-airliner-downing.html
189,15-1-20,Iran grants Canada investigators access to downed plane,"Canadian investigators flying to Tehran on Monday will access the wreckage and black boxes from a Ukranian jetliner downed by a missile strike last week, officials said.

“We don’t fully know what the scope of our investigation will be,” Transportation Safety Board (TSB) chair Kathy Fox told a press conference.

However, she added, “there have been early signs that Iran is allowing the TSB to play a more active role than is normally permitted.”

Two Canadian investigators were to land in Tehran within hours, followed by two more in the coming days or weeks.

They have been invited by Iran, which is leading the crash probe, to participate in the downloading and analysis of the aircraft’s cockpit voice and data recorders. They will also be allowed to visit the crash site and the wreckage of the plane that is being reassembled in a nearby hanger. “We do know what has happened. What we don’t know is why it happened,” Fox commented before listing off questions surrounding the crash that still need to be answered.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-grants-canada-investigators-access-to-downed-plane.html
190,15-1-20,US warns vessels transiting Gulf amid tensions with Iran,"The United States on Tuesday warned of threats to commercial vessels in and around the Persian Gulf in the wake of its confrontation with Iran.

Tensions have soared since the U.S. Airstrike earlier this month that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and the architect of its regional military activities. Iran responded by firing ballistic missiles at U.S. Troops in Iraq, without wounding anyone, and accidentally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner near Tehran, killing all 176 on board.

“Heightened military activity and increased political tensions in this region continue to pose serious threats to commercial vessels,” the U.S. Said in a maritime warning. “Associated with these threats is a potential for miscalculation or misidentification that could lead to aggressive actions.” It said vessels transiting the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz — through which one-third of all oil traded by sea passes — could encounter GPS interference or communications jamming.

It said some vessels have reported communications from “unknown entities falsely claiming to be U.S. Or coalition warships.” It said ships contacted by Iranian forces should identify themselves and say that they are proceeding in accordance with international law.

It advised ships to refuse to allow Iranian forces to board but not to forcibly resist them, and to immediately contact the U.S. Fifth Fleet.

Iran was accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the Persian Gulf last year. It denied those allegations, but acknowledged seizing a British-flagged oil tanker in response to the impounding of an Iranian oil tanker by authorities in Gibraltar. The Iranian tanker was suspected of intending to violate sanctions to deliver oil to Syria, a close ally of Iran. Both ships were released weeks later.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-warns-vessels-transiting-gulf-amid-tensions-with-iran.html
191,15-1-20,Melbourne’s air ‘worst in world’,"The air quality in Melbourne deteriorated to the “worst in the world” on Tuesday as smoke from the massive bushfires engulfed Australia’s second biggest city with authorities issuing health warnings advising people to stay indoors and take precautionary measures.

The raging Australian bushfires, one of the worst in its history, has killed at least 26 people, burned over 10 million hectares of land, destroyed over 2,000 homes and pushed many species towards extinction. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast rains through the week, bringing some relief to the bushfire affected communities and the firefighters. According to report in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), widespread rainfall is expected for the east coast of the country, including the firegrounds, starting Tuesday and lasting into the weekend.

The air quality went down overnight to “hazardous” due to bushfire smoke as the smoke from Victoria state engulfed it. 16 fires were still burning and 1.4 million hectares have been destroyed across Victoria.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/melbourne---s-air----worst-in-world---.html
192,15-1-20,Iraqis worry US-Iran tensions are eclipsing their protests,"Young Iraqis who drove mass protests demanding sweeping political reforms are worried that the conflict between the US and Iran, which is playing out in part on Iraqi soil, is killing their momentum.

Even before the US drone attack that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the 4-month-old protests against government corruption, poor services and rising Iranian influence in state affairs were beset by internal divisions.

A violent security crackdown heightened tensions, leading to hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries as well as targeted killings of sympathisers.

And in the stormy aftermath of the US drone strike that also killed top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, avoiding another war in Iraq became a top priority for state officials as they scrambled to contain hostilities between Washington and Tehran.

“We are afraid that the uprising is being forgotten and (officials) are focusing on things we don’t want, not our main goals,” said Noor, an activist in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square who asked to be identified only by her first name, fearing reprisal, like all other protesters interviewed for this story.

“On the other hand, we are trying to be calm and keep people on the street to make the point that we are not with the Americans or the Iranians. We are with Iraq.”

There are hopeful signs as Iran and the US appeared to back down — at least in the short term — after Tehran retaliated for Soleimani’s killing by firing missiles at two Iraqi bases housing American troops. No one was seriously injured and Iran was unexpectedly forced to shift gears to manage the fallout from its accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner filled with Iranians.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iraqis-worry-us-iran-tensions-are-eclipsing-their-protests.html
193,15-1-20,Tens of thousands face uncertainty as Philippine volcano spews lava,": Taal volcano in the Philippines could spew lava and ash for weeks, authorities warned on Tuesday, leaving tens of thousands in limbo after they fled their homes fearing a massive eruption.

The crater of the volcano exploded to life with towering clouds of ash and jets of red-hot lava on Sunday, forcing those living around the mountain south of Manila to rush to safety. Many people abandoned livestock and pets as well as homes full of belongings after authorities sounded an alert warning that an “explosive eruption” could come imminently.

“We left everything apart from what we’re wearing,” said Robert Cadiz, a 47-year-old fisherman among some 30,000 who took refuge in shelters. “We were terrified.” Gerald Aseoche, 30, who left with his four young children and a few possessions, has missed work to stay with them as the volcano belches out lava and earthquakes tied to the eruption rattle the region. “I am hoping this won’t go on too long because I will lose my job if I can’t report to work immediately,” Aseoche, a house painter, told AFP at an evacuation centre.

194,15-1-20,Time running out for US-N Korea deal: Moon,"Time is running out for Washington and Pyongyang to reach a deal on North Korea’s nuclear weapons, the South’s President Moon Jae-in - who brokered their talks - warned Tuesday.

Moon has long championed engagement with Pyongyang and used the South’s 2018 Winter Olympics to build a diplomatic rapprochement that climaxed with a landmark summit between Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore.

But negotiations have been deadlocked since a second summit collapsed in Hanoi last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.

Pyongyang has since ended its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and says it will not return to talks unless Washington first meets all its demands in full.

It has also suspended virtually all inter-Korean cooperation and said it has nothing to talk about with Seoul.

“It is clear there is a lull in talks,” Moon acknowledged in his annual New Year press conference. “Since a prolonged lull in dialogue can set back the situation, it is not desirable.” The two sides do not have “much time to spare”, he added.

“Once a full-scale presidential race begins, it may not be easy for the US to make time for talks with North Korea.” Despite the stand-off, he insisted further discussions were still possible, saying the North is “leaving the door to dialogue open”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/time-running-out-for-us-n-korea-deal--moon.html
195,15-1-20,Look at numbers,"Marriage is a very important function in everybody’s life. If the planets of the boy and the girl are compatible, life becomes very smooth & comfortable and if they are not compatible then life will become hell, finally leading to divorce.

Marriage usually, in India happens once in lifetime. Therefore, the selection of partner should be made with utmost care. Following points should be kept in consideration while calculating the compatibility of boy and girl, who are going to get married.

Their name number should vibrate harmoniously and be friendly.

Their psychic number should vibrate harmoniously with each other and be friendly.

Their destiny number should vibrate harmoniously with each other and be friendly.

The date of marriage/engagement, which is finalised and selected should be friendly to the destiny number of the boy as well as of the girl.

After marriage, if the girl drops her surname and adopts boy’s surname, then again compatibility of name should be checked, whether still it is vibrating harmoniously with husband’s name or not.

In case, the change of name after marriage is anti to boy’s name number then girl name without dropping her surname and adding the surname of boy should be checked whether it is still vibrating harmoniously with husband's name or not. If still it is vibrating anti then it is better to keep her name, which was before marriage, which was compatible with the boy’s name.

The house number of the boy, where the girl is going to stay after marriage should also be harmoniously vibrate with her destiny number of girl.

The chronological age number of both boy and girl should also be matched with their destiny number at the time of marriage.

196,15-1-20,‘Right direction could lead to a great experience’,"Want to study abroad? One doesn’t need a counsellor but a mentor, says Abhishek Singhal

In order to go abroad, what you really need is an Internet connection. The colleges themselves have streamlined the admission process and boiled it down to a set of simple logical steps. Added to that, the effort of applying to many colleges has been reduced by the services like the Common App and UCAS whose aim is to help you with your application. If you have access to these, then you can successfully complete your college applications.

You are the one who knows yourself the best. No one else can fill out the application for you. It is a matter of effort, time, and some introspection. In principle, you can complete the application processes on your own, which in fact many candidates do.

In case you need assistance, it is a good idea to reach out to someone who has done the same thing successfully. A well-qualified senior can guide your decisions and applications from their own experience. Look for someone who has the exposure and the skills that you wish to develop in yourself, and someone who can join your pit crew of parents and teachers as a core team member. This mentor could help you:

To bring discipline into your efforts.

To collect the information and give it to you in a more curated form.

To build your profile with a personalised touch.

To help you streamline your efforts.

It is not an education counselor that you are looking for then, it is a mentor who can help you discover your talent and abilities.

The right direction could lead to a great experience in your education and future professional experiences. A mentor can guide you through the quagmire of choice, direction, and excessive information.

A mentor does not do the work for you, but helps you to help yourself. It could be anyone from your core circle, a parent, a teacher, or a guide. Your dedicated efforts, combined with some expert guidance would make for a winning combination. That, and a working internet connection!

Budget expectations for higher education

According to Asheesh Gupta, Pro VC JK Lakhmipat University some of the Budget expectations he sees are: Relaxation in GST rates on the inward services acquired by the higher education institutes like security, transport, mess, tentage, event management equipment on hire are at present attracts 18% GST which was nil under the previous regime of Service tax. These ancillary services are key for the growth and progress of education sector and the Institutions are not able to offset these taxes unlike companies. The available fund could be used by the universities for other academic activities.

Promotion of research in basic science and social science area should be the key focus area of Government and all infrastructure requirement for creating such research Centre the GST Rate should be made NIL from the present rate of 5% (under section 35(1)(iii) at least up to 2030.

Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities are having equal importance with academic activities for the overall growth and development of students for making them life ready. In this regard acquisition of sports equipment, music equipment, equipment related to Yoga, Gymnastic there should be relaxation of GST. Assessees having income or (loss) from business profession and gain should be allowed to get tax exemption on donating to higher education institutes for the promotion and growth of education and research under Section 80GGA of Direct tax.

“Most student scholarships provided by the government are applicable only in public higher education institutions. We need to rethink this aspect as the private sector comprises more than 70% of all higher education institutions and over 70% students study in private institutions. So, it is important that Government scholarships should not differentiate between Government and private institutions. A suitable criteria should be formulated, but made applicable for public and private institutions. In view of increasing role of private sector in providing higher education in India, Budget may look at provisions for opening other avenues of funding for faculty in private institutions,” Gupta said.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/in-brief-in-brief.html
198,15-1-20,Eye opener for india,"Australia gave India a harsh reality check with a 10-wicket hiding in the ODI series opener here on Tuesday, exposing the home team’s middle-order frailty and putting to sword its bowling.

Anticipating dew in the evening session, Aaron Finch opted to field. India ended up with a below-par 255 on a decent batting surface after a middle-order failure.

Australia made short work of the target, racing to a resounding victory in 37.4 overs with David Warner (128 not out off 112) and Finch (110 not out off 114) smashing unbeaten centuries, making the Indian attack look rather ordinary. They simply ran away with chase, sharing 30 boundaries and five sixes between them.

The manner of India’s defeat, which came after dominating limited overs series wins against West Indies and Sri Lanka, has left the hosts with plenty to ponder ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Friday.

India made some unmissable changes in their batting combination with Virat Kohli pushing himself down to number four to accommodate specialist openers Shikhar Dhawan (74 off 91) and K L Rahul (47 off 61) in the playing eleven.

Dhawan opened alongside Rohit Sharma while Rahul batted at three, disturbing the combination that India employed successfully after the World Cup in July.

With Kohli (16 off 14) dropping himself down the order, Shreyas Iyer (4), who had shown a lot of promise at number four in recent times, was demoted to five. The entire experiment failed miserably, raising plenty of questions.

Earlier, Dhawan hit a half-century before Australia pulled things back to bowl India out with five balls to spare.

Dhawan looked in great touch during his stay in the middle and in the company of Rahul, shared a second-wicket stand of 121 runs off 136 balls to set the base for India's total. However, India failed to capitalise.

Sent into bat, India were dealt an early blow when they lost Rohit, caught by Warner at mid-off off Mitchell Starc (3/56).

Rahul joined Dhawan at the crease and the duo played fluently without much trouble against a formidable Australian attack.

After adopting a cautious approach initially, Dhawan upped his ante and started to play his shots, while at the same time gave due respect to the good deliveries.

Dhawan showed his class and played all kinds of shots to register his fifty in 66 balls with a single off leg-spinner Adam Zampa (1/53) in the 20th over.

Soon after reaching his fifty, Dhawan got a reprieve when he was dropped by Warner at midwicket off Ashton Agar (1/56).

The two went about their business in style, picking up runs off bad balls before both departed in consecutive overs.

Just three short of his fifty, Rahul gave a straight forward catch to Steve Smith at covers off Agar and then, in the next over, Dhawan was caught by Agar off Pat Cummins (2/44).

While Rahul hit four boundaries during his 61-ball knock, Dhawan’s innings was laced with nine fours and one six.

Dropping himself to No. 4 to accommodate both Dhawan and Rahul in the side, Virat Kohli (16) was in attacking mode from the onset, but didn’t last long as Zampa took a sharp catch off his own bowling to dismiss the Indian skipper.

Iyer followed suit when Starc induced an edge an over later and Alex Carey did the rest behind the stumps.

Rishabh Pant (28) and Ravindra Jadeja (25) shared 49 runs for the sixth wicket before the duo perished in consecutive overs as India lost the plot.

Towards the end Kuldeep Yadav (17) and Mohammed Shami (10) struck some useful boundaries.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eye-opener-for-india.html

Pant is under observation at the moment and his progress will be tracked overnight. A specialist has been consulted and an update will be given accordingly,” the BCCI said in a statement.

With the Indian selectors yet to name the ODI and Test squads for the tour of New Zealand, all is still not lost for the 20-year-old Shaw.

He was in sparkling touch since returning from his eight-month doping ban, but a shoulder injury on the opening day of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy game against Karnataka cut short his run, ruling him out of India A’s two practice matches in New Zealand.

However, his net session has sent a positive signal.

“My favourite sound. The sound when the ball hits the middle of my bat. Superb net sessions going on,” Shaw tweeted alongside a video of the session.

He was seen driving, cutting and flicking with ease.

Shaw had hurt his left shoulder while trying to save an overthrow during Mumbai's the match against Karnataka at the Bandra Kurla Complex.

The International Cricket Council is all set to discuss the four-day Test proposal during its cricket committee meeting in March.

“Cricket committee and MCC World Cricket committee have recently discussed the issue and although they can see some benefits that four-day Test cricket could bring, both committees believe that Test cricket should continue to be played over five days,” said the MCC in a statement.

The feedback to the ICC’s proposal so far has been largely critical with top current and former players such as Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Ravi Shastri, Ricky Ponting Ian Botham, Steve Waugh and Virender Sehwag ridiculing the plan.

Sri Lankan great Mahela Jayawardene and reputed coach Mickey Arthur, who are on the ICC Cricket Committee headed by spin legend Anil Kumble, too want status quo in Test cricket.

202,15-1-20,Virat Kohli to rethink about batting at 4,"Virat Kohli’s decision to drop himself down to the number four position backfired in the series opener on Tuesday, prompting the Indian skipper to say that he might have to “rethink” his plans going into the second ODI in Rajkot.

India made some unmissable changes in their batting combination with Kohli pushing himself down the order to accommodate specialist openers Shikhar Dhawan (74 off 91) and K L Rahul (47 off 61) in the playing eleven.

Dhawan opened alongside Rohit Sharma while Rahul batted at three, disturbing the combination that India employed successfully after the World Cup in July, leading to a crushing 10-wicket loss at the hands of Australia.

“(On batting at 4) We’ve had this discussion many times in the past as well. Because of the way KL (Rahul) has been batting, we have tried to fit him in the batting line-up. But I don’t think it’s gone quite our way whenever I batted at four so probably will have to rethink about that one,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

“It’s about giving some guys opportunities. Every now and then, it's about putting people up there and testing them. People need to relax and not panic with one game. I am allowed to experiment a little bit and fail at times. Today was one of the days it didn't come off,” he added.

Australia gave India a harsh reality check, exposing the home team’s middle-order frailty and putting to sword its bowling.

Anticipating dew in the evening session, Aaron Finch opted to field. India ended up with a below-par 255 on a decent batting surface after a middle-order failure.

Australia made short work of the target, racing to a resounding victory in 37.4 overs with David Warner (128 not out off 112) and Finch (110 not out off 114) smashing unbeaten centuries.

“We were totally outplayed in all three departments. It’s a very strong Australian team and if you don’t play well enough they will hurt you and we saw that. With bat in hand I don’t think we had enough intent to go out there and takes risks, get those extra runs and put the bowlers under pressure.

“I think in phases we were too respectful of the bowlers. We didn't take the game by the scruff of its neck. Having said that it's another challenge for us to bounce back from here but today total credit has to go to Australia for the way they played,” said Kohli.

India skipper said that the ongoing three-match ODI series is an opportunity for youngsters to make a mark ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup later this year.

“International cricket is always priceless. Experience in any format helps you in other formats. You perform in any format you gain confidence for the other one. So it’s an opportunity for the younger lot in the middle-order to step up against world-class bowlers and make a mark.

“They have got two more opportunities so hopefully someone stands up and plays a blinder,” he said.

Australia skipper Aaron Finch beating India in India is always a special feeling.

“I thought the way we fought back in the middle overs with the ball had a huge part today. The way KL and Shikhar were batting, they could have gone to a much bigger score. Proud of how we fought back. Any time you beat India in India is a special feeling,” said Finch.

Man-of-the-match Warner said his hunger for runs is increasing by the day.

“I think I’ve always had the hunger and desire for runs. It’s just a great effort from our fast bowlers to knock India over for 255. We wanted to just protect the Powerplay. We got off to a flier, and we were very clinical in the end,”said Warner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat-kohli-to-rethink-about-batting-at-4.html
203,15-1-20,Data science to combat fraud activities,"Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2) at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi) organised a workshop on Combating Fraud Activities using Data Science (Co-FAD) on January 11, 2020 in their campus. It was a one-day colloquium studying the impact of fraudulent activities in social science, journalism, product reviews, forged imagery, cybercrime, and finance among others. The speakers for the workshop were some of the most influential people whose research is helping curb fake activities around the web.

The workshop commenced with a welcome note by the Director of IIIT Delhi, Prof Ranjan Bose. He left us with the thought that where there is money, there is fraud. All the talks that followed further emphasised this point. The director’s address was followed by an enlightening keynote by Dr PN Vasanti, director general of Centre for Media Studies.

“Major theme that we have trying to address is collusion in online media — a secret collaboration to deceive someone. These collusions can be propagated through a vast number of social media platforms and also happens on online review forums where people hire colluders to promote or demote certain products. We are trying to address these collusive activities and came up with a method to identify such collusion in product reviews,” says Prof Tanmoy Chakraborty, IIIT-Delhi, and convenor of the workshop.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/data-science-to-combat-fraud-activities.html

205,15-1-20,Don advisor’s cap,"Making a start-up successful goes much beyond acquiring funds. A financial advisor can help start-ups navigate the rough patch, says Nikesh Patadia

Each day witnesses numerous start-ups being created and also many other start-ups closing down. According to Worldwide Business Start-Ups report, globally around 137,000 new businesses are formed each day. But unfortunately a staggering 90% of those close down. And out of that, more than 40% have closed down because of running out of funds, even after getting an external funding!

Managing funds and creating a practical expansion plan with realistic goals, can be an extremely demanding and dynamic process, which has the potential to make or break a start-up. Making a start-up successful goes much beyond acquiring funds. Utilising the funds optimally and multiplying it to grow, within the stipulated time frame and the said direction, is what leads to success.

Companies that fail, do so not because of lack of funds but due to lack of vision and ability to strategize and handle internal pressures along with their finances. They are not able to get a holistic view of things. This is where a mentor comes into the picture. A mentor’s job is to first lead the company to a strategic growth plan to get funding and, then to effectively utilize the same to create a successful business. A mentor offers the quintessential external perspective on growth challenges and bottleneck which is very significant to ensure consistent growth. Listed here are five ways how an expert financial advisor can help start-ups to navigate the rough patch and emerge successful and rich!

Set long-term goals

Setting of a long term, quantified goal is the first step to effective growth and expansion. While setting a long term goal and having a vision is a common starting point for most start-up’s, they often fail to quantify the same, or worse, end up setting hypothetical or vague descriptions, often making the goal illusionary. With a mentor and a financial expert on board, there would be a detailed analysis of the growth trends since inception and the potential, before arriving at a realistic and quantified goal for growth, within a stipulated time frame. This not only ensures that the goals are achieved but also ensures long term vision is realised.

Agile approach

While long term planning would involving looking into a distant future covering over 8-10 years, an operational strategy that is agile and can accommodate any seasonal or temporary challenges is important. This helps to ensure entrepreneurs and start-ups can navigate through these challenges effectively without deviating too much from the original growth plan. With the volatile social-economic environment coupled with the immensely dynamic international market trends, innovations across industries and sectors as well as the changing shape of the global consumer, all are rapidly changing, demanding modern businesses adapt in time to keep pace. A funding expert understands the nerve of the movement and can identify the flow of money and possibilities, thus offering expert guidance to leverage the challenge.

Optimise resources

As in the marketplace, the home front too requires effective monitoring. From internal HR management to expenses on third party vendors and complementary services, all contribute to the number under the ‘debit’ tag of the balance sheet. Monitoring, optimising and budgeting these expenses can go a long way in generating profits at the end of the year. Entrepreneurs or start-up’s usually lack the bandwidth to look into the larger implications of these routine expenses and often an external insight from an expert can help realise the full gravity of the expenses and help optimise them.

Check liabilities/debts

As a start-up business, loans, and shoe string budgets with constant liabilities, is an expected phenomenon. Often, driven by the urge to grow fast or due to lack of judgement or vision, entrepreneurs and start-ups end up taking risks that push them deep into debts and unhealthy financial situations which may take years to be solved. As a financial expert and advisor, a mentor can help navigate these tricky challenges, and help draw out a plan which involves calculative risks with healthy balance of liabilities and debts.

Quarterly reviews

While long term plans and effective operational strategies are vital to chart a growth plan, regular business reviews are important to keep a check on the growth. Mostly, internal reviews are limited to performance of subordinates and staff members and financial reviews are put off till the end of the financial year, when a CA offers a profit outcome number along with potential room for growth in the next year. However, it is too late by then. A quarterly business and financial review by a mentor ensure not only that the business is growing at the pace and in the direction as desired, but it also allows for early identification of challenges and timely resolution with corrective measures, to arrest losses – something that can go a long way in ensuring success.

As in other sectors, the start-up and entrepreneurial sector in India is also undergoing massive transformation, thanks to global and national market trends, industry policies, and technology innovations. Under such scenarios, the need for a specialised consultation for business and finance, customised to meet the needs of start-up is increasingly becoming necessary. 2020 is set to see a dedicated effort in the direction, driving the growth of customised start-up consultancy as a service.

206,15-1-20,"‘Don’t give one word answers, be prepared’","In order to ace any interview it is important to follow certain dos and don’ts, says RENU MISHRA

Getting ready for an interview?An interview at any level — beginner, mid or senior — gives us butterflies in our tummy. A bit of anxiety is healthy and can even drive you to perform better. Let us deconstruct the word:

I- Interest in the profile and organisation

N- Negative attitude not acceptable

T- Thorough with the required knowledge for the post and expected questions

E- Excitement- the profile and job content should excited you

R- Research about the company interviewing you

V- Visually appear appropriate for the role as per company norms

I- Intent to be a productive employee

E- Etiquette which shows you are a team player

W- Winners confidence, which leads the organisation to believe, you will bring the same to the table once you are part of the company.

Things to do

Check the advertised profile- does your qualification and experience match it?

Research about the company. If you can bring up a researched statistic or positive, it shows your intent to be part of the organisation.

Decide what you want to wear as per their expectation. Organise your outfit a day in advance. A two-three button coat in a neutral shade — Navy blue can add to your visual appeal.

In a neat folder organise your relevant papers and extra resume.

Have a mock interview with the help of a friend or relative. A practised scene, makes you more relaxed.

Prepare one or two incidents which highlight your special abilities and skills. These can be woven into the interview easily, if they are on your finger tips.

Most interviewers say that within 90s seconds of the interview they have almost made up their mind about hiring someone. One has 90s seconds to make an impression.

During the interview

Be punctual and neatly groomed. No visible tattoos, stubble and no white socks too. Polish your shoes.

Switch off your phone, smile and have a firm handshake. If there are more than one person interviewing you, make eye contact with everyone. If eye contact makes you nervous, look at the top of their nose, you will appear to be making eye contact. Do not get intimidated by interviewers who are straight faced, over friendly or multi-taskers.

Have thorough subject knowledge and do not fake anything.

‘I know it’ are the three most dangerous words. Show that you are eager to learn.

Don’t give one word answers. It is good to make a note of one or two points, it shows you are keen to be part of the company.

Answer expected questions like ‘tell us about yourself’, ‘why should we hire you’, ‘your strengths and weakness’, with finesse. Remember you have practised them.

Subtle humour can be an asset but don’t make small of your past or current employers.

Ask questions but not about your salary till they bring it up. The interview process is as much about making sure the company is the right fit for you.

Do not get baited into a trap of negative or controversial topics.

Close on a positive note and walk out with the same confidence and body language with which you walked in.

After the interview

Follow up by sending a short ‘Thank you’ email by reiterating your interest in the profile and organisation.

If you do not hear from them do check back after a week to 10 days.

Acing an interview is an amalgamation of your interest, knowledge, and preparation, dressing for success, first impressions, communication skills and etiquette which help you achieve your goal.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---don---t-give-one-word-answers--be-prepared---.html
207,15-1-20,MindIT,"In today's world it is pertinent to keep a balance between highs and lows. We succumb to peer pressure due to family expectations, career or business goals and immediate gratification syndrome. During these times it is only your power of positive mindset &your thought process which can help you break the vicious cycle.

Studies have proved that benefits of positive thinking are vital keys for long term success.

Positive aura

If your mind thinks in a positive way; a positive aura surrounds your personality which makes you stand out from the crowd. People always interact & connect with pleasing personalities. This gives you the edge of ""Better first impression'. In turn this has a great impact in building future professional relationships and a flying career.

Positive thinking turns problems into opportunities. When you start perceiving problems as windows of learning, your problem turns into future opportunity. Students must train their minds to do this. If they are ready with solution the degree of failure reduces drastically. A positive mind helps them overcome fear, dejection, failure, depression, frustration and delinquency in career. It acts like a shock absorber and bounces them back with new energy.

Positive attitude

Positivity helps you cope more easily with the daily life affairs. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to shun worries and negativity. If you work happily and stay optimistic in every situation, you are more likely to succeed than if you feel that the work is a burden and that it will not yield any positive outcomes.

Staying optimistic, staying focused, and believing in oneself and in one's work is what counts even more than the actual job itself. If you believe that no matter how hard you try, you just can’t complete the task at hand, you will never realise success despite possessing the potentiality to do so. However, if you believe that the job at hand can be accomplished no matter what, you will succeed the job role demands notwithstanding.

Attract creativity and respect

Moreover, positivity attracts creative thinking. Since positive individuals don't view things as problems, they tend to find creative solutions to the obstacles that come up in their lives. Positivity will benefit you by bringing you more respect from others, and having more influence over other people. You may even find that individuals around you are starting to develop a positive attitude because positivity is something that is contagious.

Ways to inculcate positivity

Observe your thoughts: Closely monitor your thought pattern. Is your mind conditioned to negative thoughts? What is the percentage of negative thoughts over positive in a day? Follow it for a week and draw a trajectory. If the negative graph is higher- start meditating, start purposely thinking positive in negative situation. It might seem foolish to you in the beginning but over a period of two weeks your mind will switch mode and start thinking positively in natural way. Perform the same test again- positive graph will override.

Digital media transform a negative situation into a positive one: Pick up one situation everyday which is negative as per you. Hypothetically imagine or you may write, the ways you could have changed it.

Digital media start making gratitude list: Thank your blessings. Make a list of good thinks in your life. You will realise how blessed you are.

Optimistic individuals tend to be less stressed, have better relationships and do better at work. If you are constantly depressed, it's time you develop a positive outlook towards life.

210,15-1-20,"I feel like a kid again, says Bravo on WI comeback","The battle-hardened Dwayne Bravo, at 36, returns to the West Indies squad “feeling like a kid”, more than three years after playing his last international.

For Bravo, who fell out with his board following a bitter dispute over the then pay structure in 2014 leading to his eventual phasing out, the path back into international cricket was an arduous one.

The flamboyant all-rounder played his last match for West Indies in any format in September 2016.

“It’s a great feeling. I feel like a kid again when I first get a call from (West Indies’ chairman of selectors Roger Harper) that welcome back to the team and play international cricket and they were looking forward to have me back,” Bravo said in a radio interview with Trinidad’s ‘I955 FM’.

He is the oldest member in West Indies' T20 squad for the assignments against Ireland.

Bravo said he has been thinking about the Ireland series since coming out of retirement in December.

“It is something that was always on my mind since the change of leadership and stuff. So just happy I get the opportunity to represent the region again and I am looking forward to doing my best.”

Bravo announced his retirement from international cricket in October 2018 but continued playing franchise cricket.

Later, in December 2019, he came out of T20 International retirement to make himself available for selection in the lead up to the 2020 ICC men’s T20 World Cup, which will take place in October-November. He believes that West Indies lack a proper death-overs specialist and he could fill that void.

“Recently that is where West Indies did falter,” Bravo said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-feel-like-a-kid-again--says-bravo-on-wi-comeback.html

212,15-1-20,"Broadband, 2G Internet partially restored in JK, but ban on social media stays","The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Tuesday evening allowed mobile Internet in parts of Jammu region and broadband in establishments providing essential services, days after the Supreme Court ordered a review of the curbs imposed in the Union Territory.

The order comes into effect from January 15 and shall remain in force for seven days, a government communication said.

In a three-page order, the administration asked Internet service providers to offer broadband facility (with Mac binding) to all institutions dealing with essential services such as hospitals, banks and government offices.

In order to facilitate tourism, the broadband Internet services would be provided to hotels and tour and travel establishments, the order said.

Mac Binding essentially means to enforce a client machine to work from a particular Internet Protocol address.

""Prior to giving such facility, the service providers have been asked to install necessary firewalls and carry out white-listing of sites that would enable government websites and website dealing with essential services like e-banking,"" the order said.

However, all social media sites remain out of bounds.

""There shall be complete restrictions on social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private network applications for the time being,"" the order said.

The institutions and government offices that are being provided Internet access shall be responsible to prevent misuse, according to the order.

It said the 2G mobile connectivity on post-paid mobiles for accessing white-listed websites including e-banking will be allowed in districts of Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Udhampur and Reasi -- all in the Jammu region.

The order said that the police has brought material relating to the terror modules operating in Jammu and Kashmir including handlers from across the border who are attempting to aid and incite people by transmission of fake news and targeted messages through use of Internet.

The relaxation came days after the Supreme Court said access to the Internet is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.

The SC verdict had come on Friday on a batch of pleas challenging the curbs imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre's abrogation of provisions of Article 370 on August 5 last year.

The court had also asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to review within a week all orders imposing curbs in the Union Territory.

It had asked the J-K administration to restore Internet services in institutions such as hospitals and educational places providing essential services.

218,15-1-20,Mumbai pick three points from drawn game,"Mumbai dismissed Tamil Nadu for 324 to secure a 164-run first-innings lead and three points on the fourth and final day of their Ranji Trophy Group B match here on Tuesday.

The visitors, who made 488 in the first innings riding on captain Aditya Tare’s 154, enforced the follow-on and the match was called off with Tamil Nadu at 48 for one in 22 overs at the tea break.

For Mumbai, left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (4/72) was the best bowler while pacers Tushar Deshpande and Royston Dias had two scalps each.

The home team, which trailed by 239 runs overnight, continued to frustrate the Mumbai bowlers on a slow track as Ravichandran Ashwin (79) and R Sai Kishore (42) showed a lot of patience.

Ashwin had a stroke of luck too as Jay Bista, who took two very good catches on Monday, dropped him at leg-gully off Tushar Deshpande's bowling. The lanky off-spinner, who was on 33, made the most of the drop and went on to play attractive shots and also hit two big sixes off the spinners.

Mumbai’s toil ended when Sai Kishore was dismissed against the run of play. The southpaw was run out after he charged for a single and Ashwin did not respond. The throw found Kishore short of his crease.

Once the marathon eighth-wicket partnership, which yielded 105 runs, ended, Mumbai got the next two scalps rather easily.

While No. 10 K Vignesh was leg-before to Mulani, Ashwin was bowled by the same bowler while going for a big heave.

Armed with a first innings lead of 164 runs, Mumbai enforced follow-on.

Tamil Nadu lost the wicket of L Suryapprakash (18) before the match was called off.

Mumbai took their tally to nine points from four matches while Tamil Nadu were languishing at the bottom with two points from five games.

Mumbai coach Vinayak Samant told reporters after the game that there was a need for 'friendly' wickets to keep days cricket alive.

“488 is a very good score. Somehow the wicket is very slow. Anyway we got first innings lead. I am very happy,” he said.

Odisha secure fourth win

Rohtak: Odisha tailenders Basant Mohanty and Pappu Roy held their nerves to snatch a thrilling one-wicket victory over hosts Haryana in their Ranji Trophy fixture here on Tuesday.

Needing 32 runs to win with three wickets in hand on the final day, overnight batsmen Rajesh Dhuper (32) and Rajesh Mohanty (21) left the task unfinished as they departed three runs shy of the target.

But Odisha's number 11 batsman, Roy handled the pressure quire well and slammed Ashish Hooda for the winning boundary, sealing their fourth win from five matches.

Odisha (28 points) consolidate their position atop the group C standings.

Medium pacer Suryakant Pradhan, who returned a career-best match-haul of 11/122, was adjudged the man-of-the-match.

In the first innings, Pradhan's six-wicket haul restricted the hosts for a paltry 90 all out, while his five-for in the second essay ensured Odisha got to chase a small target of 179.

Pradhan also contributed with the bat (12 runs) amid Odisha's middle-order collapse, chasing the paltry target.

Andhra beat Hyderabad

Andhra Pradesh: Andhra crushed Hyderabad by an innings and 96 runs to register their third win in Group A of the Ranji Trophy here on Tuesday.

Resuming at the overnight score of 45 for three, Hyderabad were shot out for 168 in 74.4 overs in their second innings.

Skipper Tanmay Agarwal made 41, while Ravi Teja remained unbeaten on 72.

Medium fast bowler Paidikalva Vijaykumar (5/25) starred for Andhra with the ball in Hyderabad's second innings, while Prithvi Raj (3/53) also chipped in with wickets.

Earlier in reply to Hyderabad’s 225, Andhra declared their first innings at a mammoth score of 489 for eight in 153 overs.

Andhra (7) pocketed a bonus point after registering the comprehensive win.

Meanwhile, the other remaining Group A match between Gujarat and Rajasthan in Jaipur ended in a draw.

But Rajasthan pocketed three points from the tie by virtue of first innings lead.

Rajasthan made 360 in reply to Gujarat’s 325 in the first innings.

Gujarat were 216 for one in their second innings when stumps were drawn on the final day.

Yadav secures win for Meghalaya

Kolkata: Sanjay Yadav shone with his all-round skills while Aditya Singhania returned a 10-wicket match haul as Meghalaya hammered Mizoram by an innings and 425 runs in their Ranji Trophy Plate group fixture here on Tuesday.

The left-arm spin duo of Yadav and Singhania wreaked havoc, accounting for 12 of the 13 wickets tumbling on the day to seal Meghalaya’s second win of the season.

Meghalaya now have 13 points from five matches to be at sixth spot while Mizoram remained at the bottom of the table with three points from five matches.

Resuming at 114 for seven in their first innings, Mizoram failed to add any run to their overnight total and were dismissed in eight balls with left-arm spinner Singhania (4/30) being the wrecker-in-chief.

Following-on, Mizoram put up yet another sloppy batting display, with Singhania grabbing 6/40 en route to his career-best match-haul of 10/70 to be bundled out for 123 in 41.1 overs.

Yadav was also at his best with figures of 4/27 to complement his career-best 254 not out that had helped Meghalaya pile a huge 662/4 declared in the first innings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mumbai-pick-three-points-from-drawn-game.html

Prajnesh knocked out local wild card Harry Bourchier 6-2, 6-4 to set up second round clash with Germany’s Yannick Hanfmann.

Ramkumar led against 15th seed Argentine before losing steam to suffer a 6-4, 4-6, 1-6 defeat to yet again collapse in the Qualifiers of a Grand Slam.

Prajnesh had last year competed in main draws of all four majors of the season.

220,15-1-20,Sania makes winning return to WTA circuit,"Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza made a winning return to the WTA circuit by advancing to the women’s doubles quarterfinals of the Hobart International Tournament with Ukrainian partner Nadia Kichenok, here on Tuesday.

Returning to the court after two years, Sania and Kichenok prevailed 2-6 7-6 (3) 10-3 over Oksana Kalashnikova of Georgia and Japan’s Miyu Kato in a contest lasting one hour and 41 minutes.

The Indo-Ukrainian pair will next be up against Americans Vania King and Christina McHale.

The US combination upstaged fourth-seeded Spainish duo of Georgina Garcia Perez and Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-2, 7-5 in a round of 16 clash.

During her two years away from the game, the 33-year-old Sania battled injury breakdowns before taking a formal break in April 2018 to give birth to her son Izhaan. The Hyderabadi is married to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik.

“Today was one of the most special days of my life.To have my parents and my little baby boy wit me in my first match after so long..And we WON our first round.Feel very grateful for the love I am receiving.. BELIEF!! Takes you places YES my baby boy,we did it,” she posted on her Twitter page.

In an engaging showdown, Sania and Kichenok weren’t off to a particularly good start as they double-faulted twice, failed to convert any of the seven break points that came their way and lost their serve two times to go down 2-6 in the opening set.

However, they pulled things back in the second set, helped by their rivals’ inconsistent game.

Both the teams converted three break points each as the set went into a tie-breaker in which Sania and Kichenok nosed ahead of their opponents to draw even.

Sania and Kichenok raised the bar in the final set and displayed superior returns to emerge triumphant.

Sania had last played at China Open in October 2017 where she picked up a nagging knee injury.

A trailblazer in Indian tennis, Sania is a former world No.1 in doubles and has six Grand Slam titles to her credit.

She retired from the singles competition in 2013 after becoming the most successful Indian woman tennis player ever.

In 2007, she attained a career-high 27th position in the WTA singles chart.

However, she has also been hampered by career-threatening wrist and knee injuries.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sania-makes-winning-return-to-wta-circuit.html
221,15-1-20,Big Three aim to keep young challengers at bay,"Novak Djokovic admits the next generation of players are edging closer, but tennis’s Big Three remain one step ahead as they aim to extend their dominance at the Australian Open.

Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have kept a tight grip on the Majors over the past decade, with the Serb and the Swiss particularly prolific at the year’s opening Grand Slam.

Adding spice is the prospect of Nadal breaking through for only his second win in Melbourne to equal the 38-year-old Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam wins.

All players may also have to deal with hazy conditions caused by Australia’s raging bushfires, after practice was suspended on Tuesday when air pollution soared to hazardous levels.

“Obviously the Australian Open has been my favourite tournament. It’s the tournament where I’ve played my best tennis,” said Djokovic.

“You have obviously Federer, Nadal, myself because of the experience and everything and the rankings, that we get to be probably named the top three favourites.

223,15-1-20,Injured Momota out for 2 months,"Badminton world number one Kento Momota could be out for two months after being injured in a car crash that killed his driver just hours after he won the Malaysia Masters on Sunday.

The 25-year-old Japanese suffered cuts and bruising in the accident near Kuala Lumpur but is aiming to return at the All England Championships on March 11, said Kinji Zeniya, secretary general of Japan’s Badminton Association on Tuesday.

Zeniya told reporters that Momota, who won a record 11 titles last year had “extraordinary enthusiasm towards the Olympics” this year in Tokyo but urged Japan’s home gold medal hope to take time to recuperate fully.

“I hope he will do his best without pushing and rushing himself too hard and without being impatient,” said Zeniya.

Momota has been in hospital since Monday following the crash with a slow-moving lorry as his party were driving to the airport.

The driver was killed at the scene while Momota received cuts to his face and bruising all over his body, Zeniya said, denying previous reports that he had broken his nose and chin.

An assistant coach, physiotherapist, and badminton official were also injured. Momota will return to Japan on Wednesday, Zeniya said, and would receive further medical checks.

“Cuts will be healed, but what will happen to the bruising later? I know injuries from car accidents can emerge after some time,” Zeniya said.

The accident came after the dominant Japanese star began his 2020 season in style Sunday with victory over Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen in Kuala Lumpur.

Momota enjoyed unrivalled success in 2019, winning a record 11 titles including the World Championships, Asia Championships and All England Championships, a dramatic turnaround for a player who had been banned for gambling in 2016.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/injured-momota-out-for-2-months.html
224,15-1-20,"Valverde out, Setien in","Spanish champions Barcelona have sacked their coach Ernesto Valverde and appointed Quique Setien as his replacement, the club announced.

The decision to remove Valverde was confirmed following a board meeting that lasted more than four hours at Camp Nou on Monday afternoon.

Barca are top of La Liga but have won only one of their last five matches. Valverde is the first coach the club has sacked mid-season since Louis van Gaal in 2003.

“FC Barcelona and Ernesto Valverde have reached an agreement to terminate the contract that united both parties,” read a club statement released on Monday night.

Setien will be presented in a press conference at Camp Nou at 2.30pm local time (1330 GMT) on Tuesday.

“Barcelona and Quique Setien have reached an agreement for the latter to become first team coach until 30 June 2022,” the club said.

“Setien is one of the most experienced coaches in Spanish football,” it added.

“Throughout his career he has been a proponent of possession based, attacking football that has been attractive to the fans.”

His first game in charge will be at home to Granada on Sunday. Barcelona play Napoli in the last 16 of the Champions League next month and Real Madrid in the league at the start of March.

Setien has made no secret of his admiration for the stylistic traditions of Barcelona, with the 61-year-old also renowned for favouring an exciting, offensive mode of football.

A former player of Atletico Madrid and Racing Santander, he was circled as a potential Barca coach during a particularly successful period in charge of Real Betis.

Setien led Betis to a sixth-place finish in 2018 and qualification for the Europa League but, despite overseeing a thrilling 4-3 victory at Camp Nou early the following season, results tailed off.

Betis finished 10th and the club and coach parted ways in the summer. Previously, he also helped Las Palmas avoid relegation from La Liga in 2016.

A footballing purist, Setien and Barcelona would seem a good fit, particularly if the players feel released from some of Valverde's more pragmatic tendencies.

But critics of Setien would argue style often takes precedence over substance and it remains to be seen how he handles the pressure of matching aesthetics with results at one of the world's most demanding clubs.

He will also have to do without Luis Suarez, who will be missing for the next four months after having surgery on his right knee.

European failures

haunt Valverde

Doubts had surrounded Valverde for several months and were underpinned by two disastrous exits from the Champions League.

Barcelona’s shocking collapse against Roma in 2018 was followed by a similar capitulation against Liverpool last year.

Familiar fragility had been evident this season and a 3-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup on Thursday, in which Barcelona conceded two late goals, prompted the board to act.

Valverde arrived two hours early for his last training session with the squad at Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper on Monday morning before meeting with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.

Bartomeu then drove to Camp Nou, where he held a board meeting with several club officials including chief executive Oscar Grau, technical secretary Javier Bordas, vice president Jordi Cardoner and sporting director Eric Abidal.

Grau and Abidal had returned to Barcelona on Sunday after spending the weekend in Qatar, where they had offered the job to Xavi, only for the clubs iconic former midfielder to indicate he was not ready to come immediately.

In Valverde’s two seasons, his team won two La Liga titles, as well as the Copa del Rey in 2018, and another league success remained very much in sight this term, despite Madrid’s impressive form in recent weeks.

But Barca’s performances have been unconvincing and there were lingering concerns about Valverde’s more functional tactics, which appear to have informed the switch to Setien.

When Valverde arrived in 2017, Barcelona were wounded, hurting after the shock departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and humiliated, as consecutive defeats by Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup hinted at trouble for the season ahead.

Instead, he steadied the ship and galvanised the team.

They lost one league game en route to winning the title and the year after, they were champions again, finishing 11 points ahead of Atletico and 19 clear of Real.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/valverde-out--setien-in-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/valverde-out--setien-in.html

""Nearly 85 per cent of India's business output comes from the unorganized sector, about 10 per cent from SMBs and probably 5 per cent from large companies.

""Therefore, you do play an extremely important role in making 21st century as India's century,"" Murthy told the audience at the 'Amazon Smbhav' event here.

""The only way it can become India's century is if the country becomes economically powerful, and the only way India can become economically powerful is if per capita revenue productivity goes up from current $2,000 or Rs 1,40,000 to somewhere three to four times, or ideally five times,"" emphasized Murthy.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken about the $5 trillion economy. That task will be delivered by you. The most important thing that you have to do is to create an idea that your differentiated business value proposition is better than any of your competitors,"" Murthy said.

Bezos spoke about innovation, experimentation and better level of excellence and execution.

Murthy said that innovation comes from the human mind.

""It comes from the power of the human mind. Therefore, you have to attract people who are smarter than you. People who will teach you, as Bezos pointed out, will teach you better things, not just in intellect, but even in values,"" he emphasized.

French diplomatic sources said France has noted the request of a UNSC member to raise the Kashmir issue once again in the powerful body and it is going to oppose it like it did on a previous occasion.

229,15-1-20,Vishwas mocks reports of him joining BJP,"Poet politician Kumar Vishwas on Wednesday mocked reports that he may join the Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of the Delhi assembly polls, saying those running such news should put it out every week on ""repeat alarm"" instead of bothering their fingers with the same story so often.

Vishwas, a founder member of the AAP who has drifted away from the party due to differences with its leader Arvind Kejriwal, tweeted that he was currently in Doha to attend an NRI event and asked in a lighter vein if he should join the BJP from there.

He was responding to a tweet that referred to ""strong buzz"" about him joining the saffron party.

This is not the first time that the speculation has grown about the likelihood of his joining the BJP. There is a view that Vishwas is ideologically close to the party on certain issues and can be the answer to its search for a leader to take on Kejriwal in the national capital.

There has been no official reaction from the BJP to these reports.

Delhi assembly polls are scheduled to be held on February 8.

During the last elections in 2015, the BJP had inducted former IPS officer Kiran Bedi- who was with Kejriwal during the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption stir- in the party and then projected her as its chief ministerial candidate.

The four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Gupta (25) -- are to be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail. A Delhi court had issued their death warrants on January 7.

Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal were told by the Delhi government and the Centre that the petition filed by convict Mukesh, challenging his death warrant, was premature.

The Delhi government and the prison authorities informed the court that under the rules, it will have to wait for the mercy plea to be decided before executing the death warrant.

They also said that none of the four convicts can be executed on January 22 unless the present mercy plea is decided.

237,15-1-20,"Taiwan 'already independent', Tsai warns China","China must rethink its hardline stance towards Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday, as she warned the island was already independent and that any invasion would be ""very costly"" for Beijing.

Tsai won a second term over the weekend with a record 8.2 million votes, an outcome that was seen as a forceful rebuke of China's ongoing campaign to isolate the self-ruled island.

China's leadership had made no secret of its desire to see Tsai turfed out because she and her party refuse to acknowledge their view that the island is part of a ""one China"".

Beijing regards Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary -- especially if it declares independence.

But in her first interview since Saturday's re-election, Tsai told the BBC there was no need to formally announce independence because the island already runs itself.

""We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,"" she said in the interview, which aired on Wednesday.

""We are an independent country already and we call ourselves the Republic of China, Taiwan."" Modern Taiwan has been run separately from the mainland for the last 70 years.

For decades, it was a dictatorship under Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists following their 1949 defeat to the communists in China's civil war.

But since the 1980s, it has morphed into one of Asia's most progressive democracies, although it is only diplomatically recognised by a dwindling handful of countries.

Polls show growing numbers of Taiwanese reject the idea that the island should be part of the Chinese mainland.

""We have a separate identity and we're a country of our own,"" Tsai said. ""We deserve respect from China"".

China has greeted Tsai's re-election with anger, warning against any move to push the island closer towards independence.

""Splitting the country is doomed to leave a name that will stink for eternity,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said this week.

Chinese state media also accused Tsai of winning the election through cheating, without providing evidence.

On Wednesday, Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said there were no plans to change policy towards the island after the landslide election.

""Taiwan's future lies in the unification of the country,"" spokesman Ma Xiaoguang said, adding its future must be decided by ""all Chinese people"".

But Tsai said China should respect the wishes of Taiwan's electorate.

""I hope the Chinese side can understand in-depth the opinion and will expressed by Taiwanese people in this election and can review some of their current policies,"" she told reporters on Wednesday.

Tsai was speaking as she announced a new ""anti-infiltration law"" had been signed into effect making it illegal to launch political activities that are backed or funded by ""hostile external forces"".

Supporters say the bill is aimed at clamping down on China's infiltration of Taiwan's politics while opponents called it anti-democratic.

In her BBC interview -- which came as Taiwan held annual military drills on the south of the island -- Tsai warned Beijing against sending in troops.

""Invading Taiwan is something that is going to be very costly for China,"" she said. Critics accuse Tsai of being needlessly antagonistic towards Beijing.

But Tsai said she had resisted pressure from within her own party to be more forceful on the issue of independence.

""There are so many pressures, so much pressure here that we should go further,"" she said.

""Maintaining a status quo remains our policy... I think that is a very friendly gesture to China."" Tsai has repeatedly said she is willing to talk to Beijing as long as there are no pre-conditions.

But Beijing has refused, cutting off official communication with her administration.

Over the last four years, it has also has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure, hoping it would scare voters into supporting the opposition.

But the strong-arm tactics backfired with voters resoundingly backing Tsai for another four more years.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/taiwan--already-independent---tsai-warns-china-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/taiwan--already-independent---tsai-warns-china.html
238,15-1-20,Cong-led Chhattisgarh govt moves SC seeking to declare NIA Act as unconstitutional,"The Congress-led Chhattisgarh government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking to declare the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 as unconstitutional.

The Chhattisgarh government is the first state government to challenge the Act. The move comes a day after the Kerala government challenged the Citizenship Amendment Act under Article 131 of the Constitution.

The Chhattisgarh government has filed an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution which provides for the state to move directly to the Supreme Court in matters of dispute against the Centre.

In the plea the state government said, ""The plaintiff (state) respectfully submits that the NIA Act is ultra vires to the Constitution and is beyond legislative competence of Parliament since the Act empowers the defendant (Centre) to create an agency for investigation, which, not withstanding the NIA, is carried out by state police, which is a subject matter of the state under entry 2, List 2, Schedule 7, of the Constitution.""

The suit filed through standing counsel of the state Sumer Sodhi said the NIA Act in its present form not only takes away the power of conducting investigation by the plaintiff (state) through police but also confers ""unfettered, discretionary and arbitrary powers"" on the defendant (Centre).

""Moreover, there are no rules governing the exercise of powers which gives ample discretion to the defendant to exercise its power at any juncture without providing any reason or justification for the same,"" the plea said.

The state government said the provision of the Act leaves no room for coordination and pre-condition of consent in any form by the central government from the state government which clearly is against the idea of state sovereignty as envisaged under the Constitution.

The NIA Act, 2008, was enacted with a view to constituting the NIA to investigate and prosecute people for offences affecting the sovereignty, security and integrity of India, security of state, friendly relations with foreign states and offences under Acts enacted to implement international treaties, agreements, conventions and resolutions of the United Nations, its agencies and other international organisations.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong-led-chhattisgarh-govt-moves-sc-seeking-to-declare-nia-act-as-unconstitutional-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/cong-led-chhattisgarh-govt-moves-sc-seeking-to-declare-nia-act-as-unconstitutional.html

242,15-1-20,Even literate need to be educated: Lekhi on Nadella’s CAA concerns,"Taking exception to Microsoft chief Satya Nadella’s comment on the CAA, BJP spokesperson and MP Meenakshi Lekhi said his comments showed “how the literate need to be educated”.

To a question about the CAA, Nadella was quoted by Buzzfeed’s editor-in-chief as saying that what is happening in India is “sad”. Later, he said every country should protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly.

He also spoke about his upbringing in a multicultural India and subsequent immigrant experience in the United States to say that his hope for India is where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation.

Asked about the controversy following Nadella’s remarks, Sambit Patra addressing a Press conference here noted that Nadella had given a “clarification”. “That is what the Government of this country has done. We are looking after national security and protecting borders.”

“As far as immigrants are concerned, there is a process for citizenship. Anybody can apply for citizenship. Even the Prime Minister has said so. Once they apply for work permit, for citizenship, many have become citizens. Of course anybody can then do whatever the Constitution has bestowed on them (sic),” Patra said.

In her tweet, Lekhi was, however, critical of Nadella.

“How literate need to be educated! Perfect example,” Lekhi said on Twitter in response to Nadella’s remarks and also posted his statement issued later by Microsoft India.

“Precise reason for CAA is to grant opportunities to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan & Afghanistan. How about granting these opportunities to Syrian Muslims, instead of Yezidis in USA?” she went on to say.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/even-literate-need-to-be-educated--lekhi-on-nadella---s-caa-concerns.html
243,15-1-20,Greening Hindu Kush raises flood fear,"Global warming is making the snow-clad Hindu Kush region greener with scientists finding the shrubs and grass appearing across certain areas in the Himalayas. This has raised fear of possible flooding in the region because plants could absorb more light and warm the ice.

Scientists from the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom used NASA’s Landsat satellite data from 1993 to 2018 and found increase in subniveal vegetation — plants that grow between the tree line and the snow line — in the Himalayas across four height brackets from 4,150 to 6,000 metres above sea level. The findings are published in the latest edition of Global Change Biology journal.

The scientists have been consistently warning that glacial cover in the region is on decline due to global warming.

“There are now more areas that are covered in plants than there were in 1993,” said the main author of the study, Dr Karen Anderson of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.

Though the study did not give the definite reason for increase in the green cover, the scientists warned that the phenomenon could increase flooding in the vase Hindu Kush Himalayan region, which feeds Asia’s 10 largest systems and supplies over 1.4 billion people with water. The Himalayan mountains are the third largest deposit of ice in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic.

“Although the water supply from the glacier may be less, the snow and grass growing between the trees can act to increase flooding in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region.

“This part is spread over 4.2 million square kilometres. It is the 10th largest river system in Asia. Over 1.4 billion people depend on water collected in the region, and changes to water cycles and supplies could have far-reaching impacts on communities in different countries,” Dr Anderson said.

“We know that plants and water cycle are coupled. Wherever you have plants growing, it changes the way the water cycle behaves in those areas,” he said citing studies of increased vegetation in the Arctic which found that they delivered a warming effect in the surrounding landscape, with the plants absorbing more light and warming the soil.

“That would be bad news for the Himalayas,” said Anderson. “The subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology - quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.”

There is an urgent need for new science to uncover the status, role and fate of high altitude ecosystems in the unique setting of the HKH for modulating seasonal non?base flow water supplies and cycling carbon, the research suggested.

Climate change has already had observable effects on Himalayan communities. A study published last year in Science Advances said that Himalayan’s glaciers lost billions of tonnes of ice - equivalent to more than a vertical foot and half of ice each year - from 2000 to 2016.

That’s double the amount of melting that took place from 1975 to 2000, revealing that the ice loss is accelerating with rising temperatures.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/greening-hindu-kush-raises-flood-fear-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/greening-hindu-kush-raises-flood-fear.html
244,15-1-20,32 avalanches kill 4 soldiers among 9 in 2 days in Kashmir,"As many as 32 avalanches in the last 48 hours in north Kashmir have claimed nine lives and taken a heavy toll on the security forces and their posts with temperature in Siachen plummeting to as low as minus 57 degrees Celsius.

Unprecedented snowfall has covered some posts by a layer of 48 inches to 50 inches snow, posing tough challenge to the forces to man the forward areas. Five civilians died in Ganderbal and three Army men died in Machil sector, while a Border Security Force (BSF) trooper died hours after he was safely brought out from the avalanche in Naugam sector.

The mishap in Machil sector took place at 12.45 am on Monday close to the Line of Control (LoC). Manned by five soldiers, the Army post was buried under snow. While four of them were brought out, one soldier is still missing. Three of the soldiers were feared to be dead while the condition of the fourth was critical, sources said here on Tuesday.

Another avalanche struck a village in Gagangir area of Ganderbal in which five civilians were killed but four others were rescued, police said.

The snow slide or avalanche struck on Monday night when the five civilians were passing by the area, they said. All the bodies were recovered.

Meanwhile, a BSF jawan was killed and six others were rescued after an avalanche struck along the LoC in Naugam. The incident occurred at 8.30 pm on Monday. A search and rescue operation was launched immediately, a senior officer of the border guarding force said.

“Out of the seven troops deployed in the area, six were safely rescued but one constable trapped could not be revived even after much effort,” he said. The BSF constable died due to cardiac arrest hours after getting rescued, sources said.

Elaborating upon the severity of weather, officials said here the last 48 hours witnessed unprecedented snowfall in higher reaches of North Kashmir. The areas hit the worst due to heavy snow included Gurez, Kupwara, Machil, Bandipora and Baramulla.

While Gurez received 20 inches of snowfall, Machil 46 inches, Naugam 48 inches, Keran Sector 22 inches and Uri 25 inches. Moreover, the minimum recorded temperature was minus 57 degrees on the Northern glacier in Siachen, they said.

While terming the avalanches as snow slides or snow slips, they said the incidents involving the armed forces and BSF were not classic avalanches. Besides hitting the Army post in Machil, they said three other incidents in Gurez, Tanghdar and Uri fortunately did not prove to be serious.

In Uri, seven Army jawans were buried in snow but rescued while same number of soldiers in Gurez and Tanghdhar were also brought out safely, officials said. Moreover, more than 200 troops stationed in Gurez were moved to safer places prior to their location being hit by a major snow slide.

On precautionary measures taken by the security forces to avoid such mishaps, they said all the avalanche prone areas are mapped. Moreover, 40 to 50 feet high poles function as markers as all the tracks are covered by snow, they said adding winter deployment of troops is always dynamic given the vagaries of weather there.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/32-avalanches-kill-4-soldiers-among-9-in-2-days-in-kashmir-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/32-avalanches-kill-4-soldiers-among-9-in-2-days-in-kashmir.html
245,15-1-20,"Top US Senator urges Pompeo to 'press' India for 'swift reversal' of CAA, NRC","A top US Senator has urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to press the Indian government for a ""swift reversal"" of the amended Citizenship Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens to ensure protection of human rights of all persons in the country regardless of their religion.

In a letter to Pompeo on Tuesday, Senator Bob Menendez, a Ranking Member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed concern over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the potential for the establishment of a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India.

Asserting that the US must remain steadfast in defending democratic values, freedoms and human rights, he said, ""I urge the Administration to engage the Indian government at the highest levels on these concerns, press for a swift reversal of these policies and practices, and ensure protection of the human rights of all persons in India regardless of their religion.""

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

""The law to grant citizenship based on religion violates India's international legal obligations and its constitution, which guarantees the rights to equality and nondiscrimination,"" Menendez said.

""The citizen registry has already disproportionately affected Muslims in India. These efforts threaten India's long history of secularism and democratic values,"" claimed the Democrat leader who represents New Jersey, which has among the highest concentration of Indian-Americans in the US.

""Despite the government's claims that the Citizenship Bill seeks to protect religious minorities, its failure to include Muslim groups facing persecution in neighbouring countries, such as Pakistan's Ahmadiyya and Burma's Rohingya, signal an anti-Muslim intent,"" wrote the Senator.

Menendez also expressed concerns over reports of injuries and deaths of peaceful demonstrators protesting the CAA and the proposed nationwide NRC.

Referring to the NRC, the Senator said in October last year, he had travelled to India during which he met with civil society activists who expressed deep concern about the ""trajectory of these policies and its negative impact on the future of democracy in India"".

""The government's efforts in Assam has left effectively 1.9 million persons, primarily Bengali-speaking Muslims, stateless. The government appears to now be extending this effort across the country,"" he said.

The NRC exercise was conducted in Assam on the directions of the Supreme Court.

Though several Union ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have often pitched for a nationwide NRC exercise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month had said that his government has never discussed the NRC since coming to power for the first time in 2014 and it was done only in Assam due to a Supreme Court order.

On the CAA, Modi said the law is about giving rights to persecuted minorities from neighbouring countries and does not snatch anybody's rights.

In his letter to Pompeo, Senator Menendez also expressed concerns on the situation in Kashmir.

""The situation in Kashmir has also not normalised since the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution in August. The five-month Internet shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever in a democracy, and has left people's lives, jobs, and the economy in a more dire situation,"" he said.

Following the abrogation of Article 370, which ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories, various restrictions -- including ban on mobile phones and Internet -- were imposed in Jammu and Kashmir to maintain law and order.

The Indian government has defended the restrictions, which are being gradually lifted in a phased manner, on the grounds that they were imposed to prevent Pakistan from creating more mischief through proxies and terrorists following the abrogation of Article 370.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/top-us-senator-urges-pompeo-to--press--india-for--swift-reversal--of-caa--nrc-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/top-us-senator-urges-pompeo-to--press--india-for--swift-reversal--of-caa--nrc.html
246,15-1-20,Machine can keep human livers alive for a week outside body,"Researchers have developed a machine that repairs injured human livers and keeps them alive outside the human body for about one week. It could help save life of many people, who are suffering from liver diseases or cancer.

Lovkesh Anand, Consultant, Gastroenterology at Manipal Hospital in New Delhi, said, ""Given the incidence of liver failure in our country and low availability of organs for transplant, such path-breaking development can transform the way we treat or transplant liver.""

""Till now, liver can be stored outside body for only up to 12 hours and had to be transplanted within that time,"" Anand told IANS. With a week's time, the number of available organs for transplant would increase and life of many patients suffering from liver diseases or cancer could be saved, he added.

According to the study, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, with the novel perfusion technology, livers -- and even injured ones -- can be kept alive outside the human body for a week.

""The success of this unique perfusion system -- developed by a group of surgeons, biologists and engineers -- will pave the way for new applications in transplantation and cancer medicine, helping patients with no liver grafts available,"" said study researcher Pierre-Alain Clavi from the University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland.

It's a major breakthrough in the transplantation medicine. Injured cadaveric livers, initially not suitable for transplantation, may regain full function while perfused in the new machine for several days.

According to researchers, the basis for this technology is a complex perfusion system, mimicking most core body functions close to physiology.

The Liver4Life project was developed under the umbrella of Wyss Zurich Institute, which brought together highly specialised technical and biomedical knowledge of experts from the University Hospital Zurich.

According to the study, six of the ten perfused poor-quality human livers, declined for transplantation in Europe, recovered to full function within one week of perfusion on the machine.

The next step will be to use these organs for transplantation. The technology opens an avenue for applications offering a new life for many patients with end-stage liver disease or cancer.

""The biggest challenge in the initial phase of our project was to find a common language that would allow communication between clinicians and engineers,"" said researcher Philipp Rudolf von Rohr.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/machine-can-keep-human-livers-alive-for-a-week-outside-body-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/machine-can-keep-human-livers-alive-for-a-week-outside-body.html

Over 30 lakh people have gathered here for the pilgrimage, breaking all previous records, a senior official of the state government said.

""Till 8 am, around 18 lakh people have taken dips in the holy waters. Several lakhs are waiting,"" he said.

Every year on Makar Sankranti, lakhs of Hindus flock the Sagar Island in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district to take the holy dip and offer prayers at the Kapil Muni temple.

""Last year, we had a record number of 20 lakh pilgrims visiting the island. This year, that record has been broken as we have witnessed over 30 lakh pilgrims arriving. It was peaceful and the pilgrims have also appreciated our arrangements,"" the official said.

Security has been beefed up in the island, around 100 km from Kolkata, and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is monitoring the situation, officials said.

251,15-1-20,24 new AAP faces in list of 70 names,"Party retains 46 MLAs for polls, Kejriwal to fight from New Delhi

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday announced its list of all 70 candidates for the Delhi Assembly polls to be held on February 8. The party has given tickets to 24 new faces, including Atishi, Dilip Pandey and Raghav Chadha, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The AAP retained 46 sitting candidates that included Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who will contest from New Delhi Assembly seat for the third consecutive time, while his deputy Manish Sisodia has been fielded from the Patparganj Assembly, Kailash Gehlot from Najafgarh, Satyendar Jain from Shakur Basti, Gopal Rai from Babarpur, Imran Husain from Ballimaran and Rajender Pal Gautam from Seemapuri.

Sisodia said party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC) has approved names of all 70 candidates for the polls. “The existing MLAs will contest elections on 46 seats. There are 8 women candidates among them. In 2015, there were six women,” Sisodia, said.

Soon after the announcement, Kejriwal tweeted, “Best wishes to all. Don’t be complacent. Work hard. People have lots of faith in the AAP and your. God bless.”

Interestingly, AAP MLA from Delhi Cantonment Commando Surinder Singh and Adarsh Shastri, MLA from Dwarka, have been denied ticket and replaced by Virender Singh Kadian and Vinay Kumar Mishra, who is son of three-time MLA Congress and one term MP from West Delhi Lok Sabha Mahabal Mishra.

The new faces in the list are former Congressmen Shoaib Iqbal (Matia Mahal), Prahlad Singh Sawhney (Chandni Chowk), Durgesh Pathak (Karawal Nagar), Naveen Choudhary (Gandhi Nagar), BS Joon (Bijwasan), and Mukesh Kumar Ajlawat (Sultan Pur Majra).

The AAP has retained former Law Minister Jitender Tomar, who was arrested by the Delhi Police in June 2015 for presenting fake law degree in his election affidavits.

While the AAP has declared all its candidates at one go, its rivals the BJP and the Congress are yet to announce names of their candidates. When asked about the announcement of BJP candidates, a Delhi BJP leader said party High Command is meeting on Thursday to decide on candidates. The BJP will declare all the names by January 19. The Congress that was decimated in 2015 Assembly election with zero seat, has not decided on its candidates.

Delhi Congress leaders are looking towards interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi to give the go ahead.

While the Congress and the BJP are slow to start, the AAP is going whole hog with its volunteers carpet bombing the localities with the works done by Arvind Kejriwal Government during its 5 years rule.

It may be noted that Delhi Assembly polls will be held on February 8, 2020 and the counting of votes will take place on February 11th. “While AAP is going to the people with its slogan ‘Abki Baar 67 paar’, BJP will have to come out with something extra to checkmate BJP and convince voters that it will provide even better facilities if voted to power”, said a BJP leader.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/24-new-aap-faces-in-list-of-70-names-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/24-new-aap-faces-in-list-of-70-names.html
252,15-1-20,No new lease of life for Nirbhaya rapists,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to give any lifeline to the death-row convicts of the Nirbhaya gang- rape and murder case when a five-judge bench of the apex court, during in-chamber hearing, rejected the curative petitions filed by Mukesh and Vinay. Soon after the rejection of his plea by the SC, Mukesh filed a mercy petition before the President of India.

Black warrants are out for the four convicts — Vinay Sharma (26), Mukesh Kumar (32), Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Gupta (25). They will be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar Jail.

Advocate AP Singh, who is representing the convicts in the case, said he would file another curative petition on behalf of Akshay and Pawan in the SC.

“I have sought details from Tihar Jail about the conduct of these convicts during their stay on the prison from 2012 till 2019. Once I receive those details, I will file curative petitions for Akshay and Pawan,” Singh told PTI.

Rejecting the curative plea, the SC bench, headed by Justice N V Ramana and comprising Justices Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan, said, “The applications for oral hearing are rejected. The applications for stay of execution of death sentence are also rejected. We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra & another, reported in 2002 (4) SCC 388. Hence, the curative petitions are dismissed.”

A curative petition is the last and final legal remedy available to a person before the convict seeks President’s mercy.

Reacting to the SC’s order, Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi said, “Today is a big day for me because I have been struggling for seven years. The biggest day would be January 22 when the four rapists would be hanged. I hope that the other remedies available to them would be similarly rejected in future and they will be hanged on January 22.”

I have fought according to law for seven years and we will get justice legally, she told a private TV channel.

Advocate Singh said he is also planning to approach the Delhi High Court to challenge the trial court’s January 7 order issuing death warrants against these convicts.

He said once he would file mercy petition, he would bring it to notice of the court so that the scheduled execution could be suspended.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gangraped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi by six people, including the most-brutal juvenile who is now free, before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The SC had in 2017 upheld the capital punishment awarded to the four convicts.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-new-lease-of-life-for-nirbhaya-rapists.html
253,15-1-20,Amicable bids on to remove Shaheen Bagh blockade,"The Delhi Police has initiated the process of clearing the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch that has been blocked for a month by people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and proposed NRC.

The move came after the Delhi High Court directed the police to look into the traffic restrictions on this stretch.

“The police have initiated the process of clearing the Shaheen Bagh road. The police are following the policy of persuasion rather than force to clear the busy arterial road. We are talking to elders and women and trying to convince them to accept our request. The protesters can choose an alternative place that does not impede the traffic flow,” a senior police official said.

Officials said police will talk to traders’ body, religious leaders and community elders to end the blockade.

According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Southeast district Chinmoy Biswal, police along with elderly people of the area on Monday night tried to enter into a dialogue with the protesters.

“We along with elderly people of the area, traders and religious leaders will again talk to them, as Delhi High Court has also directed and try to pacify the situation. We have asked them to clear the road and they can protest at a place where daily commuters don’t face hardship,” said the DCP.

Many people in South Delhi were inconvenienced due to the closure of the road as it snapped a direct link with satellite town Noida, he added.

The protesters are willing to heed to our request but an advocate misled the people that he will file another petition before the High Court and seek direction for the Delhi Police. It led to rumours being spread and soon the number swelled, a police official said.

Earlier in the day, a Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar directed the Delhi Police to look into traffic restrictions on Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch while keeping in mind the larger public interest and look into traffic restrictions on the stretch.

The court passed the order while disposing a PIL filed by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni seeking a direction to the Delhi Police Commissioner to lift restrictions on Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15, 2019 by anti-CAA, NRC protesters.

The Kalindi Kunj stretch is vital as it connects Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh) and commuters are forced to take the Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Expressway and Ashram, which is causing hours of traffic jams and wastage of time and fuel, the plea said.

The court said, “We hereby direct the respondent authority (police) concerned to look into the restrictions on usage of road — Kalindi Kunj- Shaheen Bagh Stretch, that is, Road No. 13A (between Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj) as well as Okhla underpass, in accordance with law, rules, regulations and the Government policy.”

It further asked the authorities to look into the issue keeping in mind “larger public interest” and also maintenance of “law and order” situation. However, the court refused to direct the authorities to look into the issue in a time bound manner.

During the hearing, Sahni said the road closure is causing huge inconvenience to lakhs of commuters everyday and they are compelled to take different routes for last one month.

He said children, who take that route, are compelled to leave home two hours prior to school timing. The petition claimed that the authorities have failed to take appropriate action to give relief to the residents of the locality and lakhs of commuters of Delhi, UP and Haryana.

It said the petitioner has given representation to the authorities on January 3 but no action has been taken till date.

Besides the Delhi Police, the plea had made the Centre and the Delhi Government as parties, seeking from them requisite assistance to the police in addressing the issue.

Due to the heavy traffic on alternative routes, it takes 15-20 minutes for people to cross just one traffic signal at Ashram, it said.

Citing several news reports, it said that on an average, Ashram Chowk is used by around 30,000 vehicles every day. With the Kalindi Kunj road closure, an additional 1 lakh vehicles are flowing through the intersection.

The High Court, on January 10, had refused to entertain an application, in the form of letter, seeking directions for removal of demonstrators protesting the CAA at Shaheen Bagh here in order to clear road blockages that are causing traffic congestions at the DND route.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/amicable-bids-on-to-remove-shaheen-bagh-blockade-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/amicable-bids-on-to-remove-shaheen-bagh-blockade.html
254,15-1-20,"As if Jama Masjid is in Pak, judge raps cops for Bhim Army chief’s arrest","People are out on streets as what should have been said inside Parliament was “not said”, a court observed here on Tuesday as it pulled up the Delhi Police after it failed to show any evidence against Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who has been accused of inciting people during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid on December 20.

Asserting that it is one’s constitutional right to protest, the court, which was hearing Azad’s bail plea, observed that Delhi Police was behaving “as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan”.

“Inside Parliament, things which should have been said were not said and that is why people are out on the streets. We have full right to express our views but we can’t destroy our country. We cannot disintegrate it,” Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau said.

The judge was angry with the public prosecutor as the police could not substantiate the allegations against Azad.

The counsel referred to social media posts of the Bhim Army Chief wherein he calls people to come to Jama Masjid and sit in ‘dharna’ (protest).

To this, the judge asked, “What is the problem with going to Jama Masjid? What is wrong with ‘dharna’? It is one’s constitutional right to protest. Where is the violence? What is wrong with any of these posts? Have you read the Constitution?”

“You are behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan and even if it was Pakistan, you can go there and protest. Pakistan was a part of undivided India,” the judge said.

The court asked the investigating officer of the police to put on record all the evidence which showed that Azad was allegedly giving inflammatory speeches at the gathering at Jama Masjid and any law which showed that the gathering there was unconstitutional.

It has put up the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.

When Bhatia said that permission was required to hold such protests, the judge remarked, “What permission? Even the Supreme Court has said repeated use of Section 144 (prohibition of gathering of five or more persons, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms) of the Indian Penal Code was an abuse of the law....

“I have seen many people and many such cases, where protests happened even outside Parliament. Many of them are chief ministers now. Azad is a budding politician, what is wrong with his protests?”

When the judge asked if the police had any video or audio recording showing objectionable content against Azad, the public prosecutor replied that there was no voice recording and no video of the incident and that there were only statements of witnesses in the case.

“We just have a drone CCTV footage,” the public prosecutor said. The judge rebuked the police, saying, “Do you think Delhi police is so backward that it has no tools to record? There must have been some recording... “Give me details of the last three FIRs registered against Azad. Also show is there is any prohibition on such gathering. Show any law that prohibits this kind of gathering.”

At this, advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for Azad, told the court that the accused (Azad) was suffering from Polycythemia, a blood disorder, for which he was not given proper treatment by the Tihar jail authorities till a magistrate court had directed them for the same.

“Azad was deliberately put in harm’s way. There was no ground for this arrest. He was arrested just because he had to be arrested. There is no whisper of allegation of any of the offences mentioned in the FIR, except that he had given incriminatory speeches,” he contended.

“He had logically shown to the world that this new law posed more problems to those belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) category, than the Muslims. Muslims will have documents, they will not. That is his only offence.

“He was actually reading the Constitution. He has said this CAA, NRC and NPR was against the SC/ST. Most of them does not have one inch of land in India. They will not be able to prove their citizenship,” said Pracha.

The judge also observed that Azad, having a law degree, can also protest inside the courts, and went onto add that he probably needs to research more on Ambedkarite philosophy.

“In the colonial era the protests were out on the roads. But your protest can be legal, inside the courts... Azad is in the grassroots level. No one is denying that he is a lawyer and well read and probably an Ambedkarite. Ambedkar was much closer to Muslims, Sikhs and other repressed class of the society.

“He was a rebel of his own kind. Probably Azad has a vague idea of what he wants to say. He is not able to exactly formulate it. He may not be wrong. But probably not able to put it across. If you take up an issue you do your research. And that is missing,” the court said.

The bail plea claimed that there was no evidence against the allegations made against Azad in the FIR and his arrest was illegal.

Azad’s outfit had called for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the amended Citizenship Act on December 20, without police permission.

Other 15 people arrested in the case were granted bail by the court on January 9.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/as-if-jama-masjid-is-in-pak--judge-raps-cops-for-bhim-army-chief---s-arrest.html

The show is currently seeing a ""family week"", with relatives of the housemates dropping in to visit them.

Along with other relatives who visit the ""Bigg Boss"" house, Parag will be seen greeting all the contestants. Apart from wife Shefali, he also looks forward to meeting Paras Chhabra, who is apparently like his younger brother.

He reminds her she is a ""Gundi"" (goon) and should show her ""gundapan"" (goonish behaviour).

Parag says this in the context of the way Asim behaved with her. Over the past weeks, Shefali and Asim have far from shared a cordial rapport inside the house. Recently, when Asim was cooking and Shefali said she would like some rotis, he tersely wondered how could he expecte him to make rotis for her when they hardly ever spoke properly.

During his visit, Parag will be seen telling Asim that he has been with Shefali for a decade now, and that he cannot hear junk about his wife.

He would be seen telling Asim: ""You got to know Himanshi Khurana for just 10 days and you could not tolerate rubbish being spoken about her. How do you expect me to bear this?""

262,15-1-20,Microsoft ends Windows 7 support,"Microsoft has finally dropped support of Windows 7, nearly ten years after first launching the operating system. Now, users still stuck on Windows 7 will not get any software support from the tech giant.

Microsoft has also urged Windows 7 users to make an upgrade to Windows 10 to enjoy new features and continued support.

""Today marks the end of support for Windows 7. Ten years ago, when we first announced Windows 7 and Office 2010, we focused on delivering the best productivity experience of the time. But since then, thanks to breakthrough advancements in technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), we've been able to build tools to help you take advantage of new forms of productivity. With Windows 10, the power of the cloud makes you and your organization more productive and secure than ever. "" the company said in a statement.

According to data from Netmarketshare, currently, millions of PCs are still running Windows 7 and the operating system still runs on a massive 26 per cent of all PCs.

For older PCs users it is possible to install Windows 10. In order to run Windows 10, PCs must have a 1GHz processor, 16GB of hard drive space, and 1GB of RAM memory.

""Now, for those enterprise and SMB customers who have not yet had the opportunity to move to Windows 10, we do have ways to help you stay secure during the transition.

263,15-1-20,Arjuna's arrow had atomic power: West Bengal governor,"The arrows of Mahabharata's Arjuna had atomic power, claimed West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, drawing sharp criticism from academicians, even as he joined a long list of politicians who have in recent years given bizarre interpretations linking mythology with science.

Speaking at the 45th Eastern India Science Fair and 19th Science and Engineering Fair on Tuesday, Dhankhar also claimed that flying objects existed during the period of Ramayana.

""It is said that the plane was invented in 1910 or 1911, but if we delve into our old scriptures we will see in Ramayana, we had 'uran khatola' (aircraft),"" he said.

""Sanjaya narrated the entire war of Mahabharata (to Dhitarasthra) not from TV. The arrows of Arjuna in Mahabharata had atomic power in it,"" Dhankhar said, asserting that the world can no longer afford to ignore India.

According to Sanskrit epic Mahabharata, Sanjay, even after staying away from the battlefield, had narrated what was happening there to Dhritarashtra, who was blind.

Dhankhar, who has been in news for clashes with the Mamata Banerjee government ever since he assumed office in July last year, joins politicians such as Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb and UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma to give odd interpretations of mythology.

While Deb had claimed that the internet existed during Mahabharata, Sharma suggested that godess Sita was a test tube baby.

Recently, Puducherry Lt Governor Kiran Bedi was trolled online for sharing a doctored video that claimed, ""NASA recorded sound of sun -- Sun chants Om"".

Indologist Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri said governors appointed by the BJP government at the Centre are delving into everything and behave ""as if they are know-alls"".

The Office of the General Prosecutor said it it would take ""all measures"" to properly decode the black boxes and ""preserve evidence in the investigation of the accident"".

The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737, which had been bound for Kiev, slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran last Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board.

The downing of the plane came hours after Tehran had launched a barrage of missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq, in retaliation for the killing of commander Qasem Soleimani in a US strike.

Iran initially denied Western claims that the airliner had been downed by a missile but eventually conceded that the plane had been accidentally shot down.

The Ukrainian prosecutor's office said the country had sent ""a request for legal assistance linked to the handover to the Ukrainian law enforcement agencies of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 flight recorders"".

The statement added that Ukraine's SBU security service was in charge of investigating the crash.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ukraine-asks-iran-to-hand-over-downed-jet-s-black-boxes-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/ukraine-asks-iran-to-hand-over-downed-jet-s-black-boxes.html
267,15-1-20,Trump impeachment articles heading for the Senate,"The House of Representatives is expected to transmit articles of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate Wednesday, setting the stage for a trial next week that will decide whether the 45th US president is forced from office.

After a weeks-long standoff over rules and witnesses, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that what will be only the third presidential impeachment trial was now ready to move forward.

Pelosi is expected to sign the articles of impeachment at around 5:00 pm (2200 GMT) before they are then ceremoniously transferred from the House and travel through the US capitol's main hallways before being delivered to the Secretary of the Senate.

That ceremony will follow an announcement by Pelosi on which Democratic lawmakers will lead the prosecution case against Trump in the Senate, expected to begin next Tuesday.

Trump was impeached in December by the Democrat-controlled House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

But his conviction in the Senate is highly unlikely as the president's Republican Party has a 53-47 majority. A two-thirds majority to approve his guilt is needed if he is to be removed from office at the end of a trial expected to last two weeks.

Although the trial itself is unlikely to start until next week, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts could be sworn in to preside over the process on either Thursday or Friday.

Trump has consistently painted the charges against him as part of a witch-hunt and again took to Twitter on Tuesday evening to decry his impeachment in the House as ""the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!"" ""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, Democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts,"" he told supporters at a rally in Winconsin.

At times, he has called the whole process to be stopped in its tracks while on other occasions he has apparently relished the prospect of turning the tables against his tormentors in a chamber where his supporters are in the majority.

McConnell pushed back on Tuesday against any suggestions that he would try and prevent the trial from going ahead.

""There's little or no sentiment for a motion to dismiss. We have an obligation to listen to the arguments,"" he added.

Pelosi meanwhile called for a fair trial and demanded the Senate subpoena witnesses and documents from the White House that will be crucial in the trial.

""The American people deserve the truth, and the Constitution demands a trial ... The president and the senators will be held accountable,"" she added.

Pelosi attacked suggestions by Trump and some of his supporters that the Senate, as soon as the trial opens, vote to dismiss the charges. That would only require a majority vote.

""A dismissal is a cover-up,"" she charged.

Trump was impeached on December 18 when the House voted to formally charge him with abusing his power by illicitly seeking help from Ukraine for his reelection campaign.

He is accused of holding up aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic party's 2020 presidential nomination.

Trump is also charged with obstruction for holding back witnesses and documents from the House impeachment investigation in defiance of Congressional subpoenas.

The White House is steeling itself for a trial that could present damaging evidence against the US leader on national television.

Pelosi had delayed delivering the articles of impeachment to pressure the Senate to agree to subpoena witnesses with direct knowledge of Trump's Ukraine actions, including his chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security advisor John Bolton.

McConnell said that, as with the impeachment trial of president Bill Clinton in 1999, the witness issue will only be considered after the 100 senators -- the jurors in the trial -- hear the prosecution and defense arguments.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-impeachment-articles-heading-for-the-senate-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-impeachment-articles-heading-for-the-senate.html

269,15-1-20,"Imported onions still on the shelf, Govt worried","Indians have shown their clear preference for the desi onions and shied away from lapping up imported onions that the Centre procured to tide over its acute shortage in the country due to unseasonal rain affecting the crop. As a result, nearly 85 per cent of the 18,500 tonnes of onions imported from Turkey, Egypt, European Union and Afghanistan continue to remain in the storage.

A drop in price of the desi variant has posed a challenge to the Centre in disposing of the huge stocks as State Governments are not interested in accepting the supply.

Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Centre is offering imported onions at an average landed cost of Rs 55 per kg and also bearing the entire transportation cost.

Retail onion prices, which were ruling over Rs 100-170 per kg in several cities since the past two months, have started softening now on arrival of imported onions and new kharif crop. However, prices have still not fallen to the normal levels. As per Government data, retail onion prices average Rs 50 per kg in most markets. The data showed onion being priced at Rs 50 per kg in the national Capital but local vendors were selling it for Rs 70-80 a kg.

Asked why prices are still high despite imports, Paswan said, “The imports are being done to improve the domestic supply and check prices. If State Governments are not ready to take the imported onions, what can we do?”

The Centre has contracted 42,000 tonne onion to check prices in the retail market. Of them, a shipment of 5,500 tonne was cancelled before it set on sail in the absence of demand.

A senior officer said that States such as Maharashtra, Assam, Haryana, Karnataka and Odisha have not picked up the imported onions. They had initially demanded 10,000 MT, 3,000 MT, 3,480 MT, 250 MT and 100 MT, respectively. So far, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal Governments have taken the imported onions.

With onion prices shooting over Rs 100/kg in November-December, the Central Government had decided to import 1.2 lakh MT of onions. The official added that States have said the imported onions are way too expensive compared to the onion prices in the domestic market, now that late kharif and early rabi onions have already started arriving.

“Consumers were hoping that the prices of onions will come down after imports from Egypt, European Union and Turkey arrive in the country. However, it seems that there are no takers for the imported onion across India. The taste of imported onions is different from the homegrown ones and consumers are not buying it when domestic onion is available,” said Rajendra Sharma who is biggest supplier of onion in Delhi and NCR areas.

“The Government is worried about its disposal because it is a perishable commodity,” Paswan added.

“Tomorrow, someone should not go to court and say imported onions were rotting,” he said.

According to Consumer Affairs Secretary Avinash Srivastava, 4,000 tonne of imported onions is expected to arrive in the next two days. The next consignment of 8000-10,000 is expected by January 25 and the remaining consignment is expected by the month-end.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imported-onions-still-on-the-shelf--govt-worried-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/imported-onions-still-on-the-shelf--govt-worried.html
270,15-1-20,Google to phase out third-party cookies from Chrome,"Google has announced to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome browser within the next two years.

The tech giant in August last year announced a new initiative (known as Privacy Sandbox) to develop a set of open standards to fundamentally enhance privacy on the web.

""After initial dialogue with the web community, we are confident that with continued iteration and feedback, privacy-preserving and open-standard mechanisms like the Privacy Sandbox can sustain a healthy, ad-supported web in a way that will render third-party cookies obsolete,"" the company said in a statement.

Google said once these approaches have addressed the needs of users, publishers, and advertisers, and it has developed the tools to mitigate workarounds, ""it plans to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome"".

""Our intention is to do this within two years. But we cannot get there alone, and that's why we need the ecosystem to engage on these proposals. We plan to start the first origin trials by the end of this year, starting with conversion measurement and following with personalization,"" said Google.

Users today are demanding greater privacy -- including transparency, choice and control over how their data is used. The web ecosystem needs to evolve to meet these increasing demands.

Chrome will also limit insecure cross-site tracking, starting in February, by treating cookies that don't include a ‘SameSite' label as first-party only, and require cookies labelled for third-party use to be accessed over HTTPS.

""We are looking to build a more trustworthy and sustainable web together, and to do that we need your continued engagement.

271,15-1-20,Why car makers should be afraid of Sony's electric car,"One of the biggest surprises at this year's CES 2020 came in the form of a new concept car unveiled by the entertainment and tech giant Sony - a move that must make traditional car makers worried, says a new report.

According to data-driven market research company Cascend, the car was built by Sony's internal AI and robotics team (who makes their robotic dog, Aibo) with (significant) engineering support from Austria-based automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr.

""With increasing sensors, displays, controllers and infotainment, vehicles are becoming more-and-more like electronics products,"" said the report.

Sony already makes display and infotainment systems which are becoming much more important parts of the car and controls.

Sony also makes high-res CMOS optical cameras and sensors, solid state lidar, radar and time-of-flight sensors -- integrated into an advanced driver assistance system which Sony calls its 'Safety Cocoon',"" the report added.

Called the Sony Vision-S, the concept car is an electric concept sedan.

It comes equipped with a phenomenal 33 different sensors both outside and inside the car, a widescreen display, 360 degree audio, and always-on connectivity, with some pieces coming from industry players like BlackBerry and Bosch.

Vision S is also powered by a ""newly-designed EV platform"" -- engineered by automotive supplier Magna.

""Sony outsourced much of the ""car stuff"" from autoparts makers powered by an EV ""platform"" (supposedly engineered by auto supplier Magna) that Sony expects will be able to power other vehicles (like SUVs),"" the report said.

Electric vehicles are a massive disruption in car-makers' manufacturing processes. Their core technologies around combustion engines, drive trains, suspension and body design (over 100 years of development) aren't particularly relevant.

""And because of this, new EV companies (which aren't traditional car makers) are springing up everywhere,"" said the report.

China understands they can leapfrog traditional car makers (of which they have basically none) to become a powerhouse in EV and are investing heavily.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/why-car-makers-should-be-afraid-of-sony-s-electric-car-2020-01-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/why-car-makers-should-be-afraid-of-sony-s-electric-car.html
272,15-1-20,"Bumrah's yorkers, bouncers surprise Warner","Swashbuckling Australian opener David Warner says he was surprised by the yorkers and bouncers of India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the ODI series-opener here.

Warner, who remained unbeaten on 128 in his team's 10-wicket win against India at the Wankhede Stadium, negated Bumrah's challenge well on Tuesday.

Skipper Aaron Finch also hit a blazing hundred (110 not out) as the Australians romped home with plenty to spare.

Asked how he prepares for bowlers like Bumrah and chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, Warner, one of the best left-handers in the world, said it was all about keeping still.

""It's about being nice and still. I can't imagine someone like Brett Lee running in from almost the boundary and just sort of staggering in there and all of a sudden bowl 150kmph, it takes a while to get used to and that's great skill from Bumrah.

""His (Bumrah's) bouncers surprise you, his yorkers surprise you and then when he bowls the change-up it's very, very difficult, it's like when Lasith Malinga at his prime, he bowled 140kmph and swung them.

""... But you knew you were going to get a yorker or a bouncer but it was how are you going to play that and that's what's so unique,"" added Warner.

Saying that he finds Kuldeep's bowling a fraction slower, he admitted that picking chinaman bowlers was difficult.

""And with Kuldeep (Yadav), he's got great change-ups as well. I find that he's bowling a fraction slower these days, quite different to Rashid Khan who bowls at 100kmph, under lights I think left-arm chinamans are very difficult to pick,"" he added.

Pant is the first international from the country, who has been ruled out after ICC put the concussion protocols in place.

""He (Pant) is ruled out of the 2nd ODI. His availability for the final ODI will be based on how he responds during the rehabilitation protocol,"" BCCI said in a statement.

Pant didn't take the field for the second half of the first ODI here on Tuesday after getting hit on the helmet by a Pat Cummins bouncer, the delivery that brought about his dismissal.

""After getting hit on his helmet while batting in the 1st ODI, Rishabh got a concussion and took no further part in the game. He was then taken to the hospital for overnight monitoring under a specialist.

""He is stable and all his scan reports are clear. He has been discharged from the hospital and will head to NCA, Bengaluru to undergo his rehabilitation protocol,"" the release further stated.

Since the third match is in Bengaluru on January 19, it is expected that a call can be taken after observing his physical condition in the next 72 hours.
