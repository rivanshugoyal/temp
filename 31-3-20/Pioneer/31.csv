0,31-3-20,Politics in Corona exodus,"The reverse migration of daily wagers has made a mockery of the Prime Minister’s call for a 21-day lockdown. What prompted this humanitarian crisis?

There is a strange coincidence, if not synergy, between some Twitter handles calling for the national Government to deal with the Coronavirus health crisis, even though the Union Government enjoys a staggering majority, and the sudden exodus of thousands of casual labour from jhuggi clusters across Delhi on Saturday, March 28. This made a mockery of the 21-day national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 and potentially exposed these fleeing families and those they would meet at the end of their journey to the virus, should any among them be silent carriers of the deadly disease.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal could have used the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to rein in migrants from the beginning. The Lt Governor and collectors of the capital’s 11 districts are also culpable for not realising the developments brewing under their watch and total inaction when exodus began from their respective areas. A new Lt Governor will revive confidence in the city’s shaken populace.

The Prime Minister, however, took control of the situation with Sunday morning’s Mann ki Baat, where he warned that those violating the lockdown are “playing with their own lives” and that a complete lockdown was the only solution in the global pandemic. He regretted the discrimination against medical personnel, who are risking their lives to save others at this critical time and applauded all those providing essential services.

Simultaneously, the National Executive Committee of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, under Section 10(2)(1) directed all State and Union Territory Governments to keep migrants, who left their current domiciles to return to their home towns, in mandatory quarantine at the nearest shelter for 14 days as per standard health protocol. It asked landlords not to press for rents for a month. It was later that Kejriwal appealed to all migrant labourers to remain in their current domiciles and not risk catching the infection or spreading it further. He promised to ensure rations and began thermal temperature checks at the bus stand but Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra said the buses must stop plying and people must be given rations at home.

Such mass movement of people from all parts of the city requires meticulous planning and execution. The Centre must fix responsibility for the DTC ferrying people all over the city when the service is restricted to staff of essential services at fixed hours in the morning and evening. By the time thousands of people had collected at the Anand Vihar bus stand, it was too late to send them back to their clusters. Many had already been dumped at the Uttar Pradesh border, catching Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath by surprise.

However, he had to order 1,000 buses to pick up the homeward-bound and ordered a 14-day quarantine of about one lakh people who had entered the State in the last three days. This means some began coming from Thursday.

All district magistrates were given details (names, addresses and phone numbers) of the new arrivals and 60,000 panchayats were asked to share responsibility for the quarantine. Uttar Pradesh has also sent nodal officers to 12 States to help people from Uttar Pradesh, who have business or employment there.

In Delhi, the national and international media had a field day; usual suspects interviewed poor and hungry people walking home in the absence of transport, taking care not to ask why they were moving around during a nationwide lockdown. Al Jazeera spoke with painter Ram Bhajan Nisar, who set off on foot with his wife, two children and 11 others from Delhi to Gorakhpur village on the Nepal border, 650 km away. He admitted that an overnight bus took the family from the border overpass area on Saturday up to Shahjahanpur district, Uttar Pradesh. From there, they got a ride on a tractor trolley, ate at a gurdwara and hoped to get Government transport to reach their village. Hundreds more have been spotted walking towards Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar, adjoining Delhi.

The Chief Ministers of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have expressed anger at the Delhi Government for facilitating this huge movement of people across the country in defiance of the nationwide lockdown and without any warning to the respective States. Clearly, at this time, there is no need for competitive activism or politics but a coordination between States to save lives.

The first objective would be to disrupt the Bihar administration with an abrupt invasion of thousands of families, who would immediately need food, shelter and Coronavirus screening, even quarantine. Lack of preparedness on this score would embarrass the Nitish Kumar Government in an election year.

If we destroy the efficacy of the 21-day lockdown, the Prime Minister would have no choice but to extend it further. Failure to resume economic activity and get factories, shops, offices and construction activities going as soon as possible will give the economy a jolt from which it would struggle to recover. It is pertinent that the Centre had announced a slew of incentives for the small and medium manufacturing sector, just prior to the lockdown. This sector is a large source of employment and needs to get on its feet fast.

Can there be any other reason for nudging labour from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to quit the capital? It is difficult to say but some have observed that in all the turmoil, the alleged illegal migrants from Bangladesh — both Bangladeshis and Rohingyas — stayed put. They did not express anxiety about jobs or food and shelter during the crisis; nor did they have an urge to go home. Some kind Samaritans were taking care of them.

Whatever the reasons for the reverse migration, it has increased the urgency for the National Population Register (NPR) in order to track migration and job opportunities across the country, which is vital for future economic planning.

1,31-3-20,CM Yogi stresses on total lockdown in UP,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered full lockdown in the state and banned unreasonable movement of people.

The government directed the district authorities to enforce the order in letter and spirit and not tolerate any violation failing which officials would be held responsible for laxity.

This was informed by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi in Lucknow against the backdrop of reports that the chief minister was annoyed with Noida district magistrate and chief medical officer for laxity on their part leading to rise in the number of coronavirus patients in Noida.

“The chief minister has conveyed to all district officials that from now on, no laxity would be tolerated. We don’t want people on the roads during lockdown,” Awasthi said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who reached Noida on Monday afternoon, was annoyed with the authorities and asked them why they did not act against a factory which was responsible for the spread of coronavirus.

The chief minister also visited the isolation centres in Noida and interacted with doctors and others to get firsthand information about the preparations.

Besides, the government also set up special committees for Noida and Meerut to deal with the spurt in coronavirus cases there.

On Tuesday, Yogi Adityanath would be going to Ghaziabad, Meerut and Agra, where most of the COVID-19 patients have been identified.

The number of COVID-19 patients in UP has gone up to 88 with 49 being reported in Noida and Meerut. In Noida, there were 36 reported cases of coronavirus infection of which 31 were linked to a factory while all 13 cases in Meerut had connections with that factory.

Meanwhile, the government cancelled the Ram Navami holiday on April 2 so that banks, financial institutions and treasury could function normally to meet the challenge.

Awasthi said that the situation in Uttar Pradesh was under control as all essential services were functioning normally and people were facing no problem.

“It is an appeal to the people that they should stay where they are and the government will provide all assistance. I can assure that no one will starve in the state,” he said.

The additional chief secretary said that authorities in every district had acquired complexes to house migrant workers and others, while hotels had been taken over for doctors and para-medical staff.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-yogi-stresses-on--total-lockdown-in-up.html
2,31-3-20,"Censured by Yogi, Noida DM applies for 3-month leave","Annoyed with the dressing down from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida), BN Singh, shot off a letter to Chief Secretary RK Tiwari, demanding a three-month leave, saying that he be relieved of his charge with immediate effect.

During his visit to Noida on Monday, the chief minister was annoyed by the laxity of district officials leading to rise in COVID-19 patients in Noida.

Once the video showing Yogi scolding the district magistrate was aired by news channels, Singh decided to go on long leave.

In the video, the chief minister was seen angrily telling district official that due to their laxity, the situation was so bad in Noida.

During the meeting, Singh reportedly told the chief minister that he had been working for 18-19 hours on a daily basis but now questions were being raised on his functioning.

The chief minister was annoyed at no action being taken against Cease Fire company (selling fire extinguishers) in Noida, where 31 people were infected with coronavirus. Earlier, a British national working for the company had visited the Noida factory premises and stayed there for some days and when he returned to London, he tested positive for COVID-19.

“You should have closed the factory immediately after the first case but your laxity led to such spread of the virus,” the chief minister said.

After the meeting, Singh sent the letter to the chief secretary, demanding that he be relieved with immediate effect.

The letter said, “For personal reason I don’t want to continue as the DM of Gautam Buddha Nagar. Please sanction me three months’ leave”.

He also said that a new district magistrate be appointed immediately in the district so that government action to control coronavirus was not hampered.

3,31-3-20,Yogi writes to all CMs to take care of UPites,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath shot off letters to all chief ministers of the country to take care of natives of Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown period so that they did not migrate to their home state in large numbers at this crucial juncture .

In his letter written separately to all chief ministers, Yogi appealed to them to provide all help to UP natives and also assured that his government was taking care of people of other states by providing them all facilities.

“In this time we should unite and fight against coronavirus and make the lockdown successful so that the virus could be contained and defeated,” Yogi said in his appeal.

Yogi also gave the chief ministers the names and phone numbers of nodal officers appointed by the UP government to deal with problems of natives of different states.

“We should ensure that people should stay where they are and as a government we will take care of them,” he said.

The appeal was issued after lakhs of migrant workers took to the streets violating lockdown and marched towards their villages on foot. Experts said that the exercise defeated the principle of social distancing.

“I again appeal to the people to stay where they are and the government will provide all basic necessities,” Yogi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-writes-to-all-cms-to-take-care-of-upites.html
4,31-3-20,DyCM holds video conference with traders,"In view of the 21-day lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma called upon traders to ensure the availability of essential commodities for common people, particularly the poor and vulnerable sections, and refrain from over charging.

Speaking to trading community leaders in several district through video conferencing, Sharma said that grocery and medicine dealers were fulfilling their responsibilities like warriors in this hour of crisis.

Appreciating assistance in food supply, Sharma said that vyapari mandal should ensure that prices of essential commodities do not rise.

He said that the government was relentlessly working at its level to ensure adequate availability of essentials as there was no restriction on movement of trucks.

The deputy chief minister said that the government had taken measures to ensure the availability of essential commodities and relief to the poor.

He, however, said that the government alone could not do everything and cooperation of civil society and traders community were crucial during the difficult times.

Trader leaders of Lucknow, Banaras, Agra, Lakhimpur, Sitapur, Banda, Jalaun, Unnao, Ghaziabad, Sultanpur, Orai , Prayagraj, Noida, Barabanki, Shahjahanpur, Rai Bareli, Jhansi, Saharanpur, Mathura also raised the problems being faced related to movement of goods to their retail stores as district administration had not issued passes to them.

The trader leaders also demanded suspension of fixed charge on commercial power connections for three months.

5,31-3-20,CM transfers wages to accounts of 27.15L MNREGA labourers,"NREGA funds to labourers

Giving further respite to daily wagers during the lockdown to prevent coronavirus spread in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath transferred Rs 611 crore to over 27.15 lakh labourers engaged in schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) on Monday.

The chief minister also interacted with MGNREGA workers of Bahraich, Varanasi, Sonbhadra and Deoria through video conferencing and also informed them about the initiative.

“You will also get three months’ free ration and free LPG cylinders under Ujjawala scheme,” he said and asked them about problems they were facing during the lockdown.

While interacting with the labourers, Yogi said the government was committed to looking after the well-being of the people and even spoke to a woman labourer, Sansita Devi of Varanasi, in Bhojpuri.

The chief minister said that at a time when the whole world was terrified of the global pandemic, the Rural Development department and State Bank of India had jointly sent Rs 611 crore to the accounts of more than 27.15 lakh MGNREGA workers of the state.

“By looking at the situation of migrating labourers due to the lockdown, one can easily guess what the value of this money is for them. In fact, self-employment oriented schemes will play a big role in leading to economic independence,” he said.

Yogi said that the Union government was also making efforts to provide 1 kg of pulses per month for the next three months and free cooking gas cylinders for three months to labourers under Ujjwala scheme.

“The state government has also made a provision of providing free food grains to more than 80 lakh MGNREGA workers. This is important for benefiting 80 crore poor people by these schemes all over the country. Besides, all women beneficiaries who have accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana will get an additional amount of Rs 500 per month,” he said.

Apart from this, the Union government would provide Rs 1,000 per month to old age, destitute women and handicapped pension holders for three months.

The chief minister said that during the last three years, Uttar Pradesh had achieved major goal in the creation of man-days (manav diwas) under MGNREGA schemes. A total of 15.69 crore man days were created in 2016-17 while 24.32 crore man days have been made available in 2019-20.

“The government will be successful in providing package to all needy poor, farmers and citizens in a time-bound manner through welfare schemes crafted for the poor by the Central and state governments,” he added.

The UP government is already giving Rs 1,000 to all registered 20 lakh daily waged labourers of the state.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-transfers-wages--to-accounts-of-27-15l--mnrega-labourers.html

7,31-3-20,Migrant workers sprayed with bleach in Bareilly,"Battling numerous problems due to lockdown to contain coronavirus spread, migrants workers returning home were further humiliated when they were asked to sit in rows and then sprayed with chemicals in the name of sanitisation at Bareilly bus stand on Sunday.

The workers included men, women and even children.

The shocking Sunday incident came to light when a video went viral on social media on Monday.

As per reports, a large number of migrants, who trudged to Bareilly from Noida and Delhi, were told by officials to sit in rows at Bareilly bus stand and promised that they would be given food, sanitised and transported to their destinations by buses.

One of them, Mohd Afzal, said, “About 50 of us were sitting and waiting for food and bus at the Satellite bus adda when some men in protective suits came and began spraying water on us. They said that they were from sanitisation team and were sanitising us. The children began crying and the women were shocked.”

Sources said that the sanitising team sprayed a diluted mixture of sodium hypochlorite which is a disinfectant and also used as bleaching agent in laundry, textile, detergents and paper and pulp industries.

Afzal, a resident of Shahjahanpur and working as a courier boy in Noida, said that after the spray, children complained of itching in their eyes while some women developed rashes.

“The chemical had a strange smell. After this, most of us left Bareilly and decided to continue our journey on foot,” he said.

Many of those admitted for first aid in hospital were now waiting for administration to make some arrangements so that they could proceed further for their native villages.

Meanwhile, Bareilly District Magistrate Nitish Kumar directed the chief medical officer to provide treatment to those who were sprayed with sodium hypochlorite on Sunday.

In a tweet, Kumar stopped short of apologising and admitted that nagar nigam and fire brigade personnel became over-zealous in their drive and sprayed chemical on the people.

He said that a probe had been ordered and action would be taken against the guilty.

Meanwhile, the apex child rights body, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) demanded disciplinary and penal action against officials responsible for forcefully sanitising a group of migrants with chemicals in Bareilly. It also asked the Bareilly district magistrate to submit a report within three days.

“The NCPCR has taken a serious view of this inhuman act. In view of the incident, you are requested to get the matter probed urgently and issue necessary directions for immediate action thereby, ensuring adequate arrangements of basic essentials to the families viz. provision of food, shelter and safety and well-being of these children of migrant workers during lockdown,” a NCPCR letter to Bareilly district magistrate said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/migrant-workers-sprayed--with-bleach-in-bareilly.html
8,31-3-20,Indian solutions,"Home grown test-kits and geo-fencing of COVID-19 suspects show why we need to prioritise the sciences, R&D

If indeed, as Plato famously said, “Necessity is the mother of invention,” then the Coronavirus pandemic has certainly brought out Indian innovation at its best. To begin with, a team at IIT-Bombay and professional and experienced members among the alumni recently developed an app for mobiles called ‘Corontine,’ which would help the authorities keep track of potential or suspected asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 if they were to leave their quarantine zone. This has been done by creating what the techies are calling a “geo-fence” to keep tabs on people who had travelled abroad since February-end and had been advised home quarantine for a minimum of 14 days to see if they develop symptoms. The self-quarantine was not just for those who travelled abroad, but also for the people they came in contact with after returning, including friends and relatives. Asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 have been a cause of concern for the medical community globally and in India, too. Particularly as there have been several cases in the country where people escaped quarantine and mingled with the masses, irresponsibly increasing the potential risk of community transmission of the contagion. Then there was Minal Bhosale, a virologist from Pune, who with the help of her team created the first Indian testing kit for the virus, just a day before she gave birth to a baby girl. The test was delivered in a record time of just six weeks and the first batch has now hit the markets, making for a quick and affordable option. The engineering teams based at the automaker Mahindra and Mahindra’s Mumbai and Nashik manufacturing plants developed an Ambu bag ventilator in 48 hours that will cost just Rs 7,500. This indigenously-developed bag valve mask is a self-inflating device that is typically used to help patients with breathing problems and will be an answer to India’s worry over the shortage of ventilators for Coronavirus patients. Now, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is trying to develop “multi-patient ventilators”, wherein several patients can be supported by a single ventilator to meet the huge demand if the Covid-19 outbreak goes out of control as India has only 40,000 ventilators as of now.

This goes to show that when push comes to a shove, in times of crisis, the Indian spirit and mind kick into overdrive to find answers to questions which puzzle the world even today. All around the world, Indian minds are revered and are often even found at high-ranking positions in the fields of science and discovery at the most prestigious institutions. This also points out to the lack of research and innovation facilities and incentives at home. The most brilliant of Indian minds usually flourish the most once they have been recognised by foreign institutions, which value their ideas more than the Indian ones. It is no mystery that the Indian education system does not leave much breathing room for innovation and critical thinking. The education system needs to be overhauled to promote critical thinking and innovation in various fields instead of the basic level of education and knowledge, which is forced upon students. In the absence of a higher education system that is application-based and which encourages breakthrough ventures, we will always remain plagued by mediocrity. The onset of the Coronavirus is something which brought out the best in our scientists and innovators at home. With one of the youngest populations of the world, if nurtured correctly and effectively, we understandably have the potential to become a superpower but the need of the hour is innovation in the field of science. The Government needs to back the sciences to encourage critical thinking and promote research as very few of our premier educational institutions take part or are quoted in global studies. As the recent crisis has shown, what we consign as social sectors in national budgets, namely health and education, need to be accorded a much higher priority. At the same time, amid all talk of immunity, our Ayurvedic sciences can be revived to inculcate a holistic health culture. India has overcome problems before and it surely will do so again when everyone works together and puts human life above everything else. In the end, the battle is ours to fight; nobody else will do it for us.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-solutions-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/indian-solutions.html
9,31-3-20,Looking for positives,"Maybe India should look at this period as an enforced de-addiction time

While Kerala might have the most number of confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain that has put the entire nation under a lockdown mode, there has only been one confirmed death due to respiratory illness associated with the virus at the time of writing. However, according to a news story, ever since the lockdown came into effect, seven people have reportedly committed suicide due to the non-availability of alcohol in this State. This led to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan allowing the sale of limited alcohol to those people having withdrawal syndrome though they must provide a doctor’s prescription. One wonders how those, who want liquor in the State, will find the doctors to issue them prescriptions when the medical fraternity itself is overwhelmed treating Coronavirus patients. Moreover, it is questionable if a medical practitioner is allowed to prescribe alcohol as a medicine to treat de-addiction. It is not just Kerala, alcohol shops are shut down across the country with only some people lucky enough to have stocked up before the nation went into complete lockdown. The situation is similar elsewhere, too, with paan and cigarette shops shut in most places. Once a flourishing trade for recreational purposes, the sale of addictive drugs is also in lockdown with other vice trades equally badly hit. But not getting your daily dose of whatever your vice is should not be an opportunity to mope or moan. Whether it is not having your daily pack of smokes or two pegs of whisky, maybe people with an addiction should use the coming couple of weeks constructively and try and wean themselves off them. One would not make an argument to quit but attempts must be made to reduce consumption. It should not become the case that the day the lockdown ends, everybody rushes to the liquor store to get themselves some beer.

This newspaper understands that some individuals would have built up a physical addiction to drugs or alcohol. Such people must be helped in such times but the system, just like that for being out in public, must not be abused. And that is for the addictive substances available legally; the illegal drugs must be flushed out of India. Now with the borders closed and flights effectively banned, the inflow of such harmful substances has come to an end. Of course, this will not stay the case forever. The moment things open up, people will go back to their old ways. But even then, consuming a bit less may not be a bad thing for all involved. If people can take this time to quit, all the better.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/looking-for-positives-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/looking-for-positives.html
10,31-3-20,Desperation and deprivation,"Amid the prevailing lockdown, the afflictions of migrant labourers are being compounded during their long trek home and some are being beaten up and tortured by police

If the pitiful sight of a father walking with his ten-month-old infant on his shoulders, for over 100 km in this heat to reach his hometown, does not shake us, then it raises serious doubts about humanity and its future. If the death of a 38-year-old worker after walking for 200 km and the predicament of tens of thousands of jobless, shelterless, hungry, thirsty and helpless migrant workers yearning to return to their villages amid the rapidly proliferating Coronavirus outbreak and the resultant countrywide lockdown, does not receive our empathy, then humanity’s opportunism is well-established.

Amid the prevailing threat of the contagion, the afflictions of the voiceless poor are being compounded and some are being beaten up, tortured, made to do sit-ups, locked up in overcrowded makeshift prisons, while others are being punished through other “innovative” ideas of violence, by those who are supposed to protect the people, the police.

If the authorities have become thankless to the extent that they have forgotten the contribution of informal workers towards the growth of the economy, here are some insights: India’s labour market is dominated by informal employment and constitutes 90 per cent of the total workers involved. Out of the total 47.1 crore workers in 2017-18, the number of informal workers stood at 42.4 crore. They contributed almost 50 per cent to the national income as per a Confederation of Indian Industries’ report.

The rise in urbanisation is a consequence of demographic explosion and poverty-induced rural-urban migration. As per the estimates of the Economic Survey, 2017, the magnitude of inter-State migration in India was 90 lakh annually between 2011 to 2016, while total internal migration was about 13.9 core. If this trend continues, the total number of migrants would be around 21.1 crore by 2020-end. Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar are the two biggest source States, closely followed by Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. On the other hand, the main destination States are Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.

Most workers had migrated in search of livelihood and were involved in low-paying informal work in urban destinations in sectors such as construction, hospitality, textiles, manufacturing, transportation, services and domestic work. Lacking any social or income security, they are not only exploited, ignored and disrespected by their employers but also by the political class, as they hardly translate into votes. With their livelihood threatened by the lockdown and future uncertainties, no wonder they are forced to tread the long road to their hometowns and villages on foot.

At this moment of crisis, coupled with their enforced alienation from the cities, they might not even know if they are also Coronavirus vectors. It can only be hoped that amid the thousands walking alone or with families, children or lining up at shelters and bus stations, with no practical scope for social distancing, there is no one in the crowd who is infected. If it is otherwise, India would become the new epicentre of the outbreak in no time at all, thanks to our inept healthcare system and infrastructure.

Add to this forced exodus the fact that the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-(DAY-NULM), which could come to the rescue of these workers, suffers from several inherent challenges. For instance, for the last 18 months the Government has been mulling over the idea of outsourcing the upkeep of the livelihood mission to corporates and philanthropic institutions. This implicit failure of the Government that led to the generation of such an idea is further amplified by hiring big private consultants as project monitoring units, having a “corporate-style target achievement attitude.” Further, the inconsiderate approach of the authorities during times of economic slowdown, when the migrant workers are the hardest hit, is evident from the meagre increase in the budgetary allocation for DAY-NULM vis-à-vis the flagship schemes of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). It was Rs 750 crore (in 2019-20) and was raised by only six per cent to Rs 795 crore in 2020-21. The deep-seated contentions in DAY-NULM do not stop here. Several private players and NGOs have been roped in to carry out different implementation functions for which they have tendered huge sums of money. The irony is that these agencies are bearing the brunt of corruption in the bureaucratic system leading to deferred payments for months and years even after fulfilling their work assignments punctually. The complacency in the approach of the various projects sanctioned under DDU-NULM has remained without any independent third-party monitoring and evaluation.

Given that the Government did its best to arrange special flights across the globe to bring back well-heeled citizens, it is unfortunate that it has turned a blind eye to the plight of the migrant workers. This only represents the deep-rooted systemic contempt and neglect of the vulnerable and the poor.

Though a delayed announcement, there is no denying that the nationwide lockdown is the need of the hour. However, the decision should have been accompanied with a well-crafted draft strategy for each and every section of this diverse country. Unfortunately, as time unfolded, there was no such strategy. However, while ordering everyone to stay at home during the lockdown period, the homeless and those who would be rendered homeless by the shutting down of their sources of employment, seem to have been forgotten.

As the country is bracing for an economic bloodbath with loss of millions of jobs and scramble for food and water for survival and the impending scorching summer, these migrant workers would be the hardest hit once the infection starts to spread among them. The poverty and suffering of all those dependent upon them will increase due to the lack of a source of income. Plus, home isolation will be difficult to attain as large families live in small, closely-packed houses in areas of high population density. This will add to the burden of the already inept public healthcare system and ultimately impact the private and the public sector and hit their bottomlines and profits.

Some of the immediate steps for containing the spread of Coronavirus and saving the lives of informal workers are as follows. The administration must work with various State Governments to arrange district-wise special sanitised trains and buses to send the workers to their respective homes. These means of transport must be equipped with non-perishable food items and water for the passengers.

A pre-boarding health check-up must be done and those showing any COVID-19 symptoms must be prohibited from travelling and referred to the nearest Government hospital.

If the transport cannot be organised, decent accommodation with food, water and sanitation must be arranged. The hotels, guest houses, stadiums, expo centres and so on must be made available. At present, nobody is using them anyways.

Devise and implement an immediate monetary compensation plan through cash and direct incentives for the circular and seasonal migrant workers who have lost their jobs. This must be done on an urgent basis by at least tripling the budgetary allocation of DDU-NULM and immediate transfers. Expand the DDU-NULM component of Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH) to meet the decent space and shelter requirements along with catering to the shelter needs of women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities; community kitchens; medical help; in-kind assistance through public distribution systems, water and toilets. This must be developed with service-level benchmarking standards to combat pandemics like COVID-19. This is not a daunting task and only requires passion and keenness of the authorities.

In light of the worsening situation due to COVID-19, information and communication technology (ICT) and research and data analytics must be harnessed and made to work in tandem with the Government on a war footing to ensure that comprehensive efforts being undertaken to test, trace, treat and combat the pandemic reach all sections of society, including the vulnerable and poor migrant workers. This approach will go a long way in ushering in BR Ambedkar’s egalitarian ethos in the country, upon which the Constitution of India rests.

To conclude, as the predictability of life is increasingly being compromised, the virtuous unity of a decisive leadership, mass cooperation and mutual trust will win the fight against the Coronavirus and flatten the curve in India. It is high time that educated Indians, those at the helm of the Government, the private sector and civil society organisations show some sensitivity and generosity and arrange for a safe transit and compulsory 14-day quarantine of migrant labourers in their respective States. Testing times like these and the brewing humanitarian crisis will either solidify the trust of the people in the Government or establish the narrative that the latter exists not for them but just to use them.

11,31-3-20,Good to bury the hatchet,"A new beginning seems to have been made with the conditional release of Begum Zia by the Bangladeshi Govt due to the COVID-19 outbreak

The COVID-19 outbreak has brought nearly the whole world to a standstill and its impact on geopolitics has grabbed worldwide attention. However, very little consideration has been given to the impact of the pandemic on a country’s internal politics. Amid all the gloom and doom, Bangladesh is the first country in South Asia or perhaps the world, where the spread of the pandemic has had a positive impact on the nation’s politics.

The rivalry between the two major political parties of Bangladesh is legendary and the fact that the ruling Awami League (AL) and the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have no love lost for each other, or even a common meeting ground, is no secret. However, a few days ago, keeping aside political rivalry, the ruling AL Government released the ailing Begum Khaleda Zia, chairperson of the BNP and two-time former Prime Minister from prison on humanitarian grounds. The leader was freed for six months to allow her to undergo urgent medical treatment.

Zia was serving a five-year prison term following her conviction in a case of financial misappropriation related to a charitable organisation named after her husband and former military dictator General Ziaur Rahman. The release of Begum Zia was welcomed by the people of the country and raised new hopes for a transformation of the country’s bickering politics from one that is more issue-based. Begum Zia is 74-years-old and is suffering from multiple chronic ailments like diabetes and arthritis. The BNP had been claiming that her health was deteriorating and had been stressing on the urgency for her release for treatment. Earlier, her bail petition was denied and the BNP’s plea to the Government for her release was also overlooked. Now, presumably, the spread of the Coronavirus has significantly changed the AL Government’s approach on the issue and Begum Zia was released after completing half of her sentence, i.e. two-and-a-half-years.

Analysing the Government’s motive behind the decision to free the incarcerated leader, political observers of the country opine that considering her advanced age, Begum Zia belonged to the most vulnerable group of people who could be affected by the Coronavirus and the Government wanted to avoid any unpleasant situation concerning her. Like other countries, the Coronavirus has spread in Bangladesh, too. There have been 49 confirmed cases and five people have already died. The huge influx of expatriates from various nations has increased the risk factor for the country, hence, the Government’s concern. However, there are conditions attached to Begum Zia’s release and restriction has been put on her travel abroad. Given the strict border controls put in place by most nations after the outbreak of the pandemic and banning of foreigners’ entry in a desperate bid to limit the spread of the Coronavirus, such restrictions by Dhaka hardly make any major difference.

Begum Zia will be confined to her residence in Dhaka and will be treated by Bangladeshi doctors. Given that social distancing is being considered as the most optimal preventive measure against the spread of the contagion, her presence in the country is no cause for worry for the AL Government as her party and supporters cannot derive any mileage out of it in these times of lockdowns.

The release of Begum Zia, however, raised some scepticism about her party’s astuteness in leveraging the situation to rise again politically. Most Bangladeshis are hoping that amid the current situation and its criticality globally and nationally, the political parties of the country will not precipitate any political crisis or unrest and act responsibly. Any effort by the BNP to capitalise on the situation will be closely watched by the common man as well as the Government to prevent any untoward situation in these critical times.

Apart from helping in the Government’s concerted fight against the pandemic, political stability will also contribute in strengthening the country’s relationship with its neighbours, especially India, with which it shares two-thirds of its border. More often than not, the bilateral relations between New Delhi and Dhaka have been a victim of the rivalry between the two political parties. It has been used by the two political parties to criticise each other. Normally, Indo-Bangla ties are perceived to be at their best during the AL’s rule, nevertheless, India has always maintained a cordial working relationship with the BNP regime, too. But it is always a tightrope walk for the mandarins in the Ministry of External Affairs. Political stability in Bangladesh is also a cherished dream of India as it enhances the well-being of the people of the country as this adds to the regional prosperity and security.

Humanity is passing through the biggest challenge of the century and the fight against Covid-19 demands cooperation of all. Hope, the political parties in Bangladesh will join hands in fighting this crisis and create a new history that will contribute in enhancing the safety and prosperity of their nation. This will also enhance Bangladesh’s global image as the world has started taking notice of it due to its improved and growing economy.

12,31-3-20,Employ high-tech for climate change adaptation,"To combat the impact of global warming, it is vital to improve innovation in providing support for new technologies in the water sector, in devising innovative instruments for enhancing groundwater storage and ensuring active participation of various stakeholders, including the private sector

The disastrous effects of human-induced climate change are now a reality. Across the world, there is an effort to maintain global warming below 2°C over the century relative to pre-industrial level. The impacts of climate change on water are predicted to be many: Extended summer season causing less rainy days, late onset of the monsoon season, intense precipitation, the recurring occurrence of drought and flash floods, glacier melts and heavy snowfall during winters. Each of these phenomena influences the water resources on Earth.

Glaciers form an integral part of India’s water resource system. Over 9,000 glaciers are the sources of major Indian rivers like the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra and thousands of their tributaries. Meltwater from glaciers sustains river flows during the summer and ensures year-round water availability in these river basins. With increasing temperature, enhanced melting of glaciers has been recorded and over the last four decades they have been reduced by 0.2–0.7 per cent annually.

According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the normal rainfall pattern in the country has changed from 1951-2010. There is an increase in total rainfall in western and eastern India while it has decreased in States in central and northern India. Major States showing a decrease in annual rainfall are Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, while West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar are showing an increasing trend in annual rainfall. UP, the most populous State of India, is now receiving reduced rainfall in all seasons while Bihar and West Bengal, two of the most densely-populated States of the country are receiving increased rainfall in almost all the seasons.

Although India has 1.91 km3/year of total freshwater resources, it ranks 132 in per capita water availability in the world. The per capita annual availability at 1,545 cubic metres is touching the water-stressed benchmark in India.

The spatial and temporal distribution of water resources is highly uneven with per capita water resource availability varying from basin to basin. In the Brahmaputra river basin, it is 17,000 m3, while it is 240 m3 in the Sabarmati basin in western India.

The impact of climate change on India’s water resources presents a major challenge for the success of Government schemes like Jal Jeevan Mission and achievement of the United Nation’s (UN’s) Sustainable Development Goals of ensuring universal access to safe drinking water. Changes in precipitation will have a significant influence on the design of hydrological structures, flood and drought management and urban planning and development. India’s agrarian economy, which relies heavily on the monsoon and available water for production, is particularly vulnerable to the projected climate changes.

For mitigating the impact of climate change on water vulnerability, the storage of water in many forms is highly desirable. India’s per capita water storage capacity is one of the lowest in the world. It is also not always a sustainable option. In that case, enhancing the groundwater storage should be a viable option.

Interestingly, technologies play a significant role in minimising water variability to climate change impacts. The UN recognises that technologies for adaptation could be either in the “hard” form, involving materials or equipment, or in the “soft” form, like diverse forms of knowledge, new insurance schemes or crop rotation patterns.

Also, for efficient adaptation to climate change, a combination of technologies is required — “traditional”, like conventional methods of water conservation; “modern”, like drip and sprinkler irrigation systems; as well as “high” technologies like remote sensing and Geographical Information System.

The “three Rs” — reduce, reuse and recycle — concept still holds tremendous opportunities not just for ensuring water security but also for the adaptation to climate change impacts. The entire spectrum of adaptation technologies in the water sector in India needs to focus on these “three Rs”. To reduce the wastage of water, the efficiency of water usage needs to be improved —especially in the agriculture sector (water use efficiency in this sector is about 38 per cent), which is the biggest consumer of water. Changes in cropping patterns, crop rotation as well as efficient drip and sprinkler technologies, need to be adopted on a much wider scale than the present. Rather than trying to transfer water from distant sources, the focus should be to exploit local resources by harvesting rain or stormwater and treat wastewater locally, using “green infrastructure” such as sand filters and wetlands.

Similarly, technologies like “Air to Water”, condensing atmospheric moisture to provide drinking quality water, need to be provided the strong impetus, which has the potential to provide sustainable water sources at the local level. This technology also saves groundwater resources. Also, for the success of programmes like Jal Jeevan Mission, the focus should be on conservation and utilisation of “green water”, which is the precipitation that is absorbed by soil and plants and subsequently returned to the atmosphere through plant transpiration.

For climate change adaptations, it is essential to improve innovation in providing support for new technologies in the water sector, in devising new instruments for enhancing groundwater storage, financing water sector projects and ensuring active participation of various stakeholders including the private sector.

13,31-3-20,"PUNJAB EXTENDS CURFEW TILL APR 14, SEALS BORDERS","As the fight against COVID-19 continued on war footing, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday ordered sealing of the State’s borders besides announcing extension of the curfew till April 14.

In view of the same, Capt Amarinder asked the Finance Minister Manpreet Badal to come out with a contingency financial plan to overcome COVID-19 crisis, and ensure an uninterrupted medical and essentials supply pipeline in the current battle which “would be a long-drawn one and would need more support from the Government of India”.

In another significant decision, the Chief Minister also allowed the Local Bodies Department to extend, by three months, the services of the 2000-odd sanitation workers, who were due to retire on March 31, in order to deal with the prevailing situation.

The decision to seal the State’s border was taken by the Chief Minister following the state DGP Dinkar Gupta’s proposal for the same to check the people’s inflow, especially from Haryana.

Since both Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir had locked their borders, people hailing from these States and stranded in other places were entering Punjab, the DGP pointed out, seeking the Chief Minister’s permission to block the borders.

The Chief Minister, during a video conference to discuss and review current situation in the light of COVID-19 crisis and the curfew restrictions in the State with the Ministers and top officers, directed all the concerned departments to intensify their efforts to check the spread of disease, and ensure that all essential supplies and services are maintained.

He also ordered strict enforcement of the curfew, especially in rural areas, amid reports that gatherings continued to take place in villages.

“All restrictions should be strictly enforced till April 14, after which the State will decide in line with the Government of India’s further decision,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that the lockdown was the only way to prevent the spread of the disease.

Capt Amarinder said that the state was fully prepared to deal with any contingency and urged all Government departments to continue the good work they had been doing over the past several days.

The Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) Vini Mahajan informed the meeting that mobile testing vans are being made operational to increase testing in Punjab.

Giving details of the state’s preparedness, Mahajan said that 65 more ventilators, more than 1.5 lakh PPE kits and over 47000 N-95 masks, as well as 13 lakh more triple layer masks had been ordered to augment the existing equipment.

“The PPE samples of Ludhiana’s Evershine Company has received approval from the Central Testing Lab in Coimbatore, paving way for orders for the kits to be placed on priority basis. The firm has the capacity to produce 1000 such masks a day, with a lead time of five days. The AstraZeneca India’s donation of 10,000 PPE masks to Punjab has also augmented the supply of masks in the State,” she said.

She apprised the Chief Minister that manpower for 20,000 beds had been identified and their training will start from April 1, 2020, in batches.

Directing the Health Department to take all steps to strengthen anti-COVID machinery, the Chief Minister suggested opening of OPDs of private hospitals to handle other medical emergencies, and asking the Department to take up the matter with the Medical Council of India.

Finance Minister Manpreet Badal stressed the need to press the Centre for immediate release of the GST arrears of the State, and also suggested that every Minister and MLA should donate a month’s salary and all Government employees should give one week’s salary to the COVID Relief Fund.

“Such a decision could not be imposed but appealed for all possible support from Government employees and others to bolster the relief operations further,” he said declaring that all donations to the CM COVID Relief Fund would be exempted from income tax.

The state DGP suggested talking to Deras and private institutes to accommodate the migrant labourers, 80 percent of whom were employed by industries before the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown.

Agreeing, the Chief Minister pointed out that the Government was already in talks with the Radha Saomi Satsang to seek their help in providing shelter and food to the migrant labourers. No migrant should be allowed to remain on the streets, he said, adding that arrangements were being made to accommodate them in schools and other buildings.

Capt Amarinder made it clear that while no general relaxation had been provided to industry and brick kilns to resume operations, they had been told that they could utilize the services of the migrant labourers if they could provide food and shelter to them, while ensuring strict adherence to all COVID-19 related safety protocols.

Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu apprised the Chief Minister that all efforts were afoot to ensure uninterrupted and regular supply of essential commodities and services through the department officials at the people’s doorstep. The department is also taking care of food security of the rest of the country by dispatching daily 60000 MT of food grains from Punjab.

Meanwhile, Principal Secretary Food and Civil Supplies KAP Sinha briefed Capt Amarinder that NFSA beneficiaries would get their full entitlement till March 31, and under the PM Garib Anna Yojana, distribution of additional allocation of wheat and dal for the next three months shall also start from April 1, 2020.

It was also informed in the meeting that to cover the population beyond the domain of NFSA and migrant labour in the State, the Government had ordered preparation of 10 lakh packets of containing 10 kgs atta, two kgs dal and two kgs sugar each which would be distributed during this week.

On the issue of rising prices, the Principal Secretary said that the Government was fully conscious of the few reported cases of rising prices of certain commodities because of artificial scarcity created by unscrupulous elements, against whom strict action would be taken.

The Chief Minister was also informed during the conference that all arrangements were in place for procurement of wheat grain, which will commence, after some delay, around mid-April now.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-extends-curfew-till-apr-14--seals-borders.html
14,31-3-20,"Haryana seals its borders, says Home Min Anil Vij","Stating that the movement of migrant labourers has been contained by sending them at temporary shelters, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Monday said that State Government has sealed its borders with Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh, prohibiting people’s entry into the State’s boundary completely, to check the spread of corona virus.

“The time period till April 14 is very crucial for all of us and we all have to fight this epidemic together,” he said.

The Home Minister appealed the citizens to follow the instructions of the Government and the police in letter and spirit and stay inside their homes during the lockdown. When going out in an emergency, people must follow all the norms, including social distancing, he said, adding that the industrialists and factory owners have also been advised to extend all sorts of help to their workers in the given situation.

Vij said that Police officers and jawans posted at various nakas have been directed to provide all possible help to the people especially the poor, homeless, needy and sick ones and send them at Shelter homes by assuring all assistance during lockdown.

Informing that the office bearers of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) have expressed their willingness to help the migrant labourers by providing them shelter, food and other necessary items at its buildings which are available in each 10 kilometres across the State, Vij said that 461 additional temporary shelters have been setup for their stay and food is also being provided with the help of NGO’s, social workers and local administration.

Apart from the Law and Order duty at various check-points, the police personnel and other Government staffs are also providing food and other essential daily needs to the poor and needy ones across the state.

He said that during the lockdown in the State, all public activities except the essential and emergency services are banned. However cargo movement in vehicles is allowed on the State and National Highways.

Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora said a list of migrant workers and labourers from UP, Bihar and Odisha has been shared with deputy commissioners and they would persuade them to move into the shelters.

On Sunday, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar ordered the deputy commissioners to completely seal the inter and intra-state borders, after a large number of migrant workers started walking down from Panipat, Gurugram and Faridabad to towards Delhi on their way home in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

So far 610 FIRs have been registered in connection with violation of the lockdown, 745 persons arrested and 3,407 vehicles impounded.

HARYANA DEPUTY CM WANTS MONITORING COMMITTEE IN EACH VILLAGE

Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of Development and Panchayat Department, has appealed to all Gram Panchayats that by April 14, a monitoring committee should be constituted at each village to fight Corona and ensure social distancing during the lockdown period. He said that in this committee ex-serviceman, retired persons and social organizations in large numbers should be included.

In a statement issued here, the Deputy Chief Minister shared that in past few days he has held several review meeting with all Deputy Commissioners and District Development and Panchayat officers through video conferencing. In these meetings, clear directions were issued to convert the schools, Panchayat, and other public buildings into temporary shelter homes.

Chautala said that now these village-level committees will manage and monitor the sanitization, food and lodging arrangements for migrant laborers and the needy staying in such shelter homes.

Meanwhile, the Deputy Chief Minister has also requested all Sarpanches to take initiative to set up such monitoring committees in their respective villages and also to ensure proper sanitization with sodium hydrochlorides in their respective villages as per the advice of doctors.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-seals-its-borders--says-home-min-anil-vij.html
15,31-3-20,Oppn slams govt for ‘bleach’ sanitisation of migrants,"The inhumane act of Bareilly administration gave ammunition to opposition parties to attack the Yogi Adityanath government over the mishandling of coronavirus prevention and providing succour to thousands of migrant labourers on exodus from Delhi and NCR.

After maintaining studied silence, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati was the first to react on Monday and alleged that there were reports of atrocities on migrant workers.

Taking to micro-blogging site Twitter, Mayawati posted, “Reports and pictures of atrocities have become common in the media but punishing migrant workers by spraying insecticides in Bareilly is cruelty and inhumanity which is extremely condemnable. The government should immediately pay attention.”

Earlier, the BSP chief had hailed the financial package announced by the Centre during lockdown and said that arrangements be made for those who were travelling long distances on foot so that they could safely reach their homes and not be stranded.

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav targeted the Yogi Adityanath government over spraying of migrant workers to sanitise them at Bareilly on Sunday.

“The spraying of chemicals on migrants to sanitise them raised some questions. Has the World Health Organisation given any direction in this regard? How do you treat burning sensation caused by chemicals? What arrangements are there for people to change out of wet clothes? What alternatives are being provided for food that gets wet due to spraying?,” Akhilesh tweeted also tagged the news report with his tweet.

On her part, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra raised the inhumane conduct of Bareilly authorities and asked the Yogi government to not spray chemicals on migrant workers who were already facing hardships.

Senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada also vented his ire on twitter, posting, “The entire nation stands united to fight the situation, but such actions on migrant workers is not acceptable. This will not protect them, but expose them to larger health hazards.

It may be mentioned here that as of now MGM Medical College testing unit can test a maximum of 40 samples daily while RIMS in Ranchi can accommodate 90 in a day.

Gupta along with MGM Hospital senior officials during the inspection of the isolation facility admitted about the need for more ventilators and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).

“We have already placed our requisition with the Central government for 300 ventilators and large numbers of personal protective equipment. But so far we have not received any consignment from Union health ministry,” said Gupta.

The Minister also inaugurated a liquid oxygen plant facility having a capacity of 13,000 liter in association with Praxair India at an estimated cost of Rs 5-crore on MGM hospital premises.

The government hospital has tied up with Praxair India for installation of a liquid oxygen plant. The project entailed an investment of Rs 5 crore which was provided by the state health department.

Liquid oxygen is used to treat respiratory disorders and has been found to be more effective than oxygen concentrators or oxygen cylinders. “Liquid oxygen offers several key advantages over other methods of oxygen delivery,"" he said.

Notably, the 560-bed MGM Medical College Hospital became the second government hospital after Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( RIMS), Ranchi to have the facility of piped oxygen supply.

MGM Medical College and Hospital is a government hospital with the facility of 540 beds. Everyday around 1000 patients come here for treatment. It may be mentioned that State Government governed Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital, is an Indian medical school established in 1964. It is situated in the outskirts of Jamshedpur near Dimna. The college's hospital is located in Sakchi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---icmr-to-give-nod-for-testing-facilities-at-dhanbad--ranchi---.html
22,31-3-20,17 foreigners ‘rescued’ from Hindpiri Mosque,"Police on Monday rescued 24 people, including 17 foreigners, from a Mosque in Hindpiri locality of the city and sent them to an isolation centre at Hotwar. The foreign nationals – from Malaysia, Britain, West Indies, Gambia, Holland and Bangladesh – were reportedly hiding at the place of worship in order to avoid being quarantined amid Coronavirus fear, police said.

Among the 17 foreigners rescued, eight belong to Malaysia, three Britain, two West Indies, two Gambia, and one each from Holland and Bangladesh, police personnel involved in the rescue operation said. The incident comes hardly a few days after 11 foreign nationals, including a few from China, were rescued from a Mosque in Suburban Ranchi’s Bundu subdivision – a finding that had put many places of worship across the State under scanner, police said.

“Acting on a tip off, we conducted the rescue operation post Sunday midnight. We are verifying the details of the rescued foreigners with the immigration office,” said Ranchi Superintendent of Police Saurav. “We can comment on the purpose behind their stay at the Mosque only after getting all the details from the immigration office,” he added.

At a time when the State has prohibited entry of travelers from other States and cancelled all passenger trains, buses and flights to and from Jharkhand, the incidents of foreign nationals taking refuge at different localities, especially places of worship, is a cause for concern, said sources in the Government. Such foreigners who have escaped the quarantine process and gone into hiding may carry the virus to Jharkhand – one of the few States in India that is yet to witness even a single case of COVID-19, they added.

The Government of India has imposed a complete prohibition on travel to India from foreign counties in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has wreaked havoc in some of the developed countries like the USA and Italy. The Government here has asked all travelers from other States to undergo the screening process and then be on home-quarantine if they are found asymptomatic.

The State Government had tested the samples of more than 200 suspects by the time this report was filed and none of them came out positive, officials from the National Health Mission (NHM) said. Besides, nearly 300 people occupied beds in isolation wards set up at different Government and private hospitals across Jharkhand by Monday, they added. While the State has been conducting regular screenings of people who have traveled to Jharkhand from other States in the past one month or so, many doctors and health activists have said that the screening process in place here has lapses that may lead to a large number of undetected cases of COVID-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/17-foreigners----rescued----from-hindpiri-mosque.html

An FIR against Richa and three others were lodged at Colonelganj police station under Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act.

In Hathras, an FIR was registered against two people at Kotwali police station for spreading rumours on coronavirus spread. They had posted a false message on the spread of virus in the district. Presently no COVID-19 positive case has been reported in Hathras.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party believes more in propaganda than doing work and a glaring example of it is Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s show of Monday in which he publicised the help given to over 27 lakh MGNREGA workers by transferring their dues directly into their accounts,” said Congress national spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh. Attacking the chief minister, Singh claimed that the government had extended no extra benefit to the MGNREGA workers but just gave them some relief by clearing their dues pending for last several months.

“The chief minister himself mentioned that he was clearing the dues of the MGNREGA workers,” he pointed.

However, the former Congress MLA also thanked the chief minister for clearing the dues of poor workers when they were badly in need of money. “I am thankful to Adityanathji that he at least cleared the dues of MNREGA workers but I want to ask him when he will show the same sympathy towards the cane growers or farmers who too have pending dues?” he asked.

Singh claimed that the cane growers in UP were yet to receive their Rs 9,000 crore cane dues despite the government’s claim that all the dues had been cleared.

Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced to give financial relief to 54 lakh farmers under PM Samman Nidhi scheme but the farmers were still to receive the money in their accounts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-hits-out-at-govt--over-pending-cane-due.html

38,31-3-20,‘Farmers to follow social distancing while harvesting crops’,"Appealing farmers to go to the fields for harvesting of their crops by following social distancing norms, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Jai Prakash Dalal said that the agriculture department officers have been directed to make all the arrangements ensuring hassle free Rabi procurement season for Mustard starting from April 15, and Wheat from April 20.

He says that to incentivise farmers for staggered and delayed procurement of wheat due to the ongoing lockdown, the government has sent a proposal urging the Central Government to provide incentive ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 125 per quintal to the farmers.

The Agriculture Minister said that to overcome from the shortage of labourers in this harvesting season, the district authorities have been directed to ensure that the combine and other agricultural machinery coming from Punjab and other States are not stopped from entering in the State.

In an interview with ‘The Pioneer’, the Agriculture Minister reveals his strategies to address farmers’ concerns regarding procurement of crops after enforcement of lockdown due to corona virus threat. Excerpts from the interview:

After the announcement of lockdown, how would the farmers harvest Mustard and Wheat and take it to the markets?

Mustard and Wheat are at the maturity stage now. Farmers taking their produce to the mandis for procurement will not be stopped once the season begins. But at the same time, to avoid gathering in large numbers, farmers are being made aware that they are not taking crops together in Mandis. Haryana largely depends on farm labourers from Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and others. They are employed by farmers and the aarhtiyas' commission agents each for harvesting and procurement activities respectively.

Do you think that an acute shortage of labourers and transportation following country-wide lockdown to halt the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, harvesting and procurement of Mustard and Wheat crop has turned into a herculean task for farmers and the State government?

It is true that following lockdown, farmers are facing difficulties to find labourers to cut harvest from their fields in the State. Now, farmers in the State are highly depended on local labourers. We appeal to the farmers to use machines for harvesting and threshing instead. For this, farmers should invite private players from Punjab for the combine and other agricultural machinery for harvesting and threshing of rabi crops. Such machines were also used for the same purpose in previous years too. Only we can ensure that farming machinery coming from Punjab and other States are not stopped from entering in the State. For this, district authorities have already been instructed.

With the announcement of 21-days lockdown, large number labourers are stranded at different places within State. The labour rates have also gone by 25 per cent to 50 per cent. How will you address it?

Farmers have been asked to go to the fields for the harvesting of their crops, provided that they have to follow social distancing norm. They should make an arrangement at their level to cut the harvest from their fields. Many farming families have started harvesting on their own. The Government is mulling to make a new scheme to make for farmers’ losses. Meanwhile, the process to contact the workers of the unorganised sector for providing aid had been initiated and the officials concerned had been directed to ensure that no worker was left out. We have asked the district authorities to provide food and shelter to migrant labourers and the homeless in temporary community shelters in accordance with social distancing norms.

Farmers in the State are worried following unseasonal rain, lack of storage space and closure of shops selling fertilisers and pesticides. What are the steps being taken to mitigate their woes?

Rain at this stage was not required for Wheat crop as it was at the maturity stage. Earlier in March, rain occurred and many farmers had applied for compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. State Government has already announced special girdawari (revenue survey) of rabi crops affected due to rain in the beginning of March. Meanwhile, as many farmers have started harvesting their crops, they have been urged to stock the grain at their homes or other suitable places. In case any farmer faces trouble doing the same, the marketing board has been told to look into the matter. Department officers concerned have been asked to address the issues of fertilizers and pesticides immediately.

Owing to lockdown, the State Government there is delay in procurement of wheat and farmers have a critical problem of storage. Private players may take advantage by procuring their crops at a much lower price. Your comment.

The procurement of Mustard and Wheat was scheduled to begin on March 29 and April 1 respectively, Due to unavoidable reason, dates were extended. The harvesting of mustard has started while that of wheat is also likely to begin in the next few days. Hisar and adjoining districts, including Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad and Mahendergarh, have mustard as the main rabi crop. Some Mustard farming families have started harvesting on their own. Farmers have been asked to stock the grain at their homes till then. As a part of an arrangement, the sheds of Radha Swami Dera Satsang buildings will be used for purchase. Farmers should not be in hurry. The authorities will take cognisance if such cases arise.

What are the directions given to department officers to address farmers’ concerns?

The officers have been directed to keep in mind that procurement of mustard and wheat is only five days apart, there is a possibility that both crops are procured together. To accommodate both the crops, they have been directed to build separate procurement centers apart from the existing mandis.

Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda raised the concerns of farmers over harvesting amid lockdown. He seeks guidelines from the State Government for harvesting and bonus to compensate the farmers. Your comment

We too are concerned on farmers’ issues. With lockdown till April 14, arrangements are being made to start the procurement of mustard and wheat on April 15 and April 20, respectively, if the situation gets favourable. We are in contact with farmer communities and aware about their pertinent issues. Our Government will take all possible steps to resolve their issues. The Government will come out with new scheme to compensate for farmers’ losses.

What are the prices fixed by the State Government for the procurement of Mustard and Wheat from the farmers this year?

This year, the minimum support price for Mustard has been fixed at Rs 4425 per quintal and Rs 1925 per quintal for Wheat. In the mandis, if the bid price of the crops is less than their minimum support price then the difference is compensated under the Bhavantar Bharpaii Yojana.

Does your government have any plan to incentivise farmers for staggered and delayed procurement?

We are working in this direction. The Central Government has been urged to incentivise farmers for staggered and delayed procurement. The procurement of wheat, which was scheduled to begin on April 1, is now scheduled to begin on April 20. In view of the delayed procurement of wheat due to the ongoing lockdown, the State Government has sent a proposal urging the Central Government’s to provide incentive ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 125 per quintal to the farmers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---farmers-to-follow-social-distancing-while-harvesting-crops---.html

Maintaining that the figure of 90,000 NRIs or foreign travellers, as earlier quoted, was wrong, the State’s Special Chief Secretary KBS Sidhu said: “The data that we got from New Delhi was quite delayed and contained duplicates. Apart from having incomplete particulars, the address given on the passport often was an old one and it took time to trace the new abode.”

Sidhu said that each of the 55,669 NRIs are being tracked. “The Deputy Commissioner have adopted a 4T approach — trace, track, test, treat. Our protocol is even more strict than GOI,” tweeted Sidhu from his official Twitter handle.

Notably, the Central Government’s Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, in a letter issued to all the States and Union territories on March 26, had maintained as per the Bureau of Immigration has shared the details of more than 15 lakh international passengers with the States or UTs for monitoring for COVID 19 till March 23, 2020.

45,31-3-20,THR might get delayed in April by few days,"Due to the State-wide lockdown in Uttarakhand, the distribution of the Take Home Ration (THR) by Anganwadi workers might get delayed in April. The THR is generally distributed on the 5th day of every month by Anganwadi workers across the State under Supplementary Nutrition Programme (SNP) of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) to children, pregnant women and lactating mothers for 300 days. However, the THR will probably not be distributed on the said day of the next month because the Self Help Groups (SHGs) who provide the food packages to the Anganwadi centres are incapable of doing the same due to the lockdown in the State.

While talking to The Pioneer, the Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) Anju Badola said, ""The SHGs have told us that they would not be able to pack and send the packages this time due to the lockdown in their areas. They said that they do not have the complete ration which is included in the list of THR. Therefore, it is possible that the distribution of THR might get delay in April by a few days.""

Batakrushna Maharana, the chief carpenter who has been heading the artisans, is a disappointed man. For the first time in living memory, the age-old tradition of Rukuna Rath Yatra of Lord Lingaraj that falls on April 1 this year has been suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The Rukuna Rath Yatra is believed to be “Papa Binashakari Yatra” (which destroys and eradicates all evil and sins). It is the biggest festival of the temple city. The weeklong festival is the high point of festivities in which locals throng with great fervour. This year, a miniature replica of the Rukuna Rath was showcased in the Odisha tableau during the Republic Day parade at New Delhi. The Rukuna Rath Yatra is believed to predate Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra at Puri.

Batakrushna Maharana said 75 carpenters had been working for the last three weeks. Nearly a thousand logs had been collected; new wheels and axles had been made. Four new Nahakas and two new Oras were constructed this year. Five tailors had nearly finished the work. Only the painting of the chariot was to be done.

Another uniqueness associated with the Rukuna Rath Yatra is the auction of Marichi Kund water which is held at the Mukteswar Temple.

However, a highly placed source in the Health Department here rubbished the claims, and said that the hue and cry over ventilators was a result of misconceptions among people. As per figures provided by the countries that are worst-affected by the pandemic, only two to three per cent of patients require to be put on ventilators, he said. “In order to use 200 ventilators, we will have to have around 10000 patients. Right now, we do not have a single case in Jharkhand,” he said.

The Jharkhand chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) claimed that the State may witness an explosion of cases due to the allegedly poor screening process in place, and it may run out of life-saving ventilators. “We may witness an explosion, a blast of cases here,” said Dr. Pradeep Kumar, President of IMA Jharkhand. “The shortage of ventilators has affected developed countries like the US and Italy. The only way we can tackle this pandemic is by not letting it reach a stage where ventilators are required,” he added.

According to figures with the Health Department, the State has a total of 232 ventilators as on March 30. Besides, Health Minister Banna Gupta has asked the Centre to provide 300 more ventilators in order to address medical exigencies, a close aide of the minister said on Monday.

Principal Secretary, Health Department, Nitin Madan Kulkarni said that the State was following all the guidelines laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and paying attention to prevention at present. “We have 232 ventilators and we have placed orders for 300 more ventilators. All the guidelines of ICMR are being strictly followed here,” he said.

Ranchi Civil Surgeon Dr. VB Prasad said that there were around 175 ventilators – including the ones in private hospitals – in Ranchi alone, and cases requiring ventilation would be addressed. “We are trying our level best to be prepared for any medical emergency,” he said.

Meanwhile, doctors from IMA have also raised concern over the screening process in Jharkhand claiming that only a fraction of people traveling from other States were tested. “Only using a thermometer to check a traveler’s body temperature is eyewash in the name of screening. Proper tests should be conducted. So many labourers have come to Jharkhand from severely-affected States and they were sent home without any tests,” said Dr. Pradip Kumar.

According to sources in the Health Department, Jharkhand has around 4000 testing kits. At present samples are collected and tested only at two hospitals – Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MHM) Hospital in Jamshedpur.

For this, management has not brought out any circular; though it is being done with mutual understanding,” he said.

JSW Steel, Tata Steel, JSPL, AMNS India, SAIL and RINL together produce about 45-50 per cent of the country's total steel production annually is also on move to scale down their productions.

Movement of raw material needed for steelmaking is being impacted due to nationwide lockdown. Employees in the industry are facing difficulties in reaching their offices so BSL management has decided to scaled-down it productions, informed MK Dhan Public Relations Officer of BSL.

A cop requesting anonymity said, “For two days we were arranging rice, turmeric, potatoes, salt, edible oil etc to cook khichdi to feed the hungry and now we are to stop our own district men and women not to reach home without getting quarantined which is too good for their health and the health of their families.”

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “Palamu district has inter-district borders and interstate border like Bihar. For our inter district border like with Garhwa and Latehar our strategy is different but for our border with other state my boys and officials are on live wire 24X 7.”

Linda agreed border is too vast, wide and porous besides roads like NH, SH and other rural connectivity there are numerous cross country lanes which to expect orbelieve that a normal resident of Palamu may not be knowing those hidden routes will be to live in delusion.

The SP said, “We are keeping eyes on NH and SH both. I wish forest department officials should alert their forest guards, foresters, rangers to keep a tab on people negotiating any jungle route as well to reach home by ducking their own beneficial health screening.”

Sources said Palamu has irrigational canals at Hussainabad/Mohammadganj and canal routes are the safest passage for clandestine entry. Linda said cops are alert at Mohammadganj, Hussainabad, Dangwar, Harihurganj, which is few meters away from No Man’s Land and thereafter starts Bihar.

SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta said, “We have barrier set up at Satbarwa which opens to Latehar district. Any gathering coming over here will be stopped for screening for health and if then a quarantine in the nearby government building for their safety of lives.”

About 10 migrant workers from Bhamri village in interior part of the tribal Purulia district have been living on tree tops as a measure of isolating themselves from the rest of the villagers, sources said.

The workers had returned from Chennai and unlike in many villages were not immediately pushed outside by the locals for the fear of infection. “We came straight to our village by hiring a vehicle, saw local medic who advised home quarantine. But as our houses are small with no chance of isolation without coming in close physical contact of others we decided to stay on tree top,” said Bijoy Singh Loya.

They made their own abode up on mango trees using bamboo sticks to fabricate planks some three feet by six feet each. “We have spread out bed sheets and using mosquito curtains too,” said another fellow migrant,” adding the villagers are kind enough to provide them with rice and vegetables. “They bring both steaming and puffed rice beneath the tree and we pull the utensils with rope. This is the we have passed several days and hope the remaining one week or so will also pass of by the grace of Marangburu (the tribal god)” said another person adding they will only descend from the trees and go to their village after the doctor give us permission.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP General Secretary Sunil Bansal have asked all party legislators and workers to extend all possible help to the people during the lockdown.

UP Minister Brijesh Pathak has turned his residential phone number into a helpline and has asked people to contact him if they require any help for food. He claims that his control room works round the clock for people who are in need.

Banda BJP MLA Prakash Dwiwedi said that he has provided food to at least 5,000 workers, labourers and homeless people.

He has also set up a control room to facilitate relief work, which includes home delivery of food packets.

Dwiwedi claimed in a press release that he is also providing food to monkeys.

""I have sent two quintals of gram and two quintals of wheat to a local saint along with Rs 50,000. I am doing my bit in this crisis,"" he said.

BJP General Secretary Bansal on Monday asked all party workers to provide food to at least five to 10 families every day at the booth level and send a report to the party headquarters.

Every party worker has also been asked to contribute a minimum of Rs 100 each into the PM-CARES fund.

Majority of the legislators in UP have already announced contribution form their MLA funds for fighting the Covid-19 crisis.

However, some of them are clearly hesitant to go out among the people and supervise the relief work.

Ground reality is it is difficult to get supplies. I do not know if it is hoarded by people,"" Utpal Parrikar told IANS on Monday.

The outreach by Utpal, who is a member of the state executive committee of the Goa Bharatiya Janata Party, comes at a time when the Chief Minister Pramod Sawant-led administration is facing accusations of inefficiency vis a vis ensuring availability of food supplies and basic essentials to hundreds of thousands of Goans across the state who are in a state of panic due to grocery stores running out of stock. The home delivery system initiated by the government, with the help of volunteers from political parties, has also been accused of diverting and hoarding essential goods, releasing them only to party workers and other favourites.

Former Panaji MLA and BJP leader Sidharth Kuncalienkar has also alleged a scam in the diversion of essential goods in the home delivery mechanism devised by the city corporation which is controlled by the BJP.

96,31-3-20,Kerala +ve cases cross 200 amid migrant workers’ unrest’,"As the number of corona virus affected persons crossed the 200 mark by Monday morning, making it the State with the second highest number of afflicted patients, Kerala is faced with a major issue which has been brewing up for days. It is feared that migrant workers across the State may take to the streets demanding better living conditions or for transportation back to their villages.

An aggressive posture by thousands of migrant laborers in Paippadu Grama Panchayat in Kottayam district on Sunday took the State administration by surprise. The migrants, mainly from Bengal and Assam (though the local officials term them as workers from Bangaldesh) took to the streets demanding immediate arrangements to travel back to their native places in the backdrop of the 21-day shut down.

“The workers, mostly from Bangladesh masquerading as they are from Bengal and Assam are upset that they are out of work. Being daily wage earners, they are not in a position to find ways to get two square meals a day,” said Siby Abraham, member, Paippadu Panchayath in Kottayam district. He said there are more than 10,000 migrant workers in Paippadu Panchayth and most of them are in possession of at least a dozen identity cards.

This is not a problem faced by Kottayam district alone. Neighboring district of Ernakulam, the El Dorado of migrant workers, is like a volcano which may burst anytime. Perumbavoor, a small town with nearly 500 registered plywood companies faced tense moments on Monday as local officials reached a labor camp housing migrant workers. Because of the nationwide lock down , all plywood companies, which employ nearly 1,00,000 migrant workers, had laid off the workforce.

Most of the owners of these plywood factories, money spinners in normal time, refused to pay the workers citing the layoff. “There are 1,50,000 migrant laborers in Perumbavoor who are employed in plywood companies, timber mills and eateries. They get anything between Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 per day for a 12 hour shift. The owners of the factories and mills make huge profit but they refuse to pay the workers at least half of their wages in this time,” Subramanian Sasidharan, a timber mill owner , told The Pioneer. He also disclosed that 90 per cent of the workforce is from Bangladesh. “They work sincerely and with dedication. The local youth are reluctant to do manual jobs,” said Sasidharan,

Sunday’s showdown in Paippadu has upset the authorities as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself came out with a statement on Monday. He said some vested interests were instigating the migrant workers. Officials in State police said they suspect the role of a 24X7 news channel owned by a religious group for fomenting troubles at Payippadu on Sunday.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala--ve-cases-cross-200-amid-migrant-workers----unrest---.html

100,31-3-20,Deadly virus seems to be on free run,"The deadly virus seems to be on a free run in Indore as seven new cases were tested positive in wee hours on Monday.

Besides, an Ujjain native who had died three days ago at Madhavnagar hospital Ujjain has now tested positive. With these fresh cases, the total tally of the corona positive cases has risen to 47 in the state. Of these, 27 patients hail to Indore while five are Ujjain natives.

Two other positive patients, one each from Indore and Ujjain, have died days ago.

However, alarmed with the intimidating rise of corona cases in the Madhya Pradesh commercial capital Indore, the district administration resorted to absolute lockdown in the city since Monday closing down all markets of essentials, petrol pumps and milk parlours.

Besides, those engaged in emergency services, no one is allowed to step out of home and those found in breach of preventive orders would be kept in makeshift jails, Indore collector Manish Singh had ordered on Sunday.

Initially the administration had announced that even milk won’t be distributed in the city as part of efforts to break the corona virus chain but soon after locals offered a stiff resistance reminding administration that as per norms, supply of milk canot be stopped. Under pressure, the district administration announced that milk distribution would be allowed for two hours in the evening but with all the safety measures as prescribed by the health administration in the past.

Among others, former Chief Minister Kamal Nath too had flayed the milk ban claiming it falls under essential commodities along with medicines and called the decision highly objectionable.

Hot spots of COVID19 in the city, Khajrana and Ranipura areas were sealed by the administration overnight and sources claimed that police picked up 55 suspects from these areas and kept them in isolation in the night. Around 100 persons were quarantined in Chandan Nagar area.

The police also have restricted the movement of locals in the wake of preventive orders barring those engaged in emergency services, said DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra.

We have booked a patient who had ran away from hospital a day ago under sections – 188, 269 and 270 of IPC.

The 42-year-old positive patient had fled the hospital and was later apprehended by police from Khajrana area.

The district administration has also decided to categorise hospital in various categories and mostly locals would be allowed in green category hospitals where corona patients would not be allowed.

Yellow category hospitals would be reserved for those with corona symptoms and positive patients would be kept in MY Hospital and TB Hospital.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/deadly-virus-seems-to-be-on-free-run.html

102,31-3-20,"India shifts diplomats, staff to Kabul in view of surging corona","Taking a precautionary step, India has shifted its diplomats and staff from its consulates in the Afghanistan cities of Herat and Jalalabad to Kabul in view of the surging coronavirus cases in that country which shares a long border with Iran, one of the worst-hit countries by the pandemic.

Government sources said here on Sunday all Indian staff at the two consulates were brought to Kabul following the swelling number of coronavirus cases in the country.

According to the figures given by the Afghan Government, a total of 110 people have been infected by the virus in the country, although the real figures are believed to be far higher.

Health experts believe the actual number could be higher as several provinces in the country do not have facilities to carry out a laboratory test to check the infection.

Two foreign diplomats and four officials of the NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan were among the positive cases in the country, according to Afghan media reports.

Sources said the Indian staff from the two consulates were shifted to Kabul as the two provinces do not have adequate medical facilities. Afghanistan shares a long border with Iran, which is among the very few countries reporting a large number of coronavirus cases and struggling to combat one of the world's worst outbreaks.

Over 2,500 people have died and more than 35,500 have been infected across Iran since February. There have been reports of a large number of Afghan refugees crossing over to Afghanistan from Iran in view of the deteriorating situation in Iran.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-shifts-diplomats--staff-to-kabul-in-view-of-surging-corona.html
103,31-3-20,Returning migrants a challenge for Bihar,"The migrant labourers returning to Bihar has posed a big challenge to the State Government–to keep them in 14-day isolation to contain coronavirus spread.

Over 45,000 people had reached the UP towns bordering Bihar and more than 100,000 were expected by evening, said a Bihar Disaster Management Department official, here on Monday.

Pratyam Amrit, Principal Secretary of the Disaster Management Department, said, ""Six camps have been set up along the Bihar-UP border. By Monday, we are expecting 1.30 lakh people to reach the borders. We are looking to provide them food and make arrangements for their stay during the quarantine period.""

The state government, he said was taking all precautionary measures even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 21-day lockdown on March 24. After emergence of Covid-19 cases in the state, the government had made arrangements even in the rural areas to provide food and shelter and screen villagers for infection, he added.

But the influx of workers from Delhi has created serious problem the state government. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has expressed displeasure at the migrant workers being sent back to Bihar.

""People from other states are being registered at the disaster border relief camps. Their health is being checked. After food and rest, they are being provided buses by the Transport Department in the district headquarters. Arrangements have been made to send them, "" said another official.

The process could continue for two-three days, he added.

Principal Secretary Deepak Kumar said arrangements were being made to send Biharis coming from outside to their villages. ""All the Block Development Officers, Head of panchayats and sarpanches have been asked to monitor the situation and follow quarantine and social distancing norms,"" Kumar said.

Those who had returned from abroad after March 10 were being investigated. The government has a list of 1,790 such people.

107,31-3-20,NEW DELHI:,"Covid-19 can have fatal consequences for people even without underlying cardiovascular disease or respiratory problems, according to a study published on Monday.

""It is likely that even in the absence of previous heart disease, the heart muscle can be affected by coronavirus disease,"" said Mohammad Madjid, MD, MS, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of cardiology at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

""Overall, injury to heart muscle can happen in any patient with or without heart disease, but the risk is higher in those who already have heart disease,” said the authors cautioning that understanding the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is essential for providing comprehensive medical care for cardiac patients..

The authors in the study, published in JAMA Cardiology explained that research from previous coronavirus and influenza epidemics suggest that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, and the development of, or exacerbation of, heart failure.

In a clinical bulletin issued by the American College of Cardiology, it was revealed that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 for patients with cardiovascular disease was 10.5%. Data also points to a greater likelihood that individuals over the age of 65 with coronary heart disease or hypertension can contract the illness, as well experience more severe symptoms that will require critical care.

According to the study authors, critical cases are those that reported respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure that resulted in death.

The authors also analysed another small retrospective study of 150 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 that evaluated the factors associated with mortality. It was found that cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in patients who died (13 of 68) than patients who survived (0 of 82).

“Among the 68 fatal cases, 36 died of respiratory failure, 5 died of myocardial damage and circulatory failure, 22 died of both causes, and 5 died from undetermined causes.64 Patients who died had higher levels of troponin, myoglobin, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, and interleukin-6. This study is further suggestive of a high inflammatory burden in COVID-19 and a possible rise in myocarditis-related cardiac events.”

The novel virus that causes COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, and by March 11, 2020, the WHO had declared it a global pandemic.

The three most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Other less common symptoms are muscle pain, sore throat, nasal congestion, and headache. Symptoms can appear as soon as two days after exposure to the virus to up to14 days after.

The co-authors of the study ""Potential Effects of Coronaviruses on the Cardiovascular System"" include Payam Safavi-Naeini, MD, of the Texas Heart Institute and Scott Solomon, MD, of Harvard Medical School; and Orly Vardeny, PharmD, of the University of Minnesota.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/new-delhi-.html
108,31-3-20,Muslim donates `5 L saved for Hajj to RSS-linked body,"A Muslim woman from Jammu and Kashmir has donated her savings of Rs 5 lakh, meant for the Hajj pilgrimage, to the RSS-affiliated ''Sewa Bharati'' after apparently being ""impressed with the welfare work"" done by the outfit amid the lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Khalida Begum, 87, who saved Rs 5 lakh for Hajj, was forced to defer her plans for the pilgrimage due to the lockdown.

Hajj is the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest city of Muslims.

""Khalida Begum ji was impressed with the welfare work done by the Sewa Bharati in Jammu and Kashmir during the tough time the country is passing through due to sudden outbreak of COVID-19 and decided to donate Rs 5 lakh to the organisation,"" Arun Anand, head of RSS media wing Indraprastha Vishwa Samvad Kendra (IVSK), said.

The woman wants that this money should be used by the community service organisation Sewa Bharati for the poor and the needy in Jammu and Kashmir. She had saved this amount for performing Hajj, plans for which she deferred due to the present situation, Anand said.

""Khalida Begum ji was among the first few women in Jammu and Kashmir who got educated in a convent. She is the daughter-in-law of Colonel Peer Mohd Khan, who was president of the Jana Sangh,"" he said.

Jana Sangh was also an associate of RSS and later became the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Anand said despite her age, she had been very active in welfare works for the women and the downtrodden in Jammu and Kashmir. Her son, Farooq Khan, a retired IPS officer, is presently serving as an adviser to the Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor.

Meanwhile, since the lockdown was announced, Sewa Bharati volunteers across the country have been providing food and other essential items to the needy.

109,31-3-20,"Centre extends 2% Interest Subvention to banks, 3% Prompt Repayment Incentive to all farmers","In view of several restrictions on farmers during the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus outbreak, the Central Government on Monday decided to extend the benefit of 2 per cent Interest Subvention (IS) to banks and 3 per cent Prompt Repayment Incentive(PRI) to all farmers up to May 31, 2020 for all crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh.

The decision will allow farmers to repay such loans up to the extended period at 4 per cent annual interest without attracting any penalty.

Officials of Agriculture Ministry said that the extension of IS and PRI benefit upto May 31, 2020 on the short term crop loans upto Rs.3 lakh which are due upto May, 31 2020, will help the farmers to repay such loans upto the extended period at 4 per cent per annum interest without attracting any penalty .

Officials said that many farmers are not able to travel to bank branches for payment of their short term crop loan dues. “Moreover, due to restrictions on movement of people and difficulty in timely sale and receipt of payment of their produce, farmers may be facing difficulties in repayment of their short term crop loans falling due during this period,” officials added.

The Centre is currently providing concessional crop loans to farmers through banks. Under the scheme, an additional 2 per cent interest subvention is provided to farmers repaying loans promptly. For such farmers, the effective rate of short-term crop loans works out to be 4 per cent per annum. The objective of the scheme is to make available at ground level, agricultural credit for Short Term crop loans at an affordable rate to give a boost to agricultural productivity and production in the country.

Earlier, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, NCP president and former union minister Sharad Pawar said the the condition of farmers has worsened due to untimely rains and hailstorms in some parts of the country, impairing their repayment capacity. “ The complete lockdown has disrupted agriculture operations due to unavailability of labourers and other resources, leaving standing crops unattended, halting harvesting, and impeding farmers' access to transportation, warehousing, marketing and export”, the letter read.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-extends-2--interest-subvention-to-banks--3--prompt-repayment-incentive-to-all-farmers.html

111,31-3-20,Dreams wait as weddings get cancelled or postponed,"No band, no baaja and certainly no baraat. Dreams of a big fat Indian wedding have faded into the far distance for many a couple who have had to cancel, postpone or downsize their celebrations to the barest minimum.

Like for 26-year-old Delhi boy Harshad Khurana who was all set for the wedding he had always dreamed of on April 8 and now doesn't know what to do. The venue was fixed, theme decided, the cards distributed and his suit stitched too. The threat of COVID-19 started as a little blip before blowing up into a huge cloud of dread and a nationwide lockdown from March 24, ending his hopes for a grand once-in-a-lifetime celebration.

After a day's ‘Janta curfew' on March 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 announced a three-week lockdown.""Who had expected this? There is very little that we can say or do now... Hope everything becomes normal soon. Our last resort will be a truncated function with close family members only,"" Khurana, a PR professional, told PTI.

But that would be minus extended family, no cousins and possibly not even grandparents, and what is a wedding without them.

""You know I also joined a gym to get in shape for the special day, but it was all for nothing,"" he said dejectedly.

Khurana is not alone.

The entire D-Day drill – with months spent on zeroing-in on the menu, haggling over the price of the venue, preparing guest lists, whitewashing the whole house, picking the right jewellery and clothes has come to naught.

Vipul Verma, 38, was set to get married on April 12. The compulsion of a limited gathering and that too without his brother who can't leave Australia due to travel restrictions has led to Verma cancelling his wedding – at least for now.

Particular about 'auspicious dates', Priya Malik has eventually accepted the inevitable and pushed her wedding from April to November-December.

""All of us felt it's better to be safe than sorry, and so decided to postpone the wedding date. We have to call up all our guests and inform them about the postponement date, which is both embarrassing and exhaustive.

""We have made advance payments to so many pre-wedding planners and are not sure if the money will get refunded,” said the 26-year-old IT professional.

COVID-19 alarm bells have drowned out the sound of wedding bells and also the clink of the cash registers for businesses dependent on the wedding industry -- wedding planners, banquet owners, bands, florists, photographers and salons. India's wedding market, pegged at $50 billion by a recent KPMG report, has been badly disrupted due to the spread of the novel coronavirus, said industry insiders. In the Indian way of things, families, poor and rich, save up for a lifetime to spend on weddings that can run into several lakhs and even crores of rupees.

""The business has taken a serious hit due to the spread of the coronavirus.

I have lost count of the calls we have received for postponing and cancelling bookings. For April, we had 20-25 bookings, almost one a day, and there is a big question mark on whether those will happen or not’, said Anmol Bummi, manager at the Golden Gates banquet in west Delhi in Mayapuri.

Several wedding planners and catering units, like Cosmic Lights Entertainment and Kitchen Kraft Luxury Catering, said the business will take a long time to recover.

“March-April have always been good for the wedding business and there were a lot of bookings this year too. But everything changed after coronavirus burst into the picture.

Be it a destination wedding or routine functions here in the capital, all have been either cancelled or postponed,"" said Raina Kapoor, founder of Cosmic Light Entertainment, a popular wedding planning company.

""In fact, the few functions we organised in March saw such low turnout that we had to advise people to not go ahead with their weddings,” she said.

Salons and parlours, which in normal times, would have seen brides and bridesmaids making a beeline for their bridal packages — even at exorbitant price – are also bearing the brunt.

Until a few weeks ago, Neeti Chopra, owner of the Unwind salon in Saket, was busy booking appointments for April.

“From the very beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, our salons were following all kinds of precautions, including using gloves and hand sanitisers. We thought things would become normal soon. But then one day the advisory was issued that all parlours had to shut,” she said.

The number of novel coronavirus cases in India rose to 1,071 on Monday. This includes 29 deaths.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dreams-wait-as-weddings-get-cancelled-or-postponed.html

Earlier, a 65-year-old man from Indore and a woman from Ujjain died of coronavirus here.

""We got a report from a lab of Indore-based Government Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College on Monday morning that the 38-year-old man had coronavirus infection,"" Ujjain's Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr Anusuiya Gawli told PTI.

The man died on March 27 night. He was admitted to Madhav Nagar Hospital of Ujjain in a critical condition and died after an hour of undergoing treatment.

His blood and swab samples were sent for testing as he had virus-like symptoms.

He visited the state's Neemuch district, located close to border adjoining Rajasthan, five days before he fell ill. He came in contact with some people of Rajasthan at a party there. After his return to Ujjain, he was down with fever, cold and cough, the release said.

A survey was underway in Amber locality to check the spread of the viral infection, it added.

113,31-3-20,"Maha: 2 more deaths, positive cases may cross 250","The Coronavirus situation continued to be grim in Maharashtra on Monday, as two more died of the pandemic and 17 more persons tested positive for Covid-19 taking the total number of infected cases in the State to 220.

While an 80 year-old man died at a private hospital in Mumbai, a 52-year-old man died at a private hospital in Mumbai. With the latest deaths, the total number of Covind-19 deaths in the state climbed to ten in Maharashtra.

The person with acute respiratory distress, who had been admitted to a private hospital on March 27, died the following day. “He was a known case of hypertension and Iscyhemic heart disease. He was tested positive for Covid-19,” a medical bulletin released by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said.

The total number of positive cases (220) reported by the State Health Department could be much higher as the BMC recorded as many as 47 cases on Monday as against eight cases that figured in the state health department's list. In effect, the total number of cases in the might go up to 259 cases if the BMC's figures are included.

Apart from testing positive for Covid-19, the man -- who died at a Pune Hospital -- was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure.

With another 17 persons testing positive for Coronavirus in various parts of Maharashtra, the total number of infected cases rose further to 220. Of the fresh infected cases, Mumbai accounted for eight cases, while five positive cases were reported from Pune. Nagour reported two infected cases, while there was one case each in Nashik and Kolhapur.

State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that as many as 39 persons, who had earlier tested positive for Covid-19 but recovered later, had been discharged from various hospitals till Monday.

“As many as 328 persons have newly been admitted to various hospitals in the state. Since January 18, 4538 people have been hospitalized in various isolation wards across the state owing to them developing symptoms such as fever, cold, cough etc. Out of the total admissions, 3876 laboratory samples were negative and 220 have been tested positive for coronavirus until today,” the minister said.

“As many as 19,161 people are home quarantined in the state, while 1224 people are in institutional quarantine centres,” the bulletin said.

Meanwhile, in a medical bulletin released by it, the BMC said that the private laboratories had diagnosed 18 patients between March 24 and 28. “As these 18 cases included in today, there appears to be a rise in cases. The rise is mainly due to vigorous contact tracing by health teams and enhanced testing in public and private labs, thereby ensuring proper preventive steps to control the spread of the disease,” the bulletin said.

“As a containment measure, areas surrounding the positive cases including one lakh houses and 3.87 lakh people have been surveyed. Apart from tracing the positive cases, the teams are also ensuring the home quarantining measures,” the medical bulletin added.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the stare government had set up 262 camps for migrants across the state as COVID-19 deaths touched 9 with another 215 positive cases.

“In these camps, we are currently housing 70,399 migrant labour/the homeless people and providing them food,” the chief minister said.

In a related development, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday decided to compulsorily cremate all victims of COVID-19 irrespective of their religions, to prevent risk infections even after death.

In an order issued today, Mumbai Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi lamented that the dead bodies of all COVID-19 victims must be cremated at the nearest crematorium irrespective of the religion to which they belong.

Justifying the mandatory cremation move, Pardeshi said that a religious community leader had brought to his notice that burial grounds for Muslim or Christians were located in densely populated localities of Mumbai, which posed a high risk of contamination to their surrounding community or residential areas.

Pardeshi also said that any rituals involving the touching of the body were barred and not more than five persons shall be permitted to attend any such funeral.

Among other things, the BMC banned the procedure of packaging the victim’s body in a plastic bag and burying it in a cemetery on the grounds that it would prevent early decomposition and the risk of the future spread of the Coronavirus would continue.

However, Pardeshi said that for those who insisted on holding the burial practice would be allowed provided they take the body out of Mumbai limits for the funeral rituals.

“For this, the family members of the deceased would have to make all arrangements including transportation and follow the relevant guidelines/precautions for the disposal of COVID-19 victims,” the Municipal Commissioner said.

“The concerned person would be fully responsible for his actions and those found flouting the directives would be liable for penal action,” Pardeshi said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha--2-more-deaths--positive-cases-may-cross-250.html
114,31-3-20,PM holds video-conference with heads of Missions,"With the objective of sharing details about global efforts to fight coronavirus pandemic and India’s ongoing measures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday held a video conference with the heads of all of Indian embassies worldwide — the first such event for Indian Missions worldwide.

The Prime Minister said extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions and therefore most of the world had quarantined itself even in this globalised era. Incidentally, this conference was like making assertion about taking unprecedented decisions including lockdown. Modi further said this was an unavoidable step taken to fight this pandemic, but it was also hugely consequential, as the closure of the globalised system has had an extensive and far-reaching impact upon the international transport system, financial markets and the global economy.

Outlining the measures taken by India, he said the country had taken unprecedented and early steps in response to this pandemic from mid-January this year, to reduce the risk of importing the infection, and thereafter to prevent a large outbreak. This included the world’s largest quarantine and lockdown, implemented by India.

Modi complimented Heads of Missions for their efforts to evacuate Indians stranded abroad in some of the epicentres of the crisis. He also exhorted them to take steps on five specific counts.

The steps included enduring their own health and safety, and that of their teams and families besides attending to Indians who remain in various foreign countries, given the uncertainty of continuing international travel restrictions. He called on Heads of Indian Missions to help boost the morale of such compatriots abroad, address issues arising from their unplanned stay abroad, with their host governments, and other problems Indians might face abroad, including arranging shelter, where necessary and feasible.

He asked them to stay alert and identify in their countries of accreditation best practices, innovations, scientific breakthroughs and sources to procure medical equipment, for India’s fight against COVID-19. He also advised Heads of Mission to suitably publicise the newly-established PM-CARES Fund to mobilise donations from abroad.

Since this crisis also impacts upon the economy, Modi further advised the envoys to also focus on ensuring that commerce in essential supplies, logistics chains, remittances and so on are unaffected, through their coordination with foreign partners. Lastly, he urged the heads of missions to continue to pay close attention to the evolving international political and economic situation, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response, 10 Heads of Mission, in Beijing, Washington DC, Tehran, Rome, Berlin, Kathmandu, Abu Dhabi, Kabul, Male, and Seoul offered their perspectives to the Prime Minister and the rest of the audience. They shared feedback regarding appreciation in their countries of accreditation of the resolute measures taken by India to combat this pandemic.

Heads of Missions outlined their efforts to help Indians stranded abroad, in particular, students and workers. They also reported efforts to identify medicine, medical devices, technologies, research and other measures which might help in India’s own national effort to fight this pandemic.

They also reported lessons learned in other countries, and their best practices, in the global fight against COVID-19. In our neighbourhood, Heads of Mission underlined measures to assist the national responses of those countries, using the special fund created at India’s initiative for SAARC countries to combat COVID-19. The Heads of Mission also expressed gratitude for the guidance and inspiration from the Prime Minister for their work.

Modi emphasised that India’s Missions abroad may well be far from home, but they remain full participants in India’s fight against COVID-19. He emphasised that the unity and alertness of all Indians would help safeguard the nation’s future.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-holds-video-conference-with-heads-of-missions.html

The Prime Minister was interacting with representatives of organisations working for social welfare via video conference.

He appealed to them to spread awareness about the COVID-19 outbreak. Modi said that people were seen gathered in places and flouting social distancing norms in the name of belief. He said, it is necessary to highlight the importance of maintaining social distancing during this time.

Those with whom Modi interacted included RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Dawoodi Bohra head Qaq Djoher Syedna, Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev, spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Raj Yogini Brahmkumaris sister Jayanti.

He recalled Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi's words that serving the poor and downtrodden is the best way to serve the nation. The Prime Minister praised the dedication and commitment of organisations participating in the video conference, towards serving humanity.

He observed that these organisations have three distinct specialties: a humane approach, massive reach and connect with people and a service mindset. He said, due to these distinctions, such organisations are trusted implicitly.

Modi said that the nation is facing an unprecedented crisis and needs the service of these bodies and their resources like never before. He suggested that they could play a huge role in arranging for basic necessities for the poor. They could also dedicate their medical facilities and volunteers to serving patients and the needy. Modi said, the nation needs both short-term measures and a long-term vision to overcome the challenge.

The representatives of the social welfare organisations praised the leadership of the Prime Minister in guiding the country during the major crisis.

They praised the pro-active measures of the government which, they said, have been effective in controlling the spread of the virus. They pledged support to the PM-CARES fund and said their workforce will be dedicated completely to the cause of serving the nation in this time of crisis. The organisations spoke about their work to meet the COVID-19 challenge through awareness campaigns digital means, distribution of essentials, food packets, sanitisers, medicines and provision of medical help to those in need.

The Prime Minister reiterated the importance of spreading awareness, helping the poor and needy through arranging for basic necessities, provision of medical facilities and dedicating the volunteers to the cause of serving those impacted by COVID-19. He stressed on the importance of giving medical and scientific advice and countering misinformation. Prime Minister also underlined the need to keep working together to face the challenge of the pandemic.

Over the last few days, Modi has been conducting a series of interactions via video conferencing with representatives of different sectors including electronic and print media and medical fraternity besides Chief Ministers of all the States and heads of States of SAARC nations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-lauds-social-organisations----roles-in-fighting-coronavirus.html

117,31-3-20,Cong video-conferencing to assess corona situation,"Senior Congress leaders have convened a high-level meeting on Thursday through video conferencing to discuss the implications due to the 21-day countrywide lockdown to check the coronavirus menace.

The party which has simultaneously been criticising certain measures of the Modi Government and also extending its support to the Centre in its effort to combat COVID 19 on Monday constituted a control room at party headquarters. A couple of days ago, party chief Sonia Gandhi had also constituted a task force to tackle the spread of Corona menace.

AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal said the CWC will discuss the future strategy.

""A meeting of the Congress Working Committee will be held on Thursday, April, 2. The meeting will be conducted through video-conferencing,"" Venugopal said.

The Congress has been critical of the Government''s handling of the situation arising out of the COVID-19 lockdown, saying it has halted all economic activity and is causing problems to the labourers, the poor and the marginalised.

The party has also accused the Government of not taking adequate steps to mitigate the plight of the migrant labour force.

Sonia Gandhi and former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi have suggested a nuanced approach to tackle the coronavirus outbreak rather than the total lockdown.

Congress also set up a 24-hour central control room to coordinate with States on steps being taken to extend help to people in distress due to the lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus.

The central control room at AICC will be monitored by Venugopal comprising Rajiv Satav, Devendra Yadav (ex-MLA), Manish Chatrath (Secretary, AICC) as members for the purpose of

In his plea, Unnithan said that such a blockade is a clear violation of Articles 21 and 19(d) of the Constitution at a time when supply of commodities is itself hit hard and the entire country is fighting a medical emergency.“This blockade has also resulted in cutting off the essential lifeline of National Highways and State Highways and major district roads leading to the State of Kerala, which has resulted in the shortage of supply of essential and non-essential items to the State of Kerala leading to shortage supply of food and medical supplies,” his plea said.Unnithan said the “ill-planned and dangerous blockade” has claimed the life of a 70 year old woman who was denied entry into Karnataka for urgent medical treatment only available at Mangalore.“This is a clear case of violation of the right to life with dignity by the state as citizens are made to die on the roads because of the action of the State which is in total disregard to Article 21,” he said.

The Congress MP said that his home constituency Kasaragod is the northern most district of Kerala, which shares most of its boundary with Karnataka and the Panvel-Kochi-Kanyakumari National Highway (NH-66) is passing through the district, connecting it with Mangalore, Karnataka.“The people of Kasaragod in Kerala rely entirely upon the medical facilities of Mangalore District in the State of Karnataka and its adjacent areas.“As a result of this blockade two persons have already died as they were denied entry into Karnataka even for urgent medical treatment at a hospital in Mangalore,” his plea said.

He added that Kerala being a consumer state, grocery items and vegetables come from Karnataka through roads and Highways connecting the Kasaragod and the Mangalore “Now all the roads including the National Highways

leading to the Karnataka state side are closed by the officials of the Karnataka State in the wake of the nation-wide lockdown against the Covid 19 pandemic which has resulted in stoppage of supply of goods and other essential items from the State of Karnataka to the State of Kerala,” he said in his PIL.His plea sought directions to the Karnataka Government to open the borders with Kerala and in particular Kasargod-Mangalore border at Talappadi and allowing the movement of Ambulances and other emergency vehicles through the borders.

The petition also sought direction to Karnataka to allow the movement of trucks and other vehicles carrying essential and non-essential items to the state of Kerala.

In an interview to PTI, Chouhan assured that the situation in Indore, the industrial hub which has been ranking no. 1 in cleanliness since three consecutive terms, would be brought under control soon.

So far, 47 coronavirus cases have been reported from the state. Of these, the maximum 27 cases have been reported from Indore. Besides, eight cases have been reported in Jabalpur, five in Ujjain, three in Bhopal and two each in Shivpuri and Gwalior.

He urged people to follow the lockdown for their own safety.

He was speaking to PTI after interacting with a Bhopal-based girls' hostel inmates who were stranded here after the lockdown. He went there to know their well-being and assured them that he will take care of all their needs.

""The awareness level of people of Indore is very high and they have proved it by getting the cleanliness award in the country for three times in a row...I assure them that they will not face much difficulty but the three-day lockdown is necessary and therefore it is a total lockdown for three days, he said.

122,31-3-20,Global oil prices plunge to 17-yr low,"International oil prices on Monday plunged to a 17-year low but retail petrol and diesel prices in India remained on freeze as oil companies continued to set off gains against the excise duty hiked by the Government.

Brent crude futures dropped to around USD 23 per barrel — the lowest since November 2002, while US crude briefly dipped below USD 20 as coronavirus lockdowns dried up demand while the crude surplus ballooned.

Petrol and diesel prices in India, however, remained on freeze for the 14th day in a row. Rates were last revised on March 16 and since then oil firms continue to adjust the fall against the Rs 3 per litre hike in excise duty on two fuels done by the Government.

In Delhi, petrol is priced at Rs 69.59 per litre while in Mumbai it comes for Rs 75.30. Diesel is priced at Rs 62.29 per litre in Delhi and Rs 65.21 in Mumbai. The excise duty hike, which would give the government Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue, could have led to an increase in retail prices by

Rs 3 per litre each, but the oil companies did not pass on the increase. Instead, they kept adjusting it against the fall in international crude prices.

Soon after the excise duty hike, the Government took authorisation from Parliament to raise excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 8 per litre each in future.

After the March 14 increase in taxes, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi Government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre. The BJP-led Government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped the Government’s excise mop-up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15. It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later.

But, it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.

The Saudi-Russia oil price war, combined with the destruction of demand by the coronavirus pandemic, has led to the slump in international rates.

124,31-3-20,World Bank sees outbreak taking a big toll on Asia''s economy,"The World Bank is estimating that the cornavirus outbreak will cause economic growth to slow significantly this year in China and other East Asian-Pacific countries, throwing millions into poverty.

Under a worse-case scenario, the region could suffer its sharpest downturn since a devastating currency crisis more than two decades ago, the bank said in an updated forecast released Monday.

The bank's report projects that growth in the region would slow to 2.1% this year from 5.8 per cent in 2019 under a ""baseline"" forecast in which economic recovery takes hold this summer.

But under a worse case, in which the adverse effects of the virus spillover into next year, the region's economy would contract 0.5 per cent, the bank estimates.

That would represent the weakest performance for the region since the 1997-98 Asian currency crisis, which plunged 40 per cent of the globe into recession.

More than 11 million people could fall into poverty in the region under the worse-case scenario, the bank estimates. That's in stark contrast to its earlier forecast that growth would be sufficient this year to lift 35 million people out of poverty.

A slowdown of the size being projected by the World Bank for such a critical part of the global economy would have severe effects for the rest of the world.

The World Bank said it has not finished forecasts for other parts of the world but last week, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, said it is clear that the global economy has already entered a recession that could be as bad or worse than the slump after the 2008 financial crisis.

In the World Bank's base case, China, the world's second largest economy, would see growth slow from 6.1 per cent last year to 2.3 per cent this year. In the worse case scenario, growth in China would come to a near halt with a tiny 0.1 per cent gain.

In the worse case scenario where the virus keeps disrupting activity for many more months, the negative 0.5 per cent drop for the region would include economic declines of 2.3 per cent in Indonesia, 4.6 per cent for Malaysia and 5 per cent for Thailand.

""In addition to bold national actions, deeper international cooperation is the most effective vaccine against this virulent threat, said Aaditya Mattoo, chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.

The World Bank has pledged to provide USD 14 billion in financial support through a fast-track package to strengthen the response of developing countries to the virus and expects to deploy up to USD 160 billion over the next 15 months to protect the poor and vulnerable.

Moreover, the employees will also be treated as ""on leave without pay"" for the March 25-31 phase due to the suspension of air passenger services during the period, said the airline, which offered its aircraft and crew to the government for any ""humanitarian mission"" last week.

Significantly, the pay-cut announcement coincides with the termination of service contracts of over a dozen expat pilots with the airline, as per a source.

""These are extremely tough time and call for appropriate and exceptional measures to sale through the exceptional challenge. As tough as it seems, most Indian carriers have already announced a pay cut for their employees.

""Unfortunately SpiceJet is not too immune to the situation which has unquestionably affected the airlines in the most severe form across the globe. Therefore in our bid to stay lean, and under absolutely unavoidable circumstances, we have been forced to take certain bold decisions, which will help the SpiceJet family surmount these difficult times,"" Human Resource department of the airline told employees in the e-mail.

SpiceJet management has decided to implement a pay cut between 10-30 per cent in March across our employee base. Our Chairman and Managing Director (Ajay Singh), in fact, has opted for the highest cut of 30 per cent in compensation, SpiceJet said.

It, however, spared employees in the lowest pay grades from any pay cut.

In an official statement later, the airline said it has implemented a 10-30 per cent pay cut for all its employees across top and mid-rung levels.

""The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have forced us to take some tough measures to ensure that no one at SpiceJet is retrenched. What we are facing is a global phenomenon and no airline in the world is immune to the impact,” Singh said in the statement.

India's aviation industry, reeling under the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19, is seeking help from the government to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic, SpiceJet said.

Coronavirus driven lockdown has adversely impacted the industry, leading to significant economic headwinds. Several airline companies, both in India and abroad, have been forced to undertake severe measures in their attempt to survive amidst tough market conditions, it said in the statement.

""There are a over a dozen expat captains on the Bombardier Q400 (regional jets) fleet who have been served the termination notice,"" an airline source privy to development told PTI.

""SpiceJet has not sacked any pilot. We have served a ‘one-month notice' to 13 expat Q400 captains, as per their official contract. They have also been paid a month's salary as per their contract.

""We have accepted the resignation of 18 Boeing captains,"" a spokesperson of SpiceJet said in response to a PTI query.

Other budget carriers IndiGo and GoAir have already announced similar moves earlier.

128,31-3-20,Markets extend losses as virus cases spike,"The BSE Sensex crashed over 1,375 points on Monday, pressured by heavy selling in banking, finance and auto counters, as sentiment remained grim amid a steady rise in coronavirus cases.

The number of Covid-19 cases in India shot past the 1,000-mark on Monday, with the death toll rising to 29.

Investors dumped risky assets after multiple ratings agencies cut India’s growth outlook, traders said.

After plunging over 1,500 points during the day, the 30-share BSE barometer ended 1,375.27 points or 4.61 per cent lower at 28,440.32.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty fell 379.15 points, or 4.38 per cent, to close at 8,281.10.

Bajaj Finance was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, tanking nearly 12 per cent, followed by HDFC, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank, ICICI bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Maruti, which shed up to 10.92 per cent. Only six Sensex constituents ended in the green, led by Tech Mahindra (4.94 per cent), Nestle (4.49 per cent), Axis Bank (2.50 per cent) and HUL (2.19 per cent).

“Indian markets started the week on a negative note tracking volatile global cues in Asian markets as coronavirus-fuelled volatility gripped global equities and other financial markets, with oil prices seen plunging,” said Narendra Solanki, Head- Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi.

Fitch Solutions slashed its estimate for India’s GDP growth in the fiscal starting April 1 to 4.6 per cent due to weaker private consumption and contraction in investment amid the coronavirus outbreak, costing economies around the globe. India Ratings and Research too revised its FY21 GDP growth forecast down to 3.6 per cent from 5.5 per cent.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had on Friday said the world has entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009. “As expected, the markets have set aside the stimulus measures announced by the RBI and the government, and focused on the rising virus infections and its impact on the Indian economy.

“With a global recession already declared by the IMF, the recessionary forces and the general uncertainty are forcing investors, especially the FIIs, to redeem their investments. CPI for Industrial workers is due tomorrow, although it is unlikely to have an effect in the current market scenario,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE realty, finance, bankex, auto and telecom indices tumbled up to 7.01 per cent, while healthcare and FMCG ended with gains. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 2.13 per cent.

129,31-3-20,Saudi to raise oil exports to record levels as price war rages,"Saudi Arabia on Monday said it will raise its oil exports to a record 10.6 million barrels per day starting from May, escalating a price war with Russia.

Oil prices are languishing at 17-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic threatens a global recession that will send demand plummeting.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, which already announced a sharp production increase for April, said it will add additional supplies to the global market, deepening a glut. “The kingdom plans to raise its petroleum exports by 600,000 bpd from May, so total exports will increase to 10.6 million bpd,” said an official at the energy ministry, cited by the state-run SPA agency.

Saudi Arabia had been exporting around 7.0 million bpd under an output reduction agreement among a 24-member producers’ alliance known as OPEC+ which included Russia.

Its Gulf neighbour UAE has also pledged to pump at least one million bpd more from next month.

Riyadh said earlier this month it was raising exports to 10 million bpd in April after a production cut agreement among top producers flopped in early March.

OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement on further production cuts to shore up sagging prices as the coronavirus hit the global economy hard. In an effort to grab market share, Saudi Arabia immediately announced a substantial increase in its production to 12.3 million bpd and exports to 10 million bpd at the beginning of April.

The energy ministry said it will secure the increase from two sources, by using natural gas in the domestic market to free up oil for export and also as domestic consumption drops because of the coronavirus.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/saudi-to-raise-oil-exports-to-record-levels-as-price-war-rages.html

135,31-3-20,Putin to ‘probably ask’ for sanctions lifting: Trump,"President Donald Trump said on Monday he expects his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to request the lifting of US sanctions during an upcoming phone call.

“Yeah, he’ll probably ask for that,” Trump told Fox News. Trump did not say what his response would be, noting that he had put sanctions on Russia but adding, “They don’t like that. Frankly we should be able to get along.” The two were due to talk “shortly,” he said.

Last Thursday, Putin told G20 leaders during a conference call that he wanted a moratorium on sanctions as a “matter of life and death” during the global coronavirus outbreak. In the comments he did not specify which countries he was talking about but Russia is being hit hard by the economic fallout from coronavirus and a parallel price war with Saudi Arabia on the oil market.

Trump said he would be discussing the collapse in oil prices, which he said is “really hurting” the US energy industry. Another point of contention could be Venezuela, where Washington, supported by dozens of other countries, has been trying unsuccessfully to promote the toppling of leftist strongman Nicholas Maduro. Russia is one of the few countries propping up his government.

“We may discuss that too,” Trump said. Russian state oil company Rosneft said Saturday it is pulling out of Venezuela and argued that US sanctions on a Rosneft subsidiary — imposed as part of Washington’s attempt to cripple the Maduro Government’s revenue sources — should now be lifted.

However, Russia remains a key partner to Caracas. The bulk of US sanctions against Russia were imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in Ukraine and what US investigators say was a concerted attempt to interfere in the 2016 presidential election won by Trump.

Trump has resisted punishing Moscow, which denies meddling in US politics, but his hand was forced by his own Republican party in Congress, which sees the Putin government as hostile.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/putin-to----probably-ask----for-sanctions-lifting--trump.html

140,31-3-20,Not the other,"Each episode of De Taali — Life of a Transgender, hosted by Fida Khan, curated and produced by Shameer Tandon, unravels and educates the listeners about different facets of the lives of transgenders. This is done through conversations with guests from varied backgrounds, including medicine, literature, the transgender community, and more. By Ayushi Sharma

We breathe the same air, eat the same food and feel the same way. You might say we are all equal, right? Unfortunately, that’s far from the truth. There are many communities that are treated differently, unequally, and at times even harshly. One such community is that of transgenders, the world’s third gender. While some progress has been made to improve their social situation, there are many real-world truths and stories we are unaware of. Stories of what the community faces every day and realities that many of us can’t relate to.

To increase awareness around the community of transgenders, Spotify has launched a new original podcast for India that highlights the unexplored lives of the country’s third gender. Each episode of De Taali — Life of a Transgender, hosted by Fida Khan, curated and produced by Shameer Tandon, unravels and educates the listeners about different aspects of the lives of transgenders through conversations with guests from varied backgrounds, including medicine, literature, the transgender community, and more.

Excerpts of the interview:

How was the podcast first conceptualised?

Shameer Tandon: After the success of Pioneer Six Pack, a musical band, which we created a couple of years ago, we realised that the natural extension would be to do a lot of live events across the world. Then we thought that we should do something on mainstream media to reach out to a larger audience. We had to stay ahead of the curve, so we thought that a podcast would be a great idea as it is a medium where one can put out one’s thoughts without worrying about what one wants to actually say because it’s more of a conversational format. That’s how it was conceived. The first season is already out with five episodes. Another five are on their way.

Do you think the decriminalisation of homosexuality has opened the doors for several changes to be introduced like marriage, medical, adoption and inheritance laws for the LGBTQ+ community?

Fida Khan: Decriminalisation happened on September 6, 2018 and it is only on papers till now. Zameeni haqiqat se inka koi vaasta nahi hai (It has nothing to do with the on-ground reality). I know this because I belong to that community. I can still recall the fight we started five years ago. Like there are ashrams for women, old age groups and orphans, we asked the government for the same for transgenders like me. They suffer more than anybody in the world. Being disowned by their own families and harsh treatment from the society leads to their so called ‘bad’ behaviour. Lack of access to basic rights often forces them to beg and engage in paid sex work. It takes a lot of courage for trans people to come to terms with who they are.

In our country, people usually mock and harass them which makes their life hell. It happens because of a deep rooted patriarchal mindset of people. There is a stigma attached to it. All this explains the level of discrimination prevailing in this society. All that they lack are some basic human rights. They desire nothing that the society can’t provide them. I feel, asking for a shelter is not a very major thing to do. It’s been five years and still we have got nothing. If decriminalisation would have made a difference, we would have been successful in getting something as basic as an ashram.

The podcast seems to talk about various aspects of the life of trans people. One being that there are not enough opportunities for them when it comes to healthcare, education or other skill-based tasks. Lack of accurate representation in Indian pop culture and stereotypical portrayal exist even today. What do you think is the way forward?

Fida: We don’t have to do much. Gradually, the government is actually catering to things that we as a community require. However, everything exists only on papers and not in reality. I believe that even if they start working today on the ground level, everything can just be fine. The change might actually come only if the things on paper are also done in reality. Gender-sensitisation should work in parallel with legal reform. Also, people still believe in stereotypes and refuse to give jobs to trans people. A well-educated transgender Indian is as capable and deserving to take up significant jobs as any other cisgender Indian. You have to fight for your rights because nobody else is going to do it for you.

When I was hosting this podcast, an idea popped up in my mind. You know how a child learns ABCD... as he grows and he remembers that until he dies... so why don't teach them about trans people just like they are taught about the other two genders? Childhood is a great time, without doubt to develop their values and habits, which can define them for the rest of their lives. If proper values are taught to children, they will surely be able to apply them when they grow up. More stories surrounding transgenders can be added in their books. Won’t they learn better and keep it in their minds forever? We would certainly face lesser questions. It would eventually lead to a better world that would live and grow with us, knowing that we are also a part of humankind.

Judicial reform is one thing but social realities don’t shift in an instant. How do you think people are ready to take this change ahead?

Fida: While many people treat transgenders as lesser than humans, there are some people who are brave enough to fight for their rights day and night. There are some trans people too, who have made their way into the mainstream, achieved their goals and proved that we are as capable and deserving as any other Indian. Fighting for issues like lack of legal protection, poverty, harassment and stigma, anti-transgender violence, identity documents (a barrier to healthcare for people belonging to trans-community) is my fearless grandmother, Salma Khan. She is the first trans-woman in the three-member panel of Mumbai’s District Suburban Legal Services Authority. Ours is a backward society which is devoid of its basic rights. But I am glad that people like Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, Joyita Mondal, Gauri Sawant, are constantly trying to break the social stigma and making it big by uplifting the community.

How do you think podcasts, films, books around such sensitive topic would help people to understand the community better?

Fida: Until and unless you know the truth, how will you react to it? Through this podcast, we want to convey who transgenders actually are. There are too many misconceptions and myths in people’s mind. The initiative is to show them the right thing and remove those myths.

Recently, I was on The Kapil Sharma Show, its video went viral on YouTube. I saw somebody’s comment there — “Here she is talking so nicely. You should see the way they behave on a train.” This is the exact mindset that we want to change through the podcast so that people know about the challenges we face just because we have a different gender. We are born the same, we feel the same pain, we are humans too!

Shameer: This podcast deals with the details of life of transgender, especially in the Indian cultural context. We are hoping that there might be a paradigm shift in the mindset of people, who will listen to it as they will understand their way of life. When they get disowned by their own families, their basic thought process says, “if my family didn’t accept me, how will the society?” In the initial years, we faced a lot of difficulty in gaining their trust. Fida very well pointed that — inko cheezein maangne se hi milti hai. But our idea was to give them legitimacy through a platform for singing, speaking and doing all of that. So it took time but now we are absolutely aligned and in sync.

When anybody asks me what was the biggest challenge in bringing this piece together? It was definitely winning their faith! When a community has faced centuries of oppression and suppression, then things don’t change within a click or get better overnight. It takes time. We met approximately 200 trans people about five years ago. Out of them, we picked up beautiful stories of six of them.

In the time of global crisis like this, how do you think podcast will work the best for the audience?

Shameer: When people are homebound, they resort to digital options. With the announcement of lockdown amid the pandemic of Covid-19, I think it’s a great option for people to just listen to such positive stories, which normally they wouldn't have time for.

Can you share some anecdotes?

Fida: I just want people to know that we have seen and done a lot in our lives. But it never really made a difference to my life. I want to point out to the jobs we have and that we shouldn’t be neglected as we are transgenders. We shouldn’t be judged on the basis of our gender but rather, on our capability.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-the-other-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/not-the-other.html

142,31-3-20,Respect all jeevas,"Humans need to pay heed to ancient Indian philosophy to emerge out of the present world crisis, says Benoy Behl

A day ago, I read a report by London-based professors Andrew Cunningham and Kate Jones. The report clearly depicted how human beings have played a huge role in landing the world in the present crisis, including how other viruses could also be spread even after the present disaster has ended. However, besides dealing with the ongoing situation, I thought it is time to introspect and to understand how we can plan for a healthy and happy tomorrow.

The report showcased how humans are responsible by, first, destroying the habitats of bats and other animals, as well as keeping them in conditions of extreme stress and misery. Animals which can fly and roam free are often found trapped in terrible circumstances — sometimes in cages, piled one on top of another. Some animals like chicken often spend their entire life cooped up in a crowded space and are not allowed to sleep so that they can soon become an appropriate size to be consumed by humans.

Such circumstances are terrifying for animals and make them extremely stressed. Consequently, their resistance and response to diseases is greatly impaired. This all eventually turns into a breeding ground for viruses, which one day jump on to human beings as we can see today.

This is a time when one should recall how in ancient Indian philosophy, all the living beings of the world have been regarded as being deeply united. There is no separate compartment for animals or birds. They are all jeeva (living beings). The concept can also be understood with the example of our own previous births in the form of different animals. Even the Buddha is seen in many avatars in his previous births — as a buffalo, monkey, boar, elephant and so many other animals. We are indeed taught to respect the dignity and emotions of all the animals and birds around us since we were also one of them at some point of time.

In Mahisha Jataka, a fifth century painting, Gautama Buddha is seen in his previous birth as a buffalo. The pesky monkey troubles him but the kindly Bodhi Sattva does not mind. In fact, one can see a smile on the face of the Mahisha. It is such a composite creature. The depiction displays the oneness of all life forms. It is such a delightful and joyous creature with the qualities of an elephant, cow, deer and even a horse.

Then comes the Stupa II, Sanchi from 100 BCE. In today’s time, the message from Indian art and philosophy about oneness of all beings is that it is time to stop being cruel to bats, chicken and all kinds of animals, trees and eventually, nature, which we use to fulfill our necessities.

This is one of the most difficult times the world is going through. However, we do have a choice by looking at it through a different prism. We can use it to look at ourselves, rethink our lives, take care of all that is around us and reshape a better future for this planet. We would have achieved something positive and learnt a very important lesson even in the midst of such a crisis. We are very fortunate to have a rich heritage of philosophy, which has always taught us universal love and the interconnection of all creation, including us, animals, the trees and rivers and even the sun, the moon and the stars. The early Upanishads, which were penned in the eighth-ninth centuries BCE, presented a marvellous vision of the interconnectedness of all that is around us.

Foreign visitors to ancient India constantly wrote about vegetarianism which they found here. They found it remarkable and said it was based upon the Indian belief in ahimsa, or non-violence to all living creatures.

143,31-3-20,Saudi-led coalition air strikes hit rebel-held Yemen capital,"The Saudi-led military coalition on Monday said it carried out multiple air strikes on Yemen’s rebel-held capital Sanaa in retaliation for missile strikes on Riyadh.

The operation was aimed at destroying “legitimate military targets” including Huthi ballistic capabilities which “threaten civilian lives”, the coalition said in a statement released by the official Saudi Press Agency. Residents in Sanaa reported multiple explosions after the coalition’s bombing campaign began.

The Huthi-run Al-Masirah television reported at least 19 air strikes on a number of targets in Sanaa, including military bases and a military academy. The operation comes after Saudi air defences intercepted Huthi ballistic missiles over Riyadh and the border city of Jizan late on Saturday.

The attacks left two civilians wounded in Riyadh, which is under a 15-hour curfew to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to Saudi state media.

It was the first major assault on Saudi Arabia since the Huthi rebels offered last September to halt attacks on the kingdom after devastating twin strikes on Saudi oil installations.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudi-led-coalition-air-strikes-hit-rebel-held-yemen-capital.html
144,31-3-20,US clearly doesn’t want N talks: N Korea,"North Korea said Monday that “reckless remarks” by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made it clear that Washington has no intention of resuming nuclear talks, and warned that it is now compelled to pay back “the pains the US has imposed on our people.”

After a teleconference of foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations last week, Pompeo told reporters the international community must remain united in urging North Korea to return to nuclear talks and in continuing to apply pressure on its nuclear and missile programmes.

Pompeo’s remarks showed the US. Has no strategy to stop “a countdown of confrontation,” North Korea said in a statement attributed to its new Foreign Ministry department director general in charge of negotiations with Washington.

The statement said Pompeo’s comments “seriously impaired the signboard of dialogue put up by the US president as a decoy to buy time and create the environment favorable for himself.”

It referred to a recent personal letter that President Donald Trump sent to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which North Korea said was aimed at maintaining good relations and offering cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-clearly-doesn---t-want-n-talks--n-korea.html
145,31-3-20,Global coronavirus death toll 35K,"More than 7,27,080 cases of infection and 35,000 deaths have been recorded in 183 countries and territories since the coronavirus epidemic started in China in December, according to an AFP tally compiled on Monday based on official sources.

As bells tolled in Madrid’s deserted central square and flags were lowered in a day of mourning Monday as Spain raced to build field hospitals to treat an onslaught of coronavirus patients.

In the US, the Government’s top infectious-disease expert warned that smaller cities are about to see cases “take off” the way they have in New York City.

A US Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived in New York to help relieve the crisis gripping the city. The USNS Comfort — also sent to New York City after 9/11 — will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while packed hospitals deal with those with COVID-19.

In Japan, officials announced a new date for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics — the summer of 2021 — as a spike in reported infections fueled suspicions that the Government was understating the extent of the country’s outbreak in recent weeks while it was still hoping to salvage the Summer Games.

Moscow locked down its 12 million people as Russia braced for sweeping nationwide restrictions.

And in Britain, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne who tested positive for the virus, ended his period of isolation and is in good health, his office said.

Three-quarters of a million people around the world have become infected and over 35,000 have died, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. The US reported over 1,40,000 infections and more than 2,500 deaths, with New York City the worst hot spot.

Spain overtook China in reported coronavirus infections as the outbreak stretched scores of Spanish hospitals to their breaking point. With a population of 47 million people to China’s 1.4 billion, Spain saw its official tally of infections climb past 85,000. It also reported over 800 new deaths, for an overall toll of more than 7,300.

Experts say those figures — and those in every other country — are much lower than the true numbers, because of limited testing, counting irregularities and mild cases that have been missed. Many coronavirus deaths in Spain and Italy that happen at home or at nursing homes are not even counted.

Spain and Italy make up more than half the world’s death toll from the virus that has upended the lives of billions and devastated world economies. Their hospitals have been buckling under the weight of caring for so many desperately ill patients at once.

Italy has by far the most reported deaths, at nearly 11,000. In a situation unimaginable only a month ago, Italian officials were cheered when they reported only 756 deaths in one day. The country said the number of deaths has dropped about 10 per cent a day since Friday. “We are saving lives by staying at home, by maintaining social distance, by traveling less and by closing schools,” said Dr Luca Richeldi, a lung specialist.

At least six of Spain’s 17 regions were at their limit of intensive care unit beds, and three more were close to it, authorities said. Crews of workers were frantically building more field hospitals.

Nearly 15 per cent of all those infected in Spain, almost 13,000 people, are healthcare workers, hurting hospitals’ efforts to help the tsunami of people gasping for breath.

In hard-hit Madrid, flags were lowered to half-staff for an official mourning period. During a minute of silence for the dead, Madrid’s Puerta del Sol square was empty as bells tolled.

In the US on Sunday, as deaths in New York state surpassed 1,000, the majority of them in New York City, President Donald Trump extended stay-at-home recommendations for a month in an abrupt turnaround from his previous stance.

The move came after Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said up to 2,00,000 Americans could die and millions become infected if lockdowns and social distancing did not continue.

On Monday, Fauci said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that cities like New Orleans and Detroit are ripe for the kind of acceleration that has occurred in New York City. But he said he is also concerned about other, smaller cities across the country that are merely “sort of percolating” now.

“What we’ve learned from painful experience with this outbreak is that it goes along almost on a straight line, then a little acceleration, acceleration, then it goes way up,” he said, adding: “We’re going to have all of these little mini-outbreaks throughout various cities in our country.”

Lockeddown Moscow accounted for more than 1,200 of the country’s 1,800 or so coronavirus cases.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia. More than 1,50,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins.

In Italy, coronavirus patient Andrea Napoli, 33, said he didn’t remotely expect that he would be hospitalized, struggling for his life, since he was young and fit. But what he saw shocked him. While he was being treated in Rome, three patients died in his ward. He saw doctors stressed and exhausted from the long hours, out of breath from pushing equipment around, dressed in protective masks, suits and gloves.

“What I saw was a lot, a lot of pain. It was very hard,’’

Napoli said. “I heard screams from the other rooms, constant coughing from the other rooms.’’

China on Monday reported 31 new COVID-19 cases, among them just one domestic infection. At the peak of China’s restrictions, some 700 million people were ordered to stay home, but those rules are being eased.

146,31-3-20,Italy sees slowdown in rate of new virus cases,"Italy is seeing a continued slowdown in the rate of its new confirmed coronavirus cases while registering a record number of people cured as it enters its third week into a nationwide lockdown.

Another 812 people died in the last day, bringing Italy’s toll to 11,591 and maintaining its position as the country with the most dead.

Overall, Italy added 4,050 new infections Monday, bringing its official total to 101,739 and keeping its place as the European epicentre of the pandemic and second only to the US Epidemiologists say the real number of Italy’s caseload, however, is as much as five to 10 times more than the official number, but that those cases aren’t being counted because Italy is only testing people with severe symptoms.

147,31-3-20,Global lockdown widens,"Harsh lockdowns aimed at halting the march of coronavirus around the world widened on Monday to include Moscow’s capital as the death toll mounted and fears grew for the fate of the global economy.

The planet is bracing for a long battle against the disease that has so far killed at least 35,000 people, infected more than 700,000 and left two-fifths of the world’s population confined to their homes.

From field hospitals and a US military hospital ship in New York, to the empty streets of European capitals and fears of a new wave of COVID-19 in Africa, the virus has changed the face of the world in a few short weeks.

The march of the coronavirus has also transformed the sporting and cultural calender, with the postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games announcing that it will open on July 23 next year.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin on Monday urged residents of Moscow to respect the lockdown that has seen the closure of all non-essential shops, including restaurants and cafes, in Europe’s largest city.

“I ask you to take these forced but absolutely necessary measures... Very seriously and completely responsibly,” Putin said after regional authorities clamped down because many Muscovites were failing to heed warnings to self-isolate.

Red Square in the heart of Moscow was eerily empty, while the streets were quiet even though traffic could still be seen on the roads.

Coronavirus continues to tighten its grip in Europe, which remains the epicentre of the disease with the death toll there passing 25,000 on Monday, according to an AFP tally. Spain, which has the world’s second biggest death toll from the disease after Italy, announced another 812 virus deaths in 24 hours, although it was the first decline since on Thursday.

Spain has also joined the United States and Italy in surpassing the number of cases in China, where the disease first emerged in December in the city of Wuhan.

“While the isolation measures have reduced the pressure on intensive care units, in the coming weeks it will be significant,” said Maria Jose Sierra of the Spanish health ministry’s emergencies centre.

The lockdowns are causing hardship across the world, but particularly in cities in Africa and Asia where poverty leaves many people scrabbling to survive on a day-by-day basis.

Africa’s biggest city, Lagos, was due to join the global stay-at-home from Monday, with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ordering a two-week lockdown for its 20 million people. The measures, in force from 2200 GMT, also apply to the capital Abuja.

Zimbabwe on Monday also began enforcing a three-week lockdown in the impoverished southern African country.

Experts in Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, said the virus would shrink output there this year by up to 5.4 percent.

The crisis is also testing the balance between civil liberties and the need for restrictions to curb the disease.

148,31-3-20,City at centre of China’s virus outbreak gradually revives,"Shopkeepers in the city at the centre of the virus outbreak in China were reopening Monday but customers were scarce after authorities lifted more of the anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months.

“I’m so excited, I want to cry,” said a woman on the Chuhe Hanjie pedestrian mall who would give only the English name Kat. She said she was a teacher in the eastern city of Nanjing visiting her family in Wuhan when the government locked down the city in late January to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Some 70 per cent to 80 per cent of shops were open Monday but many imposed limits on how many people could enter. Shopkeepers set up dispensers for hand sanitizer and checked customers for signs of fever.

Wuhan’s bus and subway service has resumed, easing curbs that cut most access to the city of 11 million people on Jan. 23 as China fought the coronavirus.

149,31-3-20,Israeli PM enters quarantine after aide tested +ve for Covid-19,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his close advisers have been placed under quarantine after an aide on Parliament affairs tested positive for coronavirus, his office said on Monday.

The step was a precaution and is being taken even before the epidemiological investigation has been concluded, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.

“Even before the epidemiological investigation is over and to remove all doubt, the Prime Minister has decided that he and his close staff will remain in isolation until the epidemiological investigation is completed,” the statement said.

“In accordance with the findings, the Health Ministry and the personal physician of the Prime Minister will set a day to end the isolation,” it added. Earlier, his office said “the move was unnecessary” as the Premier had not been in the same room as the concerned adviser, Rivka Paluch, during the last two weeks.

“The initial assessment is that there is no need for the Prime Minister to be in quarantine since he was not in close contact with the patient and did not meet with her,” the PMO earlier said.

“Likewise, from an initial check, the two were not together in the same room for the past fortnight. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing,” it stressed.

The statement had also emphasised that the prime minister and those around him have been strictly adhering to the Health Ministry guidelines during the past few weeks, under the watch of his personal physician, and that most discussions Netanyahu holds are via video-link from his residence.

Hebrew language media, however, contradicted these claims, saying Netanyahu had in fact met with Paluch, along with a reported confirmation from his office.

Paluch, Netanyahu’s adviser on ultra-Orthodox affairs, tested positive hours after her husband was hospitalised with COVID-19.

She met with several lawmakers on Thursday amid negotiations with Blue and White leader, Benny Gantz, over the formation of a coalition Government, according to Channel 12.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/israeli-pm-enters-quarantine-after-aide-tested--ve-for-covid-19.html
150,31-3-20,From the archives,"NGMA celebrates its 66 years with a visual tour that showcases the hidden treasures of its repositories. By Team Viva

The National Gallery of Modern Art celebrates 66 years amid the COVID-19 lockdown with a virtual tour that reflects its archives as dynamic and progressive. The tour has plenty to explore and ponder over.

Director General Adwaita Gadanayak, who completed three years and got a three-year extension of his tenure at the gallery, feels that it is important to have exhibitions that showcase the strength of the gallery.

If we go by the exhibitions in these three years, these are indeed an insight into a vision that wants to keep an eye on the past as well as bring forward the importance of India’s sculptural sensibilities.

Gadanayak, who recently designed the National Police Memorial, has a significant place in sculptural traditions and contemporary movements.

“The sculptures, paintings and prints in the visual tour showcase the hidden treasures of the collection. It all began with the exhibition titled, Itihaas, which was NGMA’s celebration of 63 years. It’s the first exhibition that was held after I took charge as the DG. This creative and wonderful journey of representing the treasures has continued with several such exhibitions. And this virtual tour is one such exhibition which I believe will take this journey to greater heights. I present it as a tribute to our modern masters and firmly believe that this would generate greater interest among people towards the legacy of sculptures, paintings and prints as a creative medium,” says Gadanayak.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/from-the-archives-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/from-the-archives-from-the-archives.html
151,31-3-20,"Afridi, not Sehwag, redefined opening in Test cricket: Akram","Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram believes it was Shahid Afridi and not Virender Sehwag who redefined the concept of opening the batting in Test cricket.

“In Test cricket, Sehwag came later but in 1999-2000 Shahid Afridi changed the mindset of opening in Test cricket. Even if I was the bowler, I would know that I can get him out but also know that he can hit me for boundaries. He used to hit lose deliveries for sixes at will,” said Akram while chatting with Afridi on YouTube.

Many in the cricket fraternity, including the likes of David Warner, believe that it was Sehwag who started for bowlers having a difficult time at start of a Test match.

Akram revealed that Afridi, who made his debut as an opener in Test cricket against Australia in 1998, was not supposed to be a part of that Pakistan side which toured India in 1999-2000 where the swashbuckling all-rounder made his name as a Test batsman.

Afridi scored his maiden Test century in the first Test at Chennai to help Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in the series which visitors went on to win 2-1.

“I called Imran Khan before the tour selection. I told him ‘skipper I want to take Shahid Afridi on tour but a few selectors were against it. He told me ‘You should definitely take him, he will win a one-two Test matches and make him open the batting’,” said the former left-arm pacer.

“I generally discussed a lot with Imran and his suggestions always came in handy,” he added.

“What a knock it was on that Chennai track. Afridi used to dance down the track and hit (Anil) Kumble and (Suni) Joshi for sixes,” Akram said recalling the 141-run knock played by Afridi in the Chennai Test.

Afridi, however, could not establish himself as a regular Test player as he managed to play just 27 Tests for Pakistan and scored just five hundreds.

Sehwag, on the other hand, represented India in 104 Test matches and scored 23 centuries, including 2 triple hundreds.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/afridi--not-sehwag--redefined-opening-in-test-cricket--akram.html
152,31-3-20,Liverpool deserve to be champions: Gundogan,"Liverpool should be awarded the Premier League title if the season cannot be completed due to the coronavirus pandemic, says Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.

Jurgen Klopp’s men were a tantalising two wins away from their first league crown since 1990 when the season was suspended earlier this month.

The shutdown is currently due to last until April 30. Premier League chiefs are due to meet on Friday, with no indications of when football will resume.

Gundogan, whose side trail Liverpool by 25 points, told German broadcaster ZDF that if the season could not be finished, Klopp’s side deserved the title.

“It would be OK for me,” he said. “As a sportsman you have to be fair.”

The 29-year-old German international, who has won the Premier League title with City for the past two seasons, said it was unlikely that he and his teammates could resume training at the end of April.

“Honestly, I can’t imagine (that happening) and also, I don’t know how realistic it is,” he said.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin on Saturday said that the 2019/20 campaign could be “lost” if it could not be restarted by the end of June.

Gundogan conceded that Premier League chiefs were faced with a difficult choice.

“There are different opinions,” he said. “For clubs who have had a very good season, it obviously wouldn’t be nice if it was cancelled now.

“On the other hand, for clubs who aren’t doing as well and are maybe in the relegation places, an abandonment would obviously suit them.”

Cancellation would have a knock-on effect on the second-tier English Championship, with both Leeds United and West Brom occupying the two automatic promotion places.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool-deserve-to-be-champions--gundogan.html
153,31-3-20,Benzema deepens France rift by ridiculing go-kart’ Giroud,"Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema has mocked France striker Olivier Giroud by likening himself to a Formula One car and Giroud a go-kart.

Benzema has not played for France since 2015 and watched from afar as Giroud spearheaded the team’s World Cup triumph in Russia two years ago. With over 500 appearances for Real Madrid and in his 11th season with the Spanish giants, no questions remain over Benzema’s playing skills.

Asked about the Chelsea forward during a question and answer session on Instagram on Sunday night, Benzema said: “You can’t confuse a Formula One car with a go-kart, and I’m being kind. I know I’m a Formula One car...

“It works because he’s there, that’s it. It’s not going to be spectacular. (Antoine) Griezmann and (Kylian) Mbappe get seen more while he rolls his sleeves up and does the dirty work.

“But does everyone like his game? I don’t know.”

During the 2016 and 2017 seasons ahead of up Russia 2018, Giroud scored 16 goals for France in 24 games.

He also played every match at the World Cup and although he failed to find the target in Russia, his team came home with the trophy. France coach Didier Deschamps has sidelined Benzema since a legal case in 2015.

Benzema has scored 19 goals in 32 appearances for Real Madrid this season while Giroud has largely been a back-up player for Chelsea, despite a decent run of form in February.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/benzema-deepens-france-rift-by-ridiculing-go-kart----giroud.html
154,31-3-20,"Tokyo Olympics from July 23, 2021","The Tokyo Olympics will begin on July 23 next year, organisers said on Monday, after the coronavirus forced the historic decision to postpone the Games until 2021.

The announcement comes less than a week after the organisers were forced to delay the Games under heavy pressure from athletes and sports federations as the global outbreak worsened.

“The Olympics will be held from July 23 to August 8, 2021. The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5,” Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori told reporters.

Only hours earlier, Mori had said he expected a decision from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during the course of the week.

But on Monday evening, he said an emergency teleconference had been held with the IOC and the date finalised.

“We agreed that the timing of the event will be in summer as originally planned, considering the coronavirus... and a certain amount of time needed for preparations, selection and qualification of athletes,” he added.

In a statement, the IOC said the new dates would give health authorities and organisers “the maximum time to deal with the constantly changing landscape and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

The decision would also cause “minimum” disruption to the international sports calendar, the body said.

There was some speculation that Japanese organisers could take advantage of the blank canvas to shift the Games to spring, avoiding the heat of the Tokyo summer that had been their main concern before coronavirus struck.

Due to the heat, the marathon has been moved to Sapporo, a city some 800 kilometres to the north of Tokyo where the weather is cooler even at the height of summer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tokyo-olympics-from-july-23--2021-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tokyo-olympics-from-july-23--2021.html

158,31-3-20,World athletics c’ship moving to 2022,"The 2021 world athletics championships in Eugene, Oregon will be shifted to 2022 to accommodate the re-arranged Tokyo Olympics, World Athletics said on Monday.

The announcement came immediately after Olympics organisers said the 2020 Tokyo Games will now take place on July 23-August 8, 2021.

That means the world athletics championships that were scheduled to take place in Eugene on August 6-15, 2021, can no longer be held on those dates.

“We support the new 2021 dates for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games announced today by the Japanese organisers and the IOC,” World Athletics said in a statement.

“This gives our athletes the time they need to get back into training and competition.

“Everyone needs to be flexible and compromise and to that end we are now working with the organisers of the World Athletics Championships in Oregon on new dates in 2022 for our World Athletics Championships.”

World Athletics said they were also “in discussions” with the Commonwealth Games Federation, the organisers of the Commonwealth Games that are currently scheduled to be held In the English city of Birmingham on July 27-August 7, 2022.

The athletics federation said it was also talking to the organisers of the 2022 European Athletics Championships, which are due to take place in Munich on August 11-21.

There has been no decision yet whether to postpone this year’s European championships, slated for Paris between August 26-30.

159,31-3-20,Olympics postponement rekindles Dipa’s hopes,"The postponement of Tokyo Olympics has come as a ray of hope for injury-ravaged Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar, who is preparing for another shot at qualification after a niggling knee problem hampered her earlier bid to make the cut.

Karmakar, who finished fourth at the 2016 Rio Olympics, has been struggling with injuries ever since she underwent a surgery to treat an Anterior Cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in 2017. ACL is a key ligament that stabilises the knee joints.

Her comeback in 2018 was short-lived as the knee troubled her again at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup in Baku last year. She was forced to withdraw from the Doha World Cup as well and failed to recover in time for the World Artistic Gymnastics Championship in October, 2019.

“There were eight World cups but now there are only two left, which were supposed to happen in March but got postponed to June due to coronavirus outbreak,” Karmakar said. “Given the situation they perhaps will happen next year. So it gives me more time to recover and prepare for the two events,” she added.

Karmakar hoped the extra time to get back to form will come in handy for her.

“I will give my best to return to form and hopefully I can do well and qualify,” said the 26-year-old, the first Indian female gymnast to compete in the Olympics.

Karmakar’s long-time coach Bishweshwar Nandi also said this postponement has renewed Karmakar’s hopes.

“She is fit now. She has completely recovered from the injury but in gymnastics, you have to slowly start the process of training and Dipa had started her basic practice late last month when this coronavirus outbreak happened,” the Dronacharya awardee said.

“She will be back to her best in 3-4 months and since there are still two events left, we can take another shot at the Olympics. See, in gymnastics, injuries happen a lot but I’m hopeful that she will take it as a challenge.

“She will need two Silver or one Gold and a Silver in the two tournaments. We will not leave any stone unturned and I hope she will be able to perform.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/olympics-postponement-rekindles-dipa---s-hopes.html
160,31-3-20,Asia Cup T20 ruled out,"The coronavirus outbreak has not only brought the world to a standstill, it has also created a scenario where the fate of sporting activities in the next six months hangs in balance. While the 2020 Olympic has already been postponed and the start of IPL-13 suspended, the 2020 Asia Cup is also likely to be given a skip this year.

Speaking to IANS, a BCCI official said that gauging from how things stand at present, it is almost safe to say that this edition of the Asia Cup might not see the light of day. In fact, the tournament had greater significance this year as it would be the perfect training ground for the Asian team going into the World T20 which is still scheduled to be played as per plan at the end of the year in Australia.

“Though it doesn’t seem right to be talking about cricket schedules as of now, we can safely assume that Asia Cup isn’t a possibility.

“The sports organisation are hit deeply and there will be some tough measures once some semblance of normalcy returns. There are liabilities and difficulties that the Board faces and it will be a new kind of a challenge to deal with them,” the official said.

Host association Pakistan Cricket Board also confirmed that there isn’t much information to be given with regards to the status of the tournament which was to be played in September.

“We cannot throw light on when the next Asian Cricket Council meeting will take place and on decisions around the Asia Cup and its fate,” the PCB official said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/asia-cup-t20-ruled-out.html
161,31-3-20,Decision on Wimbledon this week,"The vice-president of the German tennis federation has predicted that Wimbledon will be cancelled on Wednesday and slammed the French Tennis Federation for moving the French Open to the autumn.

Dirk Hordorff told French sports daily L’Equipe that he expects Wimbledon, scheduled for June 29-July 12, to be scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is not a rumour, they will announce that they are cancelling Wimbledon,” he said.

In a move that surprised the tennis world, French Open organisers have already postponed their tournament and moved it to start on September 20, instead of May 24.

“You could reorganise Roland Garros for September or October, but not Wimbledon, the grass would be too damp,” Hordorff said.

Hordorff hit out at FFT president Bernard Giudicelli for his handling of the rescheduling of Roland Garros, the claycourt Grand Slam.

“What president Bernard Giudicelli did is a disgrace, for tennis and for France,” Hordorff said.

The controversial switch leaves the French Open starting a week after the US Open finishes, if that event retains its original slot in New York.

“The way they did it, tennis would be dead if we all behaved like that. I’m sure it was a political move with elections coming up (in December). He’s panicked.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/decision-on-wimbledon-this-week.html
162,31-3-20,"Shafali needs to up the game, say experts","With her big-hitting prowess, a rarity in women’s cricket, 16-year-old Shafali Verma was bound to succeed at the highest level.

However, a lot of improvement is needed for her to sustain the sensational six-month run she has enjoyed since making her India debut, feel her coach Ashwani Kumar and former India wicketkeeper Ajay Ratra, people who have tracked her nascent career closely.

Verma was 15 when she received her maiden national call-up last September and thereafter, the attention she got as a teenage sensation was expected.

In her, India got a much-needed power-hitter at the top and less than six months later, she was in Australia, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the team’s maiden entry into the final of the T20 World Cup.

“The women’s team probables had a camp at NCA in June-July and I was part of it as the wicket-keeping and fielding coach. After seeing Shafali comfortably bat against Jhulan Goswami (senior India pacer) in the nets, I was convinced that she would be playing for India soon. And that is what happened,” Ratra, who played six Tests and 12 ODIs said.

Besides Ratra, Verma’s strokeplay in the practice session also impressed India coach W V Raman.

“Even he was of the opinion that she could go on to become a very important player for India,” recalled Ratra.

It is only fair to say that if it was not for Verma’s flying starts, India would have struggled to reach the final of the T20 World Cup as the big stars of the team failed to make an impression. Her only failure came in the final, leaving her in tears.

The Rohtak-born, who loves to play in the V, gained a plethora of fans around the world with her six-hitting ability in the tournament, especially the one that flies over the bowler’s head. There were also constant but pre-mature comparisons with the legendary Virender Sehwag.

Seeing Verma take the best of the bowlers to the cleaners in Australia was hardly a surpise for her coach Ashwani Kumar, who runs the Shri Ram Narain Cricket Club in Rohtak.

“When she came to me first as a little kid (11), I taught her the basic stance and after few days, she was comfortable hitting the big strokes. Then she started training with the girls four years elder to her and in six months’ times, she was practising with the U-14 boys. She never felt out of place,” recollected Ashwani, a former-first class cricketer from Haryana.

“Fast forward it to now, she trains with the fellow academy cricketers (like Ashish Hooda) who have played Ranji Trophy,” he said.

Verma idolises the great Sachin Tendulkar and Ashwani feels that is one reason why she developed a penchant for playing with a straight bat.

Asked if he anticipated Verma becoming a household name at such a young age, the coach said: “I will be honest here. I did not have an idea about women’s cricket. I had just seen her play for Haryana and I got an idea that she was meant for bigger things.

“Before she left for the World Cup, I was not sure how she would handle the pressure of a big event but she exceeded my expectations and did well throughout. Having said that, it is just a start for her and she knows that.”

Former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy too is mightily impressed by Verma’s showing in Australia but also picked out the areas of improvement in her game, mainly her fitness.

Both Ashwani and Ratra also feel that Verma needs to improve her agility, which would make her a better runner between the wickets and a much improved fielder.

“She only got back a couple of weeks ago and the lockdown happened. When things are back to normal, I would be talking to her about the importance of rotating the strike frequently and not just hitting the big shots. She also needs to work on reducing the number of dot balls,” said Ashwani.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shafali-needs-to-up-the-game--say-experts.html
163,31-3-20,Tendulkar was an all condition batsman: Warne,"Spin great Shane Warne on Monday picked his fierce rival Sachin Tendulkar as the batsman to bat in any conditions and called his former skipper Steve Waugh a match saver rather than a match-winner.

One of the greatest spinners to have played the game, Warne was engaged in an Instagram live session with his fans.

When the discussion turned to the best batsman in his time, the 50-year-old Warne said, “If I have to choose any batsman to bat in any conditions, it is a real toss-up between Tendulkar and Lara, but I would just choose Tendulkar.”

“If we have to chase 400 runs on the last day, I would definitely pick Lara,” added the leg-spinner who ended his illustrious career with 708 Test wickets.

“There were these two guys, then there was daylight and after that, the rest of the batsmen came.”

Tendulkar played a world record 200 Tests and amassed 15,921 runs with an average 53.78 while in 463 ODIs, he tallied 18,426 runs at 44.83.

While Lara played 131 Tests and scored 11,953 runs with an average of 52.88. In 299 ODIs he accumulated 10,405 runs.

When asked about his former captain Waugh, who is known for his solid temperament and dogged approach to batting, Warne said he was someone who could bail the team out of a precarious situation.

“Steve was more of a match saver than a match-winner,” Warner said about Waugh whom he included in his all-time Australian Test XI to be led by Allan Border.

Waugh played 168 Tests for Australia scoring 10927 runs, including 32 centuries & 50 fifties.

About his team, Warne said: “I am only picking players that I played with, that is why David Warner is not going to be a part of the side, he is one of the greatest Aussie openers.”

Warne’s team comprised Matthew Hayden and Michael Slater as openers, followed by Ricky Ponting, Mark Waugh, Border and Steve. He chose Adam Gilchrist as the wicketkeeper with Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Bruce Reid as the fast bowlers and Tim May as the spinner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tendulkar-was-an-all-condition-batsman--warne.html

Mallya, who is wanted in India on alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to an estimated Rs 9,000 crore, also said all his companies have effectively ceased operations and manufacturing following the lockdown in India.

""I have made repeated offers to pay 100 per cent of the amount borrowed by KFA to the Banks. Neither are Banks willing to take money and neither is the ED willing to release their attachments which they did at the behest of the Banks. I wish the FM would listen in this time of crisis,"" Mallya said in a series of tweets.

He further said, ""Indian Government has done what was unthinkable in locking down the entire country. We respect that. All my companies have effectively ceased operations. All manufacturing is closed as well.""

Mallya sought government help and said, ""we are not sending employees home and paying the idle cost. Government has to help.""

Asking people to stay safe and maintain social distancing ""which can effectively be achieved by staying home and enjoying home time with family and pets, he said, ""I am doing the same. We all have a sense of bravado but it's not worth challenging an unknown enemy which isn't Pulwama or Kargil.""

Mallya has challenged in the UK High Court his extradition from the country.

166,31-3-20,Migrants’ woes on! Spray gives them smarting eyes,"As plight of migrant workers remained in focus — they were given a chemical wash in the name of sanitisation in Bareilly and had one’s forehead branded in Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh — the Supreme Court on Monday sought a status report from the Centre by Tuesday on the measures taken in view of the large-scale exodus of labourers.

A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao, which took up two separate PILs filed by advocates Alakh Alok Srivastava and Rashmi Bansal, observed that the migration of labourers out of panic and fear was becoming a bigger problem than the coronavirus.

The court said it would not create more confusion by issuing directions on measures that the Government is already taking to deal with the issue. The court, which took up two separate PILs filed by advocates Alakh Alok Srivastava and Rashmi Bansal on the issue of migration of labourers through video-conferencing, said before passing any direction, it would like to wait for the status report from the Centre.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the migration of labourers needs to be stopped to prevent the spread of the virus, and the Centre States concerned have taken the requisite steps to deal with it.

Meanwhile, in Bareilly several migrants, including women and children, complained of burning sensation in their eyes after being sprayed with the “disinfectant”. These people were assembled by the roadside and were sprayed with a claimed wash.

The apex child rights body NCPCR has demanded disciplinary and penal action against officials responsible for forcefully sanitising a group of migrants with “chemicals” in Uttar Pradesh.

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has asked the Bareilly District Magistrate to submit a report in the matter within three days. “NCPCR has expressed serious view on this inhuman act. In view of the above incident, you are requested to get the matter inquired into urgently and issue necessary directions for immediate action thereby; ensuring adequate arrangements of basic essentials to the family members viz. provision of food, shelter and safety and wellbeing of these children of migrant workers during lockdown period,” according to the letter issued by the NCPCR. The body also demanded appropriate disciplinary and penal action against the officials who carried out the sanitising exercise.

Slamming the Uttar Pradesh Government for such insensitivity, former State Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said, “The spraying of chemicals on migrants to sanitise them has raised some questions. Has the World Health Organisation given any direction in this regard? How do you treat the burning sensation caused by the chemicals? What arrangements are there for people to change out of wet clothes? What alternatives are being provided for the food that gets wet due to the spraying?

On Sunday, a police sub-inspector decided to “shame” a migrant labourer by scribbling on his forehead - “I have violated lockdown, stay away from me”. Following public outrage, the authorities have decided to initiate action against the sub-inspector.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/migrants----woes-on--spray-gives-them-smarting-eyes-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/migrants----woes-on--spray-gives-them-smarting-eyes.html

168,31-3-20,"Yogi visits Noida, slams admin for lockdown lapses, ousts DM","The District Magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, Brijesh Narain Sgiingh, was on Monday transferred for failing to implement the lockdown clamped to stem the growth of coronavirus.

The Uttar Pradesh Government’s order came after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited Noida, the hotspot of the deadly infection in the State. With seven more cases on Monday, the Covid-19 positive cases reached 38 in the district.

Announcing Singh’s transfer, Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary RK Tiwari said a departmental enquiry has also been initiated against him.

Special Secretary, Planning, Suhas LY has been posted as the new District Magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, the Chief Secretary said, adding that “he has left for Noida to take over charge”.

Singh has been removed for his failure in carrying out work to control the spread of coronavirus, he said, adding that he wrote a leave application and leaked it to the media, which amounts to indiscipline.

Earlier, the DM had written a letter to the chief secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Government saying he does not want to continue on the post due to “personal reasons”.

“Hence, relieve me from the post of district magistrate and grant me three months earned leave and since in the present situation due to COVID-19 outbreak it is essential that no administrative laxity takes place, please appoint some other officer as the district magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar,” Singh wrote in the letter, a copy of which was circulated in media.

Earlier in the day, Adityanath pulled up officials in Gautam Buddh Nagar for not being able to contain the spread of coronavirus in the district, which has recorded 38 COVID-19 cases so far, highest in the state.

While reviewing the district’s preparedness to deal with the virus outbreak, Adityanath reprimanded the officers for not taking tough action against a private company which, the health department suspects, has directly or indirectly infected nearly two dozen people so far.

“Ye bakwas band karo apna… bakwas kar-kar ke aap logon ne poora mahaul kharab ho gaya hai yahan pe.. Zimmedariyon ka nirvahan karne ke bajaay ek doosre pe wo (dosh) daalna.. (Stop talking nonsense. You all have spoilt the situation here with all this nonsense. Instead of fulfilling your responsibilities you are passing the buck). We had issued orders two months ago, the order was for the entire State,” Adityanath told the officers sternly, directing them to work more efficiently and contain the spread of the virus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/yogi-visits-noida--slams-admin-for-lockdown-lapses--ousts-dm.html
169,31-3-20,"COVID-19: World economy will go into recession with likely exception of India, China: UN","The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

With two-thirds of the world's population living in developing countries facing unprecedented economic damage from the COVID-19 crisis, the UN is calling for a USD 2.5 trillion rescue package for these nations.

According to the new analysis from United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN trade and development body titled 'The COVID-19 Shock to Developing Countries: Towards a 'whatever it takes' programme for the two-thirds of the world's population being left behind', commodity-rich exporting countries will face a USD 2 trillion to USD 3 trillion drop in investments from overseas in the next two years.

The UNCTAD said that in recent days, advanced economies and China have put together massive government packages which, according to the Group of 20 leading economies (G20), will extend a USD 5 trillion lifeline to their economies.

""This represents an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis, which will attenuate the extent of the shock physically, economically and psychologically,"" it said.

It added that while the full details of these stimulus packages are yet to be unpacked, an initial assessment by the UNCTAD estimates that they will translate to a USD 1 trillion to USD 2 trillion injection of demand into the major G20 economies and a two percentage point turnaround in global output.

""Even so, the world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of global income in trillions of dollars. This will spell serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of China and the possible exception of India,"" the UNCTAD said.

The report, however, did not give a detailed explanation as to why and how India and China will be the exceptions as the world faces a recession and loss in global income that will impact developing countries.

Further, given the deteriorating global conditions, fiscal and foreign exchange constraints are bound to tighten further over the course of the year.

The UNCTAD estimates a USD 2 trillion to USD 3 trillion financing gap facing developing countries over the next two years.

In the face of a looming financial tsunami this year, the UNCTAD proposes a four-pronged strategy that could begin to translate expressions of international solidarity into concrete action.

This includes a USD 1 trillion liquidity injection for those being left behind through reallocating existing special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund; a debt jubilee for distressed economies under which another one trillion dollars of debts owed by developing countries should be cancelled this year and a 500 billion dollars Marshall Plan for a health recovery funded from some of the missing official development assistance (ODA) long promised but not delivered by development partners.

The speed at which the economic shockwaves from the pandemic has hit developing countries is dramatic, even in comparison to the 2008 global financial crisis, the UNCTAD said.

""The economic fallout from the shock is ongoing and increasingly difficult to predict, but there are clear indications that things will get much worse for developing economies before they get better,"" UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.

The report shows that in two months since the virus began spreading beyond China, developing countries have taken an enormous hit in terms of capital outflows, growing bond spreads, currency depreciations and lost export earnings, including from falling commodity prices and declining tourist revenues.

Lacking the monetary, fiscal and administrative capacity to respond to this crisis, the consequences of a combined health pandemic and a global recession will be catastrophic for many developing countries and halt their progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Even as advanced economies are discovering the challenges of dealing with a growing informal workforce, this remains the norm for developing countries, amplifying their difficulties in responding to the crisis.

""Advanced economies have promised to do 'whatever it takes' to stop their firms and households from taking a heavy loss of income,"" said Richard Kozul-Wright, UNCTAD's director of globalisation and development strategies.

He added: ""But if G20 leaders are to stick to their commitment of 'a global response in the spirit of solidarity', there must be commensurate action for the six billion people living outside the core G20 economies"".

According to reports, the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has soared past 35,000 while the number of confirmed cases topped 750,000 globally.

170,31-3-20,Hantavirus truth,"When the world is still fighting with coronavirus pandemic, a new virus in China has claimed a life. Dr Navneet Sood tells you more

The world is already in the grip of Corona pandemic; more than 170 countries are affected, even powerful countries are witnessing tough time with best healthcare systems as death toll is still at rise due to COVID-19. Time when even our entire country is locked down as safety measure, news reports about the outbreak of Hanta virus, which fuelled more fear among the people. Even it was on trend on social media including twitter and facebook and other platforms, hash tags of Hantavirus started running, people from around the world had different opinions and fears associated with this new Hanta virus term, which only made people more furious and tensed. It all started few days back when Global Times reported about a man travelling in Yunnan province in China, who died while travelling in a bus, he was found to be infected from Hantavirus, and the fellow passengers were also tested for the same. Here before we get into details about this news report and Hantavirus we all must observe it as our social responsibility to not spread panic. Considering this sensitive time entire world facing, it is highly required to be well informed rather than getting flown away with a mere news report. Keep yourselves well informed with the authentic sources as rumours are also rife about COVID-19. The sudden outbreak of Hanta Virus may have made scared people but it is not as dangerous as COVID-19 which is already world is fighting with.

According to CDC (Centre for Disease Control) the origin of Hanta virus is in urine and excretion of rodents like rats, squirrels which cause Hanta virus diseases and HPS (Hanta Virus Pulmonary Syndrome). Now it may have scared the people but it's not a new virus in the list of viruses. Even Chinese media has reported that it is not a new virus and has been infecting human race already since many years.

There is already a history available on the same as to bring this new fear down. It goes back in the history, after Korean War (1951-1953), In year 1978 in South Korean Hemerologic fever was isolated from small infected field rodent near Hantan River, and the virus was named after Hantan river. Later in 1981 it was termed as hantavirus.

Symptoms: First of all infected mouse can cause this infection to anybody around. A person may start feeling ill after getting for one to five weeks around an infected rat or any other rodent, and this chance is also rare. Initial symptoms may include:-

Fever

Fatigue

Serious muscle ache

Types:

New World Hanta Virus : It is basically found in US which causes Pulmonary Syndrome, it can cause severe cough and shortness in breathing and severe pulmonary problems.

: It is basically found in US which causes Pulmonary Syndrome, it can cause severe cough and shortness in breathing and severe pulmonary problems. Old World Hanta Virus: It is found in Asia and Europe which causes Haemorrhagic Fever with Renel Syndrome (HFRS), it causes vascular leakage, low blood pressure and kidney failure.

The writer is pulmonology consultant at Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital

Keep distance

The sigh of relief is Hantavirus is rare and can only infect people who have close contact with rodent’s urine, saliva or excretion where this virus comes from, at the same time it rarely transmits from one human being to another. Although it has caused one life according to news reports still as the time suggests COVID-19 is the bigger problem world is facing and Hantavirus is not as dangerous as it is, yes precautions can be taken, basic cleanliness and not coming in the contact of such rats can prevent even this risk as well.

As COVID-19 is changing people's lifestyle all around the world, it can be expected that the spread of this virus will be controlled in the wake of COIVD-19 and lessons it has taught to the human race. At the same time this is not the first time world is fighting against virus pandemic. Black death, SARS, plague are also some of the examples from the history which gave tougher time to human time and again. We only need to learn, take precautions and not to repeat same mistakes.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hantavirus-truth-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/hantavirus-truth.html

Lopinavir-ritonavir is the drug of choice

This combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily been used for HIV infection, has in vitro activity against the SARS-CoV and appears to have some activity against MERS-CoV in animal studies.

Although the use of this agent for treatment of COVID-19 has been described in case reports, there was no difference in time to clinical improvement or mortality at 28 days in a randomised trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19 given lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days in addition to standard care versus those who received standard of care alone.

Virus can be transmitted through breast milk

The only report of testing found no virus in the maternal milk of six patients. However, droplet transmission could occur through close contact during breastfeeding. Thus, mothers with confirmed COVID-19 or symptomatic mothers with suspected COVID-19 should take precautions to prevent transmission to the infant during breastfeeding (including assiduous hand hygiene and use of a facemask).

Alternatively, to minimise direct contact, the infant can be fed expressed breastmilk by another caregiver until the mother has recovered, provided that the other caregiver is healthy and follows hygiene precautions.

Women who choose not to breastfeed must take similar precautions to prevent transmission through close contact when formula is used.

Two tests are required to declare recovery

Ideally four. Factors include resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and negative results of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on two sequential paired nasopharyngeal and throat specimens (four specimens total, each handled separately), with each pair collected 24 hours apart.

172,31-3-20,Dockyard : Keep sugar levels in check,"Patients who have Diabetes can have an increased risk of taking more time to heal and get a secondary infection. If they have any of the symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, they need to monitor their blood sugar closely

One of the major complications in accurately detecting the novel coronavirus is the long and uncertain period of incubation which is around 14 days. This gives ample time for the infections to spread rapidly. Widespread availability of diagnostic facility being the need of the hour, it is also advised to the treating doctors and other medical assistance for protection as they are highly vulnerable even during a potential case look up.

While certain symptoms of coronavirus are similar to that of a common cold or viral infection, it is necessary to distinguish between the two. Though symptoms in most patients may vary from being asymptomatic to even being seriously ill and need immediate medical attention, the usual symptoms include — fever, cough and running nose accompanied by shortness of breath.

People need not panic in case of any of the symptoms. They should get tested for flu initially, and only in case of negative results, must undergo PCR throat swab culture, which is used to diagnose n-corona virus.

While the geriatric population may have other co-morbidities like asthma, wheezing or any other respiratory ailments, diabetes and hypertension along with a diminished immunity, makes them more vulnerable to infections. But this doesn’t make them the only victims to the virus, but people of all age and gender are equally vulnerable.

As we age, our immune system also depletes gradually and likely for this reason any elderly catching coronavirus is more vulnerable to sail through the ill-effects of the virus. While the body’s fighting capacity would have reduced by this age, in addition to the existing co-morbidities, old people are more likely to die of corona virus

People with diabetes should be extra careful about their health. They should maintain good glycaemic control (blood sugar level which helps in reducing the risk of infection and also the severity of complications.

In case a person with Diabetes gets Covid-19, the advisory suggests authorities should be notified immediately. Patients who have Diabetes can have an increased risk of taking more time to heal and get a secondary infection. In such a case people if people have any of the symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, they need to monitor their blood sugar closely.

Here are a few tips how diabetics can prevent Covid-19.

Maintain good glycaemic control, which may help in reducing risk of infection and severity. It may also lessen chances of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Pay attention to nutrition and have adequate protein. Any deficiency of minerals and vitamins should be addressed immediately.

The incident, caught on video and shared on social media, took place at Bareilly's Satellite bus station on Sunday.

A state government official has argued that such spraying of people is permitted internationally. But the authorities did not follow the right procedure, he said.

However, a fire brigade official said the migrants were sprayed with a solution containing sodium hypochlorite. It is often used to keep swimming pools sanitised.

On Tuesday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told reporters, ""The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has termed the incident as 'ashisth' (rude) and 'abhadra' (indecent). He instructed that actions should be initiated against the guilty persons, and said that such acts should not be repeated.""

The clip showed several migrants squatting on the ground as men in protective suits hosed them down. Someone is heard telling people to shut their eyes as the spraying begins. Several people in the group, which included women and children, complained of a burning sensation in the eyes.

Chief Fire Officer C M Sharma said on Monday that spraying the group of migrants with sodium hypochlorite was necessary for ""disinfecting"". He said there was a burning sensation in the eyes for ""two or three seconds, but it didn't harm them"".

Condemning the West Bengal government alleged action, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said while the TMC workers are being allowed to carry on with their relief work, the BJP workers have not only been stopped from providing succour to the poor but were also arrested in many cases.

“BJP MLA and former Bidhan Nagar Mayor Sabhyasachi Dutt was not only stopped from distributing food packets to the needy in his own constituency but was even detained by police for doing it,"" said Patra.

""The police had barged into his house and threatened him and his wife. And today he was detained,” added Patra.

On BJP President J P Nadda's call to party workers to ""help the poor, hungry and migrant labourers"" among others, the party activists came out in large number to help the needy in West Bengal.

Stressing on the recourse to sensitivity amid the country-wide lockdown to curb COVID-19 spread, Patra said, ”At a time when we should be unitedly working as one nation to serve the people, some political outfits are giving more priority to petty politics.”

In a similar incident, Patra said, BJP's Bengal general secretary Sayantan Basu approached the nearest police station to seek their help in distributing relief material, but he was threatened by the “Mamata Banerjee-led administration.”

177,31-3-20,Bids on for ample Covid gear,"Govt ropes in domestic, global players for ventilators, masks, PPE

With coronavirus cases surging by each passing day, the Government has roped in domestic and global manufacturers to manufacture ventilators, masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) among other essential medical items needed to combat the viral infection.

Bharat Electronics Ltd has been asked to manufacture 30,000 ventilators in the next two months in collaboration with local manufacturers. Automobile giants like Maruti, too, will be making ventilators which are in high demand to provide supporting aid to Covid-19 patients. Similarly, Agva Healthcare, Noida, has been given an order to manufacture 10,000 ventilators within a month, and DRDO will begin manufacturing 20,000 N-99 masks per day within the next week.

Till now PPE, which are used by medical personnel working in isolation areas and intensive care units to protect them from acquiring infections, were not being manufactured in the country. However, now focus is on Made in India as well in the wake of global shortage.

Sharing details with the reporters at a routine presser, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry, said that the Textile Ministry along with the Health Ministry are working in tandem to achieve this goal. As a result, eleven domestic producers of PPE coveralls have qualified so far and orders for 21 lakh have been placed on them.

“Currently they are supplying 6-7,000 kits per day and this is expected to go up to 15,000 per day within the next week. One more manufacturer has qualified on Monday, and an order of 5 lakh coveralls has been placed with him,” said Agarwal.

Similarly, he said, to ensure that sufficient medical items are available whenever required, orders for 10 lakh PPE kits have been placed through the Ministry of External Affairs with a Singapore-based platform and supplies are to commence soon. While another supplier based in Korea, which has tie- up with production companies in Vietnam and Turkey has been identified with daily production capacity of over 1 lakh PPE kits.

Also, he said, 10,000 PPE coveralls donated by Red Cross have been received and are being distributed. As of now, 3.34 lakh PPE are available in various hospitals across the country. About 60,000 PPE kits have already been procured and supplied by the Government while Indian Red Cross Society has arranged 10,000 PPE from China which have also been received and are being distributed. Another 3 lakh donated PPE coveralls are to arrive by April 4. An order for 3 lakh PPE has been placed with ordinance factories, said the official.

Regarding availability of ventilators, Agarwal said, PSU BEL has been asked to manufacture 30,000 ventilators in the next two months in collaboration with local manufacturers.

Noida-based Agva Healthcare has been given an order to manufacture 10,000 ventilators within a month. Similarly, automobile manufacturers too have been asked to manufacture ventilators.

Ventilators are required for patients of COVID19 as they tend to develop acute respiratory disease syndrome. Presently, less than 20 covid-19 patients are on ventilator support at this moment. Over 14,000 ventilators have been identified in various hospitals across the country for treatment of Covid-19 patients while orders have been placed on international companies like Hamilton, Mindray and Draeger besides a few domestic firms and a PSU to supply ventilators, said Agarwal.

Giving details on the availability of masks, the official said that DRDO will begin manufacturing 20,000 N-99 masks per day within the next week.

""Two domestic manufacturers are producing 50,000 N95 masks per day and are ramping up capacities to go up to 1 lakh per day within next week. Presently hospitals in India have 11.95 lakh N95 masks in stock while additional five lakhs were distributed during last two days and 1.40 lakhs being distributed on Monday.

178,31-3-20,Nizamuddin a corona hotspot? 200 suspects,"Area cordoned off after people who took part in jamaat show symptoms

An area near a mosque in Southeast Delhi’s Nizamuddin was cordoned off on Monday after around 200 people developed coronavirus symptoms in the last two days.

Police said these people have been shifted to various hospitals by authorities. Meanwhile, teams of Union Health Ministry and World Health Organization’s Delhi office reached Nizamuddin and surveyed the area. Drones have been deployed in the area to ensure strict implementation of lockdown orders.

Authorities suspect that the residents of the area might have been exposed to conronavirus as on March 10 several visitors from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia had gathered at Nizamuddin Markaz mosque located in thickly populated area at an event organised by Tableeghi Jamaat.

“Several of them were told to go back to their native places and were subsequently dropped at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport. Most of them managed to dodge police and returned back to the area and now they cited the lockdown being the reason for not going back,” said a source.

Devesh Srivastva, Joint Commissioner of Police, Southern Range, said, “Police is assisting the Health Department in taking out people for check-ups.”

He said such religious gatherings keep happening and foreigners come here and stay.

“Around 300 to 400 people were part of the religious gathering. We were approached by the Health Department after they suspected them of having some symptoms related to coronviarus,” said the Joint CP.

“In the last two days, around 200 people are taken out by the Health Department for quarantine and necessary checks up,” he said.

A senior police official said police served notice to them for violating prohibitory orders and restrictions imposed owing to lockdown.

“Police teams are making announcements through public address systems, asking people to stay indoors. People have been informed regarding the orders and further told that if violated they will face legal action,” he said.

Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said police can initiate action as per the protocol whereever larger number of cases are reported.

“Be it in Nizamuddion or any part of the country, our teams go and take action as part of the containment strategy,” he said, adding the Government is focusing on hotpsots.

He said the Centre is working in tandem with States to implement rigorous contact-tracing, community surveillance and other containment strategies to break the chain of transmission.

According to sources, earlier, two men including a religious preacher and a foreigner who were at the event had been tested positive of coronavirus and had died recently.

“The preacher died in Srinagar last week and he too had a travel history visiting to Deoband seminary in Uttar Pradesh,” said sources.

Earlier this month, the Delhi Government had banned religious, social, cultural and political gatherings as well as protests comprising more than 50 people till March 31 in view of the coronavirus outbreak.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nizamuddin-a-corona-hotspot--200-suspects-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nizamuddin-a-corona-hotspot--200-suspects.html
179,31-3-20,"‘No community spread, lockdown fruitful’","Claiming that the lockdown is showing its result, the Government on Monday said that rise of confirmed coronavirus cases are far less in India compared to many other countries.

However, the Union Health Ministry was quick to add that it was too early to make any definite assessment about the extent of the spread of the disease. The day also saw record number of positive cases being recorded in the country, with Delhi adding as many as 25 cases to its previous total of 70.

The number of positive cases raced towards 1,318 mark by late Monday evening and casualty stood at 30, according to figure furnished by State Governments. But the Ministry of Health put the number of positive cases to 1,218 in its morning update.

With an aim to ensure that it is fully geared up to meet emergency in case the number flares up, the Government said that it is in the midst of setting up specialised Covid-19 treatment centres and mobilising resources to deal with any outcome.

Lav Agrawal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, at a Press briefing said here that despite the large population in India, the spread of coronavirus has been “limited”.

When asked whether India had entered the third stage of the coronavirus pandemic, which is community transmission, Aggarwal said that the word “community” could be used in a Government document but in a “particular context”.

“It is not like that we are in that stage. We presently have local transmissions. Maximum patients in the country have travel history and other cases had their contact history,” he said, adding, “We should avoid the words ‘community transmission’.”

He also said that if the community transmission stage is reached, the Health Ministry will admit it but country is not there yet. On the question that if migrants have been found to be high risk of contracting disease, the official said, “For migrants, special guidelines have been issued. If it is found that they are not at high risk of contracting disease, they will be asked to home quarantine, else they will be quarantined for 14 days.”

“We took 12 days to go from 100 to 1,000 cases, in developed countries with less population, this has been 3,000, 5,000 or 8,000. This is because of early measures of isolation, lockdown,” the official said.

The world so far has recorded around 30,000 deaths leaving more than six lakh infected due to novel coronavirus pandemic.

While stressing that social distancing and lockdown directives must be adhered stringently, he said that, “One person is infecting more than a 100 other people. This has been seen globally. Hence one person’s carelessness can lead to this.”

“To ensure we do not go back to square one, please adhere to Government guidelines 100 per cent. Even if it is 99 per cent it will put us back to square one,” he added.

He also pointed out that institutes such as AIIMS and NIMHANS are organising the training of medical professionals in dealth with coronavirus patients while the Ministry of Skill Development is also stepping in.

As a part of the Government’s preparedness to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) will make available all its National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) and hostels across the country for conversion into quarantine/ isolation facilities.

The ICMR has maintained that there is no need of random sampling as those done earlier were found to be negative.

“We started with random samples but no sample tested positive. So the next day we changed testing guidelines as a precaution. Also, survellience is not required as of now,” said a scientist from the ICMR at the Press briefing.

Kerala on Monday surpassed Maharashtra as the State with the highest number of COVID-19 positive cases in the country. Kerala reported 234 cases while with 32 new addition whereas Maharashtra has 220 cases.

Meanwhile, to help countries manage the surge in COVID19 cases while maintaining essential services, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has published a detailed, practical manual on how to set up and manage treatment centres for the virus that has taken toll on 38,000 people.

Even though we’re in midst of crisis, essential health services must continue. Babies are still being born, vaccines must still be delivered and people still need life-saving treatment for a range of other diseases, said TA Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---no-community-spread--lockdown-fruitful----2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/---no-community-spread--lockdown-fruitful---.html

Harry, who remains sixth in line to the British throne, had announced the royal split along with his former actress wife Markle earlier this year and, as per the deal struck with Buckingham Palace, they will now be in a 12-month transition period with the option for the prince to return to his frontline roles by March 2021.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will hold on to their titles but will not be actively using them or formally representing Queen Elizabeth II from April 1.

As we all find the part we are to play in this global shift and changing of habits, we are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute, they said in reference to their new roles away from the UK as the couple signed off as Harry and Meghan on social media.

""What's most important right now is the health and wellbeing of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic, the couple said in their final message on their Sussex Royal Instagram.

While you may not see us here, the work continues. Thank you to this community for the support, the inspiration and the shared commitment to the good in the world. We look forward to reconnecting with you soon. You've been great! Until then, please take good care of yourselves, and of one another, read their farewell message, which indicates their return to social media under a more private capacity in the future.

On a more philosophical note, they referred to the extraordinarily fragile world as it undergoes the coronavirus pandemic.

Yet we are confident that every human being has the potential and opportunity to make a difference as seen now across the globe, in our families, our communities and those on the front line together we can lift each other up to realise the fullness of that promise, they add.

Alongside, Buckingham Palace released a statement saying: ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to Covid-19.

""However, we recognise there are outstanding questions relating to their future beyond their household transition deadline.""

The statement reiterated that they would no longer use the name Sussex Royal for their charitable organisation, Instagram or website. Their Sussex Royal Foundation will not continue and the winding up process has begun.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months focusing on their family and continuing to do what they can, safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future non-profit organisation,"" it adds.

Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, will now settle down with their 10-month-old baby son, Archie, in California after they flew down to the US from their previous base of Vancouver Island in Canada. US President Donald Trump had tweeted soon after to say that his government would not foot the bill for their security.

The couple's spokesperson immediately stressed the soon-to-be former frontline UK royals have no plans to ask the US government for security resources and that they had organised privately funded security arrangements .

They have hired a top executive who worked for Micrsoft's Bill and Melinda Gates to help set up their new charitable roles.

Catherine St Laurent, who the couple described as ""an incredible asset"", will start as chief of staff next month and also be executive director of their new non-profit organisation.

In a statement, she said: ""From our very first conversation, Harry and Meghan have expressed a deep commitment to improving lives and having a positive impact on society.

""Their perspective on the role that empathy, connection, and compassion can play in that mission is both deeply personal and incredibly timely.""

Frogmore Cottage, the couple's refurbished home on the Queen's Windsor estate, will continue to be their family home in the UK, where they plan to spend some time in the future. They had announced earlier that they would be paying back the GBP 2.4-million used from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant on re-doing it as they move away from access to the funding in their new avatar.

Harry's sustainable travel initiative, Travalyst, will be established as an independent non-profit organisation and the couple are said to be committed to their roles as patrons. Their spokesperson has indicated that no additional information will be made public on their next steps any time soon.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prince-harry--meghan-markle-bid-formal-farewell-as-frontline-royals-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/prince-harry--meghan-markle-bid-formal-farewell-as-frontline-royals.html
183,31-3-20,US nears China's virus death toll as New York calls for help,"The mounting death toll from the virus outbreak in the United States had it poised Tuesday to overtake China's grim toll of 3,300 deaths, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying up to 1 million more healthcare workers were needed.

""Please come help us,"" he urged.

Hard-hit Italy and Spain have already overtaken China and now account for more than half of the nearly 38,000 COVID-19 deaths worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.

But the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that while attention has shifted to epicenters in Western Europe and North America, the coronavirus pandemic was far from over in Asia.

""This is going to be a long-term battle and we cannot let down our guard,"" said Dr Takeshi Kasai, the WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. ""We need every country to keep responding according to their local situation.""

In New York City, Cuomo and health officials warned Monday that the crisis unfolding there is just a preview of what other US communities could soon face. New York State's death toll climbed by more than 250 people in a day Monday to more than 1,200, most of them in the city.

""We've lost over one thousand New Yorkers,"" Cuomo said.

""To me, we're beyond staggering already.""

Even before the governor's appeal, close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors and other professionals were stepping up to volunteer, and a Navy hospital ship had arrived with 1,000 beds to relieve pressure on overwhelmed hospitals.

News also came of the first US service member to die from the disease. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said the death of the New Jersey Army National Guardsman strengthened their resolve to work more closely with partners to stop the spread of COVID-19.

""This is a stinging loss for our military community,"" Esper said in a release.

More than 235 million people - about two of every three Americans - live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home.

In California, officials put out a similar call for medical volunteers as coronavirus hospitalizations doubled over the last four days and the number of patients in intensive care tripled.

""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,"" President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday. ""The more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.""

In contrast, the crisis is continuing to ease in China. On Tuesday, officials in the world's most populous nation reported just 48 new COVID-19 cases, all of them brought from overseas.

In Wuhan, people were ready to jump, cry and ""revenge shop"" as the Chinese city once at the centre of the global virus outbreak reopened.

""I'm so excited, I want to cry,"" said one woman at the Chuhe Hanjie pedestrian mall, where about 75per cent of the shops had reopened. Shopkeepers were limiting the number of people they were letting in, dispensing hand sanitiser and checking customers for signs of fever.

More than three-quarters of a million people worldwide have become infected and over 37,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia. More than 160,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins.

Italy and Spain saw their death tolls climb by more than 800 each on Monday, but the WHO's emergency chief said cases there were ""potentially stabilising"".

At the same time, he warned against letting up on tough containment measures.

""We have to now push the virus down, and that will not happen by itself,"" Dr Michael Ryan said.

""We are saving lives by staying at home, by maintaining social distance, by travelling less and by closing schools,"" said Dr Luca Richeldi, a lung specialist.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-nears-china-s-virus-death-toll-as-new-york-calls-for-help-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-nears-china-s-virus-death-toll-as-new-york-calls-for-help.html
184,31-3-20,"Coronavirus cases in Pakistan reach 1,865","The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan reached 1,865 on Tuesday, showing a constant upward trajectory with officials scrambling to contain the spread of the dreaded disease by appealing to the public to remain inside as people in many cities were seen roaming out.

The Ministry of Health Services in its update on dedicated website showed that the largest province of Punjab had maximum 652 patients.

It is followed by Sindh with 627, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) with 221, Balochistan 153, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) 148, Islamabad 58 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 6 cases of COVID-19. The website reported 148 new patients in the last 24 hours.

So far 25 people died due to the disease, while 52 recovered. Another 12 were in critical condition at various hospitals.

Officials in Pakistan were scrambling to contain the disease by appealing to the public to remain inside homes and go out only in cases of emergencies. But there was little impact on the masses and in several cities, people were seen roaming out while security officials were trying to convince them to go back to their places.

Efforts were also going to cope with mass breakout by providing more spaces for the patients and Pakistan Railway offered at least 30 coaches which were converted into isolation centers.

Separately, the Supreme Court of Pakistan suspended orders by various high courts to release dozens of under trial prisoners to ease pressure on jails as there was threat of the spread in overcrowded prisons.

Earlier, the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the Sindh High Court and the Lahore High Court had accepted bails of dozens of such prisoners.

The Punjab province is emerging as the new epicentre of the deadly viral infection in the country with 652 patients.

The government of Pakistan's largest province of Punjab has allowed treatment of critically ill patients of the COVID-19 with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine besides expanding the capacity of beds across the province, according to a media report on Tuesday.

Reportedly, the government has also procured 50,000 tablets of the drugs, as Mayo Hospital in Lahore had earlier started using the drug on critical patients.

China has also treated its critical patients suffering from the virus and the US has also allowed its use, the report said.

Dawn reported that the decision was taken by the government after the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) of the US granted approval to using hydroxychloroquine, which is originally used to treat malaria.

""Our physicians have started medication of the seriously ill patients of the coronavirus at the Mayo Hospital and initial reports suggest that the drug is yielding positive results,"" unveiled Mayo Hospital Chief Executive Prof Dr Asad Aslam Khan.

Meanwhile, the government planned to rent two three-star hotels in the city to use their rooms to isolate suspected patients of the coronavirus.

A 1,000-bed Expo Centre Hospital has also been completed for patient management and will start functioning soon after the recruitment of 1,900 doctors, nurses and paramedics.

On Monday, Dr Khan said, Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid reviewed final arrangements at the Expo Centre and addressed the staff, including doctors, to motivate them for this daunting task. Dr Khan has also been appointed as administrator of the Expo Centre Hospital.

We have divided the 1,000-bed Expo Centre Hospital into three portions for the patients, he explained.

Two portions will be used to isolate mild and severe patients of the disease separately. The third potion will be used for seriously ill patients, he said, adding that a 50-bed high dependency unit has also been made fully functional with ventilators.

He also said that the Mayo Hospital OPD has become the largest set-up for coronavirus in Punjab with 500 more beds added to the isolation and quarantine wards here. The patients testing positive at the OPD here would be shifted to the Expo Centre Hospital, he added.

188,31-3-20,DadiKaKehna,"Doctors say it is important to boost one’s immunity so that the body has the capacity to fight COVID-19. There are ingredients in our kitchen that can help ensure one is healthy, says Roshni Devi

There are several messages doing rounds on social media about how one to prevent getting infected with Coronavirus. While doing yoga and meditation are good as one can’t go out to a gym, remember the only way to fight this virus is to ensure that the body is healthy. There are several ways one can do so.

Drink herbal tea three-four times a day. Take 200 ml of water and bring to a boil. Add a couple of pinches of cinnamon power, black pepper, ginger root, four-five tulsi leaves and crush them together in a mortar and pestle. Add a pinch of turmeric. Add your favourite tea leaves and boil like you would a regular tea. For flavour, add half a juice of lemon. This decoction has all the goodness of antiseptic, anti-bacterial and antiviral properties.

Sleep is just as important to keep one’s body healthy. Given that Indians are sleep deprived take this time to sleep at least seven to eight hours a day.

Now that one is home, one can get an opportunity to sit in the sun. Vitamin D plays a role in helping our immune systems produce antibodies that help fight the diseases. Include red bell pepper in your diet. It contains twice as much Vitamin C as citrus fruits. Garlic may be pungent and leaves a bad breath but raw garlic contains antimicrobial and cancer-fighting agents. However, one can add this in vegetables and even as a tadka in daal.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dadikakehna-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/dadikakehna-dadikakehna-2020-03-31.html
189,31-3-20,Herbs to rescue,"DR PARTAP CHAUHAN tells you how to take the Ayurveda route and keep healthy during the spread of COVID-19

Strong immunity is necessary to fight any kind of foreign body or disease. Coronavirus primarily affects the lungs and the respiratory system. Eating a tablespoonful of chywanprash daily enhances the immunity, specifically that of lungs and respiratory system. Amalaki or amala, guduchi/glioy, neem, kutki, tulsi are some of the ayurvedic herbs that are helpful in building the immunity and preventing the infection.

In ayurveda, a good digestion or strong digestive fire plays an important role in fighting diseases. Eating a piece of fresh ginger, drinking ginger tea, mint tea, cinnamon tea and fennel tea are also good.

One can make this drink at home. Take one litre water and add to it one teaspoonful of each — fennel, cumin, coriander powder and fresh grated ginger. Boil everything together for a few minutes, filter and fill in a thermos. Keep sipping this water throughout the day.

Citrus fruits like orange, grapefruit, lemon are rich source of vitamin C and are good to consume. Add juice of half lemon to a cup of lukewarm water and drink two-three times a day. Drinking warm water and keeping hydrated is beneficial.

In ayurveda, nasya is a therapeutic treatment for the nose, throat, sinuses and head. Putting two-three drops of sesame oil in each nostril and sniffing it in will not only lubricate the nasal passage and throat but also strengthen the inner mucus membrane to keep away foreign bodies.

Apart from this, performing agnihotra/yagya or burning havan samagri (a mixture of herbs) keeps home and environment free from germs and help keep you healthy.

190,31-3-20,Paper-based test to detect coronavirus in wastewater: Study,"Researchers are working on a test to detect the novel coronavirus in the wastewater of communities infected with the virus, a development that can help curtail COVID-19 spread via contaminated water sources.

According to the scientists, including those from the Cranfield Water Science Institute in the UK, this approach may provide an effective way to predict the potential spread of the virus by picking up signatures of it in faeces and urine from disease carriers that enter water systems.

The study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, noted that rapid testing kits using paper-based devices could be used on-site at wastewater treatment plants.

It said such kits can be applied to trace sources and determine whether there are potential COVID-19 carriers in local areas.

""In the case of asymptomatic infections in the community or when people are not sure whether they are infected or not, real-time community sewage detection through paper analytical devices could determine whether there are COVID-19 carriers in an area to enable rapid screening, quarantine, and prevention,"" said Zhugen Yang, study co-author from the Cranfield Water Science Institute.

According to the scientists, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach can help monitor COVID-19 at an early stage in communities, enabling public health authorities to take effective intervention as early as possible to restrict the movements of that local population.

Citing recent studies, they said live samples of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can be isolated from the faeces and urine of infected people, in which the pathogen can survive for up to several days after exiting the human body.

The study noted that the paper device is folded and unfolded in steps to filter the genetic material of pathogens from wastewater samples.

Following this, the scientists said a biochemical reaction with preloaded reagents detects whether the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 is present.

Results are visible to the naked eye as a green circle indicating positive and a blue circle negative, they added.

""We have already developed a paper device for testing genetic material in wastewater for proof-of-concept, and this provides clear potential to test for infection with adaption,"" Yang said.

The study noted that the device has the potential to be used as a small, portable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater on site, and to track virus carriers in the community

""We foresee that the device will be able to offer a complete and immediate picture of population health once this sensor can be deployed in the near future,"" Yang added.

191,31-3-20,Amazon workers protest over virus safety,"Amazon warehouse employees and Instacart delivery workers joined protests Monday to press safety demands, highlighting the risks for workers on the front lines of supplying Americans largely sheltering at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An estimated 50 to 60 employees joined a walkout at an Amazon worker warehouse in the New York borough of Staten Island, demanding that the facility be shut down and cleaned after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus.

""There are positive cases working in these buildings infecting thousands,"" warehouse worker Christian Smalls wrote on Twitter.

Amazon, responding to an AFP query, said Smalls made ""misleading"" statements about conditions and that he was supposed to be in quarantine.

""Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable,"" Amazon said in a statement.

""We have taken extreme measures to keep people safe."" After the protest, Smalls was officially fired by Amazon.

When contacted by AFP for comment, Amazon confirmed the decision, which it said was due to Smalls's failure to comply with the company's request that he self-isolate after he came in contact with another employee who tested positive for COVID-19.

By taking part in Monday's demonstration, he put ""the teams at risk. This is unacceptable,"" Amazon said in a statement, noting that only 15 of the more than 5,000 employees at the site had taken part in the protest.

New York state attorney general Letitia James called Smalls's dismissal ""disgraceful"" and pointed out that the law protects employee's right to protest.

""At a time when so many New Yorkers are struggling and are deeply concerned about their safety, this action was also immoral and inhumane,"" she said in a statement.

James said she was exploring options for legal recourse and had asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate the incident.

Meanwhile a group calling itself the Gig Workers Collective said it was maintaining its call for Instacart's independent contractors to strike despite new safety measures announced late Sunday by the company.

""Workers aren't filling orders until our full demands are met,"" a spokesperson told AFP. ""This isn't just about us, we want to also protect our customers."" It was not immediately clear how many of Instacart ""shoppers"" who are independent ""gig"" workers, were participating in the stoppage.

Instacart, which recently announced plans to hire some 300,000 people to help meet demand for grocery delivery, said in a statement it was ""fully operational"" and that the walkout caused ""no impact.""

""We're continuing to see the highest customer demand in Instacart history and have more active shoppers on our platform today than ever before picking and delivering groceries for millions of consumers,"" said the San Francisco company, which operates in some 5,500 cities in the US and Canada.

The firm said Sunday it would provide additional health and safety supplies to full-service ""shoppers"" and would set a ""default"" tip based on customers' prior orders.

The labor group, whose numbers were not known, called the Instacart moves ""a sick joke.""

""We had been asking for hand sanitizer for many, many weeks. But apparently the company is capable of sourcing some with two days of work? Where was this before,"" the group said in a Medium post.

A separate group of workers at the Amazon-owned grocery chain Whole Foods meanwhile called for a one-day stoppage or ""sickout"" on Tuesday to press demands for improved health measures.

The group calling itself ""Whole Worker"" said it was seeking guaranteed paid leave for quarantined workers, among other things.

With much of the US population locked down, Americans are increasingly relying on delivery of food and other supplies from firms like Amazon.

A report by NBC News said Amazon workers at two Southern California warehouses had presented demands to shut down the facilities for two weeks for sterilization while employees are tested for the virus.

192,31-3-20,"Coronavirus: Next 30 days are very vital, says Trump","US President Donald Trump has said that the next 30 days are very vital for America in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, as the confirmed cases of those infected by the deadly disease soured to 164,000 and fatalities crossed 3,100 in the country.

His remarks came a day after he extended the ""social distancing"" guidelines until April 30, expecting the peak death rate from COVID-19 to hit the country in two weeks.

""Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,"" Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on Monday, his second consecutive one in the Rose Garden.

More than 250 million of America's 330 million population are in stay at home order and more than two dozen states have been notified as major disaster declaration, in addition to declaration of national emergency.

The Army has been roped in to build makeshift hospitals at convention centers, racetracks, public parks across the country.

Auto companies have stopped manufacturing cars and instead manufacturing ventilators and other equipment to be used in the treatment of hundreds and thousands of Americans who are expected to fall ill due to COVID-19; something which was seen only during a war time.

""We are sort of putting it all on the line this 30 days, so important because we have to get back, but the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis, and that is the time we're waiting for,"" Trump told reporters, reflecting upon the seriousness of the pandemic that has hit the US hardest among all the countries.

So far more than a million Americans have been tested for coronavirus, which is the highest for any country and its testing rate has now increased to 100,000 per day.

The President said that he will announce tightening of the guidelines, which he argued is having a big impact.

Manufacturing of testing kits and medical equipment including ventilators, face masks have been ramped up, he said, adding that there will be no shortage in the coming weeks.

Dr Deborah Bix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, had a day earlier said that even with all the present steps, the death toll in the US could be between 100,000 to 200,000. On Monday she said that the analysis of the fresh data would be presented before the president on Tuesday.

Trump told reporters that he is looking into the possibility of everybody wearing a mask in the public.

""We're getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things. I saw his suggestion on that, so we'll take a look at it for a period of time. Not forever. I mean, you know, we want our country back. We're not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear,"" he said.

Responding to a question on suggestions about using GPS for social distancing, he described this as a very severe idea.

""I've been hearing about it. GPS. What happens, a siren goes off if you get too close to somebody? That's pretty severe,"" he said.

Trump told reporters that saving the lives of the people is his top priority, followed by the nation's economy.

""My focus is saving lives, that is the only focus I can have. We are going to bring the economy back and we will bring it back fast,"" he said.

""The economy is number two on my list. First I want to save a lot of lives. I am going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast,"" he said.

Trump said that the extension of social distancing measure till April 30 is based on modelling that shows the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks.

"" They say modelling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we can save more than one million American lives. Think of that, one million American lives. Our future is in our own hands, and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory,"" the President added.

According to reports, the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has soared past 35,000 while the number of confirmed cases topped 750,000 globally.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday that no new domestically transmitted cases of the COVID-19 were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday.

But at the same time, 48 new confirmed imported cases were reported taking their total 771 and one death was from the virus-hit Hubei Province, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 81,518 as of Monday, which included 3,305 people who died of the of disease, 2,161 patients still undergoing treatment and 76,052 patients discharged after recovery, it said.

On Monday, 282 people were discharged from the hospitals after recovery, while the number of severe cases decreased by 105 to 528.

The NHC said 183 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

By Monday, 682 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 39 confirmed cases in Macao and 306 in Taiwan, including five deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Meanwhile as coronavirus abated in the country, China, which came to a standstill due to the COVID-19 outbreak for over two months, cut the Reverse Repo Rate (RRR) by 20 basis points on Monday to facilitate more lending as the world's second-largest economy ramped up the manufacturing sector to almost 100 per cent of its capacity to make up for big losses.

A reverse repo is a process in which the central bank purchases securities from commercial banks through bidding, with an agreement to sell them back in the future.

China's manufacturing sector has steadily resumed production after the shutdown due to the COVID-19, with 98.6 per cent of the major industrial firms nationwide having restarted work as of Saturday, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said on Monday.

In the coronavirus epicentre Hubei province, which is gradually returning to normal after the virus abated, the average work resumption rate of industrial firms have surpassed 95 per cent by far, the report said.

The production and operation of large pharmaceutical companies producing vitamins, antibiotic, antipyretic and analgesic ingredients have returned to normal, Xin Guobin, vice minister of the MIIT said.

Meanwhile, 76 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises have restarted to work nationwide.

Some 92 leading enterprises in key industries have helped boost the work resumption of more than 400,000 their upstream and downstream enterprises, Xin said.

Separately China's central bank on Monday pumped liquidity into the market through seven-day reverse repos while cutting the interest rate by 20 basis points to lower lending costs and offset the economic shock of COVID-19.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 50 billion yuan (about USD seven billion) into the market through the seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.2 per cent, the central bank said in a statement.

Hubei's capital Wuhan, which bore the brunt of the vicious virus for over two months, would begin its air services from April 8.

China began to ease its lockdown of Hubei province, home for over 56 million people, from March 25 by resuming local transport services followed by relaxation of travel for people tested negative for coronavirus.

194,31-3-20,Van Gogh painting stolen from Dutch museum closed by virus,"A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh was stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, police and the museum said Monday.

The Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of Monday. By early afternoon, all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a smashed door in the building's glass facade.

Museum General Director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is angry, shocked, sad at the theft.

The value of the work, which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, was not immediately known. Van Gogh's paintings, when they rarely come up for sale, fetch millions at auction.

Police are investigating the theft.

I'm shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this has happened, said Singer Laren museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm.

This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen - removed from the community,"" he added. It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times. The 25-by-57-centimeter (10-by-22-inch) oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background.

It dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there, including his famous work The Potato Eaters, in mostly somber tones.

Later, he moved to southern France, where he developed a far more colorful, vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in 1890.

Police said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum. That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone.

A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbors. Van Os said the museum's security worked according to protocol, but he added: Obviously we can learn from this. The Dutch government on March 12 banned large crowds among its measures to halt the spread of the virus, leading several museums to close temporarily.

Before the closure, the museum was hosting an exhibition titled Mirror of the Soul"" with works by artists ranging from Jan Toorop to Piet Mondrian, in cooperation with Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.

The Singer Laren's collection has a focus on modernism such as neo-impressionism, pointillism, expressionism and cubism.

It is not the first high profile theft from the museum. In 2007, thieves stole seven works from its sculpture garden, including a bronze cast of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin. The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later, missing a leg.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/van-gogh-painting-stolen-from-dutch-museum-closed-by-virus-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/van-gogh-painting-stolen-from-dutch-museum-closed-by-virus.html
195,31-3-20,Vijayan raises boozers’ spirits,"IMA criticises CM’s suggestion

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has kicked off a controversy by directing the State Excise Department to provide liquor to those carrying medical prescriptions in view of suicide cases reported from various parts of Kerala after liquor sales were stopped during the ongoing “lockdown”.

Taking strong exception, the Indian Medical Association said scientific treatment should be given to those who have alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

“It can be treated at home or in hospitals with medicines. It is not scientifically acceptable to offer alcohol to them. Doctors have no legal obligation to provide a prescription for alcohol. Writing a liquor prescription can result in the cancellation of the right to treatment,” the IMA said in a statement on Monday.

Vijayan’s directive to the Excise Department comes in the wake of reports of suicides by alcoholics. Till Monday, the State has reported seven suicides by persons suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Kerala State Beverages Corporation, the State-owned wholesale and retail traders of liquor have downed their shutters since last Wednesday following the nation-wide lockdown announced by Prime Minister against the backdrop of coronavirus.

There were reports that the State was mulling plans to make liquor available through on line platforms. S Ananthakrishnan, Excise Commissioner, in a note to the Government has suggested that persons with strong withdrawal symptoms can produce a doctor’s prescription at the Excise Office. “The prescription to allot liquor should be from a Government doctor. After obtaining clearance from the Excise Office, it can be produced at the Beverages Corporation Outlet to get liquor,” said a senior official of the Excise Department.

While Government doctors in Kerala are tight lipped over the issue because of the gag order from the State Government not to discuss anything regarding corona virus or related issues with the media, the IMA issued a release questioning the move to introduce the prescription for alcohol arrangement.

But Dr CV Krishnaswamy, former professor of clinical medicine, Stanley Medical College at Chennai told The Pioneer that there is nothing wrong in medical doctors issuing prescriptions for alcohol to patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms.

Dr Krishnaswamy is the Editor (Indian sub-continent) , Journal of the Science of Healing Outcomes, an international medical journal publishing peer reviewed research paper.

“I understand there are suicides reported from Kerala because of the unavailability of alcohol. The question is whether we should leave the patients to their fate and allow them to take their lives. There is nothing wrong in a medical doctor issuing prescription for spirits. The process of making a person free from the influence of alcohol is a time consuming one. The best thing is to make him reduce the alcohol intake in stages and not at one stroke. A person addicted to alcohol is likely to end up as a medical wreck up if he is denied the stuff at one go,” said Dr Krishnaswamy who heads the department of diabetology and research, Dr Prema Medical And Diabetes Research Centre, Chennai,

But a senior Government physician in Kerala, on condition of anonymity chose to disagree with Dr Krishnaswami.

“We have not studied in our medical course that a disease could be cured with alcohol. There is no mention in our treatment protocol that alcohols or drugs could be prescribed to patients,” said the doctor.

Corona virus has added yet another controversy to Kerala society where social drinking is catching up like a wild fire. There were reports of school students frequenting bars for gulping a few drinks during interval hours. One of the popular folk songs in Kerala is “Kallolam Nalloru Vasthu Bhoolokathinkal illa penne”, Malayalam for “there is nothing in this world better than liquor”.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vijayan-raises-boozers----spirits-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/vijayan-raises-boozers----spirits.html

On his parameter of choosing scripts, the actor said: ""This is the kind of roles I would like to play -- one that potentially creates impact. I think 'State of Siege' has already set the bar. Having said that, I am so eager to play an Air Force pilot in a film. That is what I am dying to play! I fly as a hobby pilot and aviation is my first love.""

Created by Abhimanyu Singh and directed by Matthew Leutwyler, the story of the show is based on Sandeep Unnithan's book ""Black Tornado: The Three Sieges Of Mumbai 26/11"".

The show also features Mukul Dev, Arjun Bijlani, Vivek Dahiya, Sid Makkar, Tara Alisha Berry, Khalida Jaan, Jyoti Gauba, Roshni Sahota, Suzanne Bernert, Naren Kumar and Jason Shah.

Arjan went through an extensive process to get the look and the feel of Colonel Sheoran right. On the show, his protagonist is a commando of National Security Guard (NSG). According to him several conversations with Col Sandeep Sen, who was the second command of Colonel Sunil Sheoran during the 26/11 Mumbai attack, helped him to get a depth and understanding of the character.

""It is true that I always wanted to play a character in uniform on screen, and playing Colonel Sheoran let me do so. I had a feeling that such an opportunity could become a milestone in my career. With the kind of review I am getting, I hope it has become one. I see the journey upwards from here,"" said the actor who began his career in modelling and also acted in Telugu films before entering Bollywood.

Asked if he feels that the influx of digital entertainment has given the right opportunity for an actor like him, Arjan said: ""I wouldn't say so. When it comes to playing a substantial part in a story, I have always done that. All my characters in Bollywood films and the few films I did in South have always been pivotal roles. However, when one plays a character like Colonel Sheoran that releases on an OTT platform, the exposure is much bigger. The show and the actor get good marketing and our work gets better projection.""

""State Of Siege: 26/11"" is streaming on ZEE5.

The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the wealthiest clubs, with Barcelona and Juventus players taking wage cuts; those in smaller countries, with Slovakian champion Zilina entering bankruptcy; and national football federations, with Uruguay furloughing hundreds of staff.

Having amassed reserves it last reported at $2.745 billion, FIFA has the resources to give much-needed financial help to the game at many levels. Now the organization has provided more details around the need agreed two weeks ago by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his vice presidents to explore a “support fund” for the sport.

""FIFA is in a strong financial situation and it's our duty to do the utmost to help them in their hour of need,"" world football's governing body said in a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday.

""FIFA is working on possibilities to provide assistance to the football community around the world after making a comprehensive assessment of the financial impact this pandemic will have on football.""

FIFA is exploring the mechanism to provide the financial lifeline to the football industry with the six regional confederations and member associations to ensure there is an announcement “in the near future.”

“The football community around the world is experiencing, to a greater or lesser extent, serious financial problems on account of the coronavirus outbreak,” FIFA said.

""This threatens to disrupt and impair the ability of FIFA's member associations and other football organizations such as leagues and clubs to develop, finance and run football activities at all levels of the game, including professional, non-professional, youth and grassroots.

""It is foreseen that in many parts of the world a considerable number of persons involved in football including both men and women players will be left in extremely difficult economic conditions.""

FIFA already operates a “Forward” development program to redistribute its wealth to member associations. In the 2015-18 cycle, investment dedicated to the scheme was $1.079 billion, of which $832 million had been approved and committed to member associations, confederations or regions, according to the last published financial results.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/with--2-7b-reserves--fifa-has--duty--to-aid-virus-hit-soccer-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/with--2-7b-reserves--fifa-has--duty--to-aid-virus-hit-soccer.html

219,31-3-20,Centre seeks in SC no media publish COVID-19 info without ascertaining facts with govt,"The Centre sought a direction from the Supreme Court on Tuesday that no media outlet print, publish or telecast anything on coronavirus without first ascertaining facts from the mechanism provided by the government.

It said that in an unprecedented situation of this nature, any deliberate or unintended fake or inaccurate reporting either in electronic, print, social media or web portals has a serious and inevitable potential of causing panic in large sections of the society.

“Considering the very nature of the infectious disease which the world is struggling to deal with, any panic reaction by any section of the society based upon such reporting would not only be harmful for such situation but would harm the entire nation,"" it said.

“It is, therefore, in the largest interest of justice that when this court has taken cognizance, this court is pleased to issue a direction that no electronic/print media/ web portal or social media shall print/ publish or telecast anything without first ascertaining the true factual position from the separate mechanism provided by the Central government,” said the Centre's affidavit filed in the top court.

The government said that though an act of creating panic is a criminal offence under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, appropriate direction from the top court would “protect the country from any potential and inevitable consequence resulting from a false alarm having the potential of creating panic in a section of the society”.

The affidavit highlighted the steps taken including social distancing and lockdown to prevent the spread of Coronavirus and sought direction to all States and Union Territories to implement all directives issued by Union of India.

“It is submitted that Ministry of Home Affairs has also taken many immediate, timely, effective and proactive actions almost on daily basis. The Home Minister is personally supervising the implementation of various directives/ advisories issued by the home ministry along with the cabinet secretary and the home secretary and senior officers in the control room which is operational for 24 hours,” it said.

Dealing with the issue to prevent migration of workers, the Centre said that it has issued directions under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and a 24X7 control room has been setup.

“As per the details received by the Control room…21,064, relief camps have already been set up by state governments and Union Territories as per the directions of the Central government in which they are providing food, shelter and medical facilities as per the requirement of migrant workers. Around 6,66,291 persons have been provided shelter; 22,88,279 persons have been provided food,” the affidavit said.

The Centre said it is, along with state governments and NGOs, religious organisations and companies, coordinating to deal with the situation of migration of workers and those en route workers are provided with all basic amenities ""so that they do not penetrate into the rural area which so far has remain uninfected”.

The Centre added that the present bare foot migration which has taken place consists of — on a very rough estimate — 5 to 6 lakhs persons across the country.

“It is most important and crucial to point out at this juncture that this kind of migration by the migrant workers on their own in large numbers, defeats the very object of the preventive measures taken by the Central government,” the affidavit said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-seeks-in-sc-no-media-publish-covid-19-info-without-ascertaining-facts-with-govt-2020-03-31.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/centre-seeks-in-sc-no-media-publish-covid-19-info-without-ascertaining-facts-with-govt.html
