0,14-3-20,Cast the food security net wide,"The Government, the private sector, civil society organisations and agencies like the UNWFP can together achieve zero hunger and improved nutrition, leaving no one behind

With remarkable progress in foodgrain production, India has made a successful transition from being a food-deficit nation to a food surplus one. However, efforts to address malnutrition have not manitained the same pace. According to the latest Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey, 34.7 per cent of children under five years of age are stunted, 17.3 per cent suffer from wasting and 33 per cent are underweight. There is also a high prevalence of anaemia and micronutrient deficiency disorders. This is the result of a multitude of underlying factors, including lack of access to health and nutrition services caused by social, economic and geographical barriers, and inhibiting social norms and structures. Climate change further exacerbates the existing threats to food security. With one decade left to achieve the ambitious goals of Agenda 2030, which include an end to hunger and all forms of malnutrition, bold action by a variety of actors — including the Government, civil society and UN agencies — is needed.

The strong policies and programmes put in place by the Government, including the implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013, the launch of the National Nutrition Strategy, 2017 and the flagship initiative of POSHAN Abhiyaan to improve nutrition in children, adolescents, pregnant and nursing women, are leading the way. Local action at the State level, with remarkable progress made by the 117 aspirational districts, is accelerating the process. Several States across India are in the process of implementing reforms and policies to address food insecurity and malnutrition. If maximised, these have the potential to transform the current status of malnutrition in the country. The use of technology to improve efficiency of food safety nets is one example of this. While, at the Central level, the Government is implementing the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme, which allows migrants to access their public distribution rations anywhere in the country, States like Odisha have deployed mechanisms that ensure proper targetting of food even in case of authentication failures. Similarly, Uttar Pradesh has pioneered the use of an interactive voice response system that not only allows beneficiaries to register their complaints but also provides accurate and updated information to them.

Fortification of Government-approved commodities within the social safety net programmes can improve nutritional outcomes. This has been initiated with the introduction of the Central scheme on rice fortification and is being implemented across the aspirational districts in several States where the foodgrain is fortified with essential vitamins and minerals to address anaemia caused by micro-nutrient deficiency, especially among adolescent girls. Going forward, fortification has the potential to have better results if implemented on a mandatory basis.

The mid-day meal programme provides daily meals to 120 million schoolchildren aged between six and 14, with an objective to improve school enrollment, retention and attendance. It also aims to reduce classroom hunger to enable better learning. These meals have been further enhanced in some cases with the diversification of menus to include locally-procured green vegetables as well as milk, eggs and fortified foods, and the promotion of kitchen gardens. Nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life has a profound impact on childrens’ ability to grow, learn and thrive. Adequate nutritional intake through improved infant and young child practices, enhanced nutritive value of food for expecting and nursing mothers and complementary food for children can prevent malnutrition. The Government of Kerala is working to enhance the nutritional value of food provided to children at Anganwadis by making take-home rations for children between six months and three years of age safe and more nutritious, and fortifying rice used to serve hot cooked meals to children aged three to six years. But more can be done. Identifying food consumption patterns and mapping locally-available nutritious food commodities such as millets, green vegetables and fruits, could lead to the diversification of food baskets under existing food security nets, which would further improve the dietary intake of vulnerable families and promote farming of indigenous climate-resilient crops.

In order to improve consumption patterns, diversify diets and enhance nutritional outcomes, it is crucial to focus on knowledge sharing. Behaviour change communication strategies to promote healthy eating habits can leverage the cultural and social aspiration of communities to encourage them to choose nutritious and appropriate diets. Eradicating malnutrition is an ambitious target, which individual entities cannot achieve alone. The private sector can bring in efficiencies and innovative solutions, civil society organisations have a key role to connect communities to the initiatives being designed and implemented for the most vulnerable and agencies like WFP can provide technical support and share international experience and best practices. Together, we can reach the goal of achieving zero hunger and improved nutrition, leaving no one behind.

1,14-3-20,All schools in UP closed till Mar 22,"Exhorting people not to get panicky about the spread of coronovirus, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered the closure of all educational institutions in the state till March 22 and enforced provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act to delegate powers to state departments to fight the infectious disease.

“There is nothing to panic as UP had started preparations to counter the deadly virus a month-and-half back. Only awareness is required to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus,” Yogi said, reiterating that prevention was better than cure.

After holding a high level meeting to discuss the preparations to counter coronavirus, the chief minister told media persons in Lucknow on Friday that the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 had not been invoked in the state but its power was delegated to state departments and a notification would be issued soon.

Yogi also announced that as a precautionary measure, all educational institutions had been closed till March 22, except those where examinations were going on. He said the examinations of primary government schools slated to start next week were also postponed.

“On March 20, we will review the situation and take further decision after assessing the situation, “he added.

The chief minister also said that there was no need to close cinema halls or malls at this juncture as it would only create panic.

“We can discuss these issues in our review meeting after assessing the situation on March 20,” he said.

Yogi said that 11 cases of COVID-19 were reported in UP, of which 10 were being treated in Delhi and one in Lucknow. As for the affected people, seven were from Agra, two from Ghaziabad and one each from Noida and Lucknow.

The chief minister detailed the preparations of the Health department and how the government would go about making people aware about the coronavirus.

“We will ask all schools and colleges to start programmes while hoardings, banners and pamphlets will be distributed telling people about how to prevent the spread of the virus.” he said, adding that citizens other than those affected or having symptoms of the infection, need not wear masks.

Yogi said that the government had trained over 4,100 doctors till date on control of the coronavirus and all district hospitals, medical colleges and other hospitals had been provided with isolation wards.

“We have 820 beds in the district hospitals in all 75 districts. There are 448 beds in 24 government and private medical colleges for treatment of the COVID-19 patients,” he said.

The chief minister also stressed the need for cleanliness and hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus and suggested to people not to go to busy places as they could get infected.

“The government has postponed all interaction and public meets but Arogya Melas would be held as scheduled as it is a health related programme,” Yogi said.

The meeting on coronavirus was attended by senior ministers and state officials and was chaired by the chief minister.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-schools-in-up-closed-till-mar-22.html
2,14-3-20,SP executive meeting today,"Samajwadi Party will hold its national executive meeting, ostensibly to meet constitutional obligation and report to the Election Commission, in Lucknow on Saturday. However, the party is projecting the event as the launch of preparations for the 2022 UP Assembly polls.

This will be the first national executive meeting of the SP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the party had failed to perform well despite a pre-poll alliance with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party — SP was able to bag only five seats while its ally won 10.

While SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav is likely to grace the meeting, sources in the party said that it was not certain.

SP secretary general and party leader in Rajya Sabha, Ram Gopal Yadav, said on Friday that the meeting would be held at party’s state headquarters from 11 am and would be chaired by party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

With the assembly poll still two years away, the SP is expected to discuss how to take on the Yogi Adityanath government in the state. The party had won 47 seats in 2017 assembly elections but the tally came down to 45 as a member defected to the BJP while Abdullah Azam was disqualified following cancellation of his birth certificate by the Allahabad High Court.

A senior SP leader and national executive member revealed that the national executive meeting was called for expediting some legal issues.

Sources said that the members would focus on the party’s stance to go solo in the next assembly elections but alliance with smaller parties could be discussed in specific areas.

A certain section could also raise the issue of joining hands with Shivpal Singh Yadav in the polls, but it is likely to be dismissed by the party brass.

Recently, Shivpal had said that his party would ally with the SP in the 2022 polls but Akhilesh had not responded. During Holi celebrations, the entire Yadav family was in Saifai and Akhilesh was seen touching the feet of his estranged uncle Shivpal.

If the SP decides to go solo, it would be the first such instance since Akhilesh took over reins of the party. In the 2017 Assembly polls, the SP had allied with Congress while in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, it had forged an alliance with arch rival BSP and Rashtriya Lok Dal. But in both instances, the strategy failed to yield the desired results and the alliances were later called off.

A decision could also be taken on making the party proactive with focus on protests and dharnas. Bicycle rallies and public gatherings may also be organised, directions for which could be issued in the meeting.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-executive--meeting-today.html
3,14-3-20,Bhim Army chief to launch new party on Kanshi Ram’ anniv,"Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ is set to launch a political party representing Dalit community on the birth anniversary of Bahujan Samaj Party founder and Mayawati’s mentor Kanshi Ram in Delhi on March 15.

The launch date has been carefully and strategically chosen by the Bhim Army to woo Dalits.

Several leaders of smaller political outfits in Uttar Pradesh, including Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Peace Party and others, are likely to be present at the launch of the new party.

Ravan’s announcement in this regard has made the BSP brass (read Mayawati) tizzy. The BSP has convened a meeting of western UP leaders in Lucknow in the first week of April.

Sources in the BSP said that the major cause of concern for the party brass was the Bhim Army chief’s appeal among youngsters and leaders from Dalit fraternity. They said to overcome the Bhim Army’s growing popularity, a new strategy was also being discussed in the BSP to counter its effect on Dalit youths.

The launch of a new party by the Bhim Army has been in the pipeline, as during a recent visit to Lucknow on March 2, Ravan had hinted on these lines and announced that his outfit would contest the UP Assembly polls in 2022.

The sources said that three names were being considered for the new party — Azad Bahujan Party, Bahujan Awam Party and Azad Samaj Party.

The Bhim Army leaders are hopeful that senior leaders from other parties would also join the outfit. Soon after the launch, a membership drive will be launched across the country and a party manifesto will be finalised.

The Bhim Army chief had recently met Bharatiya Janata Party’s former ally and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar in Lucknow, leading to speculations of him joining Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha ahead of 2022 Assembly polls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bhim-army-chief-to--launch-new-party-on--kanshi-ram----anniv.html
4,14-3-20,"Rains, hailstorm lash UP","Heavy rains accompanied by hailstorm and strong winds lashed Uttar Pradesh, killing two people and damaging standing crops.

A woman died after being struck by lightning in Ahirauli Shitalganj Bazaar in Madiyahun police circle while a man died in a house collapse in Bahraich during the last 24 hours.

Standing crops of wheat, pulses and oilseeds suffered damages in several districts, including Jaunpur, Basti, Gonda, Barabanki and Sitapur. Rains also caused massive damage to vegetables while crops of mango and litchi were also badly affected.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to speed up rescue and relief work and asked the district magistrates and officials concerned to send detailed report to the government immediately.

He also asked district administrations to provide relief and compensation to affected farmers.

“In case of loss of human or animal lives, officials should immediately pay compensation and make adequate arrangements for treatment of the injured,” the chief minister said.

Meanwhile, the Met department said that the change in weather was due to western disturbances and formation of a low pressure area over Rajasthan.

It further said that there was possibility of showers in parts of eastern UP and hailstorm at isolated places in the next 24 hours.

Basti divisional chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union, Diwan Chand Patel, said that besides wheat, mustard, peas, barley, gram, masoor, arhar, mango, litchi, banana, tomato, lady’s finger and maize crops suffered damages.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rains--hailstorm-lash-up.html
5,14-3-20,Widow killed for having relations with youth,"Communal tension prevailed in Muzaffarnagar after a 35-year-old widow having relations with a youth from another community was strangled to death and cremated by her brothers.

The police swung into action and arrested all the accused. In view of the prevailing tension, a heavy police force was deployed to avert any untoward incident.

As per reports, the woman had a relationship with Zulfikar and wanted to marry him after her husband died in an accident two years ago. After being widowed she had returned to her parent’s house in Kookda village of Muzaffarnagar where she met her recent beau.

In his complaint, the woman’s lover alleged that she was murdered over the relationship by her brothers, who cremated her body without informing the police.

A case of murder was registered against the woman’s brothers Sumit Kumar and Sonu in New Mandi police station and they were arrested on Friday.

Meanwhile in Mahoba, two girls were killed after being run over by a truck in Sura village under Srinagar police station on Thursday.

Kavita (11) and Raksha (3) were crossing a road when they were run over by the truck. The truck driver later sped off with the vehicle and a hunt was launched to nab him.

In another incident reported from Muzaffarnagar, Rajiv (38) committed suicide by consuming poison owing to a family dispute in Datyana village under Chapar police station on Thursday.

He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition but died on the way.

In Rae Bareli, four persons, including three children, were killed when a woman along with her brother-in-law and three kids jumped in a river in Aghaura area of Gurbakshganj on Friday afternoon.

6,14-3-20,Indu Goswami of BJP set to win lone HP RS seat,"Former State president of the BJP Mahila Morcha, Indu Goswami is set to win the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Himachal Pradesh unopposed after filing her nomination papers on Friday at the Himachal Pradesh Assembly here.

As per schedule, there will be no need to conduct elections for the seat on March 26 as no other candidate has filed nomination. The 52-year-old Goswami is likely to be declared unopposed after withdrawal on March 18. The scrutiny of nomination papers will be done on March 16.

Accompanied by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, State BJP chief Rajeev Bindal and other party leaders, Goswami submitted her nomination papers to Assembly secretary Yash Paul Sharma.

Thakur said BJP had sought cooperation from Congress and the opposition party decided not to field a candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat.

The opposition Congress decided not to field its candidate as the ruling BJP is set to bag the seat as it has a total of 44 MLAs in the 68-member Himachal Pradesh

Assembly.

Two independent MLAs are supporting the BJP. The opposition Congress has 21 members whereas the CPI(M) has one MLA.

Goswami had resigned from the post of chief of State BJP Mahila Morcha in July last year. Earlier, she had unsuccessfully contested the last Assembly elections from Palampur constituency where she lost to Congress candidate Ashish Butail.

One of the three Rajya Sabha seats from the State will fall vacant as Vipolve Thakur of the Congress is set to retire from the Upper House of Parliament on April 9.

The other two seats from the hill State are currently represented by BJP national president J P Nadda and senior Congress leader Anand Sharma.

7,14-3-20,Let’s think afresh,"Given a rise in gig economy, the time is ripe to ensure that the next revolution in the labour force is one that is allowed to grow and prosper, ethically and responsibly

It is well known that Jews faced severe exploitation, insult, discrimination and abuse in Nazi-ruled Germany. They were unable to hold any relevant job, other than menial ones that were assigned to them by the State. The fact that they were Jews deprived them of any chance of getting employed. German employers (most of them) would not hire them due to the existing systematic bias and propaganda that was fed to them by the State and its media channels.

Yet, a number of them, who were discriminated against, found a voice through other means — some through academics, others through literature — and ended up being pioneers in their respective fields. However, a large number of them were ultimately relegated to jobs in concentration camps, under the will of their oppressive rulers, or were left to die hungry. The success of the Jewish community brings to focus an issue that should require no debate: No one is inherently or genetically good or bad at most jobs. This episode highlights the manner in which a country views its minorities — be it on the basis of religion, caste or gender. The effects are limited not just in the way they face discrimination, through hate speech for example, but in more significant ways like a chance to earn a livelihood or to own a house.

This is where the “gig economy,” which has seen massive expansion over the past few years, provides a ray of hope if we are willing to grab it. This can broadly be defined as an area of work where short-term jobs are assigned to individuals through online platforms. These positions range from hiring people directly for the customers for everyday jobs, like a driver or a maid or a plumber, to businesses hiring people on a freelance basis to help enterprises.

There is an argument that these jobs actually erode human resource or take advantage of the workers since there is no obligation to pay for their provident fund or to provide them with health cover, among other things. This does shed light on a valid concern. However, I think the gig economy has the opportunity to ensure that people, especially those who are discriminated against, find a way to earn a living and play a constructive role in society. The discrimination at workplace against minorities has been proved statistically. A 2010 study by Thorat and Attewell observed that in the case of equally qualified Scheduled Caste (SCs) and upper caste (about 4,800 each) applicants, SCs had 67 per cent less chance of receiving calls for an interview. What is more disturbing is that a higher percentage of less qualified high castes (undergraduate) received calls compared with the more qualified SCs (post-graduates). The numbers are indeed shocking. In the case of other communities, who, too face discrimination, enough statistical and anecdotal proof exists that employers are reluctant to hire people from minority communities (assuming all things being equal). This is why even as the Muslims constitute roughly 14 per cent of India’s population, they only make up three per cent of India Inc. With workplace gender discrimination remaining an issue of much debate, there’s hardly any impact on the ground. In fact, things are getting worse for the women. According to a Deloitte report, female labour force participation in India fell to 26 per cent in 2018 from 36.7 per cent in 2005.

These are worrying trends and this is where the gig economy has the potential to alter the situation. This is evident from the number of minority communities that are registered on various online platforms as participants of the gig economy workforce. What may have started as a compulsion, on being excluded from the regular work force, may present women, SCs, STs and Muslims an opportunity to thrive in the labour workforce.

Of course, this dream has some caveats. There have been instances in the past where we have seen discrimination on these platforms too. Last year, an Indian customer took to social media to lodge a complaint with an online food aggregator, Zomato, that he had refused to take the order because the driver appeared to be of Muslim heritage. Zomato responded with a witty tweet saying, “Food doesn’t have a religion. It is a religion.” This is just a microcosm of the discrimination that gig workers can face. Such attitude or approach towards our fellow Indians is something that I am sure, we all agree, cannot be tolerated, accepted or be allowed to fester.

This is where we need both, private bodies as also the Government, to help plug some gaping loopholes in the gig economy. To cite an example, private companies can refuse to display the name/gender of the person who’s delivering the service as has been requested. Further, gig workers must be given the liberty to report any kind of discrimination by any user. Such conduct must be taken into account by online platforms prior to assigning work to any serviceman. Further, creators of the gig economy must send a clear message that the ecosystem will not tolerate discrimination against any particular community.

On its part, the Government can issue guidelines, listing out the details such companies must implement. Moreover, it is important to come up with a legal framework that protects the legal rights of such workers.

In France, for example, labour law now allows for social security coverage against accidents at work to platform workers, which allows them a right to collective action. The European Parliament, too, has passed new rules that protect gig workers by legislating against discriminatory clauses and allowing for more security for such gig workers.

Given India’s large labour force and the number of participants in the gig economy, both as consumers and suppliers, the time is ripe to ensure that the next revolution in the labour force is one that is allowed to grow and prosper, ethically and responsibly. If we manage to do so, it will truly be a win-win for all Indians.

8,14-3-20,Wall of shame,"A poster war over civil protesters in Lucknow, despite court orders, shows the UP Govt's stubbornness and arrogance

The first record of bounty-hunting or putting the price on the head of a thief came from a graffiti in Pompei in 79 AD. Since then bounties and rogues’ galleries have been used to crack down on criminals, demonise native Americans in the civil war, segregate immigrants and outcasts, tame rebels and break rival chieftains and warlords in a feudatory dispensation of justice across the world. Except that these medieval practices are well past their time; clannish societies have evolved into modern nation-states that address conflict and dissent within a defined socio-political architecture. Nowadays, the most wanted list is usually issued by Interpol. As for shaming the most hated social deviants, even petty criminals have the privilege of covering their faces when they are being taken to and from courts. Yet the Yogi Adityanath Government in Uttar Pradesh overrode all democratic convention and decided to name and shame citizens who may not be guilty of any crime. As he refuses to pull down hoardings with pictures of anti-citizenship law protesters — some of them notables and proven civil rights activists — despite a High Court order on dismantling them, he has thrown us back to medieval times and worse. For by putting out their names, details and addresses, he has placed the judgement call on a dangerous entity called the people’s court, which can be easily swamped by the tide of majoritarian sentiment. Although he insists that exposing protesters is required simply because they fuelled riots and are, therefore, responsible for destruction of public property, no credible case for conviction has been made out against them yet. Besides, while the shaming walls claim that the cost of repairing damaged infrastructure should be recovered from them, there have been news reports of spot recoveries by the State police and musclemen claiming endorsement of the regime, which have been nothing but a sanctioned loot. The Lucknow administration has even served property attachment notices to several individuals. And should the courts limit it further, the State Government passed an ordinance on recovery of damage to public and private properties during political processions. So even the democratic right to dissent via sit-ins comes with caveats. Let us not even hazard a guess about the life threats we are exposing these people to officially, leave aside the incivility of an invasion of their privacy.

Much of the recent actions of the UP Government, be it against citizenship protesters or lynch mobs, would have us believe that it is a law unto itself. What prompts it to ignore the Allahabad High Court order to take the shame posters down as they “reflect colourable exercise of powers?” What compels it to be bull-headed about challenging the order in the Supreme Court despite the latter’s declaration that there is no law to back such action? The intransigence of the Adityanath Government indicates that the “baying for blood” emotion is seen as legitimate redress by a society, which has completely bought into the finger-pointing propaganda of the times. By putting out personal details of protesters and dissenters, who are as much nationalist as any of us, there is an implied punishment of the educated and informed mind, a demonisation of it as anti-Hindu and classist. Suddenly, they are more dangerous than the criminals facing serious allegations, including murder, in Uttar Pradesh. There is a message and licence to the mob here, to do whatever they deem fit with the protesters, much like the anti-semitic posters exposed Jews as the enemy in Hitler’s Germany. It is also a warning to and intimidation of potential dissenters that the establishment will go after them regardless of institutional checks and balances. Furthermore, it is consciously identifying and humiliating people for not being “Indian.” By encouraging a mob hitback against the “guilty”, the Adityanath Government could easily absolve itself of responsibility saying that matters went out of hand in a volatile scenario, just like it did in Delhi. Even if extremist elements of the Sangh Parivar get involved, they become faceless in a mob. There is, after all, a precedent of such perpetrators going unpunished. Posters and shaming walls, something that were so long confined to social media trolls, are now being made mainstream. The Samajwadi Party (SP), although belatedly, has launched a political counterpoint, putting up hoardings of accused ex-Union Minister Chinmayanand and jailed Unnao rape convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar, both former BJP leaders, lambasting the party’s sexual offender list. Of course, they were just as promptly pulled down. Protest graffiti by civil groups are an expression of their angst because the law is often an utter failure. But when an elected Government resorts to such agitprops, it appears not a protector but a destabiliser of citizenry. And it sits smug, particularly when political gains are to be made in the end.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wall-of-shame-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/wall-of-shame.html
9,14-3-20,"Together, we can","It must not be forgotten that the responsibility to protect fellow humans from any outbreak rests upon every nation

One of the defining characteristics of the Indian State has been the humanitarian operations it has carried overseas to bring back stranded Indians whenever and wherever they may have been. The China rescue mission in the wake of the spread of Coronavirus was one that silenced naysayers. With minimal support from the virus-stricken country and much bickering, direct diplomacy helped us secure all our citizens back on home soil. The Government is now bracing up for the challenge to bring back its citizens from Italy and Iran, the second and third most COVID-19 affected countries after China. While the Wuhan rescue operations were at the very initial stages, when the deadly disease didn’t assume such alarming proportions confined as it was within the country, the current mission is being undertaken when COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic. Like in China, poignant stories abound of stranded Indians making desperate pleas, asking the Government some uneasy questions like where they are supposed to go and why they are being treated as smugglers. Panic-stricken students, fishermen and pilgrims in Italy are still not aware that they have to furnish a “Coronavirus negative” certificate before boarding a rescue aircraft. With the Italian health networks bursting at the seams, we are now flying out teams of doctors and virologists to test stranded Indians before bringing them back. This is a cumbersome process and in these stressed and stretched times, our embassies need to be proactive than protocol-bound in calming anxieties. Many Indians claim that their calls to emergency numbers, too, went unanswered. This suffering could have been avoided had the Indian embassy and by extension the Government ensured that the information about the requirement of the certificate from Indians returning from new Coronavirus hotspots had been disseminated properly. The embassy should have put up notifications on its website. A day-to-day interactivity should be immediately built in our response systems overseas and we should not be relying on SOS on social media, which is prone to fear-mongering than actual information.

Until the late Sushma Swaraj became the External Affairs Minister, India did not have a very good track record of looking after its expatriates/tourists/students stranded in foreign countries. Embassies were at best indifferent to their plight. She made a huge difference and changed the narrative. Let us maintain that efficiency and sensitivity. Remember, COVID-19 requires coordinated efforts.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/together--we-can-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/together--we-can.html
10,14-3-20,Patching up lives,"Quilting has not only become a powerful way to advocate change around the world, it has provided a healing touch to marginalised sections of society as well

In 2014, four years before the Supreme Court of India decriminalised homosexuality by declaring Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code unconstitutional in respect of consensual homosexual sex between adults, a group of people belonging to the LGBTQI community in Chhotaudepur, decided to step out of the shadows. Instead of using street protests to voice their opinions, the Gujarat-based group adopted a unique way to advocate their rights. With many of them being henna artists, the group used their artistic skills to design and stitch a patchwork quilt. Christened the “Henna Pride” advocacy quilt, their labour of love has since been taken around the world for creating awareness about the lives, trials and tribulations of its makers and for raising the issue regarding liberty for all communities, irrespective of their gender and sexual orientation.

Exhibited at the 2019 summit of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD+25) in Nairobi, the quilt drew attention to the challenges members of the LGBTQI community face in advancing their sexual health and reproductive rights, despite gains like the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment.

Quilting has not only become a powerful way to advocate for change, it has provided a healing touch as well. Making the “Henna Pride” quilt was particularly liberating for the team from Vadodara-based Vikalp Women's Group, a not-for-profit organisation that works with tribal and transwomen, as homosexuality was considered a crime in India at the time.

“The whole process of coming together to make the quilt was empowering,” says Maya Sharma, co-founder of Vikalp. “They didn’t have a voice and finding that voice was important. The quilts gave them a sense of purpose and represented the change that happened within, just by coming together. Just the process of sharing their experiences helped transform their lives. Each of them developed their potential,” explains Sharma.

Life for Payal, a 30-year-old transwoman took a turn for the better after the quilting project began. A male by birth, Payal prefers to be called that and not Mukesh, the name given by his family. He joined Vikalp to be with like-minded people and was chosen to contribute to the “Henna Pride” quilt because of his talent as a henna artist. Although Payal is one of the few educated, young tribals in his village, he had not been able to garner enough support to effectively combat stigma and discrimination. But joining hands with others like him boosted his confidence and self-belief. Today, he is the leader of a group and helps young people in tribal areas around his village live a dignified life. Now, there is greater freedom to dress and feel like a woman and to dance and celebrate without facing any backlash.

Payal’s colleague, Dakshaben, who joined Vikalp nearly 15 years ago, has become a journalist in a small newspaper. Dakshaben, a survivor of domestic violence, initially worked at women’s courts in Tilakwada to arbitrate cases of women like her, who were exploited and battered by their husbands. She brought a gender perspective to the quilting process, having been an outreach worker and possessing deep knowledge of her tribal community.

For Anika, a sex worker, quilting gave her the chance to overcome stigma and understand that she, too, had human rights. Today, she is much more aware of her constitutional rights and has begun to take her own decisions.

Much of this transformation was made possible because of the efforts of the Advocacy Project (AP), a global not-for-profit organisation that helps marginalised groups tell their stories and become agents of change. AP collaborated with Vikalp to use the quilt- making process to help the group.

“The Advocacy Project uses embroidery and quilting as a tool for therapy, rights awareness and advocacy. Funded by the United National Population Fund to train women, AP connects the artists with professional quilters to produce stunning advocacy quilts. Then they are exhibited to a larger global audience to push for social change,” says Karen Delaney, Deputy Director, AP.

Interestingly, the process of quilting has also brought change in the lives of professional quilters like Bobbi Fitzsimmons. Little did Fitzsimmons realise that her life would change when she engaged with the project some years ago. Fitzsimmons, who was present at the Nairobi Summit where AP presented 18 quilts from 14 countries, narrated how the project helped her gain confidence to move on in life.

While working in Nepal to create two quilts with women who lost family members during the civil war in the country, Fitzsimmons was able to overcome the trauma of her own loss. “The quilts are both memorials to those who disappeared and dramatic reminders to the Government that each block represents people whose lives were torn apart by their loss,” she says.

Fitzsimmons was also involved in helping to make the Kenya Cow quilt presented by Children Peace Initiative Kenya (CPIK). This quilt showcased how cows and children played a role in bringing peace between warring tribes in north-west parts of the country.

Salaiton Lenguris and Joyce Leiririo, mothers of some of the quilters from Kenya present at the summit, pointed out how freedom from conflict had given them a chance to become economically independent. Lenguris stated that the quilts portrayed how drought forced pastoralists to take their cattle into the grazing grounds of other tribes, triggering a conflict. It also showed how children became the torchbearers of peace.

The Children Peace Building Programme came about after the CPIK decided to use them as the primary actors in the peacemaking process. “The idea is that children are not just victims of conflict; rather, they are the bridges of peace in their families and communities that can combat and resolve inter-ethnic conflicts,” contends Samson, programme officer, CPIK.

Under this programme the CPIK brought children of the warring Samburu and Pokot tribes together and engaged them in a series of activities that enabled them to become friends. Once the children became friends, their families ended hostilities. Various activities over the past three years, including a five-day peace camp for the children, helped them become agents for reconciliation between their tribes. This peace was sealed by gifting two families one heifer. Once the heifer gave birth the calves were distributed among them, thus ending the perennial conflict over livestock.

Lenguris and Leiririo were among the first from the Samburu tribe to become friends with mothers and children of the Pokot tribe. No fighting has been reported between the two tribes for some years now.

Now that there is peace, the mothers have been able to make use of their quilting training to make more quilts and the sale of their products has given them economic freedom as well.

“Besides getting the opportunity to come together, we gained skills that can be used to generate income for the rest of our lives. So, for the first time, we have the resources to look after the health of our children and families. This is why these quilts have become so important for us,” says a contented Lenguris.

11,14-3-20,A measure of their worth,"India’s first Land Records and Services Index is a way to gauge States’ relative performance and help improve services on the ground

The National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) recently released India’s first Land Records and Services Index (N-LRSI), 2020, based on data collected over 2019-20 on two aspects of the supply of records — the extent of digitisation of land records and its quality. The first component, which aims to assess whether a State has made all its records digitally available to citizens, looks at three dimensions — the text (also called the record of rights), the official map associated with a land record (also called cadastral maps) and the property registration process. The second component of the index aims to assess if the data is comprehensive and reliable. Whether ownership details are updated as soon as a sale occurs; the extent of joint ownership; type of land use; size of the plot on the record and on the map and if encumbrances are being recorded (other claims on the property such as mortgages and court cases). All these elements are closely connected to property disputes and to the ease with which transactions can be completed, legally recorded and accessed. Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu are the five best-performing States on the index.

One of the unique features of the N-LRSI, 2020 is its ability to assess the relative performance of States on various components and sub-components of the index. There is no State/UT that emerges victorious on all the parameters of the index as they are at different stages of progress with regard to the extent of digitisation of records and the registration process. For improved land record management, laggard States should extract lessons from the better-performing ones on various parameters, which can possibly drive change in State-level policies. While for textual record digitisation, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Chhattisgarh and Goa appeared to be leading, Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh topped the list for spatial record digitisation. For the registration component, Maharashtra emerged as the leader, while Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh were front runners due to quality records.

The findings will enable States to make efforts in the direction of creating more comprehensive and accurate records, by adopting the initiatives that successful States have made. In addition, the index brings out certain areas where no State/UT has taken any initiative. Effective integration across departments is one such area. The N-LRSI analysis has brought out the poor synergy across land record departments — revenue department as the custodian of textual records, the survey and settlement department managing the spatial records and the registration department. The N-LRSI design entails a sub-component of updating of ownership (within Quality of Records component), which gauges the extent of integration between registration and textual records — swiftness of the process of updating ownership as the result of registration of a transaction, the phenomenon which is commonly known as mutation. The information obtained from all the State/UT sources in this regard revealed that no State/UT has the provision for mutation on the same day as the registration. Moreover, there are only seven States/UTs that have the second-best alternative wherein a note indicating the registration appears in the textual record copy. The study also brought out the weak linkage that exists between the revenue department and survey and settlement department. This creates a huge divergence between the land area reported by the textual and spatial record, enhancing the chances of legal disputes over the definition of boundaries and extent of a land plot. With such poor inter-departmental synergy, aspiring for updated and accurate records will always be a distant goal and States/UTs should strive to undertake necessary actions to have the appropriate systems in place.

With varied recommendations for land record management, the N-LRSI, 2020 holds immense significance for a number of related factors. It is likely to be a helpful tool to assess the quality of key Government services like PM-Kisan, that are dependent on land record details. The efforts by States to improve land record digitisation and quality are expected to increase the chances of accurate identification of PM-Kisan beneficiaries and enhance the scheme’s effectiveness.

The index can be a signalling factor for investors, as a clear title is one of the prerequisites for land acquisition that a firm envisions for setting up an industrial unit. An improved quality of land records, with accurate information that mirrors the ground reality, is expected to provide the necessary push to the underdeveloped mortgage market in India. As per the Committee on Household Finance, 2017 mortgages account for only 23 per cent of total liabilities in India. One of the primary reasons for this dismal situation is the inferior quality of land records, which are often not updated, indicating a high possibility of disputes. Without clear titles, it is not possible for banks to give out loans against the land/property. For instance, if the record does not get updated to reflect the subdivision of property, it cannot be used by the on-ground owner to request for a bank loan. With serious challenges of availability and use of data and information confronting the land policy and governance, the index promises to offer a pivotal solution to improve the existing situation.

They are set to enter Rajya Sabha unopposed as there was no other candidate in the fray for the three seats. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is March 18.

While Jangra and Gautam were accompanied by Chief Minister M L Khattar, Home Minister Anil Vij, State BJP chief Subhash Barala and some party legislators, Deepender was accompanied by a majority of Congress legislators from the state including his father and former chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, to submit nomination papers to Returning Officer Ajit Balaji Joshi.

Deepender had been a three-time Lok Sabha member from Rohtak. In 2019, he narrowly lost to Arvind Sharma of the BJP as the saffron party won all 10 parliamentary seats from the state.

The two Rajya Sabha vacancies are due to resignation of BJP's Ram Kumar Kashyap and the expiry of Congress leader Kumari Selja's term next month. Jangra and Deepender entered the race to fill these vacancies which will last a full term of six years.

A third vacancy which necessitated a bypoll arose following the resignation of former Union minister and BJP leader Birender Singh and Gautam is set to enter the Upper House for the remainder of the term.

Talking to reporters, BJP nominees Jangra and Gautam expressed their gratitude to the party high command and Haryana Chief Minister for sending them to the Upper House.

Earlier, Congress and BJP called their respective MLAs to reach Chandigarh during the nomination. Ahead of nomination on Friday, BJP MLAs met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar at the auditorium in the Vidhan Sabha. Both the candidates Dushyant Kumar Gautam and Ramchandra Jangra were introduced to MLAs in the meeting. On the other hand, to ensure victory of the Congress candidate,

14,14-3-20,Liquor shop poses threat to public safety,"The country-made liquor shop running under the railway overbrige located at the side of Shiv Mandir, Mhow, and the side of the railway station is becoming a threat to the safety of the people for the last 2 years. These shops are situated in Topkhana area of Mhow which is just 1.5 kms from the present location of railway underbridge.

All these shops of Topkhana were shifted at this underbridge location 2 years ago. These shops had been running for the last 25 years.

Interestingly, before starting this shop, this liquor shop owner tried to open this shop in front of St Mary Higher Secondary School. It ran for few days before being demolished by Cantonment Board Authority. Later, Indore administration gave the place of the shop under the railway over bridge for one year but the shop owner continued to run his shop at this place for another year. It seems that the shop owner is not in a mood to vacate this place.

Thousands of people use this underbridge road to reach temple, railway station and family quarters.

Due to the presence of the drinkers, people face lots of problems daily especially the women in the night. Few months back, a 4-year-old girl had been raped after being kidnaped from nearby Shiv Temple. The accused had raped the girl under the influence of liquor.

There was no such rape crime in Mhow in last 25 years of a minor girl before the opening of this countrymade liquor shop. Earlier, this country-made liquor shop was running at a secluded spot of Topkhana but as this shop has come to this underbridge location, the rate of crime has increased. People say it is the duty of the Government to safeguard people.

Former DRM has written to the Indore administration many times to remove this shop from this underbridge but of no avail till today. The country made liquor shop owner has a high political approach in the previous Government.

Assistant Commissioner Excise, Indore, Rajnarayan Soni, told The Pioneer that he would look into the matter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/liquor-shop-poses-threat-to-public-safety.html

18,14-3-20,"On same page: Jakhar, Sukhbir demands immediate Girdwari to assess crop damage","As the unseasonal rains accompanied by hailstorm and strong winds flatten Rabi crop over one lakh hectares in Punjab, the State Congress president Sunil Jakhar and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Friday come on the same page demanding immediate girdawari (revenue assessment) to assess the crop damage.

Jakhar asked the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to get the girdawari done to assess the damage done to the wheat crops and kinnow produce due to recent rains so that farmers can be compensated.

Also demanding the same, SAD chief also demanded increasing the crop compensation rates in Punjab by increasing the state quotient share in the compensation amount as had been done earlier by the Parkash Singh Badal led SAD-BJP Government.

“The Government must announce enhanced compensation for wheat crop damaged due to rain and hail storm as it is the moral responsibility of the State to bail out farmers in times of natural catastrophe and also minimize their losses,” he said.

Sukhbir said that as per reports, there was widespread damage to wheat crop as well as mustard and vegetable crops in Nawanshahr, Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Ropar, Sangrur, Mansa and Ferozepur districts due to heavy rain and hail storms. Reports of moderate damage to crops were reported from other districts also, he said.

“Besides immediate Girdwari, farmers should also be given compensation for crop damage as soon as possible as in many districts, farmers had not received compensation for crops damaged during the last rabi season,” he said.

Underlining that the horticulture crop loss is many times higher than that of conventional crops, Jakhar appealed to the Chief Minister to give full compensation to the farmers by forming a policy to compensate the loss of horticulture.

“Farmers of Abohar and others areas in Fazilka district have adopted the government’s crop diversification program and have left the traditional wheat-paddy crop cycle and set up kinnow orchards. But, the Thursday’s hailstorm has severely damaged the age-old gardens,” said Jakhar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/on-same-page--jakhar--sukhbir-demands-immediate-girdwari-to-assess-crop-damage.html

31,14-3-20,Protesters to approach HC against Govt,"Claiming that the shifting of the protest site from near the Parade Ground to Adhoiwala away from the city center as a sign of the state government’s dictatorial attitude, some protesting groups and associations have decided to go to Uttarakhand High Court against the government. Besides, some protesting groups resumed their protest in Gandhi Park instead of the new protest site.

All the protesting groups were reportedly served notice by March 9 to shift their protest on the new protest site near Adhoiwala after the Holi festival.

On March 11, the protesters were not ready to vacate the place even after the permission approved to protest on the old protest site near Parade Ground was revoked by the city magistrate. Reportedly when the protesters did not shift the protest till the late evening, the police detained some of the protesters and later dropped them on the new protest site.The protesting groups and associations are calling such actions of the government and police the suppression of citizens and their rights in a democratic country. According to the state president of Anganwadi workers association Rekha Negi, “Forcing the protesters to vacate the protest site is unethical under a democratic government. The district administration has allotted the new protest site in an area which is quite far from the center of the city.

The protesters demonstrate for their rights so that the administration can pay attention to the complaints and issues of protesters. Who is going to listen to us in this deserted place?”“We will not bear such kind of oppressive behaviour of the government. All the protesting groups and few other associations will file a case in High Court against the city administration in few days,” added Negi.

Other protesting groups also agreed with Negi saying that they will too file the case against the misconduct of administration towards the protesters. “Police detained us when we were just asking for the annulment of the Forest Guard Recruitment Exam because of the fraud in its recruitment procedure.

We were left at a distant location in Adhoiwala around 3 AM. Should this kind of incident happen in an independent country? We will definitely join the other protesting groups in filing the court case against the administration,” said one of the protesting members of Uttarakhand Unemployed Organisation (UUO) Sanjay Panwar. The protesting members of Gairsain Rajdhani Nirman Abhiyan (GRNA) are also considering going to court against the government.

According to one of its protesting members Pradeep Chaudhary, “Earlier the government just used to neglect the protesters, now it is pushing them away from the center of the city so that no one can notice the protesters and their struggles.

No protester will tolerate this corrupt behaviour and the dictatorship of Uttarakhand Government and the necessary steps will be taken by the GRNA and if that will include filing a case against the government, we will do that too.”Meanwhile, Dehradun organiser of anti-CAA protest and senior advocate Razia Beig resumed the protest in Gandhi Park on Friday claiming the new protest site to be unsuitable for the protest, especially during the rainy days.

According to her, heap of garbage is lying below the surface in the new site through which insects have started to emerge on the surface during the rain.

35,14-3-20,People with hypertension at higher risk of getting sick from Coronavirus: PGI doctors,"Amid the chaos of the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak, health experts have warned that adults with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are at highest risk for novel Coronavirus.

In India, where prevalence of hypertension is as high as 30 percent, physicians agree that there is a need for caution.

“People with hypertension are indeed at the higher risk of catching the Coronavirus (COVID-19),” said Dr Yash Paul Sharma, Professor and Head, Department of Cardiology, PGIMER.

Highlighting the data from a global research, Dr Sharma noted that Covid-19 patients with hypertension had fatality rate of 8.4 percent to 13.2 percent in those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2 percent with diabetes, 8 percent with chronic respiratory disease and 7.6 percent with cancer.

World Health Organisation (WHO) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued special warnings to safeguard those with chronic health conditions.

Also, a recent report in the China Daily stated that 50 percent of the 170 patients, who died in Wuhan in January, had hypertension or other NCDs (non-communicable diseases). Although such claims are yet to be clinically substantiated, a WHO-China joint mission on the COVID 19 outbreak has revealed similar findings. Top doctors from Wuhan, the ground zero of COVID-19 have also corroborated that almost 50 percent of those dying from the disease were hypertensive, said health experts.

With at least 35.7 percent people in Punjab suffering from raised blood pressure and a large majority unaware of their condition, screening and precautions to safeguard from the ongoing epidemic is more urgent than ever, the health experts say.

In Chandigarh, as many as 23.6 per cent of persons in the age group above 30 years screened under National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) were diagnosed with hypertension, while the number of patients diagnosed for diabetes was 16.5 per cent in a study conducted by UT Health Department in 2018.

38,14-3-20,When humans continue ignoring nature’s lessons,"One of the common features in most schools of philosophies and societies is that people down the centuries have learnt from observing Nature and learning lessons taught by it. Be it religion or science, lessons taught by nature are many and societies have benefited by adhering to these.It is not as if nature was teaching humans lessons only in the ancient times. Nature continues to give signs and teach us lessons but in recent decades, there has been a growing tendency to ignore the lessons and go for lip service. There are various examples of this proclivity in Uttarakhand, India and across the world.

The so called natural disaster during 2013 in Kedarnath caused the deaths of thousands of people in the region. The exact number of the dead is still not certain as many of the bodies were never recovered. Apart from other factors, one would have understood that many thousands of people gathering at once at this high Himalayan pilgrimage was the main reason for the large number of deaths.

But, ignoring this, we have pursued ‘ambitious’ plans to supposedly develop and secure this place to accommodate an even higher number of people. One of the major factors related to spirituality and religion especially in the Himalayas is peace and the lack of crowds. However, efforts have been made to maximise crowds in Kedarnath and other Himalayan shrines. Various safety measures have been incorporated using different engineering and technological aids. Granted that the pilgrimage is a source of income for those involved in related activities but have we learnt what nature tried to teach us in 2013?

At times, the effects of ignoring traditions based on such lessons are inconvenient but less dramatic. This was seen recently during the Assembly session in Gairsain. Here, though the Assembly building was supposedly built in the Pahadi style, the basics were evidently ignored.

While doors in Pahadi buildings are not high and generally may even have some awning of sorts above, the assembly building has a high entrance without any cover.

As a result, when it rained and snowed, a portion of the main foyer also became wet. The effects of ignoring other traditional and sensible practices which will be more inconvenient will become known in the not too distant future.

Coming to the subject that is spreading faster and wider than the disease itself- COVID-19, one would be amiss to ignore how here too the basics of nature were ignored in China and some other parts of the world too.

According to a news report, the coronavirus is suspected to have afflicted its first patient after the person consumed a pangolin or a bat carrying the virus. The extent of animal consumption in China is such that after the disease spread alarmingly in the nation, the Chinese government reportedly closed down 20,000 ‘wet markets’- places where wild animals are sold for consumption. Such places have animals, reptiles, birds and other creatures from different continents cramped in one place awaiting slaughter after capture and a stressful journey to reach the place where they meet a horrid end.

Even now, such wet markets exist in some nations despite the spread of COVID-19. Such practices cannot be excused in the name of culture alone in the present times. For those who do not believe in Karma, there is enough scientific evidence to show that such practices are harmful not only to the environment but also to the people indulging in them. And, Namaste instead of shaking hands is not the only aspect of Indian culture which can be adhered to for preventing such scenarios.

In all these instances, people have been ignoring the simple lessons that nature has been trying to teach them. Despite humans experiencing the power of nature in its intricate and raw forms, there is a proclivity to ignore this.

Such was not always the case, because most of our traditions and systems have been developed taking cognisance of such factors.

It now remains to be seen whether we will start taking such lessons seriously or continue in our foolish ways at our own peril.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/when-humans-continue-ignoring-nature---s-lessons.html

43,14-3-20,"Health services pathetic in State, says Congress","The vice president of Uttarakhand Congress party, Surya Kant Dhasmana has said that the health services of the state are pathetic. He said that the fact that the dead foetus of a woman was removed after nine days by doctors at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital underlies the status of health services in the state.

On the intervention of Dhasmana and others the doctors of GDMC operated on the pregnant woman of Dichali village near Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi district on Friday and removed the dead foetus. The doctors of the hospital had earlier asked to the relatives of the woman to shift her to higher centre. The woman was referred from Uttarkashi hospital to Dehradun on March 3 and on March 4, she was admitted in GDMC hospital. The relatives of the woman allege that the doctors knew from day one that the child in her womb has died but they didn’t undertook operation.

On March 12, the doctors directed the woman to shift to a higher centre following which the relatives protested. When the Congress leader Dhasmana came to know about the issue, he arrived in the hospital and expressed anger at the apathy of the hospital authorities.

Dhasmana told the Pioneer that he contacted the Principal Ashutosh Sayana, the medical superintendent and the district magistrate and expressed deep anguish on the incident. “ I demanded that the woman should be operated without delay. Finally the operation was done at 11.30 am and the dead foetus was removed. The woman has been shifted to ward,’’ he said. The Congress leader claimed that one Khemraj Singh of Nagrasu in Chamoli district also met him in the hospital and narrated his sordid story. “ On March 6, wife of Khemraj Singh delivered a baby on March 9 at GDMC hospital.

The doctors asked Khemrah that since the ventilator in the hospital is occupied, he should shift his child to another hospital. The child was taken to a private nursing home where the child died,’’ Dhasmana said. The Congress leader claimed that the relatives of many patients complained about gross negligence, corruption and rude behaviour of staff during his visit to the hospital. He warned that the hospital authorities would face wrath of people if things are not improved.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/health-services-pathetic-in-state--says-congress.html

47,14-3-20,"MGM rape case rocks Assembly, Govt forms probe committee","The Jamshedpur gang rape incident rocked the Assembly on Friday with the Opposition alleging that the law and order situation in the State had deteriorated under the JMM-Congress Government. As per reports, a 50 year old woman patient was allegedly gang raped in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Hospital, Jamshedpur. The matter came to light when the Sakchi police produced the victim in court for registering her statement under section 164 of IPC. The police have even carried out the medical test of the victim but the report is yet to come.

The woman in her statement before police had said that on March 6 she was admitted at ward number 64 of MGM when a youth under the influence of alcohol assaulted and raped her. As the incident has occurred at State health minister Banna Gupta’s constituency, the incident has given a tool in the hand of Opposition BJP to attack BJP over poor law and order situation.

BJP legislator from Rajmahal Anant Ojha raising the issue demanded work adjournment on the issue. Ojha said, “It is very shameful incident that a woman who is admitted at prestigious hospital is raped. The incident becomes more shocking as it has occurred at the home constituency of health minister Banna Gupta.”

The Health Minister intervening on the issue said that City SP is investigating the case. He said, “Strict action will be taken against those found behind the incident.” However, the BJP legislators dissatisfied with Minister’s remark entered the well of the House staging protest over the incident. The BJP lawmakers demanded constitution of probe committee in the incident. Later parliamentary affairs minister Alamgir Alam said, “The government has constituted a committee to probe the incident.” Later on Speaker intervention the matter was sorted out.

BJP legislator Amar Bauri said that police is treating Baghmara MLA Dhullu Mahto as terrorist. The government should consider that he is people’s representative. Bauri said, “Police are after Dhullu Mahto as if he is murder accused or involved in terrorist activities.” Due to police action, Dhullu Mahto is unable to attend House proceedings. The BJP lawmaker demanded Speaker’s protection to Mahto in this case. On Dhullu Mahto case even State BJP president Deepak Prakash had said that police is treating Mahto as criminal and terrorist. The Baghmara MLA who is absconding is facing charges of land-grabbing, molestation and extortion.

Mahto is a two-time legislator, and he managed to retain his Baghmara seat despite an anti-incumbency wave in Jharkhand during the 2019 Assembly polls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mgm-rape-case-rocks-assembly--govt-forms-probe-committee.html

50,14-3-20,Jumbos return to Dalma sanctuary from Bengal jungles,"The picturesque Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary is abuzz with activities of over 100 jumbos these days. After staying in Bengal jungles for almost a year, the elephants have started returning to their Dalma home.

All the 130-odd jumbos are finally back home after their annual sojourn to the jungles of West Mindnapore and Bankura in neighbouring Bengal.

A forest official said several tourists are attracted towards as besides the flora and fauna, people also visit the sanctuary to watch elephants. It is the best time to spend time at the elephant abode.

“The elephants can be seen indulging in activities near the watering holes. The tuskers give visitors a reason to cheer. They can also use the hideouts built the watering holes,” the official informed.

Dalma range officer (West) Dinesh Chandra said some of the jumbos have moved uphill while some were still anchored on the foothills. “We have asked village youths recruited as daily wagers to keep a tab on movement of animals have been asked to be alert and asked to report about elephants near human habitat,” he added.

Officials of Dalma informed that over a dozen have come back while others are on their way. Others are expected to leave Mednipore and Bankura jungles shortly.

Abundance of water and fodder had held up jumbos in forest of neighbouring Bengal. Jumbos generally return home to the reserve by the end of February or at the most the first week of March. But this year they overstayed in Bengal.

The perennial water sources are basically ponds running 15 to 20 feet deep while the new artificial water sources are similar to the lake with adequate slope area across the lake for easy access of the wildlife to the water source. The depth of the artificial water sources is also around 15 feet.

Notably Dalma is the best elephant habitat of Jharkhand, where the pachyderms love to spend their summer. Dalma used to be pleasing with temperatures less than 30 degrees C. But due to rising mercury over the years the elephants started migration to green pastures.

The measures taken by the forest department include availability of adequate water holes, salt licks and sufficient food for the tuskers.

52,14-3-20,Citizen woes increase due to strike of Govt employees,"The public of Dehradun are facing problems due to the indefinite strike of the members of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association.

According to some locals, the State Government is responsible for the absence of employees from the various government offices which is causing considerable inconvenience to the citizens.

The strike of the General-OBC employees in the State has been going on for more than 10 days now, which has begun to have an adverse effect on the lives of people.

According to a Rajpur resident Karan Chandela, “I have visited the Regional Transport Office (RTO) thrice in one week but still could not get a learner’s license for a bike. In the online application, they are giving date and time but there was negligible staff in the office. There were many fellows like me who were there for hours but nothing could happen due to the absence of the staff.” “Due to the strike, the submission of some of my documents to complete the procedure of getting the pension in the Social Welfare Department is stuck for the past one week. Every time I reach their office, there are more common people and a handful of staff members.

I am a widow and have two daughters and leaving them alone at home every day just to submit few documents is not possible for me.

Last week I came at least twice a day for three days but failed to deposit the documents. I do not know when the employees will stop the strike,” said Deepa Pannu, a resident of Jakhan.

According to a Dalanwala resident Manglesh Sharma, “I waited for four hours in the office of Education Directorate to get my work done. The government should really do something about the strike of the employees.”

However, some of the people consider the State government responsible for their trouble in the government offices due to the strike of general-OBC employees.

According to them, the inability of the government to take a fair decision without delay is the reason behind the absence of employees in the State.

“Had the government declared that the promotions will be given on merits rather than reservations, the employees would have returned to their work sooner.

If somebody less worthy than me would get the promotion just because he/she belongs to a particular caste then I’ll fight for my rights too.

The government is just busy playing vote bank politics,” said a school teacher Umed Naithani.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/citizen-woes-increase-due-to-strike-of-govt-employees.html
53,14-3-20,Tourist claims hearing feeble roar of tigress in Betla Park,"A tourist’s version of feeble roar in National Park Betla resurrects the ghost of the tigress while IG NTCA ( inspector general national tiger conservation authority ) Assam region under which comes Jharkhand’s Palamu tiger reserve W Longvah is to reach National Park Betla soon.

Giving this information DS Srivastava secretary of Nature Conservation Society said, “IG NTCA Longvah telephoned me and said he would be very soon coming over to National Park Betla. I understand the death of a tigress there in the park is the prime reason of the IG to come over here but it is now almost a month the big cat died.”

The tigress was found dead near road number 2 of this park on the night of February 15, which was cremated on February 16 after a due and elaborate postmortem of the corpse carried out by a team of 5 vet doctors. Srivastava said, “I would urge IG Longvah to speak to the tourist Saibal Roy who has claimed to have heard the sigh and moaning of a tiger or tigress near road number 2 of the park in the evening say between 5 to 5.10 PM on February 15 in the evening and the same night after hours of sighing she was found dead.” The Pioneer reached the Debjani hotel in Betla where Saibal Roy the tourist had checked in on February 15 with six others also.

Speaking to the Pioneer Saibal Roy the tourist said on phone, “ I along with my fellow tourists was in a jeep near road number 2 of the park when I heard a feeble roar of a tiger or tigress, which appeared to be in utter distress and discomfort.” Roy said he was in Betla on February 15 and three days later February 18 he and his team moved out from the PTR. Roy said he is a wildlife photographer and spends time in the jungles and as such knows the sound/voice of wildlife more.He further said, “We stopped there. We found a herd of bison there in utter confusion. The bison gets into confusion when they see any tiger or tigress. Here the herd of the bison was behaving the same way.”Asked if he or any of his fellow tourists saw the tigress/ tiger Roy said “No, none of us.”

The driver Najibullah said, “ When Roy Saheb and his team stopped near the site where was coming the roar in distress the monkeys, the deer and the peacocks were sending out alarm signals a feature these animals do when a tiger or a tigress is around.”

Srivastava here raised a pointer, “A tourist heard the feeble roar in the evening of February 15 between 5 to 5.10 PM but where the tiger trackers, tiger strike force, trackers , forest guards etc were in the park as none of them heard this roar at all but discovered the wild life only dead and kept guarding the dead.”

Srivastava further lobbed a query, “Was this tigress properly and adequately trailed or monitored by the ground staff or was she left to fend for herself? How is it that no ground staff had any inkling of this tigress in distress while a tourist of Kolkata found and claimed he heard roars, which were of distress and discomfort?”

The driver told, There was a talk doing the rounds here that there is a tigress here in the park that is pregnant and so Roy ji and other tourists. thought the distress roar is related to delivery of litter of cubs but there was no such thing at all.

A noted vet doctor Ajay who was one of the 5 doctors who had conducted the post mortem of the tigress had said, “There was no question of this tigress ever remaining any pregnant.”

He said “I would exhort IG NTCA Longvah to take the versions of the tourist Roy as this will expose the gap between the PTR’s official report & ground report.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tourist-claims-hearing-feeble-roar-of-tigress-in-betla-park.html

Just like that an individual must take the initiative of keeping the surroundings clean and set an example for others to follow. Women play a vital role in this as they are the first teachers in a child’s life. Children should be taught about the importance of cleanliness right from a very young age at home and also at school.”

A technical session on environmental sanitation and nutrition was conducted by Dr Raman Ballabhin where he emphasised on eating fresh fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. “Different colours of fruits and vegetables should be made a part of all meals. Whole grains like jawar and bajra should be preferred over rotis made of maida. Peanuts, chicken, daal and walnuts are rich sources of protein and should be included. Plastic and thermocol plates used at functions and gatherings should be avoided as they are harmful not only for the human body but the environment as well.”

It is also equally important to keep the surroundings near houses and schools clean. A healthy and balanced diet is essential to fight malnutrition.

68,14-3-20,NDRF team reaches Hazaribagh,"A 20-member team of NDRF reached Hazaribag on Friday to find out reason of gas leak in the town on Thursday midnight. The gas leaked from an Ice factory situated at a residential area resulted in one death and more than 20 persons falling unconscious.

Malhar Toli, a residential area of Hazaribagh district headquarters, witnessed a sudden chaos after a gas leak from the ice cream factory late on Thursday night The sudden leakage of gas caused death of Kanchan Devi age 55 year and resident of Malhar Mohall, Hazaribagh, while more than 20 persons were admitted to hospital for treatment.

On Friday afternoon, a 20-member team of NDRF inspected the Ice Factory. Inspector Mohammad Kalam, who is leading the team, said that the gas in the tank has been emptied and now there is no danger. The valve of the gas tank was in a very dilapidated state, which led to gas leakage, he added.

Speaking about the reason of the gas leak Kalam said that Hazaribagh has been in blackout for the last four days. “The factory operator was keen to produce more ice in the same condition. As they are not skilled operators so they are not able to explain about the cooling system. The factory operators were forcing the machine for greater cooling which heated the machine and receiver. Due to this the receiver pipe and the valve got burst and the gas started to leak. If the operator was skilled, they sprayed water on the receiver getting hot but this could not happen and the pipe burst. Experts operating the ice factory said that the section pressure should be at 180 sections,” he added.

“Ammonia gas is prepared by mixing nitrogen and hydrogen gas.

It is not poisonous. But when entering inside the body, it causes difficulty in breathing due to which people can die. This gas causes eye irritation. Due to the leakage of gas in the night, the pigeons had an impact on their eyes and they fell on the ground and died,” said Kalam.

Sanjay Kumar, son of Jagdish Prasad, the operator of the factory, said that due to the power cut the valve got damaged which caused leakage of gas. We tried hard to close the wall but it broke, he added.

Meanwhile, the district administration has allocated six lakh rupees from the State Disaster Redemption Fund for the treatment of gas leak victims. DC Hazaribagh, BP Singh said that necessary action is being taken against the operator by sealing the factory.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ndrf-team-reaches-hazaribagh.html
69,14-3-20,‘Scindia’ like fear in C’garh Congress too: Brijmohan,"Firebrand BJP legislator Brijmohan Agrawal in a statement on Friday said that so many leaders are facing neglect in Chhattisgarh Congress and several Scindias are likely to come to fore in near future here too.

Taking a dig on not calling Health Minister T.S. Singhdeo to the high level meeting on Coronavirus on Thursday evening, Agrawal said he was not alone but there are so many dissatisfied Congressmen facing the neglect as Jyotiraditya Scindia was feeling in Madhya Pradesh.

Strongly reacting to the comment of Agrawal, Pradesh Congress Committee’s state general secretary and chairman communication wing Shailesh Nitin Trivedi refuted the charges of any ‘internal bickering’ or any ‘neglect’.

Regarding allegation of neglect of Singhdeo, Trivedi said he was on Bhopal tour and there was no intimation that he had returned and that was why he was not called in the meeting.

Trivedi further charged that Agrawal himself was neglected for long and even being competent was denied the post of state BJP chief earlier. “We have not forgotten the resentment of Agrawal’s supporters who had then set ablaze the state BJP office,” he said.

He further advised the BJP leader for not giving any suggestion to Congress as to how to run the government in the state.

“There are so many dissidents in BJP and how could Agrawal forget how Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha, Arun Shauri, Sanjay Joshi were honoured in BJP”, he further added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---scindia----like-fear-in-c---garh-congress-too--brijmohan.html

71,14-3-20,"Samrat died due to viral disease, say officials","Elephane ‘Samrat’ who had been attracting hordes of visitors at the Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park also known as Birsa Jaivik Udyaan for the last 21 years breathed his last on Thursday afternoon. According to the zoo officials, the elephant died because of acute viral infection which led to cardio respiratory failure.

“Prima facie, it appears that he had acute viral infection which caused widespread internal hemorrhage in all the vital organs including heart, lungs and liver. Professor Dr Gupta who conducted the post mortem is of the opinion that the death of the elephant is due to cardio respiratory failure as a result of suspected per acute viral infection causing widespread hemorrhagic changes in vital organs,” said Director of Birsa Zoological Park, D. Venkateshwarlu.

Samples collected from the post mortem have been sent to the laboratories for further tests to confirm the cause of the mammals’ death. The tests will be conducted at the labs located in Bhopal, Guwahati and at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izzatnagar in Uttar Pradesh.

The incident occurred at around 1:30 pm on Thursday. The elephant had a hearty meal the previous evening but on the morning of March 12, he seemed quite restless. The zoo doctors administered an injection for colic at about 11 am.

“After the medication was injected, he must have had instant relief from the pain. ‘Samrat’ was also seen enjoying a bath a little while later which looked quite normal for him. Due to internal hemorrhage, nothing was visible on the outside and this is a very unfortunate incident for the Ranchi zoo,” said Dr. Ajay Kumar, a veterinary doctor at the zoo

As per the authorities this is a type of emerging disease which generally affects just elephants. This infection is very common in elephants and last year six elephants died at the Nandankanan Zoological Park, Bhubaneswar within a span of about 20 days.

‘Samrat’ was found abandoned in the jungles of Chaibasa by the then forest officials and was brought to Birsa Zoological Park in the 1998 when he was just three months old. According to the zoo authorities, he was rejected by his mother upon birth.

“When the elephant had first come to the Ranchi zoo, he was suffering from severe umbilical hernia for which he also underwent an operation at the Ranchi Veterinary College. He led an absolutely healthy life for 21 years, but unfortunately he caught the infection at his prime age,” added the zoo vet.

Presently, the Ranchi zoo has just one female elephant ‘Lucky’ left. The zoo has taken preventive measures to protect her as the elephants lived in the same enclosure. Sanitization of the entire enclosed space with anti viral spray along with some dietary changes to increase immunity has been administered.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/samrat-died-due-to-viral-disease--say-officials.html

76,14-3-20,Traffic tower at Baleswar Stn Square soon,"In a bid to augment the road traffic management of the town, the police here are taking initiatives including installing automatic signals at prominent squares, CCTV and positioning adequate manpower. These are done in a public private partnership mode.

On Wednesday, ground breaking ceremony of an integrated traffic tower was held at the station square.

The tower is being built with the financial assistance of the Rotary Club , Baleswar with a budget of about Rs 10 lakh.

The tower, in a pattern of Watch tower ( Ghanta Ghar), besides having traffic post, also will have automatic signaling system and clocks in four directions. Apart from this the arts and crafts of the district would find a place in the tower.

It may be noted although the Baleswar city had automatic traffic signaling systems in the major intersections including at FM Golai, Station square and Police line square with the financial support of the industrial houses in 2009, yet by a year or two, all of them turned defunct. Those couldn’t be made serviceable due to paucity of funds in the department when the industrial houses didn’t wish to spend further towards the repair or replacement of the gadgets.

Over last 10 years the traffic posts at major squares and circles have been manned manually by the police although in some major points the department installed CCTVs

“The traffic lights couldn’t be repaired or replaced due to financial bottlenecks . But CCTvs have been installed in 18 places in and around the city and about 12 others are in pipelines . These Cameras are not only helping in traffic management but also in the monitoring the movements of criminals and crime control,” said Traffic police station OIC Prasant Ransing.

The traffic control could be more effectively carried out once the encroachments are cleared and people become self conscious, he added.

“The administration, in some places ,is failing to evict the encroachments as the encroachers are influential people. Many a time, after eviction again the encroachments are put up in the same place by the same individuals or groups. More so , people lack parking senses which make difficult for providing a hassle-free traffic,” said another police official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/traffic-tower-at-baleswar-stn-square-soon.html

89,14-3-20,"Govt stops sporting events, asks people to avoid gathering","While the national Capital is under the grip of COVID-19, the Delhi Government on Friday ordered to stop all sports gathering in the city including Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020.

Citing social distancing the most effective way to contain the spreading nature of coronovirus, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said we are urging people to avoid large gathering as much as they can. Stressing on self- quarantine, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Ministers advised people to stop participating in mass gathering activities as six cases have been confirmed so far.

“Social distancing is the most effective way to stop the spread of the coronavirus cases in Delhi and India. To maintain social distancing, it is important to avoid any big event which witnesses huge public gatherings. “The IPL and such sports events witness huge gatherings, therefore, we have decided to stop such events with an immediate effect till the further order,” said Sisodia.

“I want to tell everyone to not wait for the Government orders but to proactively avoid any big gathering. The Government is doing their best but to stop the spread of Coronavirus, mutual cooperation of the people and the Government is very important,” the Minister added.

Adding furthermore, Sidodia said, “In Korea, the coronavirus was contained for the first 30 cases. Patient 31 was a super-spreader who passed it to thousands of other people. In order to prevent instances like this, the Delhi Government has ordered that no big gatherings should take place but if you find any such gatherings where people are coming from different places then please avoid such venues. We believe that such strict preventive steps are the only way to stop this disease and many other countries are following such steps.”

“This is exponential threat where every day counts. I would urge the people to self-quarantine themselves. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, get your tests done, avoid public gatherings and stay at home. This is best way to contain spread of this disease,”

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-stops-sporting-events--asks-people-to-avoid-gathering.html
90,14-3-20,Cong targets Minister over his notice,"The Congress has targeted Transport and Commerce Minister Padmanabha Behera again over a false affidavit row concerning his educational qualification.

In response to a notice sent by Minister Behera to Congress spokesperson Nishikanta Mishra for tarnishing his image over his allegation on February 16 that Behera gave false information on his educational qualification during filing his nominations at different times, which did not match, Mishra dared to face him in court with all documentary evidences.

Mishra in a Press conference on Friday asked why the police had not taken any action against Behera despite an Orissa High Court direction to take criminal proceedings against the Minister under People’s Representation Act, 1951 and IPC Section 171 A for submitting the false affidavit. Mishra also alleged one Bhagaban Bag, who moved the HC over the false affidavit issue of Behera, was being threatened and attacked by goons.

“It was expected that the Minister Behera would clear the air on his educational qualification with proofs for the people of the State. But instead of doing that he served a notice to save his face before his electorate,” charged Mishra. He also demanded that the Chief Minister who is claiming so much about transparency and 5T should take action against Cabinet Minister Behera for keeping the people of the State in dark over his educational qualification.

96,14-3-20,Corona could be modern-day Bhasmasura,"An epidemic is an event in which a disease is actively spreading. By contrast, the term pandemic relates to geographic spread and is used to describe a disease that affects a whole country or the entire world.

Throughout history, there have been a number of pandemics, such as cholera, plague, smallpox and tuberculosis. One of the most devastating pandemics was the Black Death, which killed an estimated 75–200 million people in the 14th century.

The 2019–20 corona virus pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The virus first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019. On March 11, the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of March 11, over 1,26,000 cases have been confirmed in more than 110 countries and territories, with major outbreaks in mainland China, Italy, South Korea, and Iran. More than 4,600 have died from the disease and 67,000 have recovered.

In Hindu religion, Bhasmasura was an asura or demon who was granted the power by Lord Shiva to burn up and immediately turn into ashes (bhasma) anyone whose head he touched with his hand. Bhasmasura then tried to experiment it with Lord Shiva and then wreaked havoc across the world. It might be possible that COVID-19 is manmade virus developed in Wuhan research laboratory which has now turned into Bhasmasura. Lord Vishnu, in the form of Mohini finally killed him.

Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material inside of a protein coating. Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common cold, flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, smallpox, and Ebola. The ancient virus is one of the most devastating diseases known to mankind. The extremely contagious disease small pox is caused by the variola virus. Humans have battled the virus for thousands of years. In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed 300 million people worldwide. WHO declared the virus had been eradicated in 1980.

Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This can kill, damage, or change the cells and make you sick. Different viruses attack certain cells in our body such as our liver, respiratory system, or blood. When we get a virus, we may not always get sick from it. Our immune system may be able to fight it off. For most viral infections, treatments can only help with symptoms while we wait for our immune system to fight off the virus. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Vaccines can help prevent us from getting many viral diseases.

Viruses can be transmitted in a variety of ways. Some viruses can spread through touch, saliva, or even the air. Other viruses can be transmitted through sexual contact or by sharing contaminated needles. Insects including ticks and mosquitoes can act as ""vectors,"" transmitting a virus from one host to another. Contaminated food and water are other potential sources of viral infection.

Thus it is advised to Wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly — and often. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available. Also we should not touch our face, especially our eyes, nose and mouth. People should not be panic rather should maintain a neat and clean environment. Lord Vishnu will save us from the grip of COVID-19.

99,14-3-20,Party workers miffed over Tirtol BJD polls,"The recent BJD organisational elections in three blocks under the Tirtol Assembly constituency have raised eyebrows among the party’s rank and file not only in Tirtol but also throughout the politically conscious Jagatsinghpur district.

Hundreds of disgruntled party workers told this correspondent at Tirtol, Raghunathpur and Biridi that veteran political BJD leaders including Tirtol MLA Bishnu Charan Das were not even taken into confidence before filling of nomination, election and declaration of the result.

They alleged arbitrary and unlawful nomination and declaration of the name of three block presidents by district Retaining Officer Goutam Palit have caused unprecedented resentment and huge uproar among the genuine BJD workers of Tirtol Assembly segment.

Tirtol Block BJD president Basanta Mohapatra said, “The undemocratic modus operandi of the district Returning Officer Goutam Palit, party observer for Jagatsinghpur district Debasis Samantaray and State Returning Officer Pratap Keshari Deb has administered a terrible body blow to the BJD organisation of Tirtol.”

“If the party supremo and our popular Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik will not look into the mess of affairs of BJD organisation, it will have dangerous and detrimental repurcations for BJD in days ahead,” cautioned a BJD dedicated grass root leader of Raghunathpur block Saroj Kanta Swain.

100,14-3-20,Poll reforms: What recent EC report lacks,"After the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, nine working groups comprising of Election Commission of India (ECI) officials and State electoral officers were constituted, who have submitted a report on February 18.

The report contains recommendation for putting a cap on campaign expenditure by parties and candidates and bring in greater transparency in the domain. The ECI report has also suggested bringing in the social media and print media under the silent period ambit which is 48 hours before polling and online registration of voters at the age of 17.

But it seems the unsavoury practices prior to, and during elections and the their ramifications post elections are far from being controlled by such limited measures. It is an open secret that the first three general elections were held in a free and fair manner, but a degradation of electoral ethics and standards came into light in 1967, during the fourth general elections. And surprisingly, the electoral process which is the edifice of democracy has become the basis of political corruption.

The ground reality is that in every constituency, candidates spend crores of rupees for campaigning and propaganda and this exceeds far beyond the permissible limit of expenses, and this is coupled with incidents of violence, intimidation, booth capturing, etc during polling.

It is common that political parties field criminals for funds and muscle flexing to win elections and in return they are provided with political patronage and protection. The single most important criterion, that is assessed by the political parties irrespective of the ability and integrity of the candidates is, ‘winnability’ in the elections. As a result of which competent and educated candidates who can best serve the constituents fail to see a chance to participate and succeed in the process.

In a glance, under the regulations in vogue there is no limit on the amount a political party can spend in an election or on a candidate. But, the individual candidates’ spending for the Lok Sabha elections is Rs 50 – 70 lakh (depending on the State they are contesting), and Rs 20 – 28 lakh for Assembly election.

Interestingly, the EC had put in a regulation before 2019 elections saying that exit poll results could be broadcast only after the final phase of the elections were over. This was made to not let the prospective voters get misguided. In 2013, the EC expanded postal ballot voting in the country. Prior to that, only Indian staff in missions and defence personnel in a limited way could vote via postal ballots.

But the story is different now, since it has been extended to six categories of voters who can use the postal ballot: service voters, special voters, wives of service voters and special voters, voters subjected to preventive detention, voters on election duty and notified voters. Besides, political parties now need to report contribution in excess of Rs 20,000 to the EC for claiming Income Tax benefit. Further, declaration of criminal antecedents, assets, etc. by the candidates is now made mandatory and declaring of false information in the affidavit is an electoral offence punishable with imprisonment up to 6 months or fine or both.

Irrespective of what is being done so far and what is recently suggested by the EC, the challenges are manifold, like it is yet a distant dream to devise an apparatus to assure the voter that, there is transparency about the background of the candidates, to free the election processes from muscle and money power, to prohibit nexus between business and politics, availing all the citizens eligible to vote a comfortable, friendly and assured facilitation of vote casting, to assure a non-partisan role of media and efficient application of the model code of conduct.

Early this year, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav while speaking in a conference on “Indian Democracy at Work-Money Power in Politics” said, ""I feel that the Election Commission has an important role. I feel that it should have its own cadre.” This indeed is an important suggestion to think about which can go a long way in ensuring an efficient way of functioning of the EC.

In a recent judgment, the Supreme Court said, “…this court was cognizant of the increasing criminalisation of politics in India and the lack of information about such criminalisation amongst the citizenry."" Here the court laid the onus on political parties for publicising information on candidates who have criminal charges against them, along with the reasons for choosing them and also for rejecting others with clean records.

Besides, the direction comprised vesting responsibility on the EC to inform such non-compliance, if any, to the apex court. On this, former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) SY Quraishi, said, “It is a step forward for electoral reforms but still halfway from cleaning up the system. They have basically culled out the 2018 order with stronger wording and time-bound compliance"".

So, it appears despite all of this what the EC in its recent report has missed is, the essential suggestion to give more teeth to itself, which shall be beneficial in its fight against ‘vote buying’ and ‘hate speech’, which may include suspension of candidates to contest elections for five years or any other efficient and stringent measure.

Friday was the last date of filing of nominations for the biennial polls wherein a number of the contestants are set to get elected unopposed.

Fifty-one of these 55 seats from 17 states are falling vacant on different dates in April due to retirement of sitting members, while four other seats are already vacant due to resignation of members.

Bypoll will also be held to a Rajya Sabha seat from Haryana vacated by former Union minister Birender Singh. Counting will be held on the evening of March 26, an hour after the conclusion of polls.

A keen battle is on the cards in Madhya Pradesh, where the Kamal Nath government faces a grim future following rebellion by at least 22 MLAs, as both the BJP and the Congress have announced two candidates each for the state's three seats.

Scindia and Digvijay Singh are expected to comfortably win in the polls. The BJP's Sumer Singh Solanki and Phool Singh Baraiya of the Congress are likely to slug it out for the third seat. The two parties are comfortably placed to ensure the win of one of their candidates, and while the Congress initially appeared to have an edge for the third seat, the resignation of 22 of its MLAs has made the numbers game tricky.

Apart from Madhya Pradesh, there are seven vacancies from Maharashtra, six from Tamil Nadu, followed by five from West Bengal and Bihar, four each from Odisha, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, three each from Assam and Rajasthan, two each from Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Jharkhand, and one each from Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya.

The Trinamool Congress and the YSR Congress Party are expected to make significant gains in the 245-member Upper House after the March 26 elections. The ruling YSR Congress is expected to comfortably bag all the four seats in Andhra Pradesh, given its strength of 151 in the 175-member assembly. In West Bengal, the ruling TMC has fielded Dinesh Trivedi, Arpita Ghosh, Mausam Noor and Subrata Bakshi. Its former MLA Dinesh Bajaj has also filed his nomination and may get the party's backing.

All the four BJD candidates -- Subhas Singh, Munna Khan, Sujit Kumar and Mamata Mahanta -- are also expected to win from Odisha.

For the seven Rajya Sabha seats falling vacant in Maharashtra, Pawar and Union minister Ramdas Athawale, both sitting Rajya Sabha members; BJP's Udayanraje Bhosale, a descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and Bhagwat Karad; Congress general secretary Rajiv Satav, Shiv Sena deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi and former NCP minister Fauzia Khan are in the fray.

Neighbouring Gujarat is also expected to witness a close contest with three candidates from the BJP -- Abhay Bharadwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin -- and two from the Congress -- Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki -- filing their nomination papers on Friday for four vacant seats.

All the five candidates in Bihar -- Harivansh (JDU), Ram Nath Thakur and Vivek Thakur (both BJP) and Prem Chand Gupta and A D Singh (both RJD) are expected to be declared elected on March 18, the last date for withdrawal of nominations.

For the two seats in Jharkhand, the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD alliance has fielded JMM chief Shibu Soren and Shahzada Anwar of the Congress.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/scindia--pawar--harivansh--digvijay--soren-in-fray-as-nomination-filing-ends.html
121,14-3-20,"LF, Cong frown over TMC fielding ex-MLA","In what the Left and the Congress called a product of a “secret understanding” between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress the latter on Friday fielded a former party MLA Dinesh Bajaj as its fifth candidate for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections.

While the TMC had earlier fielded four former MPs —Dinesh Trivedi,Mausam Benazir Noor, Subrato Bakshi and Arpita Ghosh — it was unsure of fielding the fifth candidate considering its strength in the State Assembly.

“Though according to the numbers we may not be able to get the fifth seat we do not say that we will not field a fifth candidate. We willtake a decision very soon,” TMC general secretary Partho Chatterjee had said on Wednesday. Bajaj is contesting as an Independent candidate backed by the TMC.

The CPI(M) which had with the backing of the Congress Party nominated former Kolkata Mayor and senior counsel Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for the fifth vacant seat however saw a “secret understanding” between the TMC and the BJP.

“Going by its strength in the House it can only elect five candidates. Now it has decided to field a fifth candidate knowing full well that it cannot get him victorious on its own votes… As the Congress has already supported the Left the BJP’s votes may be crucial in a tight situation,” said a senior Left leader.

Former CPI(M) MP Samik Lahiri said Bajaj enjoys good chemistry with the saffron party adding TMC’s fielding the fifth candidate was the result of secret talks with the BJP which too like the Trinamool Congress wants to block the passage of the Left from entering Parliament. “But we are confident that the CPI(M) candidate will win the elections,” he said.

Though the Left and the Congress feel Bhattacharya can comfortably win the fifth seat the experts feel that Trinamool is banking on a possible rift in the Congress over its support to the Left a party against which it had been fighting for the past more than 60 years.

“We will leave it on the conscience of the Congress MLAs to decide whether they will vote for a party which had tortured massacred its members for more than three decades of its rule,” said Chatterjee.

Experts also said that if the BJP decided against refraining from voting then its members might not prefer a Left candidate to the one from the TMC.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lf--cong-frown-over-tmc-fielding-ex-mla.html
122,14-3-20,Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi file papers,"Shiv Sena’s deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi, Congress general secretary Rajiv Satav, NCP’s former Minister Fauzia Khan and BJP’s Bhagwat Karad on Friday filed nominations for the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls from Maharashtra.

Friday was the last day for the elections to seven Rajya Sabha seats from the State.

NCP president Sharad Pawar and Union Minister Ramdas Athawale, both sitting Rajya Sabha members, and BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale, 13th descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, had already filed their papers for the March 26 polls.

The elections to seven RS from Maharashtra have been necessitated by the impending end of the terms of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Union minister Ramdas Athawale, Congress' Hussain Dalwai, Sena's Rajkumar Dhoot, BJP's Amar Sable, BJP-backed Independent Sanjay Kakade and NCP's Majeed Memon, on April 2.

Karad, a former Mayor of Aurangabad, filed the nomination on behalf of the BJP. He was accompanied by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra adnavis, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil and ex-state minister Pankaja Munde.

Incidentally, Karad is the third BJP candidate to have filed nomination for the polls after Athawale and Bhosale, who submitted their papers on Thursday. Athawale heads the RPI (Athawale), an ally of the BJP.

Though it has gone on expected lines, the Shiv Sena’s decision to nominate Priyanka Chaturvedi has sparked a debate within the state political circles in general and in the Sena circles in particular.

Informed party sources said that Priyanka had been hand-picked by Sena leader and minister Aditya Thackeray, whose recommendation of her name tilted the scale in her favour. The Sena announced Priyanka’s nomination after ignoring the claims of senior Shiv Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire.

A four-time MP from Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency, Khaire was trounced by AIMIM’s Imtiyaz Jaleel in 2019 polls. Khaire had been lobbying for his rehabilitation by way of nomination to contest the March 26 RS polls.

Priyanka’s nomination has apparently not taken kindly by Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut, who had till now become the face of the Shiv Sena in New Delhi. Now, he will have a completion in Priyanka who speaks well both in English and Hindi. In effect, the Shiv Sena will have a charming face in the national capital, in addition to Raut, who being a close aide of chief minister and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray will have a bigger say in the party affairs.

As the lone candidate of Shiv Sena, Priyanka’s election to Rajya Sabha has become a mere formality. Her election to Rajya Sabha will come as a major break for Priyanka in her decade-long political career.

Priyanka, who worked as a director of a media and public relations firm in Mumbai, began her political career with the Congress party in 2010.

After working as the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress from North-West Mumbai in 2012, she came to be appointed as the spokesperson of the All India Congress Committee.

However, on April 19, 2019, a miffed Priyanka joined the Shiv Sena after she quit the Congress in the wake of reinstatement of some Congress workers who had manhandled her during a press conference in Mathura in September 2018 and denial of party ticket to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Mumbai.

Soon after she joined the Shiv Sena, the party leadership recognised her and appointed her as a deputy party leader.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena---s-priyanka-chaturvedi-file-papers.html
123,14-3-20,"Ticket-booking jobs for youth, private agents not needed: Goyal","The Government will create railway ticket booking jobs for youths by first barring the private vendors and touts from doing the same, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal told Lok Sabha as he also informed members that vacant lands of railways would be used for setting up solar panels, producing 20,000 MW electricity, leading to zero cost on power for running locomotives.

Replying to a discussion on the demand for grants of the Railway Ministry, the minister spoke about his Ministry's crackdown on touts, including arrests, and asserted that private agents are no longer needed when most people can book tickets on mobiles.

Those who need help can go to ""common service centres"" which are run by Government, he said.

The touts used to book tickets in large numbers within moments of their availability using certain softwares, he said, adding that his ministry has taken action against them.

Goyal also said that on the suggestion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , his ministry would use vacant lands available with the railways for generating solar energy. He estimated that this could generate solar power to the tune of 20,000 mw, reducing power expenditure for running trains to almost zero. The Minister said whenever land was needed for other use, it solar panels could be shifted elsewhere.

Earlier, the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) was built and operated by different entities which created problems, Javadekar said.

""Now, we have decided that those who built and operate the sewage treatment plants are the same. They will operate the plant for 10 years,"" he added.

The minister also cited that the examples of water bodies in Bengaluru where sewage water is being let in without being treated and emphasised on preserving water bodies.

To another question, Javadekar said the Centre on Friday said it has permitted fencing around forest areas to ensure safety of people living in adjacent villages from attacks by wild animals. Responding to a question the nvironment Minister said the government is providing financial and technical assistance to state governments for activities like erection of physical barriers around forest areas to avoid man-animal conflict. Responding to a yet another question , Javadekar said over 300 out of 700 industries inspected by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have been found violating environmental norms and causing pollution in the last four years.

Most of the industries which were found violating environmental norms were steel, cement, power and pharmaceutical.

However, out of the 342 units found non-complying during inspection, 293 are complying as on date, the minister said, adding that directions/ notices issued for the remaining 49 non-complying units are still in force.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ticket-booking-jobs-for-youth--private-agents-not-needed--goyal.html

Stressing the point that the Navy’s fighting capabilities depend on the high value platforms like aircraft carrier, submarines, destroyers and frigates, the panel said the allocation for the Navy(percentage)wise has seen the “”sharpest decline.””

In its remarks over the low capital fund, the Committee also said it was surprised over the fact that during the year 2019-2020, the shortfall in the projection to allocated amount was Rs 67, 541.76 crores. However, the defence ministry is convinced with additional allocation of “”meagre”” Rs 7,000 crores, the report said.

In this backdrop, the committee, therefore in “”unequivocal”” terms recommend that all-out efforts be done to give first and foremost priority to the preparedness of the defence forces. It should also be ensured that critical requirements of the Services do not suffer due to want of funds, the panel said.

The issue of burgeoning pension bill also came under the panel’s scrutiny as the pension budget has increased approximately 3.5 times since the last decade. The pension provision for 2020-21 is Rs 1,33, 825crores which is Rs 16, 014.56 crores more than 2019-20.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/armed-forces-need-more-funds-for-weapons--parl-panel.html

The standing committee on External Affairs approved the Registration of Marriage of Non-Resident Indian Bill, 2019 with inclusions of recommendations made by its members.

The bill empowers passport authorities to impound or revoke passport or travel documents of NRIs who fail to register within 30 days after getting married.

The committee called for amending the proforma for registration of NRI marriage to make it “exhaustive incorporating all the germane” details related to passport, visa or permanent resident card and address in foreign country with proof.

It strongly recommended that the efforts must be intensified to establish better coordination with the member countries of Hague Convention and to take up the issues of NRI marital disputes during bilateral meetings and consular dialogue with foreign countries.

The committee also noted that 5,298 complaints have been received related to NRI marital grievances between January 1, 2016 and October 31, 2019.

The bill was brought in by former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj amid reports of Indian women being victims in fraudulent marriages with NRIs.

The bill proposes to provide for compulsory registration of marriage by an NRI within a period of 30 days from the date of marriage. It also seeks to amend the Passport Act, 1967 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

The proposed amendment of the Passport Act, 1967 empowers the passport authority to impound or cause to be impounded or revoke a passport or travel document of an NRI, if it is brought to his notice that the NRI has not registered his marriage within a period of 30 days from the date of marriage.

The proposed amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would also empower the courts for issuance of summons, warrants through the specifically designated website of the Ministry of External Affairs. It further provides for attachment of the properties, both movable and immovable, belonging to a proclaimed offender.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/parl-panel-ok---s-bill-on-mandatory-registration-of--nri-marriages.html

Responding to whether the Bill will provide amnesty to those who are covered under demonetisation related cases, she said this scheme is “not an amnesty scheme at all” but the taxpayer has to pay a certain amount and that tax amount, the undisclosed cash deposit during demonetisation is liable to suffer a tax of 75 per cent.

“Hence the taxpayer has to pay 75 per cent for settling the dispute regarding the cash deposits which have been made during the period of demonetisation. So it is not an amnesty for anybody,” Sitharaman said. She said cases above Rs 5 crore have been excluded from the scheme so that large evasion related cases and fraud cases do not come into the scheme and take advantage of it.

“That is why we have limited it to the topmost extent of Rs 5 crore and not beyond.

155,14-3-20,Sugarcane arrears of farmers down: Paswan,"Sugarcane arrears of farmers have come down significantly to Rs 1,314 crore from Rs 28,222 crore for the 2018-19 marketing year. Sugar marketing year runs from October to September. In a reply to Rajya Sabha during Question Hours, Union Food and Supplies Minister Ramvilas Paswan on Friday said the cane price arrears now are almost “negligible” for the last two sugar marketing years.

“As a result of these measures, the all-India cane price arrears of farmers have come down to Rs 251 crore for 2017-18 based on state-advised price (SAP) and Rs 134 crore based on the central price called the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). For 2018-19, the arrears have come down to Rs 1,314 crore on SAP basis and Rs 931 crore on FRP basis, Paswan said.

“Low realisation from sale of sugar due to surplus sugar stocks had adversely affected the financial health of sugar mills, resulting in accumulation of cane arrears of farmers which peaked at Rs 23,232 crore during sugar season 2017-18 in May 2018 and at Rs 28,222 crore during the sugar season 2018- 19 in April 2019,” Paswan said.

Paswan said some states, including Uttar Pradesh, announced their own cane price called SAP, which is higher that the Centre’s FRP. The minister highlighted that the Centre has taken many steps in 2019-20 as well to help sugar mills clear cane dues.

He said the Centre has created buffer stocks of 40 lakh tonnes of sugar, costing Rs 1,674 crore to the exchequer. That apart, an assistance of Rs 6,268 crore is being provided to help mills export 60 lakh tonnes of sugar.

During the sugar season 2018- 19(October-September), the sugar production in the country was 331.20 lakh tones. The sugar production during current sugar season 2019-20 is likely to be reduced by about 18% to 273 lakh tonnes. The reduction in production of sugar is due to fall in production of sugarcane mainly in the major sugar producing states of Maharashtra and Kamataka, due to drought in some parts and healy rains and floods in some other parts ofthese states.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sugarcane-arrears-of-farmers-down--paswan.html

158,14-3-20,Govt approves tax reimbursement plan for exporters,"The government on Friday approved a scheme for reimbursement of taxes and duties to exporters with a view to give boost to the country’s dwindling outbound shipments.

A decision in this regard was taken in a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.

The reimbursement of taxes such as duty on power charges, VAT on fuel in transportation, farm sector, captive power generation, mandi tax, stamp duty and central excise duty on fuel used in transportation would make Indian products competitive in global markets, the Commerce and Industry ministry tweeted.

The measures are compliant with WTO norms, it mentioned. The sectors and products under the remission of duties and taxes on export products (RoDTEP) will be notified in a phased manner and the MEIS benefit for those sectors and items will be withdrawn.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced RoDTEP scheme in her Budget speech on February 1.

Briefing the media about this decision, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said with the rolling out of this new scheme, the Merchandise Export Incentive Scheme (MEIS) will be “phased out”.

Sitharaman had said the scheme will be launched this year itself.

159,14-3-20,Brokerages advise investors against taking short bets,"Brokerage houses on Friday cautioned investors against making an entry even as benchmark stock indices recovered after hitting the lower circuit of 10 per cent, saying the impact of coronovirus pandemic is still lingering. If someone is buying stocks, they should do so only with a medium to long term investment horizon and not to make a quick buck, they advised investors.

Immediately after opening, trading had to be halted on both the BSE and NSE on Friday as the indices hit the lower circuit after a fall of over 10 per cent. However, after opening in 45 minutes, they zoomed to be in the green as against the previous day’s close. The selling was in line with global peers and possibly also a reaction to the first Indian death due to the virus pandemic. “Investors should avoid taking any knee-jerk reaction to the current sell-off,” asset manager Axis Mutual Fund said in a note, advising that fresh investments should be spread over 3-6 months time.

Foreign brokerage Bank of America Securities made it clear that it is “not yet” the time to buy, reasoning that the Covid-19 sentiment is still driving the markets and major global markets will first have to contain the pandemic.

Containment of the virus will have an economic cost as it may require drastic lockdowns and also economic checks. It is not a “kid in toy shop” moment in India, it warned, pointing out that stocks which can deliver steady growth are still far from being cheap.

However, domestic brokerage ICICI Securities was more optimistic.

“We see the current correction as a buying opportunity for the investors who should utilise the declines to lap up the good businesses which have comfortable leverage, strong return ratios and enjoy leadership position,” it said.

Shares of IndiGo and SpiceJet were trading with heavy losses. InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of the country’s largest airline IndiGo, saw its shares slump 14.08 per cent to hit 52-week low of Rs 875. SpiceJet dropped nearly 10 per cent to Rs 44.70. Hundreds of cancelled flights, decline in daily ticket bookings, fall in footfalls at airport shops and spike in expenses continue to rattle the country’s aviation space as airlines, with weakened financials, and airport operators grapple with coronavirus headwinds.

161,14-3-20,"Govt, RBI closely monitoring markets: FM","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the government and the Reserve Bank are closely monitoring the stock market, which is facing intense volatility amid mounting coronavirus fears.

Together with the RBI, the government is closely monitoring markets, she said on the situation arising out of a panic spread of coronavirus pandemic.

After being battered in the early session, the BSE Sensex spurted 1,325.34 points and the NSE Nifty rose 365.05 points to settle the day at 9,955.20.

Indian market saw its biggest intra-day selloff in early session, wiping nearly Rs 12 lakh crore off investor wealth in less than 20 minutes of opening trade.

As coronavirus-led recession fears triggered panic selling globally, both Sensex and Nifty plunged over 10 per cent in the opening session, hitting their lower circuit levels.

Stock exchanges halted trading for 45 minutes. Normal trading resumed at around 1030 hours.

The last circuit freeze happened in January 2008.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday said it is closely monitoring the current global situation and assured that it will take all steps to keep markets adequately liquid and stable. The statement comes at a day when trading on the Indian stock exchanges hit a “circuit breaker” — first time since 2008 — as soon as markets opened on Friday.

“The RBI is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that money, debt and forex markets remain adequately liquid and stable, and continue to function normally,” the RBI said in a statement. In the currency markets, the Indian rupee recovered sharply to trade 46 paise higher at 73.82 against the US dollar. At open, the rupee fell to a record low of 74.5075 against the US dollar.

The RBI also announced to infuse an additional short-term liquidity of Rs 25,000 crore in to the system to counterbalance the domestic liquidity effects on account of dollar sell-buy swap on Friday.

It conducted Rs 25,000 crore of a variable rate repo auction with a 7-day tenor.

On Thursday, the RBI had announced to undertake six-month US dollar sell/buy swaps to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market amid evolving financial market conditions and taking into consideration the requirement of US dollars in the market.

To start with, an amount of USD 2 billion would be offered on March 16, 2020.

The swap will be in the nature of a simple sell/buy foreign exchange swap from the Reserve Bank side.

A bank will buy US Dollars from the RBI and simultaneously agree to sell the same amount of US Dollars at the end of the swap period.

The RBI also said the minimum bid size for the swap auction will be USD 10 million and in multiples of USD 1 million thereafter.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt--rbi-closely-monitoring-markets--fm.html

164,14-3-20,Europe now ‘epicentre’: WHO,"The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Friday that Europe was now the “epicentre” for the global coronavirus pandemic and reporting more daily cases than China did at the height of its outbreak.

“Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a virtual Press conference, describing the more than 5,000 deaths worldwide as “a tragic milestone”.

The death toll from COVID-19 jumped over 5,000 on Friday as the number of cases around the world topped 134,000, according to an AFP tally.

Europe is bearing the brunt of increasing infections, but Iran clocked more deaths on Friday and cases were reported in Kenya and Ethiopia, the first in east Africa.

Across the globe, Governments are imposing draconian measures never before seen in peacetime — sealing off borders, closing schools and cancelling public gatherings.

The virus has also torn up the sporting and cultural calendar, with top-flight events from Broadway to English Premier League football scrapped. The virus, which first emerged in China in December, has spread relentlessly around the world even as cases in Asia have levelled out in recent days. South Korea — once grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China — saw newly recovered patients exceed fresh infections for the first time, as it reported the lowest number of new cases for three weeks.

China earlier this week claimed “the peak” of the pandemic had passed its shores, but infections and deaths have jumped dramatically in Italy, Spain and Iran.

COVID-19 is sparing no-one. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was in self-imposed quarantine after his wife tested positive, the day after Hollywood star Tom Hanks said he and his wife were infected. Australia’s Home Minister Peter Dutton announced he had tested positive, while as leaders in Brazil and the Philippines await test results.

France — the world’s most visited country — has ordered schools and universities closed until further notice and announced it was banning gatherings of more 100 people, following similar moves in many other countries.

President Emmanuel Macron said it was “the worst health crisis in France in a century”. The measures came after Italy — second worst hit in the world — imposed the continent’s toughest response to the outbreak, shutting all shops except for pharmacies and groceries in the hope of stemming contagion and easing the burden on overstretched hospitals.

With nations imposing travel bans and closing borders, global tourism has ground to a halt, throwing the aviation industry into chaos and leaving travellers stranded.

In European airports, confused passengers scrambled to redraw their plans after US President Donald Trump this week banned all travellers from mainland Europe for 30 days.

“We just got off our plane and we’re going to go straight back — we can’t believe it,” said 29-year-old Tiara Streng, queueing with three friends at London’s Heathrow Airport for a return flight to Colorado.

The Czech Republic became the latest European country to order the closure of its borders, sealing it off from a number of countries, including virus hotspots.

Such measures were criticised by EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who said travel bans were not seen by the WHO as being effective.

Fellow EU state Hungary has also imposed border restrictions — with outspoken nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban blaming foreigners for the spread of COVID-19. “Our experience is that primarily foreigners brought in the disease, and that it is spreading among foreigners,” he said in a radio interview.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/europe-now----epicentre-----who.html
165,14-3-20,Oasis of calm,"New York, Big Apple, The City That Never Sleeps — the most wanted city goes by different names and is loved by all, visitors and residents. But the pulsating vibe of one of the most expensive pieces of real estate can be exhausting. Offset it with some of the most luxurious spas that the city (and the country) can offer. From Swedish massages to aromatherapy, Hungarian beauty secrets and Ayurvedic treatments, take your pick

Bamford Haybarn Spa at the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge: The Bamford Haybarn Spa adopts wellness traditions from around the globe and uses exclusive, organic products made in England. Notable treatments include the Bespoke Facial, which employs jade stone therapy, yogic breathing techniques and natural elixirs to help restore and repair skin. Other specialised services, like the Edition 1 Signature Treatment, incorporate Swedish and Japanese massage methods as well as acupuncture to promote full-body relaxation. The spa’s decor was inspired by hay barns of the English countryside, accented with reclaimed wood and tree branches to evoke a rustic, calming environment.

The Spa at the Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown: This Lower Manhattan hotel boasts a 75-foot lap pool, seven spa treatment rooms and customised services. The marble-decorated facility has partnered with Hungarian beauty brand Omorovicza for its facials, such as the gold hydralifting, which uses bioavailable gold to repair and plump up the skin. Its body treatments shouldn’t be overlooked either. The hydrating Swiss milk ritual recalls an ancient Egyptian beauty treatment — favoured by Cleopatra herself — that incorporates Swiss milk and an anti-ageing concentrate into a nourishing bath for the skin.

Guerlain Spa at The Plaza Hotel: You’ll feel like you’re on an island (other than Manhattan, that is) at Guerlain Spa — a peaceful, French-inspired oasis far-removed from the bustle of midtown. Located in The Plaza Hotel, this spa offers skin care and massage treatments that mirror the hotel’s extravagance. The Orchidée Impériale Black facial uses the beauty brand’s Black Orchid cream to defend and combat signs of ageing, while the Urban Island Escape applies coconut honey and sugar to massage and exfoliate the body, with a coconut-oil massage to follow.

Spa Valmont at Hôtel Plaza Athénée: The Hôtel Plaza Athénée’s Spa Valmont, which is the Switzerland-based spa’s only US location, includes four private suites, each with a dressing room, lounge chair and steam shower. The spa’s signature Time Master Sublimating Programme combines massage and facial services to reduce signs of stress and provides anti-ageing benefits for your skin. Also on site, a salon offers blowouts and make-up applications, the latter courtesy of Kevyn Aucoin cosmetics.

Joanna Vargas Skin Care: The woman responsible for Jessica Alba’s glowing skin offers a range of skin care services in her Bryant Park–adjacent office. Vargas’ signature Triple Crown facial lifts and firms the skin and is a favourite of her celebrity clientele — which includes Julianne Moore. Clients also clamour for the LED light therapy treatments, which provide a full-body boost for those feeling a little worn out. Try the “Sleeping Beauty,” a half-hour treatment comprising microdermabrasion on your face, followed by oxygen-serum application and an LED light bed session meant to reduce inflammation and fatigue.

La Prairie Spa at The Ritz-Carlton Central Park: Find the only Northeast location of La Prairie’s spa inside the Ritz-Carlton Central Park. The Swiss luxury skin-care line is famous for its Skin Caviar, a nourishing, lifting and firming line of products that is incorporated into spa treatments like the Timeless Beauty facial. Exclusive to this outpost is the Central Park Signature Ritual, a massage that uses essential oils for a serene experience. Six spacious treatment rooms provide a relaxing environment for clients.

Tracie Martyn: Tracie Martyn is the go-to facialist for Brad Pitt, Sandra Bullock and Madonna—and you, too, can get the celebrity treatment at her lavender-accented Fifth Avenue salon. Options there include the skin-tightening Resculpting facial and the Red Carpet facial, which focus on reducing wrinkled and fine lines via LED light and light skin contouring. The Diamond facial, however, is probably the most luxurious—it uses a crystal-free, diamond-tip microdermabrasion machine to purify and brighten the skin and reduce signs of ageing.

Naturopathica: This Chelsea spa takes a holistic approach to skin care, based on the belief that good skin is a result of what you put on your face and in your body. The full-service spa, which uses its own line of natural products, features six treatment rooms, a juice bar and a zen sensory and meditation lounge where you can reboot after treatment. Naturopathica offers clarifying and rebalancing facials along with microdermabrasion and brightening treatments — but the holistic facial is the signature experience here. Clients who come in for this treatment meet with an aesthetician to determine their skin personality type (stress, reactive, adaptive or mature), which informs the type of facial they receive. The package includes a seven-day follow-up concentrate to help prolong the effects of the facial, a guide to skin care, diet tips and herbal remedies that target your skin’s particular needs. Additionally, the Marmara Park Avenue’s wellness centre uses Naturopathica products for its luxurious facial treatments.

The Peninsula Spa at the Peninsula New York: This opulent spa includes access to a glass-enclosed pool, a fitness center and a sun terrace that overlooks Fifth Avenue. The menu has a mix of French and Asian skin care and body treatments, including the Vedic Aromatherapy Full Body and Facial Marma massage, which aims to rid the body of toxins via a scrub, therapeutic oils, and a massage and facial. For those who have problems sleeping, the exclusive “Sleep Ceremony” service aims to alleviate disruptive sleep patterns with a relaxing full-body treatment that includes meditation and massages.

Julien Farel Restore Salon & Spa at the Loews Regency New York: The Julien Farel Spa at the Loews Regency New York features private massage and facial rooms, plus a post-treatment relaxation lounge with complementary drinks. The Five Pillar massage treats guests inside and out with not only massage but also aromatherapy to relax the mind. Another trademark treatment, designed by podiatrist Suzanne Levine, works on reviving tired feet with a massage, mask and exfoliation. The spa also offers blowouts, manicures and pedicures thus ensuring that every customer leaves looking their best from head to toe.

Spa at Mandarin Oriental, New York: Treatments here centre on Eastern rituals with everything from a Thai yoga massage to treatments inspired by ancient Ayurvedic medicine. Prior to any treatment, guests are invited to visit the Mandarin’s soaking tubs, jacuzzi and steam rooms as well as its Oriental Tea Lounge. The spa’s customised “Time Rituals,” which last two to three hours, usually include an exfoliation followed by a full body massage. Those who book a VIP suite receive a bento box with the spa’s services.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oasis-of-calm-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/oasis-of-calm.html
166,14-3-20,Politically illiterate by choice: Rahman,"The Oscar-winning composer chooses to channelise his energy in making music, stories and art that can bring about a positive change in youngsters

Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman feels although the world is going through a socio-political turmoil, and every second person is expressing political opinion in an aggressive manner, he chooses to channelise his energy in making music, stories and art that can bring about a positive change in the mind of the youngsters.

The Indian music maestro is all set to take a new step in creativity. He makes his debut as scriptwriter and film producer with the upcoming musical film, 99 Songs.

“I am politically illiterate by choice, because I rather invest my energy to create what I am creating. One of the reasons why I am making films, music and training kids in music is to offer them a space that they can explore away from politics, violence and all things that are negative. I see how everyone is getting into some political opinion and it is a grey area. It is complicated and probably I won’t be able to articulate my thoughts as correctly as I can do it through music. For me, serving humanity through art — that heals people, that is spiritual — is more important when there is too much aggression out there,” said Rahman.

His daughter Khatija was brutally trolled a while back by the Swedish-Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen on social media, for wearing the burqa, but Khatija’s graceful and befitting answer to the author received huge applauds by netizens.

Rahman’s 99 Songs is directed by Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy and the film features Ehan Bhat, Edilsy Vargas, Lisa Ray, Manisha Koirala, Ranjit Barot and Rahul Ram.

What prompted him to take up the challenge of filmmaking? The ‘Mozart of Madras’ replied: “Not taking up challenges and feeling complacent due to success is boring! I mean, none of us are immortal. We all are going to die, but before death happens let us give new ideas a try. My drive is to explore human possibilities. Criticism is okay with me, so many challenges are thrown at us by life. It is worth taking up the challenges!”

The songs of his film were released in Mumbai. Rahman has created the album with Dolby Atmos. Emphasising on the collaboration, Rahman said: “When you hear music, good sound technology offers you an experience that is worth cherishing. We get to experience Dolby Atmos in cinema theatres. They are now collaborating with streaming platforms where you listen to music on the phone and still get the same sound quality, without those speakers.”

He added: “When you listen to a song on your phone, you hear a compressed file that tampers the sound, and the nuances are missed. When a 200MB file is made into a 1. 5 MB file, usually you do not get the same quality. But now that is possible courtesy the new sound technology of Dolby Atmos. I am looking forward to it,” he explained.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/politically-illiterate-by-choice--rahman-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/politically-illiterate-by-choice--rahman.html
167,14-3-20,A 360º experience,"The liberal laws on sex and drugs influence the heady atmosphere in Amsterdam. But the city has a lot more to offer on culture, art and cheese, says Karishma Kripalani

Are you serious, we are going to Amsterdam?” I was excited as my husband booked the flight tickets. This place had been on my list since forever. But I had waited for so long to ensure that I went there with the right company.

And there was a reason. As I walked through Dam Square, all I could smell was marijuana and cannabis in the air. The square is the main centre of the city, like those piazzas which are walking streets in any European city. The speciality here is popular cafes selling all the illegal stuff which is legal here. A person can smoke pot and even in the stores you will find lollipops, cookies, brownies, chocolates, teas, candles, energy drinks and a lot more laced with it. Every alternate stop is a shop or cafe to smoke up and get spaced out.

In the evening, we walked through the red light area, De Wallen, where sex workers had positioned themselves in glass windows and called out to tourists, for a sneak peek. In all the lanes there must be over hundreds of them. And extending the contours of sexuality where heterogeneous coupling is not the only normal, there were some lesbians as well. What a great city. I absolutely adored the liberty.

There was even an entire museum dedicated to it which made my heart melt and made me very emotional. The Red Light Secrets was once upon a time an actual brothel. It was in this place that a very famous sex worker Annie was murdered and till today her death is a mystery. There is a memorial to all like her who have worked here and gone to heaven. A line that took my respect for the profession, two notches higher was, “I am not a Prostitute, I am a Sex Therapist.” The peep sex show is great entertainment for all couples.

But that is not all that one can experience in the city. The next day promised to be spirited, practically, with a visit to the Heineken Experience. It is definitely considered one of the top beers in the world and Amsterdam is home to it. The museum offers a varied experience. While it contains all sorts of exhibits and history of the family, a visitor can even personalise one’s own bottle or get a three dimensional experience of how one feels inside the bubbles of a beer bottle. But those who love their beer need not be disappointed as it all culminated with some delicious tasting session.

Amongst my favourite things-to-do here was the Heineken beer pouring competition, where one needs to pour the drink into a glass in the correct manner, so that there is just the right amount of drink in proportion to the correct level of froth. After downing all these beers, I was slightly light-headed and I thought a bite would help. I had some poffertjes, the Dutch mini pancakes, a speciality dessert here. These fluffy bites just melt in the mouth. I personally feel they get even more tastier with Nutella and strawberries.

Amsterdam is the real city of canals, since there are over a hundred of them. What better way to soak in the city than by sitting in a boat, sipping some champagne and experiencing the local life and colourful narrow houses of Amsterdam through the waters? In most of the city, houses are very narrow as people are taxed on the basis of the width of the house and so you will see long houses which are very narrow. A bit of disproportion.

Another unique feature in the city is bicycles. The parking lots outside the canals are filled with them. The stands always make for a lovely picture, to post on social media. In a city with so many canals and narrow roads, most places become inaccessible by car. The ratio of car to bicycles is, for every one car owned there are four bicycles.

I’m sure most of you would have seen the “Iamstsrdam” sign. It’s quite famous. In fact, it is the first of place signs. Every other place has taken inspiration from it and has only recently started their local versions. But trust me, it’s much easier to find the sign on the web rather than when you are in the city. The city officials move the sign overnight. I actually experienced this. One day, I saw the sign across the river, while we were at Amsterdam Central, in an area called Noord. The next day, when we actually reached that place, the sign was missing. It was almost like a real treasure hunt to find it. Apparently the previous day, there was such a huge crowd which wanted to take pictures that it caused chaos. Overnight the city officials changed the location. Many locals too didn’t know where it was. We pretty much walked three km to find our treasure. Luckily because of the change, as there were lesser crowds, we were able to get some great pictures.

It was only when I visited the city that I realised how the Dutch have some amazing artists who have created some breathtaking pieces of work. The Rijks Museum is comparable to the Louvre. Actually, I would say, better. Besides the beautiful paintings, some of them very vibrant, my favourite sections were the libraries of books, tile art in blue and white and the dollhouse section. Even the dollhouses of the Dutch royalty bore the imprint of their grandeur. They are quite comparable to life-size houses.

Another museum, which cannot be missed, is Van Gogh. There is limited entry and thus needs to be booked about a week in advance over the web or depending on length of stay, at the tourist offices. The way the museum is made, I actually felt the artist come alive. His paintings are so real that I felt he’s right in front of me. The most touching part of the museum is the life of Theo and Vincent as well as the role of Johanna Gazina (Theo’s wife) who showcased her brother-in-law’s work to the outside world.

It’s only because of her that we all know of the genius artist.

However, I missed an important museum, that of Anne Frank House. Being a very old structure, and something that’s very difficult to maintain, only 1,000 people are allowed in a day, and tickets for this open online three months in advance which get sold out within 10-15 days of their opening.

No visit to Amsterdam is complete without visiting the Dutch countryside. I’m sure, most of us, including myself, have seen the very unique European windmill. To see these, drive about 45 miles to the village of Zaanse. I loved dancing in the wind and posing around these beautiful structures.

I am sure if any of your friends have visited Amsterdam, you would have seen a magnet, or a wall hanging of those wooden shoes. These are clogs, that are worn by the inhabitants of the Market Village even today. Due to technological advancements, crafting them has become easy. These make for the best souvenirs to take back in the form of a magnet or a hanging.

Holland and cheese are synonymous. Visit a factory in Voladem and try out over 50 flavours of this dairy product. I brought back home basil pesto and truffle. The best part is that way the cheese is packaged, until it is opened, it will stay fine at room temperature. So it makes sense to travel with it. The whole countryside, can be completed in a day. It is recommended to do this as a group tour.

Despite knowing what to expect, the city was out to surprise me. And that is what any traveller looks forward to.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-360---experience-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-360---experience.html
168,14-3-20,"Eats, shoots and leaves","While exploring the hacks of Arunachali cuisine, chef Sanjay discovers that it doesn’t use any spices for enhancing taste but rather lets natural ingredients lend flavours to the dish. By Chahak Mittal

The spread on offer is special on several counts. Not even a single dish is cooked in oil. Most of them are steamed. The ingredients, like turmeric and bamboo shoot, are organic and freshly sourced from Arunachal Pradesh. The chefs have used leaves like banana and poto (a native leaf), which is good for controlling blood pressure. While most of the dishes in the buffet are non-vegetarian, there is a special section dedicated to the vegetarians.

Executive chef Sanjay’s Arunachali cuisine festival at Hotel Ashoka lays out a meal for the city’s food connoisseurs from the north-eastern state. For somebody, who specialises in Awadhi at The Oudh, it was an experience preparing the spread. He says, “Initially, we were a bit hesitant because Arunachali cuisine was absolutely new. We didn’t know what it would taste like. But once we started the process, we learnt some new recipes and its nuskhas (tricks). We realised that it’s a very healthy cuisine. No oil, steamed dishes and organic ingredients from the state set it apart as do the native leaves, which are quite rich in iron.”

Chef Sanjay points out that understanding the nuances of this cuisine surprisingly turned out to be easy for him. “That happened only when I actually started cooking the dishes. The transition was smooth. I realised that in Arunachali food, there’s a special emphasis on bringing out the flavours of the ingredients. Extra spices are not added for flavour,” he says and explains further with an example. “If you are preparing bamboo shoot, the speciality of that dish would be that its original flavour will be kept intact. No masala would be added to it to impart a spicy taste. If we are using an Arunachali leaf, no other ingredient is used to dominate the original essence of the dish,” he adds.

There are several dishes in the buffet which are prepared using bamboo shoot since it has a delicate flavour and is a chief component of the food in the state. Chef Sanjay enjoyed cooking Khawlam, which is a dish of steamed rice in fresh green bamboo, the most. The dish, he tells us, is prepared by the Khamti tribals using a long hollowed out bamboo stick which is stuffed with plain rice. The stick is then heated on coal fire, and the natural flavour of bamboo seeps into the rice. The chef says he would even like to call it his signature dish now since he has learnt it so well. The only variation being that he would stuff “chicken” instead of rice now, “especially keeping North Indians in mind,” he says and laughs.

Talking about other commonly-used ingredients in the state, he explains, “Nobody uses spices in Arunachal Pradesh. There, they only use ginger, a lot of garlic and chilli to enhance taste. We must understand that there is not much variety in the local produce. In the same way, we have also prepared the Aating, which is local rice wrapped and steamed in wild leaves. Banana leaves can be used in their place. Even here, no spices are mixed in rice as the dish gets permeated with the natural flavour from the leaf.”

North Indian cuisine is known for its tadkas and a number of spices it uses. Did chef Sanjay, being a north Indian, bring any variation in the dishes to help people in the city relate with the cuisine better? He says, “Here, most of the people like it spicy and tangy. A number of flavours like ginger, garlic, clove, cardamom and various kinds of chilli and pepper can be found here. However, Arunachal has nothing of this sort. They might use cardamom leaves to wrap the chicken and meat. They only use the Bhut jolokia chilli, which is the hottest in the world. We have tried to include it in the menu to suit the palate of North Indians while staying true to the flavours of Arunachal.”

Puta, a famous dish in Monpa (an ethnic group in Arunachal) cuisine is made of buckwheat noodles with fermented soya beans and chillies. “It is a meal in itself,” chef says and adds that he has prepared it using the Bhut jolokia.

One is naturally curious if such food festivals have enabled chefs and patrons explore newer cuisines? He feels that it’s actually the other way round. “People have started travelling more, which, in turn, has opened them to the idea of trying out more cuisines and becoming more experimental in their tastes. And people’s extensive travels are the reasons that such food festivals gain so much attention. There are a lot of new cuisines coming in and, with them, equal footfalls too. People really like South Korean and Japanese food now while earlier, nobody knew wasabi and kimchi. I had literally thrown up when I ate sushi for the first time. But now, I have developed a taste for it. Similarly, foodies have started experimenting with bamboo shoot in food which is almost identical to Japanese wasabi due its pungent smell,” he says.

169,14-3-20,Potpourri of ideas,"Cultural impresario Shobha Deepak Singh says that the charm of classical music is still intact as it helps understand the important elements of culture, heritage, history and the emotions of a country. By Team Viva

What is new in the 73rd edition of Shriram Shankarlal Music Festival?

Through it is one of the oldest festivals, we aim to make a mark in the arena of performing arts and nurture the basic ideology of binding rich Indian traditions with the current generation. It brings forth Indian classical music in the most unique way carrying with it the essence of a nation as culturally rich as ours.

We don’t have a particular theme. Everyone is free to sing and play what they want to. We just have some new artists who will perform for the first time. Of the established artistes, eminent sarod player Ustad Amjad Ali Khan will also perform after a long gap. There’s dhrupad by Prashant and Nishant Mallick, vocals by Manjiri Asanare Kelkar, Ulhas Kashalkar and Bhuvanesh Komkali, sitar by Niladri Kumar, santoor by Rahul Sharma and many more.

Is there a specific criterion to choose the artistes?

We have a community that works all round the year and keeps selecting and discarding artistes. One month prior to the festival, we observe the pattern of the artistes who have performed consistently over the years, have a fine pitch and connect well with the audience. Over the last two decades, I have witnessed that the final list is much appreciated. Even this year, there has been a positive response from places such as Kolkata, Pune and Mumbai.

Do you think the charm of traditional music is still intact?

Yes, of course. Its charm is still intact as it helps to understand the elements of culture, heritage, history and the emotions of a country. The changes over time reflect in “traditional music” too through a different kind of rhythm or a musical instrument.

How has the festival evolved over the years?

Having had this festival for 73 consecutive years, where every well-known name has performed, it’s an achievement in itself. And that too, without any sponsors. It began in 1947 and since then it has evolved in many ways. Earlier, there were only instrumentalists, now we have vocalists too. Even the participation of good artistes has increased over time. We have seen the best musicians performing here, who have kept alive the interest in classical music. While celebrating renowned names, it serves as a platform for new artistes to showcase their talent. It gets bigger and better with every year.

Do you think it is important to try something new to keep the audience hooked?

We don’t want to step out of our traditional mythology and dance forms because that’s our forte. I recently saw the dance performance of a classical Bharatnatyam dancer. She attempted to do something new and it failed terribly. So I don’t want to try something new but prefer a contemporary touch to old classics.

We have reinvented mythology in a contemporary way several times. Our presentation changes keeping in mind the present scenario and times. For instance, three-four years ago, we gave a new twist to Sita’s ‘Agnipariksha’ in our Ramleela, which people had not seen before. Sita was portrayed as an independent entity who has a say like any other woman today.

I don’t look at mythology as something which is 200 years old and you can’t agree with it anymore. I try to add my personal understanding to it in a way that it is relatable to the current generation.

173,14-3-20,"lt; no change in prices; govt to get Rs 39,000 cr","The government on Saturday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre each to garner about Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue as it repeated its 2014-15 act of not passing on gains arising from slump in international oil prices.

Retail prices of petrol and diesel will not be impacted by the tax changes as state-owned oil firms adjusted them against the recent fall in oil prices and the likely trend in the near future, industry officials said.

According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre in case of petrol and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel.

Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.

Officials said the increase in excise duty will result in annual increase of government revenues by about Rs 39,000 crore. The gains during the remaining three weeks of the current fiscal would be less than Rs 2,000 crore.

Petrol and diesel prices, which are changed on a daily basis, were cut by 13 paise and 16 paise respectively as oil companies adjusted the excise duty hike against the drop in prices that warrants from international rates slumping the most since the Gulf war.

Petrol now cost Rs 69.87 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 62.58.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.

It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.

Government sources said that while the benefit of reduction of crude prices in the first quarter of this year has significantly gone to the consumer, the Centre has taken this step of increasing duty to raise some revenue in view of a tight fiscal situation. This would help in generating the resources for development of infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, they said.

Benchmark crude oil prices have halved since January to USD 32 per barrel. In sync with this, the prices of petrol and diesel have also come down by more than Rs 6 per litre (from Rs 76.01 a litre on January 11, 2020 to Rs 69.87 a litre on March 14 for petrol, and from Rs 69.17 to Rs 62.58 for diesel during the same period in Delhi).",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/excise-duty-on-petrol--diesel-hiked-by-rs-3-lt--no-change-in-prices--govt-to-get-rs-39-000-cr-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/excise-duty-on-petrol--diesel-hiked-by-rs-3-lt--no-change-in-prices--govt-to-get-rs-39-000-cr.html

175,14-3-20,How to clean bundle of germs that is your phone,"You’re washing your hands countless times a day to try to ward off the coronavirus.

You should also wash that extension of your hand and breeding ground for germs — your phone. Tests done by scientists show that the virus can live for two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cleaning all “high-touch” surfaces daily, including phones, keyboards and tablet computers.

But cleaning your phone improperly can damage it. You want to avoid getting moisture inside it or scratching the surface. Don’t spray cleaners directly on it, don’t dunk the phone in cleaning solutions, don’t spray it with compressed-air devices used to clean keyboards and avoid rubbing it with abrasive materials.

Instead, start by turning off the phone and unplugging all cables. Your phone shouldn’t be charging as you clean.

You can use Clorox wipes or wipes with 70% alcohol, which you can get at the drugstore, to wipe down your phone. Apple, which has cautioned against using household cleaners on its phones, says to do that “gently.” AT&T has further recommended wringing out disinfectant wipes before using them on a phone.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/how-to-clean-bundle-of-germs-that-is-your-phone.html
176,14-3-20,Iran imposes lockdown,"Iran said on Friday the security forces will clear the streets nationwide within 24 hours so all citizens can be checked for coronavirus — its toughest measure yet to combat the outbreak.

The COVID-19 epidemic in Iran — a nation of more than 80 million people — has now claimed over 500 lives and infected more than 11,000.

Since it announced the first deaths last month, Iran has shut schools, postponed events and discouraged travel ahead of Nowrouz, the country’s New Year holidays.

But despite those and other measures including the cancellation of the main weekly Friday prayers, the official number of deaths and infections has continued to grow exponentially. Iran’s supreme leader on Thursday ordered the armed forces to lead the battle against the outbreak.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei instructed the security forces to bring their services together and expand efforts to combat the virus. Acting on those orders, armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri chaired a meeting on Friday that included Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami and police chief Hossein Ashtari.

Among other top brass at the gathering was Gholamreza Soleimani, who heads the Basij, a volunteer militia loyal to the establishment, as was Defence Minister Amir Hatami. Bagheri appeared in front of the cameras later to say a newly formed commission had been charged with overseeing the “emptying of shops, streets and roads” within the next 24 hours.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/iran-imposes-lockdown.html
177,14-3-20,First Ranji title for Saurashtra,"Skipper Jaydev Unadkat on Friday produced a lion-hearted spell when it mattered the most against Bengal, leading Saurashtra to their maiden Ranji Trophy triumph a year after stumbling at the last hurdle.

The win was achieved on the basis of the first-innings lead here.

Bengal had the upper hand going into day five after Anustup Majumdar (63) and Arnab Nandi (40 not out) shared an unbeaten 91-run stand in the final session on Thursday.

But Unadkat, who had single-handily taken Saurashtra into the final with a seven-wicket haul against Gujarat on the final day of their semifinal, rose to the occasion yet again to script a historic victory.

The left-arm pacer had the in-form Majumdar LBW and Akash Deep run out in a space of three balls to turn the game on its head. Unadkat ended as the season’s leading wicket-taker with 67 scalps at a staggering average of 13.23, one short of an all-time record.

One hour and 10 minutes of play in the decisive morning session yielded 27 runs and four wickets with Bengal all out for 381, giving Saurashtra a 44-run first innings lead. At the start of the day, Bengal needed 72 runs for the first-innings lead with four wickets in hands.

In the second innings, all Saurashtra had to do was to bat time before both captains decided to call off the game and shake hands. They eventually did that at tea time after Saurashtra sauntered 105 for four in 34 overs.

With the win, Saurashtra ended their Ranji Trophy title drought while a fighting Bengal will have to wait longer for their first crown since the 1989-90 season.

“It’s a great feeling, different world altogether. Last season we were very close to winning the title but we couldn’t. It’s a great, great feeling. The best things about this team is that all the players have played together for a very long time,” said Saurashtra stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara.

Despite the loss, it was a memorable season for Bengal, who reached the title clash after 13 years at the back of stellar performances from the pace trio of Akash Deep, Mukesh Kumar, Ishan Porel and veteran batsman Manoj Tiwary and Majumdar.

The decision was taken after the AIFF and I-League officials had a Skype meeting with club representatives.

“Adhering to the advisories issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, AIFF has decided to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 edition of the Hero I-League behind closed doors,” the AIFF said in a statement.

“Besides team officials and players; match officials (referees), medical staff, TV Crew, accredited media, and required security staff — none would be allowed to be in the premises of the stadium on match day, and during official practice the preceding day,” it said.

This will be the first time in the country that so many competitive football matches under the aegis of the AIFF will be played closed doors.

The first match to be played behind closed doors will be the one between Real Kashmir FC and TRAU FC at TRC ground in Srinagar today. The enthusiastic Real Kashmir supporters who have been turning out to pack the venue most of the time will be robbed of the opportunity to cheer their team.

But the match which will be hit the most as far as football-mad spectators are concerned is Sunday’s Kolkata derby between champions Mohun Bagan and East Bengal at the Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata.

After New Zealand earlier kept the home side to 258 for seven, the Australian bowling attack dominated the Kiwi batsmen to dismiss the visitors for 187 in the 41st over.

Australian skipper Aaron Finch won the toss and chose to bat, with the home side at one stage looking at a score in excess of 300 following a superb opening partnership from Finch and David Warner.

But once Warner (67) and Finch (60) were dismissed, the Australian innings lost momentum and New Zealand clawed their way back into the game, despite a late flourish from Marnus Labuschagne, who made 56 from just 52 deliveries.

New Zealand must have given themselves a good chance of taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, but some superb Australian bowling in the first 10 overs meant the visitors were always behind in the run chase.

None of the New Zealand batsmen was able to dominate — Martin Guptill top scored with 40 — and wickets fell at regular intervals as Australia took control.

180,14-3-20,"ATK, Chennaiyin to vie for hat-trick","ATK and Chennaiyin FC will seek a hat-trick of ISL titles here today when they meet in the 6th edition’s final, which will be played without spectators owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Though for a different reason, this is the second time that an ISL match will be played in an empty stadium after the league stage game between NorthEast United FC and Bengaluru FC was held behind closed doors in Guwahati in the wake of the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Assam.

The season has been a landmark one in many ways. While it has produced high quality football, the sport’s governing body AIFF has granted ISL the top-tier domestic competition status.

The league phase winners of the ISL, FC Goa will become the first Indian side to directly play in the group stage of the AFC Champions League, the top club league of Asia.

ATK (2014 and 2016) and Chennaiyin (2015 and 2017-18) have both won the ISL twice already and are looking to become the first side to win it three times.

But, in an anti-climax of sort, there will be no spectators to witness the historic moment as the final will be played in front of an empty stadium.

The two teams were brilliant in the play-offs with Chennaiyin getting the better of FC Goa in a thrilling two-legged tie that finished 6-5 on aggregates, while ATK produced a second leg turnaround to send defending champions Bengaluru FC packing with a 3-2 win on aggregate.

This is the first time that these two clubs are meeting each other in the final. Interestingly, neither club has lost an ISL final — a run that will end for one of them today.

The two sides are also on equal footing this season. In the league stages, ATK defeated Chennaiyin in Chennai before the team from the south returned the favour in Kolkata.

While ATK have been one of the most consistent sides this season, Chennaiyin were left to produce a miracle to reach this stage after Owen Coyle took charge of them at the start of last December.

In the six matches before his arrival, Chennaiyin had won only once and scored just four goals. Since he took charge, Chennaiyin went on to win eight matches, a tally bettered only by FC Goa. Now Coyle is a win away from completing a miracle.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/atk--chennaiyin-to-vie-for-hat-trick.html

182,14-3-20,Man Utd thrash LASK,"Manchester United put one foot in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday with a 5-0 win at LASK Linz in one of four last 16 first leg matches played behind closed doors.

Odion Ighalo slammed home the opener via the underside of the bar from 20 yards just before the half-hour, and Daniel James added a second with a sharp run and finish just before the hour mark.

Juan Mata bagged a third eight minutes from the end and Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira struck in injury time, as United extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches, with nine clean sheets in that time.

“I think the quality in our play was good. We were well prepared for them and they did fantastic,” United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport.

“There was some high-class finishing in the goals ... It should have been more goals before half-time, but we got the goals we needed.”

Ibrox was one of the two grounds where fans were allowed to attend, but the presence of Rangers’ home support couldn’t stop them losing 3-1 to Bayer Leverkusen.

Bundesliga outfit Bayer are now favourites to progress should the second leg matches take place thanks to Kai Havertz’s penalty eight minutes before the break and two lovely second half strikes from Charles Aranguiz and Leon Bailey.

George Edmundson had briefly given Rangers hope in the 75th minute when he pulled the scores back to 2-1 with a well-placed header, but Steven Gerrard’s side could not capitalise.

Istanbul Basaksehir won 1-0 at home to FC Copenhagen in Turkey courtesy of a late Edin Visca penalty, in the other game allowed to take place before a crowd.

“Let’s stick to the postponement (at the moment). First priority is safety, so we postponed the games,” Ganguly said in his first reaction.

“We will see what happens. It is too early to answer,” said Ganguly when asked if there will be more double headers if they are able to host it from April 15.

184,14-3-20,F1 season in turmoil,"Formula One’s season was thrown into turmoil Friday with the Australian Grand Prix cancelled just hours before cars were due to hit the track, and races in Vietnam and Bahrain subsequently called off as well as the coronavirus takes its toll.

The decisions follow the postponement last month of April’s Chinese Grand Prix, leaving motorsport chiefs scrambling to revise the calendar and proposing the end of May as a potential start date for the season.

“The global situation regarding COVID-19 is fluid and very difficult to predict and it’s right we take time to assess the situation and make the right decisions,” F1 chief Chase Carey said in a statement.

“We are taking this decision with the FIA and our promoters to ensure the safety of everyone involved in Formula 1 and our fans”

Formula One and the FIA, world motorsport’s governing body, said they “expect to begin the Championship in Europe at the end of May but given the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Europe in recent days, this will be regularly reviewed.”

The Dutch Grand Prix is the next race on calendar, although its scheduled May 3 date will be pushed back. The Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona was planned for the following week.

The future of the Australian race, the first of the season, was in doubt on Thursday when McLaren pulled out after one of its team members tested positive for the virus.

McLaren revealed on Friday that 14 other staff were now in a mandatory two-week quarantine after being in close contact with the man.

The McLaren employee was among eight Formula One personnel who went into isolation after showing flu-like symptoms typical of the disease this week.

The other seven — including four from the Haas team — all returned negative results.

The fast-moving developments sparked a crisis meeting between the race organisers, the FIA, teams and Formula One promoters late Thursday to discuss whether Sunday’s race should go ahead.

“Those discussions concluded with a majority view of the teams that the race should not go ahead,” they said in a joint statement just hours before the first official practice session and with fans queueing to get in.

Teams quickly began packing up to leave the circuit as some fans, many travelling from overseas, fumed at the way they were treated.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/f1-season-in-turmoil.html
185,14-3-20,Oly torch relay scrap because of crowds,"Greece’s Olympic Committee on Friday said it was cancelling the rest of the torch relay for the Tokyo 2020 Games on Greek soil as large crowds had turned out despite coronavirus warnings.

“The rest of the torch relay on Greek soil has been cancelled,” the committee said, adding that the Olympic flame would be handed over to Tokyo organisers on March 19 as scheduled, but without spectators.

It noted that crowds had ignored “repeated warnings” not to gather in force at stopovers in the torch relay.

Greece has so far declared 117 cases of the coronavirus, one of whom died on Thursday after 10 days in hospital.

The move was announced after a large crowd mobbed Hollywood actor Gerard Butler as he lit a cauldron in the city of Sparta.

Butler had starred as the ancient Spartan King Leonidas in the 2007 epic 300, and repeated his famous line from the movie — This is Sparta — for gathered media.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/oly-torch-relay-scrap-because-of-crowds.html
186,14-3-20,Players want full DRS for next season,"The introduction of the limited DRS courted controversy this Ranji season and players, including Jaydev Unadkat and Cheteshwar Pujara, would like to see full use of the technology from next season.

The DRS became a talking point ever since it was introduced in the semi-finals with an aim to reduce howlers.

“It is important to have it. Sometimes umpires can make an error as they are human beings and it is part of the game. BCCI using DRS in knockout games is a good step but I still feel there is scope for improvement,” said Pujara.

“There is no ball tracking and snickometer at the moment. So, I would like to see that in the big games going forward, especially the semi-finals and finals,” the India player added.

Unadkat concurred with his friend and teammate. “I agree with him. But it is partial DRS with partial errors so if they can make it full nothing like that. Like you saw yesterday there were a couple of decisions which were not quite convincing to be honest, but at the same time, there were instances when both teams benefitted from it.

“So not at all against DRS but full DRS is something we would like to see especially in knocksouts,” said the left-arm pacer.

Saba Karim, BCCI’s General Manager of Cricket Operations later said that the board is open to the idea of a full DRS.

“The season has just ended. We will take a call in due time. We will discuss it at the annual captains and conclave and then take a call,” said Karim.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/players-want-full-drs-for-next-season.html

Saurashtra skipper and lead pacer Unadkat picked up 67 wickets this season at 13.23, but more importantly, bowled match-winning spells in both the semi-final and final.

“I still have that hunger to make a comeback. The hunger has never been stronger than this and that actually kept me going throughout the season,” said Unadkat after captaining Saurashtra to their maiden trophy.

“To be honest, it was challenging physically surviving the season. Bowling those long spells as a fast bowler in almost every game.

“I just want to keep this phase going. I don’t want to end it here. Yes, we have won the trophy and I am the happiest captain in the world right now If I can say that.”

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said that the national capital will not have any sporting events for a month to contain the spread of the deadly infection.

“All sports gatherings will be banned, including the IPL, in wake of the coronavirus threat,” Sisodia said.

The BCCI responded by listing the alternate venues that could play host. Delhi is home to the Delhi Capital IPL franchise.

“Lucknow has been wanting to host IPL matches for a while now. If it’s a closed door tournament, it really doesn’t matter where it is played,” a BCCI source said.

190,14-3-20,No plan for Olympics without spectators: Japan,"Japanese government officials insisted on Friday they have no plans to alter the Olympics, including holding it without spectators, after US President Donald Trump proposed a delay over the coronavirus.

The fate of the 2020 Games, scheduled to open in Tokyo on July 24, has been thrown into doubt by the outbreak of the virus, now dubbed a pandemic.

But organisers, Japanese government officials and the International Olympic Committee have insisted preparation for the Games is on track, with no expectations of a postponement or cancellation.

“There is no change in the government policy in that we closely cooperate with the IOC, the organising committee, and the Tokyo metropolitan government to steadily prepare for holding the Games as scheduled,” government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters.

He said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump had held a phone call to discuss the outbreak as well as the Olympics. “In the telephone talks with President Trump, the prime minister mentioned our efforts toward holding the Games, and the president said he highly values Japan’s efforts on transparency,” Suga said.

Asked about the possibility of scaling back the number of spectators, Hashimoto said: “We are not thinking about that at all.”

Suga also said the government “doesn’t envisage” either a Games without spectators or the prospect of athletes withdrawing from the event.

IOC chief Thomas Bach told German television ARD on Thursday that the body would follow recommendations by the World Health Organization, but for now continues to work for a “successful” Games.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-plan-for-olympics-without-spectators--japan.html

194,14-3-20,Manjrekar's axe from BCCI commentary panel for SA series raise eyebrows,"Former Test batsman and noted commentator Sanjay Manjrekar's absence from the BCCI's world feed commentary panel for the recent ODI series against South Africa has raised quite a few eyebrows.

Manjrekar, one of the most accomplished voices among Indian experts got embroiled in controversies in recent years for some of his views on air, but not having him in the world feed team has surprised many.

""Yes, he wasn't a part of the panel for this series but it doesn't mean that during the next series, he won't be there. I don't know what exactly was the trigger,"" a senior BCCI official, in the know of things, told PTI.

Normally there are two sets of commentators -- one employed by the BCCI and known as the 'World feed' team while the other is the team comprising hosts broadcaster (in this case Star).

The 54-year-old Manjrekar, who played 37 Tests and 74 ODIs for India, had courted controversy during last year's World Cup when he termed Ravindra Jadeja a ""bits and pieces cricketer"", something that didn't go well with the Saurashtra all-rounder, who questioned the Mumbaikar's cricketing credentials.

Manjrekar later admitted that he was off the mark with his unsavoury analysis of Jadeja's cricketing prowess.

He was also panned on social media for his on-air comment about fellow commentator Harsha Bhogle during the 'Pink Test' when he questioned the latter's credibility since he hasn't played at the highest level.

195,14-3-20,"If IPL-13 happens, it will be a truncated one: BCCI president Ganguly","Suspended till April 15 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 13th edition of IPL can only be a truncated one provided the situation improves, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said on Saturday.

The Indian Cricket Board on Friday postponed the start of this year's IPL from March 29 to April 15 in wake of the pandemic, which has caused massive upheaval across the globe.

Asked if the cash-rich event could be a curtailed one, Ganguly said, ""It will happen, because if it is April 15, then, in any case 15 days are gone, it has to be truncated. How truncated, how many games, I can't say at the moment.""

Ganguly, a decorated former India captain, was speaking to reporters after the end of the IPL Governing Council meeting here.

The Board's top boss reiterated that safety is their top priority, a day after the IPL was postponed and the three-match ODI series between India and South Africa called off.

""We will monitor further. Safety is most important and with the current situation with what is going around the world and in India, with government directives, we have even postponed the remaining domestic matches.""

The decisions to postpone the cash-rich league and the ODI rubber were taken hours after the Delhi government suspended all sporting activity in the national capital due to the ever-growing health crisis.

Delhi is home to the Delhi Capitals IPL franchise.

In the meeting between the franchise owners and the BCCI brass, six to seven options were discussed, including a curtailed IPL.

""We met with the owners, to tell them how it can happen and where do we stand at the moment. At the moment, it is just postponed. We will assess the situation,"" Ganguly said.

""It will be reassessed every week. I can't say at the moment (about any deadline). I has to be worked around. As much as we want to host the IPL, we also need to be careful about the security.""

So far, India has recorded more than 80 positive cases and two deaths due to the pandemic which has claimed more than 5,000 lives globally while infecting close to 1,50,000.

The COVID-19 has led to either cancellation or postponement of top sports events across the world, and the IPL was no different.

Asked if there is any backup plans, Ganguly said, ""I can't say anything at the moment, allow us a week, let's see how it goes around the world.""

There is a possibility that the tournament could feature more double-headers than previously planned and at least five optional venues are being kept ready after state governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi refused permission for the games.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/if-ipl-13-happens--it-will-be-a-truncated-one--bcci-president-ganguly-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/if-ipl-13-happens--it-will-be-a-truncated-one--bcci-president-ganguly.html

“... Or giving up on tournaments, that others choose to play, risking to lose out on not only the Olympics, but also ranking spots that gives access to all the other big events. We should not be put in this position.”

Vittinghus’ post was retweeted by the likes of Saina, Srikanth, former top 10 players Parupalli Kashyap and H S Prannoy and Spanish national coach Fernando Rivas on their respective timelines.

“I dont get it too @bwf media #Coronavirus Pandemic,” tweeted Saina, a former World No 1, who is currently in Birmingham.

Srikanth, too, echoed similar voices.

“I agree with you (Vittinghus) and @bwfmedia should think about players safety,” he wrote. Kashyap tweeted: “Please Wake Up! @bwfmedia.”

“Things to be done by @bwfmedia. 1)Suspend all tournaments immediately 2)Freeze the current ranking and decide on qualification on a later date,” he wrote.

The world body has so far maintained that it has no plans to make any adjustments to the regulations related to the Tokyo Games qualification period and that other events will go as per schedule.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/top-shuttlers-say-bwf-putting-players-at-risk.html

204,14-3-20,English Football Shut Down,"The English Premier League suspended all fixtures until April 4 on Friday after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus.

Matches in the English Football League, Women’s Super League, all football in Scotland and international friendlies for England and Wales have also been suspended.

“Following a meeting of shareholders today (on Friday), it was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on 4 April, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time,” the Premier League said in a statement.

Everton also announced a player is in self-isolation for seven days after reporting a high temperature.

The rest of their first-team squad and coaching staff have been told to stay away from all of the Merseyside club’s sites.

Leicester City had three players go into self-isolation on Thursday and Bournemouth said goalkeeper Artur Boruc and four staff members were taking the same precaution.

West Ham staff are also self-isolating as they faced Arteta’s Arsenal six days ago at the Emirates.

“Well done PL (Premier League) for making the right decisions,” Arteta tweeted.

“Feeling better already. We’re all facing a huge & unprecedented challenge. Everyone’s health is all that matters right now.”

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp commended the decision despite it halting his side’s cruise towards a first league title in 30 years.

“We don’t want to play in front of an empty stadium and we don’t want games or competitions suspended, but if doing so helps one individual stay healthy — just one — we do it no questions asked,” he said.

The English Football League, which heads up the three divisions below the Premier League, and Women’s Super League will be suspended until April 3 at the earliest.

England’s two friendly matches at home to Italy and Denmark later this month have been postponed as have Wales’ games against Austria and the US.

The fifth-tier National League will continue but said in a statement it “will keep the operation of its competition under constant and diligent review, and will remain in compliance with government advice at all times.”

The authorities still hope to be able to resume and complete the season at a later date.

“Despite the challenges, it is the Premier League’s aim to reschedule the displaced fixtures, including those played by Academy sides, when it is safe to do so,” added the Premier League statement.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday the government was considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures, but was not ready to do so yet.

However, the news of Arteta and Hudson-Odoi’s positive tests in the last 24 hours forced the English football authorities to act.

Hudson-Odoi said he had already “recovered” from the virus but will continue to self-isolate.

“As you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days, which I’ve recovered from,” the England international posted in a video on social media.

“I’m following the health guidelines and self-isolated myself from everybody for the week. I hope to be back on the pitch very soon.”

All matches in Scotland, including Sunday’s Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic, have also been indefinitely suspended.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/english-football-shut-down-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/english-football-shut-down.html

212,14-3-20,IPL caught & bowled,"Coronavirus hits sporting events across the world

A day after it was announced that the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League will take place behind closed doors, the Board of Control and Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday suspended the start of this year’s IPL from March 29 to April 15 and also called off the remaining two India-South Africa ODIs in Lucknow and Kolkata owing to the COVID-19 threat after the visiting players “expressed unwillingness” to continue because of the rising positive cases in the host country.

“The BCCI has decided to suspend the IPL 2020 till 15th April 2020, as a precautionary measure against the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) situation,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.

This came hours after the Delhi Government suspended all sporting activities in the national Capital due to the ever-growing health crisis which has already led to the postponement of ISSF World Cup for Rifle, Pistol and Shotgun (March 15-25), India Open Golf (March 19-22) and no fans engagement in India Open Badminton (March 24-29).

The BCCI statement made it clear that IPL remains “suspended” and “not postponed” which means that there is no clarity on whether the event will start on April 15.

In case IPL starts on April 15, it will be a 40-day competition as the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP) of other international teams will make it virtually impossible to stretch it beyond that point.

Also, there is a possibility that the tournament will feature more double-headers and at least five optional venues are being kept ready after State Governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi refused permission for the games.

As for the bilateral series against Proteas, senior BCCI official said, “The South African team was unwilling to take any further part in the series due to the rising number of positive cases in India. The players seemed to be in panic mode and wanted to go back home at the earliest.”

On Friday, the final day of the Ranji Trophy between Saurashtra and Bengal, was played in an empty stadium.

Apart from cricket, country’s top-flight football tournament — the Indian Super League Season 6 final in Margao on Saturday, will take place without spectators and also all the remaining 28 matches of the I-League will be played in empty stadiums. The Blue Tigers FIFA World Cup Qualifier match against Qatar (26 March in Bhubaneswar) and Afghanistan (9 June in Kolkata) has been postponed.

Globally, the English Premier League, German Bundesliga and European football’s showpiece event, the Champions League, has also been put on hold. England’s cricket tour of Sri Lanka fell victim to the virus and the French Football League announced that all league 1 and league 2 games would be on hold until further notice.

Formula One’s Australian Grand Prix followed by Bahrain & Vietnam and The Players Championship, one of golf’s most prestigious events, the men’s tennis tour, NBA basketball, Major League Baseball were among other events scrapped.

There can be more bad news as European football chiefs will meet next week to consider whether to postpone Euro 2020, due to start in June, and this year’s other major international sporting events along with the Olympics.

Tokyo Olympics organisers, the Japanese Government and the International Olympic Committee have been adamant the Games will go ahead as planned despite the global panic.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ipl-caught---bowled-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ipl-caught---bowled.html
213,14-3-20,Corona kills 68-yr old in Delhi,"Virus afflicts 82, toll rises to 2, several States go into shutdown mode

Coronavirus took second life in India on Friday killing a 68-year-old woman in Delhi’s Janakpuri area. The Union Health Ministry and the Delhi Government officials said the woman had come in contact with her affected son, who has travel history to Switzerland and Italy between February 5 and 22. Her death was caused due to co-morbidity (diabetes and hypertension), they said, adding she had tested positive for COVID-19.

As the number of positive cases reached 82 on Friday — eight more since Thursday night, which includes the woman and a 76-year-old man from Karnataka who became the country’s first coronavirus fatality besides 17 foreign nationals — several States have started shutting down schools, theatres and colleges, and many public events.

States like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra on Friday donned battle gear to fight the pandemic by announcing the closure of various public places like shopping malls, theatres and educational institutions to avoid large gatherings.

The Centre, too, continued with its slew of measures: It intensified tracing of the confirmed cases, resulting in identification of more than 4,000 contacts who have been put under surveillance; it declared masks including N95 and hand sanitisers as ‘essential commodities’ up to June 30, 2020 amid reports of their shortage and black marketing; it briefed the representatives of more than 130 countries and international organisations, including over 100 envoys, about the proactive steps taken by it to combat the menace; and it decided to send an Air India flight to Milan on Saturday to bring back the 220 Indian students stranded there even as it brought back the second batch of 44 Indians from Iran. After China, Italy and Iran are the second and third most-affected due to the pandemic.

Air India, however, decided to cancel its regular flights to Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Israel, South Korea and Sri Lanka till April 30. So far, India has evacuated 1,031 people, including many foreigners on the request of their respective countries.

The Centre also decided to allow international traffic only through 19 border checkposts out of 37 and decided to continue suspension of Indo-Bangladesh cross border passenger trains and buses till April 15, or earlier, if so decided.

In between, some good news emerged. After the discharge of three Keralites who were the first positive cases in India, seven more coronavirus patients have been cured and will be discharged soon. As many as 71 others are “clinically stable”.

Sharing these details with reporters here, Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal, however, ruled out the need to invoke the Epidemic Act. “It is important to understand that it is not a health emergency. We are trying to support initiative taken by the State in terms of managing the situations. Covid-19 is not a health emergency and that there is no need to panic,” he said.

The number of novel coronavirus cases on Friday rose to 81, which include 16 Italians and one Canadian, he said. On Friday new cases emerged from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Meanwhile, 124 evacuees from Japan, 112 evacuees from China are being discharged from Friday onwards after testing negative for COVID-19, Agarwal said.

Union Ministry of Civil Aviation Joint Secretary Rubina Ali briefed the reporters about efforts being taken to bail out stranded Indian citizens on foreign land. “An exercise will be undertaken on Saturday to bring back Indian passengers stranded in Iran. Air India will also send a flight to Milan on Saturday to bring back stranded Indians. It will land on Sunday morning at Delhi airport,” she said.

Dammu Ravi from Ministry of External Affairs Ministry said that around 220 students are in and around Milan, Italy and our priority is to bring them back. If any other students are left behind they can contact our missions, and we will see what next we can do, he added. Italy has more than 15,000 cases and over 1,000 deaths -- the most outside of China, the epicentre of the disease.

Meanwhile, the second batch of 44 Indian pilgrims arrived from Iran, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said.

With the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring coronavirus a pandemic, Agarwal said 42,000 people across the country are under community surveillance. States have come under vigilance mode. For instance, the Uttar Pradesh government announced on Friday that all schools and colleges in the state where exams were not going on, have been closed till March 22 in view of the coronavirus scare while Government, private schools in Madhya Pradesh will remain shut till further orders.

Similarly, the Haryana Government and Jammu & Kashmir too on Friday announced shutdown of all universities and colleges, cinema halls and public parks till March 31. Maharashtra which has reported overall 17 cases with Pune topping the list at 10 cases too have announced similar moves in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Pimpri-Chinchawad starting midnight on Friday till March 30.

Karnataka which has reported first death due to the deadly pathogen, announced lock-down of malls, cinema theatres, pubs and night clubs for a week to avoid large gathering in the wake of coronavirus outbreak which has claimed over 5,000 lives globally and infected over 1.34 lakh.

With the outbreak of novel coronavirus, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur too decided to suspend all classes and exams as a precautionary measure till March 29. Similarly, Army has postponed its all recruitment rallies by a month as a precautionary measure.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/corona-kills-68-yr-old-in-delhi-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/corona-kills-68-yr-old-in-delhi.html

215,14-3-20,"lt; no change in prices; govt to get Rs 39,000 cr","The government on Saturday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre each to garner about Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue as it repeated its 2014-15 act of not passing on gains arising from slump in international oil prices.

Retail prices of petrol and diesel will not be impacted by the tax changes as state-owned oil firms adjusted them against the recent fall in oil prices and the likely trend in the near future, industry officials said.

According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre in case of petrol and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel.

Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.

Officials said the increase in excise duty will result in annual increase of government revenues by about Rs 39,000 crore. The gains during the remaining three weeks of the current fiscal would be less than Rs 2,000 crore.

Petrol and diesel prices, which are changed on a daily basis, were cut by 13 paise and 16 paise respectively as oil companies adjusted the excise duty hike against the drop in prices that warrants from international rates slumping the most since the Gulf war.

Petrol now cost Rs 69.87 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 62.58.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.

It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.

Government sources said that while the benefit of reduction of crude prices in the first quarter of this year has significantly gone to the consumer, the Centre has taken this step of increasing duty to raise some revenue in view of a tight fiscal situation. This would help in generating the resources for development of infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, they said.

Benchmark crude oil prices have halved since January to USD 32 per barrel. In sync with this, the prices of petrol and diesel have also come down by more than Rs 6 per litre (from Rs 76.01 a litre on January 11, 2020 to Rs 69.87 a litre on March 14 for petrol, and from Rs 69.17 to Rs 62.58 for diesel during the same period in Delhi).",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/excise-duty-on-petrol--diesel-hiked-by-rs-3-lt--no-change-in-prices--govt-to-get-rs-39-000-cr-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/excise-duty-on-petrol--diesel-hiked-by-rs-3-lt--no-change-in-prices--govt-to-get-rs-39-000-cr.html

219,14-3-20,How can you eat bats & dogs: Shoaib Akhtar lashes out at China,"With COVID-19 outbreak killing over 5,400 people globally, former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar has lashed out at those responsible for making the coronavirus infect humans and blamed China solely for the outbreak.

""I don't understand why you have to eat things like bats, drink their blood and urine and spread some virus across the globe...I'm talking about the Chinese people. They have put the world at stake. I really don't understand how you can eat bats, dogs, and cats. I'm really angry,"" Akhtar said in a video posted on his Youtube channel.

""The whole world is at risk now. The tourism industry has been hit, the economy is badly affected and the whole world is going towards a lockdown.

""I'm not against the people of China but I'm against the law of animals. I understand this may be your culture but this is not benefitting you now, it is killing humanity. I'm not saying you boycott the Chinese but there has to be some law. You cannot go on and eat anything and everything,"" he added.

Coronavirus, which originated in China's Wuhan city, has so far spread to more than 100 countries, infecting over 1,30,000 people.

In Pakistan the number of positive cases reached 28 on Saturday.

Many sporting events, including the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Pakistan Super League (PSL), have been affected by the disease which has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

While the IPL 2020, which was originally scheduled to start from March 29, has been postponed till April 15, the playoff stage of PSL has been curtailed and will be played behind closed doors.

""The biggest reason for anger is PSL...Cricket returned to Pakistan after so many years, the PSL was happening in our country for the first time now even that is at risk. The foreign players are leaving, it will take place behind closed doors,"" said Akhtar.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases across India has crossed 80 while two people have lost their lives due to the deadly disease. But Akhtar did not have the information and added: ""God forbid the virus doesn't reach India. There are around 130 crore people there. I've been in touch with my friends in India and wishing them well.""

In PSL, there will be no play-offs and the top four teams will now play semi-finals and then the final on March 17 and 18. The final was originally scheduled to be held on March 22.

""I've also heard that IPL has been postponed till April 15. The hotel industries, travel industries, broadcasters everything will incur losses because of this,"" he said.

The former Pakistan pacer also called on the world authorities to come out with a new animal protection law so that such diseases don't resurface in the future.

223,14-3-20,Gates steps down from Microsoft board to serve humanity,"Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates has stepped down from Microsoft's board of directors -- another step back from the tech giant he founded 45 years ago to dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities.

Gates who co-founded Microsoft in 1975 with Paul Allen will continue to serve as Technology Advisor to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and other leaders in the company.

""It's been a tremendous honour and privilege to have worked with and learned from Bill over the years. Bill founded our company with a belief in the democratizing force of software and a passion to solve society's most pressing challenges. And Microsoft and the world are better for it,"" Nadella said in a statement late Friday.

""Microsoft will continue to benefit from Bill's ongoing technical passion and advice to drive our products and services forward,"" he added.

On June 27, 2008, Gates, who is now 64 with a net worth of over $100 billion, transitioned out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

He served as Microsoft's chairman of the board until February 4, 2014.

""With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company,"" Gates said.

""Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals. I feel more optimistic than ever about the progress the company is making and how it can continue to benefit the world,"" he added.

With Gates' departure, the Microsoft board will consist of 12 members.

""As a member of the board, Gates challenged us to think big and think even bigger. He leaves an enduring legacy of curiosity and insight that serves as an inspiration for us all,"" said John W. Thompson, Microsoft independent board chair.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month announced that it would immediately commit up to $100 million for the global response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

A significant portion of the commitment that the foundation made is focused particularly on developing countries, Gates said in a blog post.

Saying that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has started to behave a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen the world has been worried about, Gates has called upon donor governments to help low- and middle-income countries prepare for this ""pandemic"", in addition to helping their own citizens respond.

227,14-3-20,"Canada shuts Parliament, Trudeau in quarantine, no travel","Canada shut down Parliament and advised against all nonessential travel outside the country while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau governed remotely from his home, in self-imposed quarantine after his wife tested positive for the new coronavirus.

Dr. Theresa Tam, the chief public health officer, also advised more social distancing, no handshakes and kisses.

The Canadian government is advising the cancellation of all large events like concerts. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said cruise ships with more than 500 people will not be able to dock in Canada until July 1.

Overseas flights returning to Canada will also be restricted to a small number of airports in the country.

Canada's House of Commons voted to shut down for at least five weeks to help ensure lawmakers do not contribute to the spread of the virus.

The moves came a day after Trudeau's wife tested positive. The prime minister himself has been in self-imposed quarantine.

All parties in Parliament agreed to the suspension, which means lawmakers will miss two weeks of sessions since they had previously planned to be away next week and two weeks in April. The House is scheduled to next meet on Monday, April 20.

""This just shows you how seriously our government and members of the house are taking this,"" Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez said. Part of the deal for closing Parliament for five weeks was ratifying the new North American Free Trade Agreement. Rodriguez said lawmakers have passed legislation to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the Senate is expected to follow suit later Friday.

The suspension of the House of Commons means the federal budget won't be presented March 30 as Finance Minister Bill Morneau had promised. Rodriguez said the federal budget will be announced at a later date.

Trudeau was quarantining himself at home because his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for the new coronavirus after returning from Britain. He said Friday his wife has mild flu-like symptoms but is doing fine. He said neither he nor their three children are showing symptoms.

""She's getting lots of rest and drinking lots of fluids and we're paying very close attention to what the medical professionals are saying,"" Trudeau said to the CBC.

""I am feeling fine, no symptoms. The kids are all fine, happy to being staying home from school. We're doing well.""

Trudeau was spending the day in briefings, phone calls and virtual meetings from home, including speaking with other world leaders and joining a special Cabinet committee discussion on the coronavirus. Trudeau spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday. But Trudeau did cancel an in-person meeting with Canada's provincial premiers.

The prime minister planned to address the nation later Friday, according to his office.

Trudeau himself had not been tested because he was not showing symptoms, his office said. The doctor's advice to the prime minister is to continue daily activities while self-monitoring.

Trudeau said his government will likely recommend that Canadians avoid travel outside the country except for essential purposes.

“We are going to be able to get through this if everyone is going to follow the advice of our medical professionals and experts,” Trudeau said to CBC.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/canada-shuts-parliament--trudeau-in-quarantine--no-travel-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/canada-shuts-parliament--trudeau-in-quarantine--no-travel.html
228,14-3-20,Miami mayor tests positive for virus after Brazilian event,"The mayor of the city of Miami has tested positive for the new coronavirus after meeting with a Brazilian senior official who was also in close proximity to President Donald Trump.

Mayor Francis Suarez said in a Friday statement that he was not feeling any symptoms and advised anyone who shook hands with him or was close to him since Monday to self-isolate for 14 days.

Florida politicians such as US Sen. Rick Scott had expressed concerns about coming into contact with the Brazilian president's press secretary Fábio Wajngarten, who tested positive after joining Bolsonaro in a visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend.

As of Friday afternoon, Florida tallied 45 people in the state testing positive for COVID19, ranging in age from 25 to 83, the state health department announced. Two of them have died. Most appear to be travel-related but in more than a dozen cases, the route of infection was not immediately clear.

The new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, and the vast majority of people recover within weeks. But it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia in older adults and people with existing health problems.

Public events in Florida are mostly shutting down after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recommended the practice of social distancing and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez declared an emergency on Thursday. Most theaters took their cue from Broadway in New York City, which said it would “go dark.” But producers of a traveling “Hamilton” show in South Florida told ticketholders that their show would go on. The Miami Herald reported that Miami-Dade's Arsht Center notified patrons via email on Thursday evening that no refunds would be issued for this weekend's performances.

“At this time, most performances are continuing as scheduled and refunds are not being offered,” Arsht Center president Johann Zietsman's email said. “We will continue to follow guidance from local government health officials, and will implement any new directives from those officials swiftly.” Hamilton actor Jon Viktor Corpus, who plays John Laurens in the traveling show, called the approach “disgraceful” in a Twitter reply to a Miami Herald post about it Thursday night.

“I'm in the show. It's disgraceful,” Corpus tweeted. “The major concern is that the demographic of people most severely affected (by COVID-19) is the same demographic that comes to see our show.”

For now, continuing with performance aligns with Miami-Dade's cultural programs, which also haven't canceled shows.

“We're not there yet,” said Michael Spring, a Miami-Dade official who oversees theaters and cultural programs. “But we might get there.” Suzette Espinosa Fuentes, vice president of communications at Arsht, told the Herald late Thursday the situation was “fluid” and that the center was reviewing its no-refund policy.

232,14-3-20,Confident Nath asks Guv to hold floor test,"Rebel MLAs drop plan to return to Bhopal; 6 ‘Scindia loyalist’ Ministers ousted

Political uncertainty continues in Madhya Pradesh as 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including 6 Ministers, on Friday cancelled at the last minute their plan to return to Bhopal from Bengaluru and Chief Minister Kamal Nath called on Governor Lalji Tandon requesting him to order a floor test in the Assembly.

Nath said he will welcome a floor test in the Assembly, whose Budget session is beginning on March 16, on a date fixed by the Speaker.

The MP CM made the statement after calling on the Governor, his first meeting since rebellion by a section of Congress MLAs three days ago which pushed his Government into crisis. He also submitted to the Governor a three-page letter in which he accused the BJP of being involved in horse-trading and holding the rebel Congress MLAs in captivity. “I have demanded that these MLAs be released immediately. Floor test can be held anytime,” Nath told reporters after meeting Tandon.

Meanwhile, the Governor on Friday removed six Ministers, supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, on the March 10 recommendation of Chief Minister Kamal Nath. Imarati Devi, Tulsi Silawat, Govind Singh Rajput, Mahendra Singh Sisodiya, Pradyumn Singh Tomar and Prabhuram Chaudhari were removed from the Cabinet with immediate effect on Friday, said a Public Relations Department official.

As per the previous plan, most of the rebel MLAs were scheduled to arrive in Bhopal by Friday evening. “The legislators had reached the Bengaluru airport. However, at the last minute they dropped the plan to return to Bhopal. They were told not to go to the Madhya Pradesh capital for security reasons as Congress workers have gathered outside the Bhopal airport holding sticks,” Pankaj Chaturvedi, a loyalist of Scindia, who recently quit Congress and joined the BJP, said.

The Opposition BJP has consistently denied the Congress charge of poaching MLAs to topple its Government. Nath pointed out that senior BJP leaders reached the speakers residence at about 5.50 pm on March 10 to handover 19 resignation letters allegedly of these Congress MLAs.

“Nobody is allowed access and/or any sort of communication with the 19 captive MLAs,” the CM said.

None of these MLAs were present to tender their resignation, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/confident-nath-asks-guv-to-hold-floor-test-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/confident-nath-asks-guv-to-hold-floor-test.html

When will NRC be started? “What documents will be accepted as conclusive proof of citizenship and if a bona fide citizen is not in possession of any of these documents, how does s/he obtain them now? Will be answered by the Government of India, in true democratic spirit, to the satisfaction of those living in fear of being thrown into detention centres.”

Hitting out at Center for NRC and NPR, he further said more than 90 per cent of the people of India won’t have expected documents and the whole exercise of seeking documents to prove their citizenship will put the citizens of India to untold miseries, cause widespread panic and create a peculiar situation when such large number of people will be unable to prove their citizenship.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/anti-nrc-npr-resolution-ok---d-by-delhi-house.html

235,14-3-20,"Had a great time in India, says Trump","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a ""great"" friend and it was an incredible two days in India, US President Donald Trump said on his last month visit to the country.

Trump was on his maiden official visit to India from February 24 to 25. He was accompanied by First Lady Melania and a high-powered delegation comprising senior US administration officials, including National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien.

They visited Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi before leaving for Washington.

“We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days and he (Modi) is a great friend of mine,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference.

“He's a friend of his people because he was greeted incredibly warmly as was I in that stadium. That was an incredible event. And I loved being with him,” Trump said.

“We talked about everything. We talked about far more than just borders,” said the president in response to a question.

236,14-3-20,COVID-19 can spread even before people show symptoms: Study,"With COVID-19 outbreak killing over 5,400 people globally, researchers have identified how quickly the novel coronavirus can spread and that the time between cases in a chain of transmission is less than a week and that more than 10 per cent of patients contract the virus by an infected person who hasn't yet shown symptoms.

In a study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, the research team from the US, France, China and Hong Kong were able to calculate what's called the serial interval of the virus.

To measure serial interval, scientists look at the time it takes for symptoms to appear in two people with the virus: the person who infects another, and the infected second person.

""Our findings are corroborated by instances of silent transmission and rising case counts in hundreds of cities worldwide. This tells us that COVID-19 outbreaks can be elusive and require extreme measures,"" said the study's researcher Lauren Ancel Meyers, Professor at University of Texas in the US.

According to the researchers, the speed of an epidemic depends on two things -- how many people each case infects and how long it takes cases to spread.

The first quantity is called the reproduction number; the second is the serial interval. The short serial interval of COVID-19 means emerging outbreaks will grow quickly and could be difficult to stop, the researchers said.

""The data suggest that this coronavirus may spread like the flu. That means we need to move quickly and aggressively to curb the emerging threat,"" Meyers added.

For the study, the research team examined more than 450 infection case reports from 93 cities in China and found the strongest evidence yet that people without symptoms must be transmitting the virus, known as pre-symptomatic transmission.

According to the study, more than one in 10 infections were from people who had the virus but did not yet feel sick.

Previously, researchers had some uncertainty about asymptomatic transmission with the coronavirus.

This new evidence could provide guidance to public health officials on how to contain the spread of the disease.

""This provides evidence that extensive control measures including isolation, quarantine, school closures, travel restrictions and cancellation of mass gatherings may be warranted,"" Meyers said.

The researchers pointed out that with hundreds of new cases emerging around the world every day, the data may offer a different picture over time.

237,14-3-20,Trump declares national emergency as coronavirus crisis deepens,"US President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the novel coronavirus, unlocking up to USD 50 billion in federal funds to combat the fast-spreading pandemic that has killed over 5,000 people and triggered fears that the deadly outbreak will lead to a global economic recession.

The announcement came as infections and deaths soared in Europe, with the World Health Organization (WHO) calling the continent the pandemic's current epicentre.

The deadly virus, which has killed over 5,000 people globally, including 41 in America has spread to 46 of the 50 US States, with nearly 2,000 cases being reported from across the country.

""It could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical,"" Trump told a press conference at the Rose Garden in the White House.

""To unleash the full power of the federal government … today I'm officially declaring a national emergency,"" he announced and said that the action will open up access to up to USD 50 billion in the fight against coronavirus.

The declaration of a national emergency, a rarely used presidential power, allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments and coordinate the nation's response to the crisis.

The deadly virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has infected more than 134,000 people globally.

The US president has asked every State to set up emergency operation centres immediately.

Every hospital has been directed to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of citizens, he said.

The emergency orders confer broad new authority to the secretary of health and human services, and gives doctors, hospitals and healthcare providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients.

""We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they are entitled,"" Trump said, announcing a new partnership with the private sector to vastly increase and accelerate the capacity to conduct tests for the virus.

""We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently. But we don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn't be doing it and we don't want everyone running out and taking tests,"" he said, adding that tests should be taken ""only if you have certain symptoms"".

Using federal emergency authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new test for the virus, Trump said, adding that he expects that up to half a million additional test will be available early next week.

The administration has been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in critical locations identified by public health professionals, he said.

The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave their cars, Trump said.

President Trump said that all Americans had a role to play in defeating the novel virus, asserting that the most effective weapon right now was to limit the damage to the people and country by slowing the spread of COVID-19.

""The choice we make, the precautions we put into place are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread, and shortening the duration of the pandemic, which is what it is,"" he said.

Trump has suspended all travel from Europe, excluding the UK, to the US for the next 30 days to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The temporary ban comes into effect from Friday night.

""We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take,"" he said.

He has also issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places, but in particular nursing homes.

Trump thanked search engine giant Google for helping to develop a website to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.

Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now and they have made tremendous progress, Trump said.

""Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don't want everybody taking this test, it is totally unnecessary and this will pass. This will pass through and we are going to be even stronger for it,"" he said.

Trump also waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies.

That will be until further notice, he said.

""Based on the price of oil, I have also instructed the secretary of energy to purchase at a very good price large quantities of crude oil for storage in the US strategic reserve,"" the president said.

Vice President Mike Pence told the press conference that the coronavirus had spread to 46 US States.

He, however, said the risk of serious illness of the coronavirus remained low.

""We want to encourage every American to practice common sense,"" said Pence, who also heads the White House coronavirus task force.

Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services chief Seema Verma said: ""These temporary national blanket waivers are reserved for the rarest of circumstances, and they represent a massive mobilisation of our country's resources to combat this terrible virus"".

Abdullah, along with two other former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, was kept under preventive detention since August 5 last year, the day the Centre abrogated the special status of J&K under Article 370. Later he was booked under PSA on September 15, 2019.

In his first reaction to media, he said, “Today I don’t have words, the way I feel today, I am free...I hope my people will be free.”

Emerging out of his home, along with his wife and daughter, Abdullah, wearing a black overcoat and a traditional karakul cap, first of all greeted his well wishers and mediapersons assembled outside his Gupkar Road residence.

Abudullah said that this freedom would not be complete unless all the leaders in detention were freed”.

When mediapersons asked him to spell out his next move, Abdullah announced, “I will not speak on political matters until everyone else is released”.

“I hope my people will be free. The people of this State will be free. Let us pray to god that we get true freedom for which we have been trying for so long.”

Abdullah also extended thanks to all fellow parliamentarians who stood behind him. “I thank all parliamentarians who fought for my freedom. I will be able to take a decision on the future only after other leaders are released,” he said.

Abdullah’s release is seen as another major political development in Jammu & Kashmir close on the heels of launch of Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party, floated by former PDP Minister Syed Altaf Bukhari.

Meanwhile, Iltija Mufti, daughter of PDP president and former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who operates her mother’s Twitter account posted series of tweets.

""I don't consider myself to have an addictive personality but I felt as though I did at one point have a gym addiction that was just not fun, I felt I had to go to the gym every single day,"" Goulding said.

""I don't know whether it was a survival thing, because ­touring was so tiring, so hard, really taxing on your body and your mental health. I felt as though it was a ­survival instinct to be working out all the time, making sure I was super fit, super healthy and tried to counteract having drinks on tour and perhaps not eating very well,"" she added.

Last year, Goulding shared that she nearly quit music after 10 years of touring left her with anxiety.

The leading news channel also put out a promotional tweet ahead of its broadcast during its main evening bullettin.

At a press conference on Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister had mentioned about reaching out to Modi, among other leaders, hinting at Israeli efforts to maintain and stabilise ""supply lines"" of essential materials in view of the massive disruption caused by COVID-19.

""I also spoke to the Prime Minister of India, my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,"" Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday evening.

His remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister, the economy and industry minister, the Bank of Israel's governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus.

Netanyahu, however, did not share any specific details of his discussions with his Indian counterpart during the press conference.

The Dow's gains doubled in the last half-hour of trading as Trump made his remarks, giving the index its largest percentage gain since 2008 and capping a rally that recouped many of the losses from a day earlier.

That's when the index saw its worst slide since the Black Monday crash of 1987 and European indexes had one of the worst drops on record. The major indexes each closed with gains of more than 9 per cent.

The turnaround wrapped up a week of brutal losses on Wall Street amid heightened fears that the virus outbreak will lead to a global recession. Investors have been clamoring for strong action from the US government to combat the economic impact of the outbreak on businesses and workers. All told, the Dow jumped 1,985 points, or 9.4 per cent.

News that the White House and Congress were close to announcing an agreement on a package to provide sick pay, free testing and other resources helped boost the market.

""We're finally getting that a little late to the party, but it's better to be late to the party then not to come to the party,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. He said the stimulus plan should help cushion the financial effects on people and businesses.

Stocks surged in the early going Friday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC that the two sides were ""very close to getting this done.” But during a late-afternoon White House press conference, Trump said the White House and Congress had yet to agree on a broader aid package. He said he doesn't believe House Democrats are ""giving enough.""

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would approve its own coronavirus aid package and urged the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to “put families first” by backing the effort to provide Americans with relief.

The market's rout intensified this week amid a torrent of cancellations and shutdowns worldwide. Business closures have fueled fear that a severe pullback in consumer and business spending will tip the US economy into a recession and wreck corporate profits.

Meanwhile, Warren Buffett said Friday that the annual shareholder meeting for Berkshire Hathaway will be streamed live in early May without any attendees, apart from maybe a select number of journalists. The meeting normally draws a crowd to rival professional sporting events.

In just a few weeks, US stocks have wiped out all the gains made during 2019, one of the best years for the market in decades. All the major indexes are in what traders call a bear market.

The virus has infected over 137,000 people worldwide. More than 5,000 have died, but half of those who had the virus have already recovered. The pandemic's new epicenter is Europe.

In the United States, cases have topped 1,600, while 41 people have died, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.

Friday's rally was broad, with technology stocks accounting for a big slice of the gains. Shares in cruise line operators, airlines and hotels — among the hardest-hit stocks as people canceled vacations and companies shut down business trips — headed higher.

Investors' anticipation of a government stimulus effort and a rate cut by the Fed next week likely put traders in a buying mood, though it's not unusual for stocks to rebound a day after a big decline, something Wall Street calls a ""dead cat bounce.""

""I don't know if I would call this a dead cat bounce, but I would certainly not call it a trend,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.

""Maybe it reflects a little more optimism that we're getting a fiscal impulse that will help support the economy, and by extension, the market while we get through this transitory period of economic weakness.”

On Thursday, the Federal Reserve unveiled a massive short-term lending program to try to help smooth trading in US Treasurys. Many economists expect the Fed will move to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, to nearly zero, at its meeting of policymakers next Wednesday.

This week's historic sell-off helped to wipe out most of the big gains since President Trump took office in 2017. After hitting an all-time high on February 19, the S&P 500 fell more than 20 per cent, officially ending Wall Street's unprecedented bull-market run of nearly 11 years. The slide into a bear market has been the fastest since World War II.

The selling has been so swift and sharp that there remains the potential for a significant bounce after the virus and its impact begin to recede, Detrick said. The economy was already on solid footing and well-known companies like Disney and Apple were could help lead a recovery.

He also said there could be a recession on the horizon, but it would likely be mild at this point. ""It could be a shallow, quick, violent, scary recession, but one that bounces back quickly,"" Detrick said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/stocks-surge-on-new-virus-measures--dow-up-1-985-points-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/stocks-surge-on-new-virus-measures--dow-up-1-985-points.html
250,14-3-20,New Zealand tells overseas arrivals to self-isolate,"International visitors to New Zealand must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Saturday.

Ardern said the ""unprecedented and far-reaching"" measure would come into effect from midnight Sunday and affect all inbound travellers except those from Pacific island nations.

She said remote New Zealand had been relatively unscathed by coronavirus so far, with six confirmed cases and no fatalities, but the evidence showed the numbers would inevitably rise in the face of a global pandemic.

""But the scale of how many cases we get and how fast we get them is something we should do as much as we can to slow,"" she told reporters.

""We must go hard and we must go early.""

Ardern said the self-quarantine order would be reviewed after 16 days.

She said New Zealand had also told cruise ships not to visit the country until at least June 30, while New Zealanders were being advised to avoid all non-essential travel overseas.

""There's no doubt this will have a significant impact on New Zealand's economy but our priority is to ensure we reduce the impacts of COVID-19 as much as we can,"" she said.

New Zealand has already cancelled several major events, including a memorial planned Sunday to mark the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 people died.

Ardern said more general restrictions on public gatherings would be imposed but details had not yet been finalised.

Pacific island nations have not yet recorded any confirmed cases of COVID-19, with the exception of French Polynesia, where one person has tested positive.

Air New Zealand said it was reviewing the impact of the measures announced Saturday ""and will adjust its capacity accordingly"".

251,14-3-20,China's move to lockdown Wuhan delayed spread of coronavirus outside: Study,"China's decision to shutdown coronavirus-hit Wuhan city and the national emergency response delayed the spread of the virus to other Chinese cities by nearly three days and the overall efforts had cut the number of confirmed cases outside the city by 7.44 lakhs in mid-February, an international study has said.

The Wuhan travel ban alone had reduced 202,000 cases in China, delaying epidemic growth and buying valuable time for other areas to mobilise and response, a research study done by 22 scientists from 15 institutions in China, US UK said.

The study was published on health sciences preprint server medRxiv, meaning it has not been peer-reviewed and its results are up for debate, state-run China Daily on Saturday reported.

While China's massive clampdown on Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, putting over 50 million people under lockdown since January 23 won praise from the WHO, Beijing faced criticism for not acting in time when the virus began spreading rapidly since December last year.

Another study published reported by the South China Morning Post on Friday said the first case was now traced to November 17 last year.

Interviews with whistleblowers from the medical community suggest Chinese doctors only realised they were dealing with a new disease in late December, the Post report said.

By December 31, 2019, the number of confirmed cases had risen to 266. On January 1, 2020 the numbers jumped to 381. Dr Li Wenliang, a 29-year-old whistle-blower who later died of the coronavirus was warned by local police when he first reported about the virus on social media on December 31 last year.

China on Saturday reported 13 new coronavirus deaths, taking the toll due to the disease to 3,189 amid a steady slowdown of the cases in Wuhan.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 80,824 by the end of Friday, National Health Commission said on Saturday.

The details of the research paper published by China Daily on Saturday examined the impact of transmission control measures against COVID-19 in China from December 19 to February 19, the first 50 days of the epidemic. Wuhan went into lockdown on January 23, followed by the whole Hubei province a day later. It is still continuing.

These transmission control efforts included travel restriction, isolating suspected and confirmed cases, suspending schools and entertainment venues, banning public gatherings, and routine health checks on the population.

However, an estimated 4.3 million people travelled out of the city between January 11 and the time of lockdown due to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays.

The study said the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan was rapid with 262 Chinese cities reporting cases within 28 days. For comparison, the 2009 H1N1 influenza took 132 days to reach the same number of cities.

The Wuhan travel ban delayed the arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by an estimated 2.91 days on average. More than 130 cities, covering over half the geographic area and population in China, benefited from the delay, the report said.

While the impact of the entire national emergency response is hard to evaluate, scientists found that suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, contributed to the overall containment of the epidemic.

""With that caveat, we conclude that these control measures had a major impact on the COVID-19 epidemic, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by February 19,"" the study said.

""Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to spread worldwide,"" it said.

The deadly novel coronavirus that first originated in Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 5,000 lives and infected more than 134,000 people across 110 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-s-move-to-lockdown-wuhan-delayed-spread-of-coronavirus-outside--study-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-s-move-to-lockdown-wuhan-delayed-spread-of-coronavirus-outside--study.html

255,14-3-20,Oppo Reno 3 Pro: Well-rounded midrange companion,"Chinese smartphone maker OPPO has launched yet another impressive smartphone, the 'Reno 3 Pro' in the Indian market.

The smartphone starts from Rs 29,990, and there are two RAM and storage combinations -- 8GB RAM with 128GB storage, and 8GB RAM with 256GB storage.

The device is available in three colours: Auroral Blue (the one we reviewed with 128GB varient), Midnight Black and Sky White.

Here's our take on the latest Reno offering.

The device features 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a screen-to-body ratio of 91.5 per cent. It has a resolution of 1800x2400 pixels, which is acceptable at this the price point. The display is bright enough to use outdoors.

The display has a pill-shaped cutout on the top, which houses the two front cameras while the punch-hole is on the left side of the display.

The smartphone uses an under-screen fingerprint reader that the manufacturer calls 'Hidden Fingerprint Unlock 3.0'.

The back of the phone is plastic and quad camera setup is placed vertically with a flash.

The normal buttons (power, volume) and the SIM tray are placed at left while power button is at the right side of the device.

There is a USB-C port for charging and file transfers, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack.

For photos and videos, the smartphone has the quad rear camera setup that includes a 64MP sensor with an f/1.8 lens.

The rear camera setup also has a 13MP telephoto shooter with an f/2.4 aperture and an 8MP ultra-wide-angle shooter with a field of view (FoV) of 119.9 degrees.

There is also a 2MP mono sensor with a pixel size of 1.75 microns. The rear camera setup supports 5x hybrid zoom and up to 20x digital zoom.

The cameras appear to work well together and the results from the hybrid zoom and the portrait mode were impressive. The smartphone clicked some really good photos in daylight conditions with subjects being sharp.

For low-light situations, OPPO included a Night Mode along with an Ultra Dark Mode which are quite efficient.

The smartphone also comes with the dual selfie camera setup that consists of a 44MP primary sensor with an f/2.4 lens and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an f/2.4 lens.

The selfies we shot had punchy colours and good amounts of detailing in different light conditions.

Additionally one can also record videos in 720p or 1080p at 30fps or 60fps; in 4K at 30fps; and slow-mo in 720p at 240fps or 1080p at 120fps.

It is also the first phone to house the MediaTek Helio P95 processor, which was unveiled couple of days back.

It is an octa-core processor with two Arm Cortex A75 cores and six Cortex A55 cores. Supporting the processor is 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The smartphone has a feature called the Hyper Boost, which is most suitable for games and graphics-intensive apps and during our review, we were able to play PUBG on its highest settings without any lag.

The device runs Android 10 with ColorOS 7 on top.

The battery on the Reno 3 Pro has a 4025mAh capacity, which easily powered the phone for a day in a normal usage during the review period.

The smartphone comes with 30W fast charging technology that is claimed to fill the battery completely in under 60 minutes.

Conclusion: In terms of specifications, like the MediaTek P95 processor and the 1080p screen, the OPPO Reno 3 Pro is a good mid-range Android companion in the sub-Rs 30,000 category.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oppo-reno-3-pro--well-rounded-midrange-companion-2020-03-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/oppo-reno-3-pro--well-rounded-midrange-companion.html
