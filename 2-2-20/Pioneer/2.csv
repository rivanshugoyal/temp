0,02-2-20,The apocalypse: It is coming...,"First the assertion — the climate change is not coming; it is already there. Greta Thunberg may then be rather a belated warning symbol. The time for activism is over. It is now time to act. We had enough of activism ever since the world leaders gathered at Stockholm in 1972. We have been talking, discussing, blaming but not acting. Every party is responsible, yet no one is owning. And the time is ticking. To quote the Halifax Declaration, supposed to be a mile post on the issue of climate change: “Human demands upon the planet are now of a volume and kind that, unless changed substantially, threaten the future wellbeing of all living species”. Universities must be significant actors if those demands are now to be shaped into the sustainable and equitable forms necessary for a wholesome future environment. This was December 1991 at the Conference on university action for Sustainable Development, Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Vice Chancellors and President from 33 universities in 10 countries and representatives from business, banking, government and non-government organisations were present. Little has been achieved except that some courses on Environment Science and a big number of seminars have been floated. The Halifax meeting was to add voice to many other worldwide which are greatly concerned about the rampant and growing degradation of the earth’s environment, the persuasive influence of poverty on the process and the unsustainable environmental practices which are now widespread. In 2005, at the G8 climate change round table in the World Economic Forum in Davos, the following were reiterated: “Our earth is heating up due to human over consumption”, the developed world is responsible for all this and the developing world must take note of all this. But it seems things are still quite the same, only the activists seem to change. If it was Dr Tony Grayling then, it is Greta Thunberg now in this year’s Davos. We need action not activists. And action on the part of the entire humanity. There is need to go beyond and change attitude and behaviour of every human being. This year the 50th Annual meeting of the World Economic Forum was held in Davos again with a very noble theme — stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world. But neither the cohesiveness nor the sustainability were anywhere in sight. This is the problem. Bland sloganeering and popular catch phrases are the highlights while there is no light at the end of the tunnel. We need to take the matter to the grass roots. What was mentioned in the Halifax Declaration still holds good. It is the persuasive influence of the poverty that must be talked first. The answer may be found in the “time to care” report of Oxfam which suggests that the richest 2,153 people control more money than the poorest 4.6 billion combined, that is around 60 percent of the humanity. Single use plastics are just part of the whole story. The two words that sum up the whole issue are faulty consumption. The world still has enough for humanity’s needs. It is the greed that is endangering the world. And the point to ponder is who lives if the world dies.

1,02-2-20,Election in the time of Shaheen Bagh,"As the Kejriwal Government has redeemed its promises of freebies, it has already got certain credibility among the Delhi voters, most of whom comprise the poor and the lower middle class for whom financial concerns are paramount. However, the vote swing also hinges on how Kejriwal’s strategic silence on the anti-CAA protest is perceived by the Muslim voters

The pretext (Holocaust) for the creation of the Zionist regime (Israel) is false. It is a lie based on a mythical claim,” so had proffered Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the then President of Iran, about ten years ago. To bolster his constructed narrative, global experts were invited to a seminar to enlighten an “august” symposium on the subject and to attest to the veracity of Ahmadinejad’s protestation, much to the elation of the gathering. Ironically, the conference ensured that none of the Holocaust survivors attended the assembly, neither as a resource person nor as a member of the audience.

Cut back to India, there has been a new bid to create a narrative to discredit the historical facts about the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits, with stories cropping up about their mass migration from their homeland “at their will”. These stories started appearing soon after some eminent Kashmiri Pandits narrated their agony last month on the 30th anniversary of the tragedy, with a few experiencing the vicarious fear of the 1989-1990 from the similar “azadi” slogans of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters.

These two examples are not the work of futile efforts; they itch to weave suitable narratives that can culminate in creating new perceptions at the appropriate time. As perception drives passion stronger than facts, vested interests subtly indulge in management of the public perception. Seen in this perspective, electoral politics is more about war of perceptions which keep on changing.

Therefore, the Government’s firm stance on the CAA, and the “democratic” protests against the Act and the proposed NRC (National Register of Citizens) are feeding two competing perceptions. In the electoral battle for Delhi, the anti-CAA protest in Shaheen Bagh, some say, has left Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at its wits’ end. Those who claim so believe that any statement on the Shaheen Bagh protest is pregnant with risks of being seen on one or the other side of the political binary. Perhaps, the AAP too considers it safe to stay clear of the anti-CAA protest, fearing it to be a polarising topic. The view posits the existence of two preconceived dangers: first, there is a communal streak among the Hindu voters of Delhi; second, the freebies do not hold paramount importance even for the poor and the lower middle class.

Though there is no foolproof mechanism to discern how voters’ preference for a party or a candidate is shaped at the time of voting, prevailing perceptions and the analysis of the last three elections in the national Capital can throw light on the outcome of the February 8 Assembly elections. In the December 4, 2013, Delhi Assembly polls, the AAP rode on the Anna Hazare-led anti-graft movement and cashed in on the pent-up frustration among the common man against the alleged corruption under the Congress Government, both at the Centre and Delhi. The AAP offered a new brand of “clean” politics, and the idea was received warmly by the voters. Five months later in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the voters chose Narendra Modi as a “strong” Prime Minister after the BJP-led NDA was successful in managing a public perception about “PM” Manmohan Singh being a rubber stamp sitting on a corrupt Government. In Delhi, all the seven seats were bagged by the BJP as perception about the need for a strong PM dominated all other concerns. However, seven months later in 2015, voters’ preference changed again and they picked up Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Delhi with a brute majority.

A national election and an Assembly poll present different aspirations in the minds of the voters as they are now intelligent enough to distinguish the defined scope of the local and national governments. Moreover, the AAP Government has already redeemed its poll promises of freebies. When even a hike in onion prices blights the prospects of a political party, few among the Delhi voters, most of whom comprise the poor and the lower middle class, can afford to forego Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 freebies every month. For only a small number of the voters — affluent class among non-Muslims — the national issues like CAA and NRC may hold more importance for voting purpose.

Also, as the challenger BJP has angered the Muslims with the CAA, the community is likely to vote en masse for the AAP as the Congress, with its subdued poll campaigning, has either given up the hope of regaining ground in Delhi or has tacitly lying low to make its vote swing in favour of the AAP to defeat its arch national rival BJP.

Therefore, the AAP seems to have a bright chance to retain power in Delhi, but its electoral prospects also depend on the success of its strategic political postures in order to reinforce the desired public perception about the paramountcy of “freebies”. More so, because the AAP has got formidable challenges from the convinced ideologists spreading the word of correcting historical injustice and providing succour to the persecuted non-Muslim minorities in the neighbouring Islamic countries.

In such a tense atmosphere, considering the firing incidents on anti-CAA protesters in Jamia and Shaheen Bagh on January 30 and February 1 respectively, the perception among the Muslim voters about Kejriwal’s strategic silence on anti-CAA protests will also determine the poll outcome.

2,02-2-20,Budget based on larger economic philosophy,"What the Modi Govt has indicated is that transferring assets to the private sector is good for the country. It is also a more efficient way of managing national resources. Traces of this philosophy were evident in the Budgets of the Vajpayee Government and even in the Budget speeches of Arun Jaitley. But this is probably the first time the approach has been linked to a larger economic philosophy

The problem with Union Budgets is that they are calculated to leave a lot of people dissatisfied. The reason is simple: Governments have to exercise choices. Those at the helm of decision-making have to factor in what is possible and desirable and what those who voted it to power seek. The choices become even more daunting when economic growth has slowed down, not necessarily because sovereign decisions have been wrong, but because of global currents that are beyond the control of any single country.

In the case of Nirmala Sitharaman’s 2020 Budget, there was another complicating factor. Having won an emphatic mandate in 2019, not least on the strength of his record in governance, the Narendra Modi Government has been confronted with sustained hostility over the past two months based on the grave crime of having implemented things it promised in its election manifesto. The protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act isn’t really about any disquiet over granting Indian nationality to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists from across the Radcliffe Line. It is about the persistence of India’s Muslim community, in alliance with the Left and rag-tag liberals, to make themselves politically relevant and reclaim lost political ground. Given this background, it was near inevitable that whatever Budget the Finance Minister presented on Saturday morning would have been rubbished.

It is for economists and media pundits to decide the extent to which the Budget corresponded to the art of the possible. The Modi Government has broadly adhered to the norms of fiscal responsibility, despite pressure both from within and without to spend as if there is no tomorrow. A 0.5 per cent slippage from last year isn’t such a big deal given the slowdown that India confronted. The Government has also been remarkably successful in keeping inflation under check so much so that mehngai has disappeared from the post-Modi political lexicon. It is also the case that the Government’s delivery of its ambitious schemes has been far more targeted than the preceding Governments. This is partly because technology has been put to better use by the present Government and partly because private gratification does not feature among the Government’s priorities.

Where this Government was falling short of the expectations of its supporters — those who voted for change rather than mere stability — was in chalking out a blueprint of its approach to economics. This was understandable given the preoccupations of the first Modi Government in fixing the GST, chasing crooked politicians and businessmen and removing the cobwebs of over-regulation. The record on these counts was mixed but satisfactory.

What is significant about this year’s Budget speech was the clear elaboration of an economic philosophy. While conceding that quoting either Kalidasa or the Tamil Saint poet Aauvaiyar does not impress those more accustomed to being inspired by Nobel Prize winning economists or, at least Adam Smith and Ricardo, Sitharaman did succeed in getting a few basic ideas across.

First, the Budget has committed this Government to wealth creation and entrepreneurship. This is a departure from the notion of a benevolent state that was idealised by the Nehruvians. It implies that, hopefully, in future the tax policies will not be geared towards punishing those who accumulate wealth.

Secondly, the Government has in effect conceded and even acted on the assumption that economic growth can be fuelled if, instead of paying more taxes, people had either more money to spend on their families or even put away for a rainy day. The philosophy of lower taxes, hopefully, will come to stay for some time to come.

Thirdly, by identifying the prosperity of India in previous centuries to both the country’s manufactures and trade, the Government has underlined the importance of being a part of the global economy. This implies that Make in India is not a slogan for protectionism but an encouragement to greater competitiveness. Maybe Modi may have some problem explaining this to some members of his parivar for whom India is a byword for intellectual and material self-sufficiency, but this prudent interpretation of swadeshi as implying the essence of the Indian experience is welcome.

Finally, read with the Economic Survey that is quite explicit in its endorsement of private enterprise over state control, it is quite clear that the Modi Government has quite a different perception of what constitutes the ‘commanding height’ of India’s 21st century economy. The commitment to the privatisation of Air India was reaffirmed a few days before the Budget and Sitharaman broke new ground by endorsing schemes to open up railway passenger routes to private partnership and offering a slice of the LIC equity to the capital markets. Earlier Governments have divested because they needed to sell the family silver to pay the bills. What the Modi Government has indicated is that transferring assets to the private sector is good for the country. It is also a more efficient way of managing national resources. Traces of this philosophy were evident in the Budgets of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government and even in the Budget speeches of Arun Jaitley. But this is probably the first time the approach has been linked to a larger economic philosophy.

Whether philosophical clarity has also been accompanied by the simplification of personal taxes is for the accountants to judge. I hope it has.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/budget-based-on-larger-economic-philosophy.html
3,02-2-20,"Budget development-oriented, will spur job creation: Yogi","



|

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath lauded the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha on Saturday, saying it was “development-oriented” and would spur job creation in the days ahead.

“The Union Budget will help in creation of jobs, it is in the interest of farmers, it will boost continuous development and is a development-oriented budget. For this, I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman,” Adityanath, Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday afternoon.

“This budget will also prove to be a milestone in terms of developing the basic infrastructure of the country, farmers’ growth, jobs for youth and betterment of health facilities in the country,” he added.

The chief minister further said the budget was as per the current needs of the country and would strengthen the country’s economy.

“It will prove to be a medium to fulfil the aspirations of the countrymen. It will strengthen the economy and also protect the interests of each section of society,” he said.

Yogi Adityanath also hailed the decision to give further relief to the income tax prayers.

Bharatiya Janata Party’s UP unit president Swatantra Dev Singh also welcomed the Union Budget, it was a budget for the common people’.

Congratulating the prime minister and the finance minister for the budget, Singh said, “It’s a comprehensive budget which serves the interests of all sections of society like farmers, the poor and deprived sections of society, middle class and women.”

The BJP state chief said the budget had given tax relief to every section of society and would go a long way in doubling the income of farmers with the special emphasis on irrigation and foodgrain warehousing schemes.

Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reaffirmed his commitment for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes by making a provision of Rs 85,000 crore and Rs 53,700 crore for the Scheduled Tribes.

Welcoming the provision of Rs 3.6 lakh crore for tap water to every household, the BJP state chief said this scheme would help the poor.

He said the ongoing schemes like housing for all, toilet, LPG connections for poor and universal health insurance schemes had already benefited the poor.

4,02-2-20,Bankrupt budget from a bankrupt govt: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav dismissed the Union Budget for 2020-21 as “disappointing and bankrupt budget from a bankrupt government”.

The Union budget was presented in the Lok Sabha by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday.

The SP chief said this was the most bankrupt Budget of the decade as there were no plans for creating job opportunities, reviving the rural economy and PSU banks which were deep in red and financial distress.

“There is no map in the budget to revive the failing economy nor any vision for creating fresh job opportunities which has adversely affected the faith of the people in the economy,” Yadav said, adding that the stock market crashed after the announcement of the budget, eroding investors’ wealth to the tune of over Rs 4 lakh crore.

He said the budget ignored the interests of 70 per cent population of the country and cheated the farmers, working class and the rural people.

The SP chief said the budget was silent on stemming the rising tide of inflation while despite the repeated claims of the Narendra Modi government of doubling the income of farmers, no change was visible on the ground in last over five years.

“Far from doubling the income the farmers, they have been denied remunerative price of their agricultural produce and the farmers reeling under the twin burden of bank loan and inflation are committing suicide across the country<” he said.

Yadav said the budget totally ignored the interests of the farmers and the agriculture sector and there was no relief for the sugarcane farmers.

He said the budget would bring no change in the lives of the poor people.

The SP chief said that despite the series of measures announced by the government for attracting investment, the investment climate remained subdued.

He said the relief in income tax announced in the Budget would have little meaning as there was no income and the people were jobless.

Yadav said the government had gone almost bankrupt as there was no money in the treasury and the government was forced to privatise Air India and sell its stakes in the LIC.

The SP chief said the prime minister’s claim of taking the Indian economy to the height of Rs 5 trillion dollar remained a pipe dream.

“In fact, the revenue of the government has nose-dived and fiscal deficit is growing, making the economic situation unmanageable,” he added.

Yadav said the budget would add to the miseries of the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bankrupt-budget-from-a-bankrupt-govt--akhilesh.html

The accused is wanted by the Mohali police in Punjab so he will be taken to Punjab and produced in the designated court.

According to an official communiqué released by the UP ATS on Saturday afternoon, they got inputs that one Asheesh Kumar of Jani area of Meerut, who was wanted by the Punjab Police, was present in western UP so they developed the information and subsequently laid a trap and nabbed him in Haridwar on Friday night.

The ATS claimed that in August 2016, Brigadier (retired) Jagdish Kumar Gagneja, who was co-chief of RSS Punjab unit, was murdered in Mohali by KLF members and Harmit Singh was arrested in this connection.

During interrogation by the sleuths of National Investigation Agency (NIA), Harmit revealed that the plan to eliminate Gagneja was hatched in Pakistan by another KLF member Harprit Singh, who was then camping in Pakistan.

It was also revealed that the weapon was provided to Harmit by Asheesh Kumar of Meerut. The Punjab Police named Asheesh Kumar in the case and were trying to arrest him.

On January 27, 2020, Harmit was killed in Dera Chahel Gurudwara in Lahore.

8,02-2-20,"Haryana and farmers ignored in Union Budget, says Hooda","Leader of the Opposition in Haryana Assembly and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Saturday termed Union Budget as directionless and said that Haryana and farmers have been completely ignored in the Budget.

Reacting to the union budget, he said that no new railway tracks, airports, trains, universities, big industries or institutions for Haryana has been announced. ""BJP government has discriminated with Haryana in this budget,"" he said.

At present, the biggest problem in the country is unemployment and in this budget, no step has been taken in this direction, he said, adding that unemployment in Haryana is highest in the entire country. According to the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy (CMIE), the unemployment rate in Haryana has reached an unprecedented level of 28.7 percent, which is highest in the country, but nothing has been announced in this budget towards giving employment, which is very disappointing.

Apart from this, no relief has been given to the employees, middle class and poor people in income tax, he said, adding that the Union Minister has played with only data in her budget speech. No relief has been given to farmers. There is no step towards doubling the farmer's income in the budget.

The Leader of Opposition said that it was being said from many years to double the income of farmers, but the conditions of farmers are getting worse and even after this, the farmers did not get anything in this budget.

There is nothing in the budget to double the income of farmers. In Haryana, the farmers are not even getting the MSP of their crop. The farm cost is increasing day by day. Farmers’ debt has not been waived off. The farmers’ condition has not improved. Similarly, education and health were not given special attention in the budget. This budget is a completely dull and directionless budget.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-and-farmers-ignored-in-union-budget--says-hooda.html
9,02-2-20,President Kovind inaugurates Surajkund Crafts Mela,"Hailing the contribution of fairs like Surajkund International Crafts Mela in economic self-sufficiency, President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said that we should adopt the basic mantra of 'Local for a bright tomorrow’ as giving priority to local products would be of great help to the craftsmen and small entrepreneurs of the area.

Speaking after inaugurating the 34th Surajkund International Crafts Mela at Surajkund in Faridabad, Kovind said that through various public welfare schemes of the Central Government, many programs of skill and employment are being run to make the minorities, especially women self-reliant. One of them 'Hunar Haat' has proved to be a strong campaign in providing employment opportunities to artisans, craftsmen and chefs. He said that under 'Hunar Haat', 2.65 lakh skilled people belonging to minority community has been provided employment opportunities.

The President was accompanied by his wife Savita Kovind. Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya , Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh Jai Ram Thakur.

Kovind said as lakhs of people would come to see Surajkund Mela, the message of Mahatma Gandhi for the spread of hygiene, Khadi-products and handloom items can be easily conveyed to the people in this fair.

Congratulating the craftsmen and artists from various states and abroad, Kovind said that the Surajkund International Crafts Mela has become an established platform to showcase the art-skills, talent and entrepreneurship of the people of India. He said that the fair is organized to preserve and promote the dying art of handicrafts and special art forms of handlooms and to provide an appropriate platform for artisans to showcase their work.

He said that this year Himachal Pradesh is the ""Theme State"" and Uzbekistan is the 'Partner Nation'. In this fair, the cultural heritage and traditional art of Devbhoomi Himachal Pradesh is being featured. He said that this fair also presents an excellent opportunity to witness the rich culture and the traditional art forms of Uzbekistan.

Kovind said Kullu Dussehra of Himachal and Surajkund Mela of Haryana, have attracted tourists from the country and abroad in the last few years.

Welcoming President Kovind, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said, “we have implemented the State Cultural Policy 'Kalash' (Arts and Culture Haryana) to provide various genres and platforms to the artists of the state”. A project has also been initiated for the preservation of all the state protected monuments and to protect their exterior design. An Atlas of the ongoing work on the projects of Harappan sites in Haryana would be published soon, he added.

Khattar said the folk songs , arts and artefacts of Haryana show the eternal legacy of love, devotion and hard work developed and nurtured by the people of Haryana .

An agreement has been signed between the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and the Department of Cultural Affairs, Haryana to jointly organize various cultural and arts related programs. Under this agreement, the Haryanvi culture and art are being displayed not only in our country but also abroad.

He said Kurukshetra has been included in the “Srikrishna Circuit” under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme by Ministry of Tourism, Government of India. Under this scheme, development works on various pilgrimages were being done in the State.

Khattar said in the Shivalik region, the Kalka to Kalesar stretch is also being developed from tourism point of view. He said that our plan is to revive the Saraswati River and develop the areas associated with the Saraswati as tourist and pilgrimage sites internationally. Adibadri is the pilgrimage site on the Saraswati River situated on the border of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. At present, the origin of River Saraswati is considered as Adibadri which is a very beautiful scenic site and is being developed as a pilgrimage site.

Speaking on this occasion, Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur thanked Khattar for giving an opportunity to Himachal Pradesh to become a theme State in the 34th Surajkund International Crafts Mela. He said that Himachal Pradesh got this opportunity again after a period of 24 years.

Thakur said Haryana and Himachal shares lot of similarities in their arts and culture and fairs like Surajkund Mela provides an appropriate platform to the artisans and craftsmen to showcase their products.

He said that work is underway for the expansion of two Airports in Himachal and this would attract more tourists from the country and abroad to Himachal. Apart from this, the Government plans to set up a new Airport to give further boost to tourism in the State. He said that efforts are also being made to further promote water sports, snow skiing and paragliding.

Ambassador of Uzbekistan to India, Farhod Arziev said that a high level delegation of Uzbekistan comprising 100 artisans and craftsmen are participating in the 34th Surajkund International Crafts Mela.

10,02-2-20,Utkal Chamber hails Union Budget provisions,"The Utkal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UCCI) organised a discussion on the Union Budget 2020-21 after its members watched the live presentation of the budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday.

UCCI president Ramesh Mahapatra rated the budget at 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. He opined that the deposit and lending rates should have been reduced to encourage the money-flow and more investment in mutual funds, capital markets, etc. He welcomed the proposals in agricultural development, blue revolution, healthcare facilities on PPP mode in the district levels. He was also happy with the proposal of WSHGs to have storage facilities to preserve locally-produced perishable commodities. He also hailed the proposed Sagar Mitra Yojana.

UCCI VP (commerce) AK Sharda greeted the budget proposals as a whole and particularly those in the agricultural and MSME sectors. He also hailed the tax audit proposal in MSME to increase from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore. He too appreciated the proposed tax holiday for the real estate developers. He also welcomed the Kisan Rail Yojna and the Agricultural Udaan Scheme. He rated the Budget proposals at 7 in the scale of 1 to 10.

Executive members CA Ashok Chinchela and CA Tarun Kr Agarwalla also welcomed the provisions in all sectors and hailed the huge allocation figures and wished that there should be proper implementation of the programmes at the field levels.

They also hailed the proposal to simplify the IT laws by removing several confusing and overlapping provisions.

EC member Brahmananda Mishra was particularly happy with the increase in import duty in respect of sophisticated healthcare instruments as this would be a boost for the “Make in India”. India would produce these instruments and multinational companies would invest in India in this sector, he said, adding that the proposed integrated farming in rain-fed areas would be expanded.

12,02-2-20,"Guru Nanak championed cause of equality, justice: CJI Bobde","Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde on Saturday said Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev championed the cause of equality and justice and his teachings transcend all man-made boundaries irrespective of race, caste, creed or religion.

Recalling the first Sikh Guru's ideology of ""Pavan Guru, Pani Pita, Mata Dharat Mahat (air the guru, water the father and earth mother), Bobde said had people followed this message sincerely, the country would not have faced the terrible environment crisis as being witnessed today.

The Chief Justice was addressing the international conference on 'Philosophy of Guru Nanak Dev and its relevance today in equity, social justice and environment' here.

""Guru Nanak and his philosophy do not belong only to Punjab or the Sikh religion but his persona and his teachings have gifted pearls of sanity and wisdom to whole world that could transcend all man-made boundaries irrespective of the race, caste creed or religion,"" Bobde said.

Noting that Guru Nanak's teachings revealed that he was a rationalist, he said the first Sikh Guru challenged superstitions and dogmas in simple and thoughtful words that were well understood and accepted by members of the clergy and commoners alike.

""….Guru Nanak would demonstrate that all religions were equal and deserved to be equally respected by all. The ideas

behind equality of all human beings as well as universal brotherhood formed the philosophy of the holy Guru Granth sahib (Sikh holy book) which we know the collection of poetic hymns through which Guru Nanak delivered his divine guidance,"" Bobde said.

""He pushed away the bounds of race, creed caste and religion and championed the cause of equality and justice both for men and women,"" he added.

The CJI told the lawyers and law students present at the event that they will ""realise how much of this basic philosophy runs through the first couple chapters of the Indian Constitution and the Preamble which we are sworn to uphold"".

Bobde said Guru Nanak's views about women were far advanced for his time, adding he formed a democratic congregation where single, married and widowed women were welcomed and treated as equal partners of the community.

""He (Guru Nanak) further declined the practice of devaluing women on the basis of their gender and would often put the question how can we call her polluted from whom the great ones are born,"" the CJI said.

He said Guru Nanak left the foremost lesson behind for his followers and admirers which was feeding masses through 'langar' (community meal), and due to it the Sikh community is commended throughout the world.

""He (Guru Nanak) termed such sewa (service) as 'Sacha Sauda' or true business of life,"" Bobde said.

Bobde said Guru Nanak gave a message of 'Pavan Guru, Pani Pita, Mata Dharat Mahat'

""I cannot imagine the more powerful statement in the case of environment of today. It does make one feel if people had taken followed this loyally and sincerely, we would not have faced the terrible environment crisis which we are facing now,"" he said.

Bobde said it was Guru Nanak's passion for binding human beings together for leading a happy and peaceful life which acknowledges his role as the founder of a 'dharma'.

""Extensive travels of Guru Nanak helped him acquire deep knowledge and appreciation of diversity of flora and fauna,"" the CJI said.

Addressing the gathering, former Canadian minister Ujjal Dosanjh described Guru Nanak as thinker, debater and intellectual and urged people to follow his teachings and philosophy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/guru-nanak-championed-cause-of-equality--justice--cji-bobde.html

14,02-2-20,Kissan Congress to hold workshops from Feb 15,"To create awareness about failures of both the Union and State Governments in resolving problems relating to farmers and farming, the Pradesh Kissan Congress would organise Kissan Karmasalas (farmers’ workshops) in all districts in a phased manner from February 15.

This was informed by AICC Kissan Congress president Surendra Solanki at the Pradesh Kissan Congress’ extended executive meeting held here under the chairmanship of State president Amiya Patnaik on Saturday. The Kissan Congress would be made proactive from State to panchayat level, he said.

“During the last six years of Narendra Modi rule at the Centre, farmers have suffered a lot. While farmers have suffered from distress sale and loan burden, the Government has waived loans of crores of rupees of corporate houses. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichai Yojana has completely failed. Agro-based firms have become defunct. Today’s Central Budget will not support farmers,” said Solanki.

He said the Congress is the only party that can resolve farmer issues with all seriousness.

Kissan Congress president Patnaid said a road map would be prepared soon for staging of agitations against the lackadaisical attitude of both the Governments towards farmers. He said demands such as waiver of farm loans, Provision of monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for farmers, creation of 100 per-cent irrigation system for cultivation and increase of MSP of paddy to Rs 2,930 per quintal would be placed before the Government.

15,02-2-20,Man walks with wife’s severed head for 1.5 km before being arrested,"Panic gripped the passers-by in Jahangirabad area of Barabanki when a man decapitated his wife over some petty dispute and walked with her severed head for almost one-and-half kilometres to surrender before the police.

Before arresting the accused, even the cops were horrified at the sight of a man walking with a severed head.

A case was registered against the accused and the severed head and the torso were sent for post-mortem.

Police revealed that the accused, identified as Akhilesh Rawat (30) of Bahadurpur village in Barabanki, committed the crime and later surrendered before them.

The police said that Rawat was married to Rajani almost two years ago and had a daughter from her but she died due to illness.

“On Saturday afternoon, Rawat had a quarrel with Rajani (25). He dragged his wife out of his house and killed her using a sharp-edged weapon.

“After killing her, he took the severed head and started walking towards Jahangirabad police station to surrender,” a police official said.

According to the police, Rawat walked for almost one-and-half kilometres, and was moving towards Jahangirabad police station when he was arrested near Kadirpur village.

“The case will be thoroughly probed,” Superintendent of Police Arvind Chaturvedi said.

Meanwhile in another killing in Muzaffarnagar, a teenage boy was shot dead by his cousin over land dispute. Reports said that a 15-year-old boy was allegedly shot dead by his cousin over a family dispute on possession of agricultural land in a village in Muzaffarnagar, police said. The body of the teenager identified as Vinit was found with bullet wounds in the fields on Friday at Kharpod village under Kakrauli police station area, Circle Officer Ram Mohan Sharma said. A case has been registered against the accused Lalit Kumar and his father Jaipal Singh who are both absconding, the officer said.

According to the complaint lodged by the deceased boy’s father Chanderpal, he owns agricultural land in the village and his brother Jaipal Singh was demanding a share of the property. Vinit, who is the adopted son of Chanderpal, has no biological child, it stated. His brother and nephew are said to have brought Vinit to a field and shot him dead, Chanderpal said in the complaint.

Meanwhile, a woman and her four daughters allegedly committed suicide in Fatehpur district.

Circle Officer Kapil Dev Misra said the bodies of Shyama (40) and her daughters Pinki (21), Priyanka (21), Varsha (14) and Nanki (10) were found from a house in Shantinagar locality in Fatehpur City.

Locals said the head of the family, Ram Bharose, was a drunkard and four days back he had thrashed the five and gone missing thereafter.

The main door of the house had remained shut since then, according to police.

However, the locals alerted the police after foul smell began to emanate from the house. A police team broke open the door and found the bodies on Saturday, Misra said.

Some poisonous substance was recovered from the house suggesting that the woman and her daughters may have committed suicide, he added.

The bodies were sent for post-mortem to ascertain the exact cause of death, Misra said, adding that a manhunt had been launched to nab Ram Bharose.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/man-walks-with-wife---s-severed-head-for-1-5-km-before-being-arrested.html

17,02-2-20,"Nothing tangible, only pompous announcements in Budget: Capt","Trashing the Union Budget as high on pomposity and low on tangibles, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the economy was clearly not a priority for the BJP-led Central Government, which was too busy pursuing its negative and divisive agenda.

There was nothing in the budget, he said, that could pave the way for economic reforms or raise public consumption that was an imperative for reviving the economy. The budget was nothing but mere rhetoric, said the Chief Minister, adding that it had failed to address the problems of any section of the society, be it the farmers, the youth, the industry/business or the middle class and the poor.

Far from reviving business sentiment, the non-visionary budget, which reflected the Union Government’s total apathy to the needs and aspirations of the people, would plunge the economy further to abysmal depths, warned Captain Amarinder.

Pointing to the Finance Minister’s failure to even mention the economic slowdown of 2019-20, the Chief Minister said this showed that the Centre had no intention of addressing the problems faced by the economy. The budget has dashed the hopes of one and all, with the famers still waiting for a solution to their debt stress and the challenge of stubble burning, the industry feeling ignored, and the youth still waiting for the light at the end of the dark tunnel into which this government has thrown them.

The 16-point Action Plan for Agriculture makes no mention of any initiatives or schemes to encourage crop diversification, noted the Chief Minister, adding that with buffer stocks of food grain already putting a strain on the states (including Punjab) and farmers, failure to diversify would further aggravate the problems for the country on the agriculture front.

Captain Amarinder also castigated the failure of the Central Government to provide the much-needed push to infrastructure. “And what is there in the budget to strengthen and upgrade the Irrigation and Power sector? How can India progress without infrastructural development?,” he asked.

Even the defence sector, which one would have assumed to be a key priority area for any government in these dangerous times, had not got its due, Captain Amarinder lamented, terming the Rs 10,340 hike provided for modernization of the defence forces and purchase of new weapon systems as a pathetic joke. “This is worse than the increment even a clerk expects at the end of the year,” he quipped.

The Chief Minister also flayed the Centre’s failure to address the concern of the states, including Punjab, on the delays in release of GST compensation. “Where will we get the money for the development of our state?” he demanded to know.

The budget offers no cheer for the industry, with a meagre Rs 27300 Cr allocated for promotion of industry and commerce, said Captain Amarinder. Some grandiose plans have been announced to make every district an export hub, but no roadmap has been drawn on the way forward, which shows how clueless the Government is when it comes to the nation’s economic development and progress, he added.

Frankly, this lack of vision is manifest in almost every major announcement in the budget. For instance, the decision to hold Online Recruitment Test for all Non-Gazetted posts in banks does not take cognizance of the lack of digital literacy among the poor students, Capt Amarinder said.

The Chief Minister lamented the step-fatherly treatment given to Punjab in the budget, which had failed to make any outlay for the celebration of the 550th anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and the upcoming 400th celebration of Guru Teg Bahadur Ji, or for the promotion of Sikh Culture and Heritage. Despite being severely water-stressed, Punjab remains excluded from the districts which the Centre intends to focus on for water conservation, he pointed out, adding that even the Special Tourism Projects announced in the budget were meant only for BJP-ruled states. Such an approach does not behoove the government of a federal nation, he added.

Another area which is really a matter of serious concern for Punjab, and all other states, is the Centre’s decision to limit the GST Compensation Fund to collections under GST cess, said the Chief Minister. This, he warned, will further add to the problems of the states, which are already suffering immensely from the prolonged delays in getting their share of the GST revenue.

Even the industry has little to cheer in this budget, with a meagre Rs 27300 Cr allocated for promotion of industry and commerce, according to Captain Amarinder. Some grandiose plans have been announced to make every district an export hub, but no roadmap has been drawn on the way forward, which shows how clueless the Government is when it comes to the nation’s economic development and progress, he said.

BUDGET IS PRO-FARMER AND PRO-POOR, SAYS SUKHBIR BADAL

Hailing the union budget 2020 as pro-farmer and pro-poor, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday said the common man would be benefitted due to reduction in income tax even as the ground had been laid for achieving higher GDP by giving a boost to digitization, infrastructure and industry.

In a statement, the SAD President welcomed the Rs 15 lakh crore allocation for the agricultural sector. He said farmers across the country, including Punjab, would be benefitted by the government’s decision to go solar by subsidizing 20 lakh standalone solar pumps.

He said similarly the decision to set up Kisan Rail through PPP mode to transport perishable goods quickly as well as Krishi Udaan to transport agriculture goods to national and international destinations would give a much needed boost to the vegetable and horticulture sector in Punjab. “Insurance cover given to six crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna is also a path breaking step and will shield farmers from the vagaries of nature”, he added. He also lauded incentives given for fish farming and balanced fertilizers.

The SAD President also welcomed provision of Rs 85,000 crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and backward classes. He said as much as Rs 27,300 crore for development of industry and commerce besides launch of the national textile mission at a cost of Rs 1,480 crore. “This coupled with the government’s decision to restructure loans of more than five lakh MSMEs would help in revival of small units”, added.

Badal also welcomed the digital revolution being unleashed by the government particularly in the rural sector. He said the decision to lay optical fibre in one lakh gram panchayats would bring digitization to villages and would help the youth tremendously. He said simultaneous efforts to boost infrastructure by making new economic corridors, allocating Rs 28,600 crore for women linked programmes, making government functioning transparent and also allocating funds to tackle air pollution were laud worthy.

CII NORTHERN REGION WELCOMES BUDGET

Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) welcomed the Government of India’s Budget 2020 saying it dwells on a roadmap towards building a new and aspirational India, focusing on boosting income and enhancing the purchasing power of people.

CII said many of its recommendations have been incorporated in the Union Budget 2020-21 like enhancing farmers’ income, availability of piped water for all, balancing the use of fertilizers, encouraging greater use of solar energy.

The Budgetary allocation under the lead of agriculture & allied activities, irrigation and R&D has been increased to INR 2.83 lakh crores, which will be a big game changer for Northern states, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nothing-tangible--only-pompous-announcements-in-budget--capt.html
18,02-2-20,"Haryana, Himachal CMs hail Budget","Hailing the Union Budget presented by the Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharamanas a visionary, pro poor and future friendly, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the special focus on farming , MSMEs and social welfare sectors will in particular help improve the lives of people of Haryana.

He said the significant Budgetary allocations and announcements for promotion of good governance and ease of living including the 16 point plan for farmers, relief to taxpayers, an extension of Ayushman Bharat scheme will have great synergies with the ongoing and planned efforts of the state government.

Congratulating the Union Finance Minister for presenting a pro-poor, pro- farmers and pro-common man budget, Khattar expressed confidence that the budget will boost country's socioeconomic development and also give a decisive upward push to the economic growth. He highlighted the importance of raising the turnover threshold for audit of MSMEs from 1 crore to 5 crore in this regard.

Praising the Union Finance Minister on the announcement for selecting Rakhigarhi village in Hisar district to be developed as an iconic site with on-site- museum, the Chief Minister said that it is a matter of pride that now Rakhigarhi will be recognized internationally. He said that Rakhigarhi is the historic city of Indus Valley Civilization.

He said that this decision will not only place Rakhigarhi on the world map but will also increase the revenue of the State as it will be developed as a tourist destination and employment opportunities will also be created for the youth of the village.

IT IS A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, SAYS JAI RAM THAKUR

Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur termed it as a historic document that revolves around three ideas of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society. He said that the budget was aimed to address hopes and aspirations of all the sections.

Thakur also hailed the proposal of 16 actionable plans to enhance the income of the farmers. He said that since 90 percent population of Himachal Pradesh reside in rural areas with agriculture as their main avocation, these plans would go a long way in strengthening economy of the farming community of the State. He said that this ambitious plan would not only ensure the upliftment of rural areas but also ensure socio-economic development of farmers, unemployed youth and common man.

The Chief Minister said the budget was an attempt to ensure faith of masses by winning their confidence by way of all round development. Thakur also hailed the proposal for constitution of ‘Investment Clearance Cell’ at State level for attracting investments to the State without any delay. He said that this would give fillip to endeavour of the State to attract more investments to the State as the State Government had already signed MoUs worth Rs. one lakh crore with various prospective entrepreneurs.

Chief Minister said that the State Government would also be immensely benefitted by allocation of Rs. 6,000 crore for BharatNet Programme under which around one lakh gram panchayats of the country would be linked with BharatNet during this year. He also appreciated the proposal of providing Rs. 3000 crore for ‘Skill India’ to provide relevant employment oriented skill training to the youth. He said that the budget was guided by the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’. He said that the budget was an attempt to boost the economy of the people and increase their purchasing power.

Thakur hailed the proposal in the budget for increasing the budget allocation for Himachal Pradesh by 33 percent which would accelerate the pace of development in the State. He also appreciated the proposal to simplify Personal Income Tax proposal. He said that the personal income tax is at lowest rate of all time.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana--himachal-cms-hail-budget.html
19,02-2-20,SAD slams Punjab Govt for proposing to start home delivery of liquor in Mohali,"The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday condemned Congress government in Punjab for proposing to start home delivery of liquor in SAS Nagar Mohali saying after running away from providing Ghar Ghar Rozgar, the government was offering Ghar Ghar Sharab.

Terming the proposal, which the Government wanted to run as a pilot project in Mohali in the first phase as shameful and unmindful of the sentiments of the people, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said the very fact that it had been made and publicized spoke volumes about the mindset of the Congress government.

“This insensitive government can do anything to fulfill the coffers of its near and dears but it cannot do one thing to improve the lot of lakhs of unemployed youth all of whom were promised an unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month till the time all of them were provided jobs by the State. Forget fulfilling this promise, the Congress government now wants unemployed youth to drown their sorrows by ordering liquor online. This will not only increase alcoholism among the youth but also lead to a law and order problem”, the Akali leader added.

Asking chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to nip this evil in the bud, Cheema demanded action against the officials who wanted to implement this proposal which was bound to cause hurt to the sentiments of the people as well as causing social unrest.

“Simultaneously a probe must be ordered into this disgusting episode as it also goes against the spirit of the constitution whose Section 47 clearly states that the State shall work towards prohibiting intoxicants. Here we have a State which is not only encouraging consumption but has turned this into a State policy by getting into the business of home delivery of liquor,” he said in his statement.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-slams-punjab-govt-for-proposing-to-start-home-delivery-of-liquor-in-mohali.html

25,02-2-20,"Union budget 2020-21 a huge disappointment, says Congress","State Congress on Saturday termed the Union Budget 2020-21 a huge disappointment and called it just an ‘airy castle’. It also denounced the budget for not including any new railway project for lesser developed region of Chhattisgarh.

In a statement on Saturday PCC Chief Mohan Markam said, “People of the country had a lot of expectations from Union Budget 2020-21, which turned into a disappointment.”

Markam mocking the Union government’s claim of making India a five-trillion economy termed it a ‘Jumla’. Denouncing the Union Budget he said, ""Their goal is to make India a $5 trillion dollar economy in next few years but the reality is, that our economy is sinking not rising.""

Further slamming the Union Budget he said, “The budget is silent on how the sinking economy, skyrocketing price hike, burning problem of unemployment, safety of women, doubling the income of farmers, affordable education, better health facility, strengthening of industrial sector would be done”.

Markam also expressed his disappointment on Union budget for not having provisions for farmers and tribal populace.

""They promised to benefit the farming sector by reiterating commitment to double their income, which turned out to be a lie today. Farmers of this nation are going through a major crisis but there was no mention about any pro-farmers scheme or policy in the budget.

The Finance Minister did not propose any scheme or initiative to control the unemployment rate, which stood highest in the last 45 years, he added.

On the other hand, the state general secretary and chairman communication wing Shailesh Nitin Trivedi terming the budget an “airy castle criticised the move of the Union government to introduce Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in education sector. The sinking of share market after declaration of the budget itself is an indicator that the budget was a huge disappointment for the business sector too, he commented.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/union-budget-2020-21-a-huge-disappointment--says-congress.html

28,02-2-20,Union Budget gets mixed response in State,"The Union Budget 2020-21 has received mixed response from different leaders and individuals in the State.

Giving his reaction, Samajwadi Party State president Rabi Behara said the Budget can’t check inflation and price rise and help in generating jobs for youths of the country. He severely criticized the Government for deciding to make disinvestments from the LIC and the IDBI. The Budget would not provide any support to farmers, he said.

Lawyer and tax consultant Dillip Dashsharma termed the Budget very disappointing. “Disinvestment from the LIC and the IDBI will cost poor a lot. Further increase in petrol and diesel will break the backbone of common people,” said Dashsharma.

However, DAV School of Business Management Principal Dr DN Mishra hailed the Budget as “game changer” for Indian economy. “Adopting mechanism of 16-point action plans such as adequate warehousing facilities, district wise export centres, marketing support and ease of getting bank loans will help farmers to enhance their income. It will also support the marine sector and promote fishing activities,” said Dr Mishra.

Hotel and Restaurant Association of Odisha chairman and Hotel Association of India secretary JK Mohanty welcomed the Union Government’s decision to increase the budget for tourism promotion from 575 crore in 2019 to 2,500 crore in 2020 and for promotion of culture from 875.33 crore to Rs 3,150 crore.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/union-budget-gets-mixed-response-in-state.html

Owing to highhandedness and nexus between the officials of the Supply and Cooperative Departments and corrupt mill owners, farmers are facing problems in selling crops. Mill owners of the neighboring State Andhra Pradesh are exploiting farmers to which the Ganjam district administration has paid deaf ears.

The party alleged that the Government is able to procure paddy from only 25 per cent of the six lakhs farmers, including Bhaga chasi (sharecroppers) of the district but making false claim of procuring paddy from all farmers.

“The Government could procure 37,04,427.51 quintals of paddy only from 73,737 farmers out of 1,28,700 registered farmers.

The release alleged that Supply Department officials misappropriated lakhs of rupees in 2019 by procuring paddy at Rs 1,000 per quintal and showing Rs 1,361 in papers.

The Government had introduced token system to loot crores of rupees from farmers. Millers are not depositing one-sixth of the cost at the time of procurement which violates the established principle of procurement and the objections put forth by the farmers remain unheeded.

Due to lack of storing facilities, farmers have faced distress sale. Mill owners and businessmen of Andhra Pradesh are procuring paddy from Ganjam farmers by paying Rs 500 less than the MSP.

Pati and present BJP district president Bibhuti Jena have given an ultimatum to the Government to procure the entire existing stock of the paddy from the farmers and clear all the dues of the farmers within 15 days failing which their party would be forced to stage a demonstration in front of the office of the District Civil Supplies Officer at Chhatrapur.

47,02-2-20,State BJP hails Budget,"State BJP leaders across the board hailed the Union Budget for FY 2020-21 and congratulated Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting a budget of “people’s aspirations”.

Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Arjun Munda said that the budget is the budget of the country's aspirations. “I congratulate the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for this Budget. A tribal museum has been announced in Ranchi under some iconic museums in the country. There is a provision of Rs 53,700 crore in 2020-21 for the development of scheduled tribes,” he said.

“The aspirational India that is envisaged in the budget has economic development for all. The announcement of the 16-point formula for farmers will benefit agriculture and farmers. The Government is committed to double farmers' income by 2022. The Krishi Udaan scheme will provide national and international markets to the farmers of the northeastern states and especially the tribal-dominated areas,” he said.

“Especially, the middle class will benefit from the change in the tax slab. Those earning up to 5 lakhs per annum will no longer have to pay income tax. Apart from this, several announcements have been made for the development of infrastructure. Along with the new announcements, the government has decided to extend additional deduction of one and a half lakh rupees for the purchase of cheap houses for one year by 2022,” he said.

Congratulating the Finance Minister for presenting the visionary, development-oriented and new India-creating budget for the first decade former Chief Minister Raghubar Das said a new India is being built under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “This Budget will accelerate this work. The budget has focussed on BJP's Antyodaya. The Budget is a budget to strengthen the economy of the country, increase the purchasing power of the common man and speed up the progress of the country,” he said.

State BJP president Laxman Giluwa said that the Union Budget is a budget to complete Sarvodaya from Antyodaya. “There is a meaningful initiative towards strengthening the village economy. An attempt has been made to increase the purchasing power of farmers by doubling their income. The development of solar energy power, irrigation with solar pump, arrangement of accessing agricultural produce to markets by farmer rail, promotion of fish and milk production are all efforts to strengthen the farmers,” he said.

State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo described the general budget as a kick-start budget for the economy. “On the one hand, the provision of millions of crores has been made on the development of infrastructure. On the other hand, by making a provision of approximately Rs 1,70,000 crore for the welfare of women, tribals and backward classes, the government has shown its clear thinking towards these sections. A unique Tribal Museum of its kind will also be built in Jharkhand. Building solar plants on empty land is a major step towards clean energy,” he said.

Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar has called the General Budget 2020 - 21 as a strong foundation for the creation of a new India. He said that through the budget, efforts have been made to increase the income and purchasing power of the common man, and to connect private sector entrepreneurs in infrastructure construction.

This first Budget of the current decade simplifies the tax system, giving relief to the middle class, and fulfilling the dreams of the poor, dalits, the underprivileged, farmers, youth, women and entrepreneurs. While the middle class has got tax relief, corporate and business There are efforts to promote the world, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-bjp-hails-budget.html

49,02-2-20,Cong calls Union Budget ‘directionless’,"The Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Saturday criticized the Union Budget, calling it ‘directionless’ and ‘superficial’. Addressing media persons in Ranchi, JPCC Executive President Rajesh Thakur said that the Union Budget was a theoretical budget that will fail to address the real issues on the ground – inflation, unemployment, falling development index and farmers’ plight.

“The budget is completely directionless when it comes to addressing the burning issues that are plaguing the country. It fails to address inflation, unemployment, falling GDP and farmers’ plight,” said Thakur.

Citing alleged lacunae in the budget tabled by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Saturday, he said that the Ashok Dalwai Committee had suggested that a growth of at least 10.4 per cent in the Agriculture sector will ensure the doubling of farmers’ income by 2022, but there was a growth of only 2.8 per cent in the income of farmers in the current fiscal. “The Government has failed to achieve the suggested growth rate for doubling the income of farmers. Even the new budget has no roadmap to address farmers’ problems in the country,” Thakur said.

Last year, the Government allocated a fund of Rs.75,000 crore under various agriculture schemes to bring an end to the plight of farmers, but the Centre only managed to spend half of the fund. “Their (Government’s) promise was to disburse the funds among 14 crore farmers, but around seven crore farmers did not get any benefits under the schemes. This is the greatest failure of the Government till date,” a press communiqué from the JPCC said.

Highlighting the figures of the Economic Survey Report (ESR), JPCC Spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said that the country needs at least 8 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to achieve the development target, but the ESR has put the growth rate of GDP to 6 per cent. “If we go by the ESR, it is evident that we cannot achieve our dream of becoming a 5 trillion economy by doing what we have been doing since 2014,” he said.

A press communiqué from the JPCC said that the introduction of fresh slabs in income tax was a gimmick to divert the attention of people from the ‘flaws’ in the budget. “The budget has nothing for the youth, the farmers and even MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employee Guarantee Act) workers,” said Congress leader Suryakant Shukla.

Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former JPCC Secretary Aditya Vikram Jaiswal said the BJP refuses to admit that there are problems in the country’s economy. “The budget will make little to no difference to the economic challenges in the country. There is no indication of repairing the financial system in the budget. I would call it a non-budget,” said Jaiswal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-calls-union-budget----directionless---.html

68,02-2-20,Yogi: Shaheen Bagh ‘azadi’ seekers are terrorists’ backers,"While campaigning for Delhi polls entered the last leg on Saturday, Chief Ministers and senior leaders of different States held Jan Samvaad for their respective parties.

Amid the blame game on Shaheen Bagh firing incidents, CAA, NRC were lauded in Delhi streets.

In a first, while campaigning for the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that those who support terrorists in Kashmir are staging protest at Shaheen Bagh and raising slogans of ‘azadi’.

Hitting out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) dispensation at an election rally in northwest Delhi's Rohini, Adityanath said that the Arvind Kejriwal Government supplies biryani to protesters at Shaheen Bagh.

Addressing another poll rally at Karawal Nagar Chowk in east Delhi, the BJP leader lashed out at anti-CAA protesters and said their ancestors divided India, so they have a grouse against this emerging 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'."" ""These protests happening at various places in Delhi are not about the CAA, but it is happening because those people are questioning as to how can India emerge as a major power in the world, and to stop that rising India,"" Yogi claimed.

Citing the anti- CAA protest across country, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot alleged that the government did not know what people really expected of it, leading to protests and tensions in the country. ""There is a lot of tension in the country since over a month. There was no requirement of protests but if this government understood what citizens want, this situation wouldn't have arrived,"" he said.

He said the Congress believes in keeping all religions, sections and classes together. ""Whether it was the time of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi or the present leadership, they have always looked at Indians as one. Neither their policies nor decisions affected citizens in a wrong way,"" Gehlot said.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh also accused BJP for creating disharmony in Delhi.

Referring to fresh incident of Shaheen Bagh open air firing where no casualty reported, AAP leader said that I had warned that the BJP is conspiring to vitiate the atmosphere of Delhi, since the BJP is scared of its humiliating defeat in the February 8 Delhi Assembly elections.

AAP leader accused Shah and said he wants to postponed Delhi elections at any cost.

""How is it possible that open firing is taking place in Delhi on a daily basis?"" Yogi is mentally sick,"" Singh said.

Meanwhile, leaving no stone unturned, political parties will fielded their senior leaders on Monday. Prime Minister Narender Modi will hold two rallies in Delhi on Febraury 3 and 4 while RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav will also hold two roadshows and two public meetings here in support of his party and Congress candidates in the run up to the Delhi assembly elections.

73,02-2-20,India extends support to China in fight against coronavirus,"India has extended support to China in combating the dreaded coronavirus outbreak, and called for objective and rational assessment of the epidemic that has killed 259 people and affected nearly 12,000 others.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday spoke to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over phone and thanked him for China's cooperation in evacuating the stranded Indians from the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city and Hubei province.

On Friday, India airlifted 324 Indians, mostly students, from Wuhan and operated a second flight on Saturday to evacuate the rest from the province.

Chinese health authorities announced that the death toll has risen to 259 with total confirmed cases increasing to 11,791, the biggest increase since China began reporting the spread of the virulent virus on January 21.

In his telephonic conversation with Wang, Jaishankar advocated an objective and rational assessment of the epidemic and said India is confident that China will overcome the difficulties, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement.

Jaishankar said that India supports the Chinese government and people in their efforts to combat the outbreak of the new coronavirus and appreciates China's open, transparent and responsible attitude in responding to the epidemic, it said.

India is confident that China will eventually overcome the epidemic, the External Affairs Minister said.

Wang, who is also the State Councillor, thanked India for its support and said the Chinese government and people are doing all they can to combat the coronavirus.

""We have taken the most comprehensive and rigorous prevention and control measures, many of which go well beyond the requirements of the International Health Regulations.

""China's efforts are not only protecting the health of its own people, but also the health of people around the world. Foreign governments and the World Health Organization (WHO) have given full recognition to this,"" Wang said.

The WHO on January 31 declared the virus as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Wang said that the WHO, however, did not approve of the travel or trade restrictions on China when it judged the coronavirus outbreak.

""We believe that all countries in the world, including India, will respect this important recommendation of the WHO and China is willing to further strengthen public health cooperation with the international community,"" he said.

Wang, in his separate telephonic conversation with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday, once again highlighted the deep friendship between the two countries.

While India, the US, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and many countries evacuated their nationals from Wuhan, the Pakistani Government — despite strong criticism from the opposition, has declined pleas by several hundred Pakistani students in Wuhan to evacuate them.

The virus, that emerged in early December and traced to a Wuhan market selling wild animals, has now spread to more than two dozen countries including India, the US, the UK, Russia and Sweden.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/india-extends-support-to-china-in-fight-against-coronavirus.html
74,02-2-20,Aligarh admin prevents people from taking out anti-CAA march,"The district administration on Friday thwarted an attempt of a group of people from taking out an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act march here.

The protesters, led by Aligarh mayor Mohammad Furqan, tried to take out a procession from Shamshad Market to the collectorate complex but police blocked their passage.

Speaking to mediapersons, Furqan said, ""We were exercising our democratic right to protest but police did not allow us to reach the Collectorate.""

Meanwhile, Aligarh Muslim University officials said there was a ""marked improvement"" in attendance in all faculties on Friday.

The varsity was closed early for winter vacations from December 16 last year, a day after students clashed with police during a protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on campus.

The university was to reopen on January 6 but the vacation was extended owing to persisting tension over the changes in the citizenship law.

Students have been boycotting classes seeking the withdrawal of ""false cases"" against those who took part in protests against the CAA on December 15.

AMU Vice Chancellor Professor Tariq Mansoor has sanctioned a grant of Rs 1,50,000 each to two students who were seriously injured in the police action on December 15 last year, AMU spokesman Omar Peerzada said.

This decision was taken on the recommendation of a committee which had been constituted to decide compensation for the injured students, he said.

The vice chancellor also constituted a seven-member committee to look into FIRs lodged against AMU students during the anti-CAA protests which began in the campus from December 13. The committee is headed by Professor Najam Khalique of Department of Community Medicine, Peerzada said.

A senior university official said one of the demands of the protesting students was to give a permanent employment in the teaching staff to a student who had lost his hand in the December 15 violence.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aligarh-admin-prevents-people-from-taking-out-anti-caa-march.html

76,02-2-20,PCC feud: Harish Rawat supports disgruntled Dhami,"Plunging into the support of the disgruntled MLA from Dharchula, Harish Dhami, former Chief Minister Harish Rawat has said that dedicated workers of the party should be respected. In a facebook post, the former CM replied to his detractors within his party who are pointing finger at him for the fiasco involving Harish Dhami. The two-time MLA was listed on the last position (98th) in the list of secretaries of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) which infuriated him. In his FB post on Saturday, Harish Rawat accepted that he had suggested the name of Dhami along with dozen others for a place in PCC. He said that he had suggested Dhami’s name for general secretary. Terming Dhami as a strong pillar of Congress party, Rawat said that Dhami is a two time MLA and had once helped him for being elected for State Assembly.

He said that it is good that the top leadership of party has said a lot in appreciation of Dhami but has said that the responsibility lies on the person who had recommended his name. Rawat said that before releasing the list the leaders should have talked with Dhami and other leaders. On a sarcastic note, the former CM said, “I was not invisible. Had I been informed I would have talked with the responsible authority for correcting the error.’’

Dharchula MLA has virtually revolted ever since the new PCC was announced. He was appointed as secretary by the party and his name was on the last position. Terming it as his insult the two time MLA had resigned from the post offered to him.

The PCC president Pritam Singh accepted that the name of Dhami appeared errorenously in the list of secretaries.

Interestingly the episode gave the Harish Rawat camp to open front against Leader of Opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh. Dhami has accused the LoP for remaining friendly and non combative with the BJP government. He said that the moment the BJP Government stated that it would hold inquiry on the irregularities on the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) during the Congress reign; Indira Hridayesh adopted a soft stance on the Government. Dharchula MLA claimed that eight out of eleven MLAs were not in favour of making her the LoP but everyone accepted the decision of the party high command. He added that party high command would be requested to replace Indira Hridayesh with someone else.

With Harish Rawat coming out openly in support of his protégé, the internal squabble in the Congress is expected to increase in coming days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pcc-feud--harish-rawat-supports-disgruntled-dhami.html
77,02-2-20,"CM terms Budget ‘visionless, meant for capitalists’","While Union Budget for FY 2020-21 did not bring anything specific for the State except setting up of a Tribal Museum in Jharkhand, Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Saturday termed it a “visionless Budget meant to safeguard the interests of Capitalists and Industrialists.”

The CM said that the budget is against the aspirations of the common people of the State. He said that the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman, in her 2 hour 45 minute-long speech did not divulge the preparations of the Central Government to tackle the challenges like poverty, price rise and unemployment.

Speaking to media persons at his residence here on Saturday the Chief Minister said that the Budget has brought despair among the poor, farmers, unemployed and youth.

He said that economists are continuously evaluating the budget and after that only it can be said how much will the budget benefit the country, how much hopes of people will be fulfilled and how will it impact the economy of the country? However, he said, prima facie the budget does not look visionary.

The CM said that this budget has been brought in keeping with the interests of capitalists and industrialists. “An attempt has been made to provide relief to the big industrialists, who steal tax, through the budget. Now, they will not have to pay any interest or penalty, beyond being caught for tax evasion. At the same time, the middle class has been given a minor relief in income tax. The relaxation of income tax slabs expected by the common people has been sidelined in the budget. In this budget, there been an effort to encourage the privatisation of more and more Government properties. With this, the interest of the country will not be satisfied,” he added.

Soren said that there is a complete lack of vision in the general budget. “It shows neither direction nor vision of how the country and countrymen can be taken forward on the path of progress. It is not mentioned anywhere. The budget is completely dedicated to the capitalists and an attempt has been made to console the common people. In any case it cannot be called a balanced budget,” he said.

The Chief Minister said that he had met the Prime Minister and demanded to open Tribal University in Jharkhand. “But, in the budget presented today, there is talk of opening a Tribal Museum in Ranchi. In this way, the much awaited demand of Jharkhand was not fulfilled in this budget and the tribals here were once again cheated,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-terms-budget----visionless--meant-for-capitalists---.html
78,02-2-20,"Odisha share shrinks by Rs 3,000 crore","Even though Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik welcomed the Union Budget presented in Parliament on Saturday, he raised concerns over the fall of the State’s share by Rs 3,000 crore.

In a statement, Patnaik said that due to the shrink in the divisible pool of Central taxes by almost Rs 59,000 crore, Odisha would lose around Rs 3,000 crore.

However, he hailed the following initiatives:

Krishi Rail and Krishi Udan for national cold supply chain.

PM-KUSUM to cover 20 lakh farmers for solar pumps.

Removal of dividend distribution tax and introduction of concessional component tax.

Odisha has requested for extension of Concessional Tax rates to cooperatives in line with Corporate Tax cuts. We welcome the announcement of Concessional Tax rates for cooperatives.

Increase of deposit insurance coverage from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

Announcement for New Education Policy and FDI in the education sector.

At the same time, Patnaik raised concerns about some of the other measures:

Almost all allocations under the Centrally-sponsored schemes have been stagnant.

The divisible pool of Central taxes has shrunk by almost Rs 59,000 crore. This will reduce Odisha’s share by about Rs 3,000 crore.

None of archaeological sites of Odisha have been included in the iconic sites to be developed. Also, Odisha deserves a National Tribal Museum.

Drinking water is a national priority. Allocation of Rs 11,500 crore nationally against an approved plan of Rs 3 lakh crore is too little. In fact Odisha spends about Rs 3,600 crore in drinking water.

However, stating that SC, Dalit and Backward Class people would get more benefits from the Budget, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, “Odisha will benefit most from the Budget as a big share of its population belongs to SC, Dalit and Backward Classes.”

He also said fish production in Odisha can be doubled through the blue economy. The ‘Sagarmitra’ programme would help youths adopt marine businesses.

Delhi does not come in BJP's priority, so why should Delhi vote for BJP?"" he tweeted in Hindi. ""The question is also that when the BJP has disappointed Delhi before the election, what is the guarantee that it will keep its promises after the election?"" Kejriwal asked.

Prior to the Union Budget announcement, Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia requested several times to enhance the Center's share for Delhi.

Reacting on the Budget, Sisodia, who also holds the portfolio of Finance Minister, said that the Budget is a vision document of the Government and spells out its economic agenda for the next financial year.

""This year, there was great anticipation around the Union Budget and people of Delhi had high hopes from the Central Government that justice would finally be done to them, particularly when the elections to the State Assembly are merely a week away, Sisodia said, "" However, this budget has deceived the people of Delhi in a big way, it lacks any vision and is particularly disappointing in the critical Education sector.""

""In this year's Union Budget, the share in Central Taxes of Delhi has not been increased from 325 crore which is stagnant since 2001-02. Delhi deserves its legitimate share in Central Taxes to finance various developmental projects,"" Sisodia said.

""In the Budget, Government of India has not earmarked any funds to Local Bodies in NCT of Delhi although Delhi Government had requested for allocation of at least Rs 1,150 crore as basic and performance grants to local bodies in Delhi in 2019-20 and Rs 1,250 crore in 2020-21.""

""Delhi Government is providing 12.5 pr cent of its annual net tax collection to the local bodies, however, the local bodies in Delhi are not getting any financial support from the Government of India,"" the finance Minister said, ""Despite the fact that BJP leaders had in 2017, before the MCD elections, publicly declared that they would get funds for the MCDs directly from the Centre. What happened to their promise? It was a Jumla. BJP needs to answer why it is starving its own ruled MCDs for funds?""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-slams-centre-for-not-raising-delhi---s-share.html

83,02-2-20,"So, are you in sync?","If we wish to exist well, we must be in sync with the system, that is every thing taken together, including the cosmos, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

Before I answer this question, let us understand what does this word ‘sync’ mean. It is defined as moving or working out at exactly the same time and speed as something else. There is another definition also, which is: working well with something, in our case the creation or the system. We, small souls, are minuscule parts of the creation. If we wish to exist well, we must be in sync with the system, that is everything taken together. For example, all forms of life on earth, including our bodies, respond rhythmically to the movements of sun, moon, etc. When they don’t, we run into problems. Similarly, when we are in sync with the system we are doing very well.

How do we achieve this state? Before I go into its details, let me warn the readers that it is not something which can be done quickly. Rather it is result of years if not decades of spiritual progress. However, once we get started we begin to get fleeting feelings of it because we have identified it. The first requirement is to accept the present reality outside of our bodies. To elaborate this point, we must accept that whatever is happening around us is exactly what should have happened. There is no question of challenging/ rejecting anything because in the ultimate reality nothing happens by chance.

The same type of acceptance is required for whatever is happening inside of us, ie our thoughts, desires, health, etc. Yes, changes can be made but the present is what it is. For example, if we are lusty by nature, don’t find excuses for it but accept this fact. The same is true of our present limitations. For example, if we don’t have a genuine friend, we should acknowledge it. We can try to henceforth strike friendships with those close to us beginning with the closest relatives like spouses, brothers, etc. Ups and downs of life, which happen inevitably in everyone’s life must similarly be accepted with equanimity. Neither one should become puffed up in good times nor too demoralised in bad times. These must be taken in stride. Negativity has to go.

All these requirements may appear too theoretical. They are, because being in sync is getting close to perfection; it is not easy. A very solid bond with God is an absolute necessity. Only then, one will not lose control over the self due to passionate reactions. Only those, who have strong faith in God are able to control their emotions to this extent. Though all this may appear like dream but saints have achieved this divine state and written extensively about it.

To enumerate some of the benefits of this extremely rare experience: One will appreciate the pluses or positives in life; will not take them as routine. One will not lament the minuses or negatives; will accept them with humility. This is the beginning of the synchronisation of our desires with the reality of living; our feet will begin to get well grounded. Mental energy will not be wasted in rejecting the reality; one becomes a cautious observer. There is alignment with the life as it is at this moment; one accepts God’s arrangement. There is efficiency in life; when we are disturbed, we are unable to put our best foot forward.

We will be confident of self and will be looking forward to a bright future and even the next life. Narrow-mindedness will be finished; one will feel aligned with the creation. There will be satisfaction in the way life is going; one will feel secure. Surely, one will be peaceful. There will be nothing to worry or fear. Amazing calmness will descend; one will experience the elusive bliss (ananada). One will feel the presence of the creator, who is ever ready to guide and help. It is yoga, about which Lord Krishna has spoken many times in the Geeta. Are you ready to be in sync?

84,02-2-20,The net trap,"With about a 248 per cent rise in cyber crime complaints in 2019, online fraud is topping the chart. However, there are many guidelines laid out by the banks and the Government to stay safe but not many people follow it. MUSBA HASHMI speaks with experts to bring you a report

It was the New Year’s eve and Noida-based Neha Chandra, a PR firm employee, travelled to Paris to welcome the New Year with full enthusiasm. However, things took an ugly turn when her wallet was stolen while travelling through the French city’s metro. Within few minutes, Chandra’s zest for the celebrations disappeared as she noticed sudden transactions through her debit and credit cards.

However, Chandra was quick to get both her cards blocked within 12 hours but she still suffered a whopping Rs 1.45 lakh loss of the hard-earned money. It has been one of the few isolated incidents since in most of the phishing and other online frauds, the fraudster asks for OTP or ATM pin. But in this case, the transactions were done without any passwords or pins.

Another case in point is Manish Chandra Bajpai, a resident of Eros Sampoornam Society in Greater Noida (West). Bajpai had opened a joint savings account with his wife. On January 25, his wife received messages of atleast eight to 10 transactions that siphoned off Rs 98,000 from the account.

Getting messages on your phone to get your KYC done are dime a dozen. It wasa routine day in November 2019 when a Gurugram-based MNC executive got a message on his phone to verify his KYC that was pending on a digital payment app.

Thinking nothing out of the ordinary, the Manish (name changed) clicked on the link that came with the message.

Much to his horror within a few minutes of doing this, he got a message from his bank that Rs 3 lakh had been debited from his account. Manish has linked his e-wallet with his bank account to make payments like electricity bill, telephone bill and to make other monthly expenditure.

In yet another case of KYC update, a Delhi-based manservant lost Rs 35,000 within minutes. He called the number that came on his phone. The person on the other line asked him to click on various links to verify his KYC. While he was on call, he found that his smartphone hanged and the connection with the person on the other line got disconnected.

In the next 15 minutes Rs 25,000 was deducted from one bank and Rs 9,500 from another. He tried calling the number on which he was speaking. While the phone kept ringing, nobody picked up at the other end. A case was filed wih Delhi cyber security cell. The matter was taken to the concerned banks as well. The result? The Delhi Police finally closed the case last month citing —no leads. The banks too proved their helplessness in the matter.

In yet another fraudulent incident, Greater Noida-based 25-year-old Rohan Nagar, was duped of 3305 dirham (Rs 64,000) on June 22, 2019.

“It was on the morning of June 22 that I saw a message stating that a transaction of Rs 64,000 was done through my credit card. The message was of 3 am. I was shocked and decided to reach out to my bank as the transaction was done without an OTP validation. The bank immediately filed my complaint and assured me that the money will be refunded as I was not the one at fault. I was informed that the my card was used to book an Oman Air ticket,” Nagar tells you.

Moreover, since it was a credit card fraud, the banks take full responsibilities of such frauds because its their money.

“The money was refunded back to my card within a few months,” Nagar says.

The fraudulent practice is so in trend that Netflix released a 10-episode web series — Jamtara: Sab Ka Number Ayega recently to throw light on the phishing scam or for that matter to increase awareness per se. The series is set against the backdrop of Jamtara, Jharkhand. The theme is the Cops VS Boys.

Cyber Law Expert Pavan Duggal says that cases of phishing, identity theft, cyber stalking and online harassment are more prominent these days.

“Phishing is happening on a large scale these days. Also trying to invade the privacy of others is common,” Duggal says.

Data shows that there has been 248 per cent rise in cyber complaints in Navi Mumbai in 2019, however the conviction rate is low.

“The conviction rate in our country is extremely poor. I was in India’s first Cyber Crime Council in 2003 and we thought that henceforth a new trend will start, but we were wrong. The reason is that most of the time the police is not equipped enough to detect cyber crimes. They are casual, they don’t collect relevant electronic evidence correctly in accordance to the provisions of the law and consequently they are not able to produce and prove it in the court of law. The Supreme Court has come up with strong parameters on electronic evidence that has to be duly followed. Most of the times, for a variety of reasons, these parameters are not followed. As a result, despite having the best evidence if it’s not appropriately collected, produced and proved as per the requirement of the Evidence Act, it is just waste paper basket material. Despite it being a straightforward conviction case, often judges have no option but to acquit the accused because of lack of effective electronic evidence,” Duggal says.

The are a lot of challenges in such cases and the need is to have capacity building amongst the police and other law enforcing agencies.

Since online shopping and going cashless has become a part and parcel of our daily lives, Duggal shares a few tips to avoid falling prey to online frauds.

“One, always shop online from a secure website. The site which begins with https. Doing transaction on a normal http website is unsafe, insecure and all your data gets exposed to various hackers and fraudsters. Two, before shopping from any independent website do some research about it on search engines to find out whether or not the site is verified and bonafied.

“Three, when you use your credit or debit cards make sure you don’t do transactions on public computers or networks. Using free wifi or public wifis is a bad idea since it is completely insecure and all the data that you save can be easily hacked.

Four, you must have transaction alerts services for both your credit and debit cards. Five, have lower limits for your credit cards. There is no point of having big limits because there are chances that it can be misused as it gives more exposure to hackers. Six, constantly check your account balance and transactions every two days. In case of any unauthorised transaction, immediately report it to the bank in writing. Reporting such incidents within 72 hours of the transaction is preferable and it allows you to take the benefit of zero liability. This benefit is granted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the consumers via a circular from July 6, 2017,” he tells you.

In cases of no OTP validation or password exchange, cloning of cards is used for frauds.

“Today, there are a lot of internal leakages of data in banks and other institutions. One may have his cards with his own self but because of leakage, hacking or cloning is cards, this misuse takes place and a person ends up losing money. This now happening frequently. The RBI has mandate all banks to fulfill various obligations of reasonable security practices to protect the confidential data. Despite this, you see that the Cosmos Bank being hit by Rs 93 crore loss because of cyber hack. Most of the banks don’t comply to these guidelines and invariably these cyber crime incidences take place,” Duggal says.

There are certain things that the customer knows yet turns a blind eye towards it.

“Giving your phone to someone else is the most common mistake that most of us make on a daily basis. Customers carelessly share confidential information on phone. Most people have the tendency of forgetting passwords so they save all their information on their phone forgetting that it is completely hackable. If only people will become more careful and keep an eye for details, these frauds are largely preventable,” he tells you.

Given the current situation, is it safe to get back to cash in the coming years?

“Digital payments are here to stay but they have to be handled with lot of care and caution. They cannot be taken for granted. If you are too casual or careless with your digital payments then it’s better to prefer cash payments. Also in today’s scenario once you lose money in digital transactions, trying to get it back becomes a huge challenge. Therefore, if you are not completely equipped with cyber security tools, it’s better to be on the safe side and use cash,” he tells you.

Karnika Seth, cyberlawyer and expert who has been handling cyber crime cases for a while now says that she gets a few queries of phishing and other frauds queries on a daily basis.

“There are a lot of queries pertaining to online frauds and data theft that we get over phone calls and in our mail box daily. So far we have been able to resolve quite a few of them. A recent case that we have handled was related to frauds using various online payments app. The modus operandi is different in different crimes,” she says.

In case of credit card frauds, recovering the money back is relatively easy due to availability of chargeback. However, in the case of debit card frauds, recovering money is a challenge.

“Recently we have sued a bank for unauthorised transactions in our client’s account. Our client was defrauded of lakhs of money. There were no alerts or messages sent to the client regarding the transactions. No two-step verification was done as well,” Seth tells you.

There are certain challenges while fighting such cases since the bank doesn’t give out full information of the client.

“When you are suing the bank, the bank will not like to reveal much information about the client’s account unless they are asked to. In such cases we have to rely on the client’s bank statement to show the fraud. If a fraud has happened from a far location, the banks don’t even share IP addresses and they don’t reveal much information about how the transaction has taken place. This is what the banks should do in order to resolve external cyber attacks. Also, it may be that an internal employee from the bank or some insider could have caused this, it depends on facts,” she says.

If a bank is not helping the customers in case of unauthorised transactions, Seth lists out a few steps that one can follow to get their money back.

“In such a scenario, a person can go to the banking ombudsman or file a complaint with the adjucating authority under the IT Act. This way he can claim the compensation amount, if he has the right to do that,” she tells you.

There are a lot that the people can do to prevent themselves from becoming a victim of online frauds.

“First, customers should always register for online alerts. Second, they should have strong banking passwords that are not easily predictable. Third, be vigilant with your bank statements. Fourth, whenever one is changing their mobile, all the confidential information including the saved passwords and account numbers should be deleted. Fifth, never open any fictious link that have been sent to you via a message and don’t download any unverified and suspicious app. These malicious apps can make your device fully accessible to the hackers who can steal all the financial information and passwords from your phone. Lastly, don’t attend to or entertain any calls that are trying to verify your personal data or are pretending to be an authorised professional from a bank or another organisations,” Seth tells you.

85,02-2-20,Talktime : ‘Rejections don’t bother me’,"Alaya Furniturewala | Debutante Alaya, who is seen in Jawaani Jaaneman speaks with Musba Hashmi about how she got on board the film, her experience working with Saif Ali Khan and Tabu and approach towards acting, among other things

How did Jawaani Jaaneman happen?

I got to know about this film through a newspaper. My father had sent me a clip of the article wherein they were calling people for auditions. My father asked me to give it a try and I agreed. I went for the auditions and fortunately the team liked the performance. This is how I was confirmed for the project.

Did you have to do any preparations for the role?

There were no specific preparations as such. But since this is my debut so yes I did all the general preparations that an actor does.

Was there a moment when you had to go out of your comfort zone?

Not as such. But there’s a scene where I had to stop Tabu ma’am and Saif sir from shouting. It was challenging because they are so good. So yes that’s it.

How was the experience working with Saif Ali Khan and Tabu?

It was amazing. They are calm and friendly. It didn’t feel like I was working with big stars. I instantly felt comfortable with them. It was fun too.

The atmosphere at the sets was so good and comfortable that I didn’t feel like a newcomer. It felt like we haven’t done anything but actually we have done a lot of work. The entire team was supportive.

A lesson that you took back home from the sets?

I believe in doing lots of preparation before reaching the sets. So whenever I was on the sets Tabu ma’am and Saif sir acknowledged that I was prepared. They advised me to never change this quality. This motivated me a lot. I never miss my dance classes even after returning from shoots.

You have been open about facing rejections. Did that demotivate you?

Not at all. I don’t mind getting rejected. Facing rejections is part and parcel of acting. Even if you are not getting rejected in the auditions, your film will fail at the box office and you will ultimately face rejection from the audience. There’s no escaping from that.

Good performance is must. It’s a part of growing up and learning how to cope. The true sense, dedication is when things are not going your way and you still wake up every day, do the chores, go to your daily classes and try once again. This shows courage. Everytime I got rejected, I realised how much I want it.

What is your approach towards acting?

Prepare lots and when you are on the sets forget everything. Just go with the flow. That’s it.

What does fashion mean to you?

Fashion means everything and nothing to me. I am versatile. I feel happy dressing up, doing my hair and make-up. I am also happy to get nothing done and sit cosily in my space. I am happy both ways. It just depends in which mood I am in.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime--------rejections-don---t-bother-me----2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime--------rejections-don---t-bother-me---.html
86,02-2-20,Tradition comes alive,"For 45 days, the city of temples comes alive with the the sound of music and dance as hundreds of artists from across the world throng Chennai. Kumar Chellappan tells you more

With more than six hundred musicians reciting together “endaro mahanubhavulu …andariki vandanamulu..”(my respect to all those great men in this world, those men will feel the moonlike beautiful form of God) the famous kriti composed by saint Thyagaraja, one of the trinity of Carnatic music at the famous Thygaraja Swami Temple on the banks of River Cauveri last Wednesday, the festival season of Tamil Nadu has given way to the dreary, humid and hot summer days ahead.

The Margazhi Music and Dance Festival which commenced in the first week of December bade farewell to the city as musicians and danseuses flocked into Chennai from all the continents boarded the return flights with the promise to come back again in December 2020.

For almost 45 days, it was non-stop dance and music performances and that too classical which elevated the aficionados to hitherto unheard and unseen feelings — nearly 4,000 artists and 500 performances! Chennaites couldn’t have asked for more!

Whether it is the US-born danseuse Shreya Iyer, daughter and disciple of Suganda Sreenath or Padma Subramaniam, the eternal queen of Bharatantyam who has been giving scintillating performances even at age76, the stages in Chennai’s various sabhas (Tamil/Sanskrit for the perfect auditoriums where concerts are held) come alive for 45 days as audience are taken for a flight to fantasy.

For Shreya, a globe trotter, an hour of her daily life is devoted to composing and preparing the numbers for the next Margazhi Festival. Whether it is in Norway, or in Melbourne, this disciple of Dhananjayan and Shanta Dhananjayan is full of anxiety about Chennai festival.

“It’s the ultimate stage and the final jury,” Shreya tells you whose Nrityopaharam was the concluding programme of 2020 season. “Sakhiye, in Ragam Anand Bhairavi, captures a conversation between the heroin and her friend. The lovelorn nayika (heroin) pleads with her sakhi (friend) not to be indifferent to her suffering and help her by bringing her Lord Rajagopalan (Sree Krishna),” Vijayashree Ramesh, a Bharatanatyam connoisseur who has an eye for picking the best, explains.

Chennai becomes the capital of music and dance during this period as hundreds of artists, local as well as from around the global make a beeline to this city to enthral and entertain the connoisseurs. The musicians may recite the same old numbers and the danseuses the ageold kritis dating back to time immemorial.

“That’s the beauty of Carnatic music as well as the Indian classical dances, especially the Bharatanatyam which has distinct and different styles like the Pandhanaallur and Thanjavur. They are visual treats and if the repertoire are any yardstick, we have not reached the half way mark of the kritis which are there in the treaasurehouse,” said Dakshayani, choreographer and disciple of Padma Subramanian.

There are no repetition or ennui resulting out of hearing the same composition. When Nithyasree Mahadevan, sings Sree Ganapathy Ni Sevimparare, the audience felt they were hearing it for the first time. For Mahadevan, who literally lives out in airport lounges as part of her musical tour around the world, what matters most are the compositions which she has to present during the festival.

There are a lot of reasons why there is so much love for this festival and why people throng to it?

“If you are in Chennai and not attended the festival, it is like a man living in Varanasi and neve rhaving taken a dip in the Ganga,” N Kalyanasundaram, veteran scribe and a regular at the sabhas dotting the city landscape, says.

There can be no Chennai without Margazhi. Though attempts have been made by self-styled progressive elements to counter Margazhi Festival with the other similar festivals, all attempts remained a non-starter.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tradition-comes-alive-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/tradition-comes-alive.html
87,02-2-20,‘Music is hero in indie space’,"Music director BHARAT Goel who released his single Hun Nahi Jeena, speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about his journey and future projects

How did your musical journey begin?

I learnt the tabla when I was very young for about six years. I had a keen sense of music and instruments in general as a child. As I grew older, I learnt other instruments and tried to master them. I was in the school band and played the flute and the keys. Once I finished school, I went to Singapore for further studies for technical training. After graduation, I decided to take up music seriously; went to London and did in master in audio production. That was life changing. It taught me lot of things related to audio production. Came back to Indian in 2009 and joined Pritam da, in-house, in 2010. Started my own studio in 2012 and started producing music and worked with Pritam on a number of films like Yeh Jawani Deewani, Barfi and Badhai Ho. As of 2018, I have started composing too.

What the challenges that music directors are facing?

The industry is extremely dynamic today. There is a boom of consumption — our population and music streaming. To keep up with the on-going demand, one has to be a cutting edge and versatile composer and producer. The industry is competitive as well, one has to keep up with that.

Is there more stress on beat rather than melody?

No, not really. Our perception as a music society has always been melody driven since the beginning of time. For a song to be picked up, it has to have melody. Though, rap is being well-perceived. But in general, we have a melody driven consumption population. A song must have melody, a beautiful voice and music production.

We take cues from what is happening in the western music. Why is that happening?

We are part of the global culture. This is not just happening in the music. It reflects in other aspects as well like technology needs, fashion and culture; a lot has influence from western culture, so even music would have it. But this need not necessarily be a bad thing if it adds value to the music, why not. Music is an art form and if we are consuming it with an added value, that is good.

What is Hun Nahi Jeena about?

It is a beautiful romantic single. Most of the Bollywood songs that I have produced for Bollywood have been upbeat and peppy numbers. Since I started composing, I wanted to showcase this. The collaboration happened between Asees Kaur and myself. Times Music was supportive and we came up with this single

Has indie space given you a way out for your creativity?

Absolutely. Being a composer is brining out your own creativity. As a producer, I give shape to others’ vision. But as a composer, it gives me a chance give shape to my vision. Being a music composer is a natural transition for a producer.

Where is music heading today?

Up until now, we have been consuming music was film-driven. But now, there is a complete boom for independent music. The music here is the hero. This is great.

What are the other projects in hand?

I have other singles in hand with Times Music. I am closely associated with Pritam for films. I am doing my own composition as well.

What kind of music would you like to compose?

I don’t have a preference. I have the ability to produce and compose any kind of record. From desi Indian to progressive, electronic, newage, urban cool music, I can do it all. That is why I started composing. I wanted to explore how much variety I could bing to the table.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---music-is-hero-in-indie-space----2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---music-is-hero-in-indie-space---.html

Pooja hegde steps up for a cause

Actor Pooja Hegde is a prolific actor, who has proved her mettle in both Bollywood and southern film industry. This is visible in the huge fan following and adulation she gets from the audience and she has expressed her gratitude time and again.

However, she very strongly believes in giving back to society. The multi-talented actor recently made a donation of Rs 2.5 lakh for two children suffering from cancer.

Pooja attended an event hosted by, CURE Foundation. The event was held to announce the 6th Biennial ‘Cancer Crusaders Invitation Cup’, a golf tournament which was a fund-raiser and awareness initiative to support the child cancer patients.

Pooja praised the organisation for their efforts and made the noble gesture, which would financially strengthen two children’s battle against the illness.

Talking about the cause, Pooja says: “I don’t think this is something that only actors or celebrities should do. It has to come from within.

89,02-2-20,For a lasting peace in Nagaland,"As it is over three months since the October 31 deadline to finalise the Naga Peace Accord failed, the talks between the Centre and National Socialist Council of Nagaland, Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) is shrouded in utter confusion. More so, because there is a trust deficit among the stakeholders, resulting in little progress on the political front. On January 30, NSCN-IM leaders led by Ato Kilonser and chief negotiator Thuingaleng Muivah opened another set of peace talks with Interlocutor and Governor RN Ravi.

However, senior NSCN-IM leader Kehoi has questioned the intent of the Centre, alleging that the Government is misleading the Naga people. In an indirect reaction to threat of resumption of picking up the guns, Governor Ravi, in his Republic Day address, said guns and corruption have taken toll on the Naga people and warned, “I remind them that violence has never succeeded and shall never succeed… In democratic India, the people are supreme. We resolve our differences through peaceful dialogue, not under the shadow of guns.”

Ironically, the concerted bid to bring a lasting peace in Nagaland was one of the first initiatives Narendra Modi took after becoming Prime Minister. The 2015 accord marked a resolution of peace talks between the Government of India and the NSCN-IM that began in 1997. However, the peace talks are yet to be concluded.

The issue of Naga integrity and independence has a chequered past. Its roots go to the medieval period as documented in Tarikh-e-Aasham by Shehabuddin Talesh (one of the Mansabdars of Bengal). Back then, in 1662, members of this ethnic community were employed because of their fighting spirit in the service of the nawab to fight against the Ahom king Jaidhwaj Singha.

Frequent fights took place between the Nagas and the Ahoms in 1530 and 1692 for taxation and sovereignty in which many Assamese subjects were killed.

In the following period, the Ahom Raja Gadadhar Singh took revenge and subdued the Nagas occasionally but could not suppress them in the 17th and 18th centuries as recorded in the Ahom Buranji.

On the other hand, the royal chronicle of Manipur known as Cheitharon Kumpapa mentioned the annexation of the soon-to-be Naga Hills District in 1832-33 by Raja Gambhir Singh, the then king of Manipur, erecting a stone sculpture at Kohima. This event irked the British.

Following the treaty of Yandabo signed in 1826, the Naga Hills District was formed in 1866 by the British Government with its headquarters at Sumuguting. And it became part of British India in 1879-1880. The British administered it from 1881 onwards. First Deputy Commissioner of the Naga Hills Damant, along with his thirty-five escort troops, was murdered in 1879 by the Khonoma warriors because of the unwelcomed administrative initiatives, establishment of police outpost and imposition of a house tax of Rs 2.

Divide and quit

Britishers followed divide and rule in most of its colonies, but, at the time of their exit from the colony, they adopted the strategy of “divide and quit”, (Mohammed Ayoob, The Hindu, November 6, 2019). This was evident from partitioning of Ireland (Catholics and Protestants), India (Hindus and Muslims), and Palestine (Arab Muslims and Jews) in the 20th century.

The identity and politics among the Nagas dates back to the days of establishment of the Naga Club in 1918 by Naga leaders, village officials and French Labour Corps who were First World War veterans with the aim of addressing the social and administrative problems of the villagers.

An unseemly concoction of missionary, education, Christianity, and war-taught political awareness drove some Naga men to submit a memorandum to the famously-and-overwhelmingly-boycotted-by-Indians Simon Commission in Kohima on January 10, 1929 seeking reversion of their political status through “you were the only people who have ever conquered us and, when you go we should be as we were”.

Its outcome was that the Simon Commission recommended the Government of India Act 1935 treating the Naga Hills District as “Excluded Areas”. In April 1945, Sir Charles Pawsey established an institution known as the Naga Hills District Tribal Council that evolved into the Naga National Council (NNC) in 1946 aiming to establish the unity of the Nagas and rejuvenating the community from the sufferings of the Second World War focusing on the establishment of local autonomy within the Province of Assam, and the people’s training for self-Government leading to publication of a newspaper called Naga Nation for a few years.

In this initiative, AZ Phizo, the father figure of the Naga secessionist movement, and other Naga leaders of the NNC took notable roles.

Naga Independence

In 1947, a nine-point memorandum known as Hydari Agreement was signed in which the ninth article read “the Governor of Assam as the Agent of the Government of the Indian Union which would take the special responsibility for a period of ten years to ensure the due observance of the agreement and the NNC should be asked at the end of this period for further extension or the new agreement considering the future of the Naga people”.

This inherently empowered the NNC under Phizo’s leadership to declare “Naga Independence” on August 14, 1947. However, this could not bring substantial changes on the Nagas’ demand of separation from the Indian Union apparently because of a gap in the understanding of the spirit behind the agreement, as felt by GK Pillai, who was in charge of the North-East affairs (1996-2000) and, later oversaw the progress of the peace talk as the Home Secretary of India.

After a plebiscite in 1951 for over six months, 99 per cent of the Nagas sought a referendum which did not materialise. And it was after which they boycotted the General Election of 1952. In 1955, some of the extremists took to arms though the NNC did not approve it at that point of time.

In 1956, the NNC set up the Federal Government of Nagaland represented by a flag which is in use till date. Also, it raised its own army called Naga Safe Guards and another paramilitary by the name Naga Home Guard. Its underground parliament was declared “unlawful associations” under the UAPA 1967 in 1972.

Against the backdrop of this development, what came as a surprise then was that followers of the Naga movement’s involvement in the General Election of 1957. Their three nominated members were elected unopposed and one of them became a Deputy Minister.

Social engineering of the Nagas

Even with centuries-long history, the idea of Naga has remained controversial. For the integration of the Nagas, former four-time CM of Manipur and Parliamentarian Rishang Keishing, a Manipuri Tangkhul Naga with lifelong allegiance to the Indian National Congress, initiated an agreement signed in 1972 between the then United Naga Integration Council (which later gave birth to the NSCN) and the Congress.

This agreement recognised the vision of a Greater Nagalim, a region that would integrate Nagaland and the Naga-populated districts of Manipur under one administration, much to the chagrin of Manipuris.

However, this stand left him in a vulnerable position as he was made to resign from the CM-ship for his support to the Nagas for Nagalim even as he wanted it within the confinement of Indian Constitution.

Secondly, several attempts were made to murder him by the NSCN, led by fellow Tangkhul man Thuingaleng Muivah. His body was even denied a burial place in his hometown of Ukhrul. Similarly, another CM of Manipur Yangmaso Shaiza from the same Tangkhul tribe to which Keishing and Muivah belong was murdered by the Muivah-led NSCN for his opposition to the Greater Nagalim demand outside the purview of the Indian Constitution. SC Jamir, the former three-time CM of Nagaland, Governor of Odisha and a signatory to the 16-point agreement in July 1960 that paved the way for Nagaland creation, recently opined that the Nagas outside Nagaland are indigenous to their own State.

This came as a setback to the current peace process that aims to integrate all the Nagas, close to 89 tribes as of 2015, under one political unit. Pradip Phanjoubam, the acclaimed journalist from Manipur, recently quipped in his piece published in The Hindu that “all notions of unique histories and ancestral homelands will need moderation” against the backdrop of the tumultuous events, competing interests, infighting, multiple factions, fratricide, forced assimilation, identity re-construction/ colonisation, etc, which are common to all armed struggles.

Apparently, the most accepted meaning of the word “Naga” is people, and the imagined nation of the Nagas is an outcome of the voluntary or otherwise integration of multiple “peoples” at least in Manipur through the efforts of the main outfit NSCN (IM) using various non-inclusive means.

The villages in the remote areas of Manipur will never be developed as the existing arrangement of Autonomous District Council has failed to do much for them owing to various reasons, corruption being the major, even though the instrument was created to take development to the last person in the village.

Many of the people in the remote villages still live close to the state of nature which is the main reason why they do not like to be represented, ruled or suppressed by others, including the NSCN (IM).

In the proposed settlement, a time-framed industrialisation and development in 10 years are to be brought about. Will those people evolve to the state of civilisation in 10 years because of pumping in of funds? Has anyone thought about the tenability and cost of such a fast-paced development?

During the program a report about on Prison status in Chhattisgarh was also tabled.

Presenting the report Deenbandhu Vats from Pairavi, an organization working for human rights, said that if a person has to go jail once then for his entire life become suspicious for the society at large.

He advocated for voting right to the prisoner while arguing that if a person can contest election from jail then why can’t the other vote?

Advocate Akash Kundu while presenting the report outlined the fact that jails in Chhattisgarh are overcrowded and short-staffed.

This compels the prisoner to live in inhumane conditions, he asserted.

Advocate Son Singh Jhali from Bastar while sharing his experience said that pending cases in courts, lack of courts, geographical limitations and delaying attitude of police administration is causing the overburden.

Language difference in Bastar is another major issue.

93,02-2-20,Art & city,"Even though the India Art Fair concludes in New Delhi today, there is a lot of art waiting to be explored in the city for the entire month, writes Navneet Mendiratta

Even as curtains come down on the 12th edition of India Art Fair today evening, this year has been extraordinarily special. The fair had as many as 81 exhibitors participating from as many as 20 global cities with cutting edge art on display. In the last two years, the IAF has focussed extensively on building gallery participation, public programming and creating a spotlight on South Asian and Indian art. As Jagdip Jagpal, Fair Director of India Art Fair, shared: “In these two years, we have looked to strengthen the programme to highlight the artists, as well as make a visit to the fair accessible for all ages and abilities.” Modern and contemporary South Asian art remains the focus of the fair, with 70% of the floor space dedicated to Indian galleries, and an esteemed line up of artists not seen in India presented by international galleries, she added.

For a lot of people, visiting Delhi for India Art Fair, there really is a lot to see beyond the fair. Clubbed under IAF Parallel, collateral events programmed by galleries, museums and arts spaces around the city add a festive vibe to the otherwise very individual art scene. Many of these shows continue well into the month, allowing the visitors who are staying back some more time to reflect on the art and interact with the artists. We bring you some of the must visit shows that extend into the month.

You will know me, Art Alive Gallery

You will know me: Migration Stories is about migration and displacement featuring artists from the US, Germany and India and has on display, works by artists including: Ayisha Abraham, Golnar Adili, Tomie Arai, Barbara Beisinghoff, Janet Goldner, Cheryl Goldsleger, Leslie Jean-Bart, Tatana Kellner, Mohammad Omer Khalil, Karen Kunc, Sarojini Lewis, Berette Macaulay, Lavanya Mani, Larry Millard, Veer Munshi, Roger Rigorth, Tara Sabharwal, Ritu Sarin & Tenzing Sonam.

“Tara started working on this project about two years ago and from then to now a lot of change has happened in the world around us, with the statistics numbers only going up. For us, the show has grown as the migration crisis has grown and intensified. I find this issue compelling and wanted to stand with the artists who are coming together and trying to draw attention to this urgent issue and instigate a dialogue,” says Sunaina Anand, Director, Art Alive Gallery. The show is on till February 10.

Bhoomi and Bhurukuwa : A two-part show by Shambhavi, Gallery Espace and Shrine Empire Gallery

For the first time, Shambhavi is presenting a two-part solo showcase at Gallery Espace and Shrine Empire Gallery as part of IAF parallels. Her earlier series Maati Ma was on view at the 2018 Kochi Muzuris Biennale, curated by Anita Dube.

Drawing inspiration from her roots in rural Bihar, Shambhavi’s work explores the relationship between man and nature, specifically focusing on the connection between the farmers, field and their ceaseless struggles. Bhoomi at Gallery Espace features a collection of her signature paintings and large-format installations in iron, that are primarily abstract and aim to intuitively foster a sense of nostalgia for a way of life that most of us no longer remember.

From metal to paper pulp, she extends her story to depict dawn or Bhurukuwa in part two of her show at Shrine Empire Gallery where she explores the subtle interplay between man, nature and art in varied textures. Shambhavi brings to life the textures, colours and forms of rural life: whether in the mud-and-hay textured walls of their houses or the grey mist that rises from the field on winter mornings. The show at Gallery Espace is on till February 24 and at Shrine Empire Gallery till February 28.

Stammer in the Shadow by Atul Dodiya, Vadehra Art Gallery

Atul Dodiya’s Stammer in the Shade is a presentation of his world-renowned shutters along his consistently evolving romance with the solitary figure and landscape in his canvases. These shrines include some of his photographs of paintings by the great masters, made during his travels around the world. These photographs form not the entire painting but a portion of the work. Darshan, or epiphany, is an implied experience here, as the viewer waits to see what the shutter will reveal when it rises, except that the darshan has already been granted. The show is on till February 29.

Soma by Ravinder Reddy, Vadehra Art Gallery

Famous for his gilded female heads that take inspiration from ancient temple idolisations while channeling the bold spirit of the contemporary woman, in this exhibition of nude sculptures, Ravinder Reddy turns to the undraped body with a similar intent. In doing so, he undertakes an intricate exploration of the body, which for decades has not been considered important or appropriate as a subject of study in the Indian cultural context. Reddy’s dalliance with the nude form began in 1979, and Soma includes his consistent and controversial portrayals from the eighties up to the present, giving viewers the opportunity to track the artist’s developing oeuvre in response to ever changing climes and contexts over the years. The show is on till February 29.

Memory’s cut; Its Deep Embrace by Remen Chopra W. Van Der Vaart, Gujral Foundation

In collaboration with Outset India, this exhibition is a personal account of the artist’s journey of migration. Using personal objects to punctuate the exhibition, Vaart delves into the history of personal spaces and its memory using writings, maps, objects, poetry and sculptural works to respond to the emotion and idea of home.

‘The exhibition is a poignant chronicle of the artist’s life that interweaves personal archives, notions of home and memory. Her work is a unique assemblage of intimate moments, poetry and personal objects that were passed on from one generation to the other.’ says Reha Sodhi, Curatorial Advisor, about Vaart’s works. The show is on till February 24.

Materiology 2.0, STIR Gallery

This is the second show of Stir’s Materiology series, curated by Pramiti Madhavji and Amit Gupta. Cutting across disciplines, the show brings installations by some of the leading designers including Paola Navone, Sumant Jayakrishnan, Matteo Cibic, Rooshad Shroff, Samira Rathod, Manish Maheshwari, Sandeep Sangaru, Soumitro Ghosh, Hanif Kureshi, Shiva Nellaperumal, Banduksmith Studio and Ankon Mitra. Through installation art and design, these designers highlight a simple, productive things that we did in the past, that were educational, made us think and learn, that have now taken a new avatar. The show is on till February 22.

The Exodus of Eternal Wanderers by Sudipta Das, Gallery Latitude 28

Through collections and assemblages of her now-iconic doll-like paper sculptures, Sudipta Das dives into personal history and family narratives to explore themes of exile, refuge and temporariness of life. Meticulously crafted from layers and layers of handmade Hanji paper, her chosen medium is fragile, yet resistant. An unsuspecting medium, paper has long been a hidden protagonist in the narratives of placelessness. Without paper, one has no form of identification. Without identification, one loses the freedom to move from place to place. One loses their proof of belonging.

“Das’ work presents melancholic verse of individuals who have lost their roots, but still, for a time, have each other, raised above their homes and the places they hold dear, as if on the tide of a flood, to be deposited ... somewhere else,” says Bhavna Kakar, Director of Gallery Latitude 28. The show is on till February 28.

The Hand Painted Textile by Ajit Kumar Das, Gallery Art.Motif

Gallery Art.Motif presents hand-painted textiles made using natural dyes and the kalam by the master artist Ajit Kumar Das. In his work spanning four decades, Das picks up strands from diverse repertoires, simultaneously however, evolving a distinct vocabulary quite his own. His works have been a part of the Vishwakarma exhibitions curated by the late heritage conservationist Martand Singh, and are in important textile collections around the world, including the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The show is on till February 15.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/art---city-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/art---city.html
94,02-2-20,"If we resolve, we can change","My secretary ushered in a seemingly gangster character to my chamber, making me wonder what he had come for. “How can I help you?” I asked. “Sir, I have come for an astrological consultation. I don’t have my actual birth time. It is somewhere between 13.30 to 14.00 hrs. Your secretary tells me that you need to figure out the exact time of birth, before she can draw my chart,” the man replied.

Having ascertained his particulars, I made a ruling planet chart at that particular moment. Based on that, I fixed his time of birth at 13.29 hrs. “How could you arrive at my exact time of birth so quickly? And how authentic is that?” asked the young man. “My friend, there remains continuum in time. Remember, what you encounter this particular moment is the culmination of the doings in the past. And this moment carries the seeds of how things are expected to evolve in future. Going by this gnosis, the ruling planets at the moment of consultation should match the one at the time of your birth. This is the premise on which the Krishnamurty system of astrology rectifies time of one’s birth. We then try to cross check whether the chart drawn reflects major happenings in the past. This is a well proven method.

Based on observations of the chart drawn at the corrected time of his birth, I then asked him a few questions: Are you eccentric by nature? Do you have a fixated one-track mind, often stuck to your own perceptions, no matter how delusionary or realistic it might be? On slightest provocation, do you get into fighting mode? Did you leave your education unfinished? Have you been ever associated with criminal activity? You are highly egotistical, not open to look beyond your own perceptions? Have you ever been to jail? “Yes, that’s all true. But I have since changed myself, and now single pointedly pursue my business,” he answered. I, then, asked him time bound questions? How good or bad was close to your 22nd year? What good initiative you took at the age of 26-27? “Sir, 21st and 22nd years were horrible. During the 26th year, I formed an all India organisation, and a year later I took business initiative,” the man responded.

So, his chart reflected with precision not only his inherent personality traits but also important happenings in the past stood true to the callings of the timeline arrived out from the chart. Let us now look at the astrological pointers to above. The Sun placed adverse to Uranus speaks of his eccentric nature; to Neptune makes him stuck to his delusionary perceptions; and to Jupiter reflects his inflated ego. The lagna lord and the mind signifying Moon though exalted but occupying the nakshatra owned by the Sun, too, resonates latter’s traits. Mercury placed adverse to Saturn accounts for fixated one-track mind. Saturn and Mars are together, with latter conjunct erratic Rahu. Both Mars and Rahu occupy the nakshatra owned by Moon, the lagna lord. That makes him temperamental, irritable, haughty, intolerant and impatient. Also, it makes him susceptible to criminal association. 12th sub-lord Venus occupies the nakshatra owned by Mars, which is conjunct Rahu. Association of the 12th cusp to Rahu makes one vulnerable to imprisonment. 4th house marked with formal education seems to be clouded, being the reason for his incomplete education. For, in the first place, 4th lord Venus is ill-disposed off to the Sun. Second, the 4th cusp sub-lord Mercury occupying its own nakshatra, happens to be the 3rd lord, which being 12th from 4th serves as contra-indicative to education prospects.

Now about the events, during 21-22nd year, the 10th cusp would have progressed close to natal Moon, which being ill-disposed to mischievous Neptune, had put him under great strain. The natal Sun being 26 degrees behind the 10th cusp, would progress at that age on latter’s axis, is how he could establish an all India organisation and took business initiative. All these vindicate efficacy of the system put to use.

The question now is, despite all negative traits, what brought about positive change in him. Wisdom oriented Jupiter occupying intelligence signifying Mercury owned sign, made him self-reflect and take corrective steps. Remember, ego, which would be otherwise limiting, if given a positive turn can prove equally rewarding. Also, bear in mind; human beings enjoy the exclusive privilege to guide their actions by choice and discrimination. So, once someone makes a conscientious choice to reform oneself, he can transcend all odds.

95,02-2-20,Time to give Vidya its due,"Basant Panchami is dedicated to Devi Saraswati, the Goddess of vidya. Learning, says ancient wisdom, is of two types: vidya and avidya, writes Acharya Prashant

anyadevahurvidyaya anyadahuravidyaya |

iti susruma dhiranam yenastadvicacaksire ||

(Isha-Upanishad, Verse 10)

‘One result they say is obtained by vidya, and another result, they say, is obtained by avidya, thus have we heard from the wise ones who explained it to us.’

The knowledge in the fields of science, arts, politics, economics, social sciences — all the university disciplines — is called avidya. In that sense, any knowledge about whatever can be found within the world is avidya. Using our senses and mind, when we look outwards into the world, and gather information and build knowledge, that is avidya. Avidya is also called aparavidya, or lower learning.

When we turn inwards and look at ourselves, we see the self, the ego, glimpses of the entire structure and movement of the personality. This self is the seer, observer, of the world. This knowledge, this perception of the self, is called vidya. Vidya is also called paravidya, or higher learning. How is vidya different from Psychology? Vidya encompasses not merely the study of the inner self — the ego — but also addresses the mystical cravings of the ego for spiritual liberation.

In our education system, vidya must be given importance so that the child, the student, must get to know about his mind. Who is he and what relation does he carry with the world? He must be introduced to this fundamental question in the most creative of ways. He must know why he runs towards the world, relates with the world, and wants to achieve something in the world.

Avidya is that which keeps filling up the mind with knowledge about the world, about this and that. One pernicious result of avidya is that one starts identifying with only the material world, and engenders a lot of suffering for himself and the others. Today, across the world, we can see the toxic results of an overdose of avidya at the cost of vidya. Man knows much about the material universe today, but too little about himself. Under the circumstances, vidya, also referred to as education of the self, is a thousand times more valuable than the rest of our education put together.

Know both Vidya and Avidya Together

vidyam cavidyam ca yastadvedobhya saha |

avidyaya mrtyum tirtva’mrtamasnute ||

(Isha-Upanishad, Verse 11)

‘He, who knows both vidya and avidya together, overcomes death through avidya and experiences immortality by means of vidya.’

Due to our limited sensory experience and the failings of our education, we keep feeling and asserting that the existence of the universe is totally independent of our existence. We say, “We come and go, the world remains”, and so it is a common tendency to take the universe as an objective thing totally independent of the subject that we are. Therefore, we believe we can change something in the universe without fundamentally changing anything in us. We think avidya suffices in helping us, in improving us, in giving us a better life, even if we do not have vidya. So, our belief is that something can be bettered ‘out there’ without bettering anything ‘in here’. And that is how mankind has largely proceeded — wanting to improve things outside, it keeps disregarding what is happening inside. We don’t seem to realise that the world out there is the same as, is dependent on, and is organically linked to, what is within us. This has led to a disregard of, rather contempt of, vidya.

The scriptures say: ‘only when you know vidya and avidya together, then you have known something.’ This is of utmost importance for both — the seekers of material good, and the seekers of spiritual attainment. The materialist has to drop the notion that real material success can be attained without spiritual realisation. And the spiritualist had to drop the notion that spiritual progress is devoid of all materiality. The spiritual and material must walk hand in hand. One’s material life must be in honest agreement with one’s spiritual journey. These inner and the outer must be together. And when these two are together, the Upanishad says, that one verily conquers all fears and attains a timeless eternality.

We must realise why both avidya and vidya were considered important. We must also reflect on why vidya is called higher learning. This reflection will help us see the hidden root of the various catastrophic challenges facing us today — be it Climate Change, extinction of species, sectarianism, blind self-destructive consumerism, or the epidemic onslaught of mental disease. We will see that a lot of these are self-created problems rising from a neglect of vidya or spirituality.

Let us give vidya its due. Let us invest more of our attention, time and resources towards spiritual learning. Let the study of the highest philosophies like Vedanta be institutionalised, let the beautiful songs of the saints enter mainstream culture. Let the young and old alike discover the higher dimension of life. That alone can save us, and that alone would be a real celebration of Basant Panchami.

96,02-2-20,To connect is the key,"In part two of the ‘Cosmic heirloom’ series, Sumiran Annamaria Kashyap tells the readers how to establish the relationship of a lifetime with their crystals

It’s not just you looking for crystals. Sometimes, they’re looking for you. You might say, “I don’t think so much. I pick up a crystal because I think it looks pretty.” That’s perfectly fair and true! Whatever makes that crystal unique is probably within you too, which is why you’re able to recognise it. Indeed, every relationship with a crystal is not always about replenishment. It’s about nourishing and celebrating what’s already there, too.

This ‘piecing together’ that takes place at the time of the first encounter, is the beginning of the relationship. It includes the time you decide to look up the benefits of crystals, to pick the one(s) you want (need?). You can take advice from seasoned crystal workers; or more experienced family and friends. They’d also direct you to authentic sources to procure your crystals. As could your family jeweller, really!

I personally stay away from direct purchases online. Some of them may be undoubtedly genuine, but I prefer the reassuring energetic exchange with people who have made crystal therapy of any kind a lifestyle choice themselves.

Bringing your crystal home

It’s good to ‘clear the air’ so that a new crystal accommodates itself to the vibrations of your home easily — and to those of other crystals, if you’ve got them. As such, crystals are always excited to welcome one of their own. But being responsive entities, they can take on each other’s qualities. Clearing the air, by burning incense/loban, smudging sticks, or essential oil in a diffuser every time a new crystal ‘joins the ranks,’ ensures a fresh start. Later, you can figure if your new crystal needs to be able to hold its own, or if it can ‘live’ with another that has similar qualities.

The Raw v/s Tumbled Debate

Some people prefer to work with uncut, unpolished crystals because their raw energy is desired for its potency. Tumbled crystals — smaller, rounder and polished — are certainly easier to carry around and often what people opt for when new to crystals. Both kinds work in their own ways. Personally, I use larger, raw pieces for the house, smaller raw pieces for meditation and self-work; and I carry tumbled pieces like talismans in my pocket, or bag.

Storing crystals

It’s worth the effort to procure a proper wooden box, with compartments, depending on the number and size of crystals you own. Each one, or each ‘set’ of complementary crystals, can also have its own convenient drawstring pouch — cotton/muslin is a great material for this. Additionally, your crystal vendor should be able to give you these small, ring-like bases to prop your crystals on when you’re using them. They’re convenient, especially if the crystals are ball-like in shape.

You need to charge your crystals from time to time. Charging enhances the efficacy of crystals. But, it’s about basic respect, not just about making the stones work like machines. Even if you’re not using your crystals, charging them once every 7-10 days, especially during significant lunar phases, is a good way to make them feel at home with you. If you ever feel your crystals aren’t responding, maybe they’re feeling neglected. I will share the methods to recharge your crystals in the next column.

You don’t need to have a checklist of crystals to tick off from. It’s not a competition with other collectors . Above all, please don’t succumb to the ‘holier-than-thou’ trap! I’m often asked, “how will I know if my crystals are working?” My answer is, keep working and your crystals will work with and for you. Respect them. Be still in their presence. Everything will unravel from there.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier in the day said the insurance behemoth will be listed as part of the government's disinvestment initiative.

The Centre proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC through initial public offer, she said, while unveiling the Union Budget 2020-21.

""I am shocked and appalled to see how the central government plans to ambush the heritage and legacy of public institutions. It's the end of sense of security. Is it also an end of an era?"" the CM said in a tweet.

104,02-2-20,"Budget does injustice to Maha, Mumbai: Uddhav","Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said here on Saturday that the Union Budget for 2020-21 had done “injustice” to Mumbai and Maharashtra, which were considered twin engines for the country’s development, and had merely sold dreams to the Youth, farmers and common man.

Slamming Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman for her budget for 2020-21, Uddhav said: “The Union budget has done injustice to Mumbai and Maharashtra. The budget does not seem to have anything for Mumbai in terms of funds for the infrastructure projects like Metro. Nor has it made any allocated for the development of the sub-urban railway lines, considered the lifelines for Mumbaikars”.

“In 2030, India will become the youngest nation in the world. But, the Finance Minister has not created any concrete avenues for creation for jobs for the youths. Though there is a possibility of creation of a large number of jobs, the minister has made very little allocation for the development of tourism,” the chief minister said.

“The Centre’s decision to sell its stakes in IDBI, LIC and privatise Railways reflects the sad state fiscal situation in the country,” Uddhav said.

“The budget has not made adequate allocation for the child welfare. Nor has the Centre bothered much about the welfare of senior citizens and specially-abled people in the country,” the chief minister said.

NCP president Sharad Pawar made no bones about his displeasure over the Union budget which, he said, lacked vision and clarity on doubling farmers’ income. “Budget focuses on Agriculture Warehousing but lacks vision and clarity on Doubling Farmers' income. It is still a distant dream,” Pawar tweeted.

“Automobile sector has been completely ignored and unemployment issue is not addressed fairly. It was the lengthiest speech but lacked farsightedness and direction,” the NCP chief said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/budget-does-injustice-to-maha--mumbai--uddhav.html

As per Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government will encourage external commercial borrowings and FDI in the education sector for financing infrastructure. “It is felt that our education system needs a greater inflow of finance to attract talented teachers, innovate and build better labs. Therefore, steps would be taken to enable sourcing of external commercial borrowings and foreign direct investment so as to be able to deliver higher-quality education,” she said in the budget speech. The Centre also added another amount of Rs 3,000 crore for skill development.

She added that the new national education policy will be announced soon. “By 2030, India is set to have the largest working-age population in the world. Not only do they need literacy, but they need both jobs and life skills. Dialogues have been held with state education ministries, MPs and other stakeholders about the education policy. Over two lakh suggestions were received. The new education policy will be announced soon,” the finance minister said.

In order to boost employability of general stream students, about 150 higher educational institutions will start apprenticeship-embedded degrees or diploma courses by March 2021. Similarly, for the students of technology streams, the government has proposed to start a programme whereby urban local bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to fresh engineers for a period of up to one year.

“In order to provide quality education to the students of the deprived section of the society as well as those who do not have access to higher education, it is proposed to start a degree-level, full-fledged online education programme. This shall be offered only by institutions who are ranked within top 100 in the National Institutional Ranking framework. Initially, only a few such institutions would be asked to offer such programmes,” Sitharaman said.

With an aim to boost the “Study in India” programme, the government has proposed to hold Ind-SAT in Asian and African countries. It shall be used for benchmarking foreign candidates who receive scholarships for studying in Indian higher education centres.

HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ expressed his gratitude to Finance Minister for giving priority to education sector and allocating Rs 99,300 crore for Education.

106,02-2-20,Mega boost to revive farm sector,"From solarising pumping sets, encouraging usage of traditional and organic fertilisers to special rail and flights service for the transportation of farm produce for doubling the farmers’ income by 2022 and reviving the farm sector, the Union Budget 2020-21 proposed 11 per cent increase in the farm credit target to 15 lakh crore for 2020-21.

A fund of Rs 1.60 lakh crore has been allocated for the Agriculture sector in the new budget. It has also proposed to promote ‘one product one district’ for better marketing and export of horticulture crops. It also called on states for early implementation of three key central model laws on land leasing, agriculture produce and livestock marketing and contract farming.

Announcing a 16-point programme for agriculture and rural development sector in the Union Budget presented in the Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday more than Rs 2.83 lakh crore would be spent on Agriculture, Rural Development, Irrigation and allied activities as farmers and rural poor continue to remain the key focus of the Government.

To provide better access to bank credit, the Union Budget proposed raising the target for disbursing agriculture credit to Rs 15 lakh crore for the 2020-21 fiscal from the current target of Rs 13.5 lakh crore. Normally, farm loans attract an interest rate of 9 per cent. But the Government is providing 2 per cent interest subsidy to ensure farmers get short-term farm loan of up to Rs 3 lakh at an effective rate of 7 per cent per annum. Since Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs)and cooperatives are active in the agriculture credit space, Sitharaman said the NABARD re-finance scheme will be further expanded.

To improve marketing, Sitharaman announced that the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail” — through public private partership (PPP) arrangements — to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish. There would be refrigerated coaches in Express and Freight trains as well. ‘Krishi Udaan’ will be launched by the Civil Aviation Ministry on international and national routes. This will immensely help improve value realisation especially in North-East and tribal districts, she added. As water stress related issues are now a serious concern across the country, Sitharaman said, “Our government is proposing comprehensive measures for 100 water stressed districts.”

In the previous fiscal year, the government had allocated Rs 1.3 lakh crore for agriculture and Rs 1.20 crore for rural development. The current budget allocates Rs 1.60 lakh crore agriculture and allied activities, and Rs 1.23 lakh crore for irrigation and rural development. The 2020 budget has increased allocation to the farming sector by Rs 35,000 crore.

According to the budget document, the government has proposed a lower allocation of Rs 54,370.15 crore for PM-Kisan scheme this fiscal, as against the budget projection of Rs 75,000 crore because of implementation hurdles in some states. Despite lower outgo on the PM-Kisan scheme — under which Rs 6,000 is being provided to eligible farmers per year in three equal instalments, the government has kept the budget estimate for the next fiscal at the same level of Rs 75,000 crore.

To libersalise agri-market, she urged the State Governments to undertake implementation of three central model laws — Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017; and Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.

The Budget also proposed to expand PM-KUSUM to provide 20 lakh farmers for setting up stand-alone solar pumps and for another 15 lakh farmers to solarise their grid-connected pump sets, setting up of efficient warehouses at the block/taluk level. “Solar power generation on barren lands and would be operationalised. Farmers who have barren land can send the power to the grid. They will be able to make a living out of it,” Sitharaman said.

The government also proposed including all kinds of fertilisers, including traditional and organic types, as the prevailing regime encourages excessive use of chemical fertiliser.

“All beneficiaries of the PM Kisan Yojana will be covered under the Kisan Credit Card scheme. The focus will be on developing fodder farms and doubling of milk production from 55.8 million metric tonnes to 108 million metric tonnes by 2025,” Sitharaman said.

The Budget also proposes cultivation of cluster products, where each district would focus on one cultivating in order to boost the horticulture sector. The budget also encourages zero budget natural farming and online national organic products market.

The budget proposed boosting the ‘blue economy’ for the development and management of marine fisheries. The Budget proposed setting up of youth-run ‘sagar mitra’ centres and 500 fish farmer producer organisations to encourage the cultivation of algae and seaweed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mega-boost-to-revive-farm-sector.html

“However, since then I have received several references that this levy has put additional burden on print media at a time when it is going through a difficult phase.

The additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh over and above Rs 2 lakh was introduced in last year’s budget. This was allowed for those buying homes for the first time and of up to Rs 45 lakh and made applicable for home loans sanctioned till March this year. Besides, the Budget also proposed the setting up of five new Smart Cities. However, she didn’t make any mention of the Budgetary allocation.

Presenting the Budget 2020-21 in the parliament, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday also announced that builders will get tax holiday on affordable housing projects approved till March 2021.

“For realisation of the goal of ‘Housing for All’ and affordable housing, in the last budget I had announced an additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans taken for purchase of an affordable house. The deduction was allowed on housing loans sanctioned on or before March 31, 2020.

“In order to ensure that more persons avail this benefit and to further incentivise the affordable housing, I propose to extend the date of loan sanction for availing this additional deduction by one more year,” the Minister said.

The additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh, over and above the existing Rs 2 lakh, is being provided under the Section 80EEA.

The real estate industry, which is facing a huge demand slowdown and sluggish housing sales, had sought extension of this additional deduction, but wanted the price cap of Rs 45 lakh to be enhanced.

“Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in real estate, if the consideration value is less than circle rate by more than 5 per cent, the difference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and seller. In order to minimise hardship in real estate transaction and provide relief to the sector, I propose to increase the limit of 5 per cent to 10 per cent,” she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tax-holiday-extended-for-builders.html

The Budget fixed Rs 85,000 crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and other backward classes (OBCs), and Rs 53,700 crore for scheduled tribes in the next fiscal.

The land so vacated can be put to alternative use,” she said detailing the government’s plan for environment and climate change.

The National Clean Air Action Plan aims to focus on 102 non-attainment cities with consistent poor air quality than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. “It is a big jump(allocation of Rs 4,400 crore), in terms of financial support,” said Anumita Rowchowdury, from Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), “but, we now need a clear template on how government plans to get all sectors to collaborate to achieve a real reduction in emissions and monitor implementation at various levels.”

Soon after Sitharaman unveiled the Union Budget for 2020-21 in Parliament woven around the themes of aspirational India, and economic development for all and caring society, India Inc took to Twitter to share views on the announcements. The Finance Minister proposed new slabs and reduced tax rates under them for an individual income of up to Rs 15 lakh per annum, if a taxpayer opts for foregoing exemptions and deductions.

She also proposed to remove dividend distribution tax on companies, and henceforth the tax will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

118,02-2-20,Govt removes DDT,"The Government on Saturday proposed to remove dividend distribution tax on companies, and henceforth the tax will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while unveiling the Union Budget said the proposal would make India more attractive market for investment. “This is another bold move, which will further make India an attractive destination for investment,” she said, adding it would result in a revenue sacrifice of Rs 25,000 crore per annum.

Currently, companies are required to pay dividend distribution tax (DDT) on the dividend paid to its shareholders at the rate of 15 per cent plus applicable surcharge and cess, in addition to the tax payable by the company on its profits.

“In order to increase the attractiveness of the Indian equity market and to provide relief to a large class of investors, I propose to remove the DDT and adopt the classical system of dividend taxation under which the companies would not be required to pay DDT.

“The dividend shall be taxed only in the hands of the recipients at their applicable rate,” she said.

The system of levying DDT, she said, results in increased tax burden for investors and especially those who are liable to pay tax less than the rate of DDT, if the dividend is included in their income.

Further, non-availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign investors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return on equity capital for them, she noted.

“Further, in order to remove the cascading effect, I also propose to allow deduction for the dividend received by holding company from its subsidiary. The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of Rs 25,000 crore,” the Minister said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-removes-ddt-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-removes-ddt.html

BJP president JP Nadda welcomed the Budget as “visionary, futuristic, growth oriented, transformative and all-inclusive” and said it will ensure development of all sections of society.

He said the Budget gives impetus to fulfilment of aspirations of the middle income groups with focus on home for all by giving subsidy to first time buyers and announcing relaxation in income tax. The BJP chief praised Budget’s emphasis on the development of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

“Inspired by the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, the Central Budget 2020 is a significant step in the strengthening the efforts towards a new and developed India. My heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Finance Minister for this transformative and holistic Budget,” Nadda tweeted.

The BJP president said Modi has ensured all-round development of all sections of society and Budget 2020 is a testimony of his vision for “New India”.

Union Minister of Commerce & Industry Piyush Goyal who had also presented Union Budget in the past praised part disinvestment in the PSU behemoth Life Insurance Company saying the step would increase transparency and accountability.

“If a small part of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) goes to the public it will increase transparency & accountability, after all it is public’s property, I don’t think there is any harm if a small part of it is with the people,” he said.

On stock market’s response to Budget, Goyal said there are some specific sectors in the stock market that carry a lot of weightage, for example, we have increased tax on cigarettes, so ITC’s stocks have weakened a bit, he said.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh hailed the Union Budget for 2020-21, saying it will revive growth and rejuvenate demand in the economy.

Rajnath said the Budget is not only investment friendly but it will go a long way in doubling farmers’ income and unshackling Indian industries.

“The first Budget of the new decade presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gives an outline of a new and confident India. It is a promising, proactive and progressive Budget which will make India healthy and wealthy in coming years,” the Defence Minister said.

“The new tax reforms introduced in the Budget this year are extremely progressive, bold and unprecedented in nature. The new tax regime will reduce tax burden on common man. It will pave the way for an efficient tax system, in sync with the best practises in the world,” he added.

The Defence Minister also complimented Sitharaman for proposing policy intervention in areas like new technologies, saying investments in these sectors will build a strong foundation for a new India based on knowledge driven economy.

He said the Budget proposals have emphatically laid a foundation to achieve the goal of USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25.

Ridiculing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s disapproval of the Budget-20-21 and welcoming budget proposals, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, “A person who is hollow himself, will find everything hollow. I request Rahul Gandhi to educate himself, stay in the country, learn about it and have a positive mindset. Then he will be able to contribute to the country as Opposition”.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari asserted that the Budget will boost growth while Union Minister Prakash Javadekar described the budget as “most pragmatic” at a time when the world economy is facing headwinds.

India has not only managed a “good growth rate” but is also marching towards a better rate, he said, adding that the budget will usher in all-round development, he said.

121,02-2-20,Budget disappointing: KCR,"The Union Budget proposals are 'totally disappointing' and the Centre has shown discrimination towards Telangana by imposing substantial cuts in funds to be released to the state, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said here on Saturday.

He said the Centres allocations in the budget may have an adverse impact on the development of Telangana, ""which is a progressive state.""

Rao said it was 'atrocious' that the Centre had reduced the ratio of the State in central taxes and added that there was a danger of funds scarcity for many welfare and development programmes due to the 'heavy cuts' in the Central funds, an official release quoted him as saying.

Rao observed that it was the Constitutional right of every state to have a share in the Central taxes, he said Rs 19,718 crore was due from the Centre to the Telangana in the 2019-20 fiscal .

In the last Budget, the Centre had announced that this amount would be paid toTelangana. But in the revised estimates, it was reduced to Rs 15,987 crore, he alleged.

As the state anticipated getting Rs 19,718 crore, the reduction led to the states financial planning going awry, he said.

The share of states in funds are to be released after collection of taxes and the funds are released according to the proposals declared in the budget, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/budget-disappointing--kcr.html

All the legitimate needs of the southern state were completely ignored in the budget,presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, though Kerala had submitted a detailed memorandum on its long pending demands, Vijayan said.

Kerala had put forward a slew of demands, including the Angamali-Sabari railway line, raising rubber subsidy, granting of AIIMS, accelerating the development of national highways, increasing the number of attaches in embassies in the Gulf countries, rehabilitation of expatriates and so on, he said in a statement.

It was only last month that Kerala had been denied deserved natural disaster relief though it was one of the worst flood hit states in recent times, the Left veteran said.

In the case of Kerala, the same ""political mindset"" was reflected in the budget also, he said.

The budget, which comprises proposals to sell more Public Sector Undertakings, has not provided enough funds for the survival of PSUs like the Cochin Shipyard and Kochi refinery in the state, Vijayan said.

“Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilise prices of essential food items..Government is also implementing PSF to help moderate volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato,” said the Union Budget 2020-21 presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament.

Onion prices started to flare up from August 2019 onwards peaking to about Rs 150-200 a kg due to unseasonal rains which disrupted supplies from key producing regions such as Maharahstra and Karnataka.

Prices of tomato too hovered in the range of Rs 60-80 a kg while potato sold for Rs 30 per kg towards the end of 2019. Pulses also turned costlier due to a fall in acreage resulting from rains in the growing states and low price realisation due to glut in market following increased production of earlier years.

The consumer price index-based retail inflation spiked to over five-year high of 7.35 per cent in December 2019.

The Government said it resorted to trade and fiscal policy instruments like import duty, minimum export price, export restrictions, imposition of stock limits besides advising states for effective action against hoarders and black marketers to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices.

CPI or the retail inflation averaged 4.1 per cent in during April-December period of the current fiscal, while it had declined to 3.4 per cent in 2018-19 from 3.6 per cent in 2017-18. It was at 4.5 per cent in 2016-17.

125,02-2-20,Captains of industry welcome Budget,"Captains of various sectors of industry on Saturday welcomed the Union budget and provided suggestions to the Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman.

President of Tirupur Exporters’ Association Raja M Shanmugham termed the budget as a people-oriented one.

Appreciating the focus on agriculture and farmers welfare, wellness and education and skills, Shanmugham, in a statement, said the measures announced in the budget would help overall development of economy. He said the allocation of Rs 100 lakh crore for investment in infrastructure would lead to cut in logistics cost.

“As of now, poor logistics is one of the hindrance factors for attaining the export competitiveness by our units,” he said. Welcoming the proposal of setting up a National Technical Textile mission at an outlay of Rs 1,480 crore, he said it would boost the manufacturing of technical textiles in the country, he said.

The fund allocation for the Amended Textile Upgradation fund was only Rs 761.90 crore when the pending claims to the industry is to the tune of Rs 8,500 crore, he said and added that this would not attract the industry to go for modernisation.

Shanmugham expressed hope the government would consider and address the issue.

Convenor (economic affairs and taxation panel), Coimbatore Zone CII G Karthikeyan said the budget was presented with a recessionary phase in the background and hoped that there would be some big ticket reforms and tax cuts. It is a welcome move that all-round allocations made in health care, renewable energy, education, technology-related advancements would not only benefit society at large but also help in pushing aggregate demand.

“We need to wait and see whether these will suffice in ...Spurring growth,” Karhikeyan said. A long standing demand of increasing deposit insurance of banks has been met with the limit per deposit increasing from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, he said.

It is a good move to see that start-up ESOPs (employee stock ownership plan) have been tax-deferred and it remains to be seen whether these measures would push demand, consumption, and private investment and help the economy turn around, he said.

Head (treasury) of Lakshmi Vilas Bank RK Gurumurthy said tinkering with the personal tax and some structural changes in the way DDT (dividend distribution tax) would work are cosmetic benefits that the small and medium investor will like.

The worry is that there was no specific mention of bank recapitalisation, which when read with RBIs Financial Stability Report that NPLs (non-performing loans) could still haunt banks, could raise concern and cripple the ability of banks to lend, he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/captains-of-industry-welcome-budget.html
126,02-2-20,Budget lacks immediate measures to revive ailing sector: Auto industry,"Automobile industry on Saturday said the Budget 2020-21 lacked measures to revive the sector which has been going through a prolonged slowdown.

The industry, however, lauded the government’s initiative to increase customs duty on imported electric vehicles and said it would help in establishing local production of such products in the country.

“The Indian automobile industry was looking forward to some direct benefits in the budget, which could have helped in reviving demand in the context of the current slowdown and huge investments made by the industry for transition to BS-VI and from that aspect, the Budget speech was not what we were expecting,” SIAM President Rajan Wadhera said in a statement. SIAM had made specific recommendations on steps that could have revived demand, like an incentive-based vehicle scrappage scheme; budget allocation for diesel buses procurement by STUs and zero customs duty for lithium-ion batteries, which do not seem to have been considered, he added.

Automobile dealers’ body FADA said the Budget lacked immediate demand boosters for the automobile industry.

“It was disappointing that as part of auto ecosystem, no direct benefits for the automobile industry were announced. Budget allocation for an attractive incentive-based scrappage policy would have been a demand booster for commercial vehicles,” FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said.

Even though GST is not a part of the Budget, an indication about rationalisation of rates for automobiles would have brought much respite for the industry, he added.

Auto component body ACMA, however, expressed satisfaction on the measures announced in the Budget especially the focus on development of rural economy, manufacturing and infrastructure.

127,02-2-20,Opp slams Budget,"Opposition parties slammed the Modi Government’s second Budget of its second tenure saying the BJP led NDA regime has failed to meet mass aspirations of creating employment and in a nutshell it has also given up on reviving the economy and accelerating growth.

While Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said there was no strategic idea or anything concrete in the Union Budget and it described the “hollow” approach of the Government that was “all talk and nothing happening”, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the Modi Government is in complete denial that the economy faces a “grave macro-economic challenge”. The Left parties said the Budget consisted of just “platitudes” and did not address the problems faced by the people.

Talking to reporters outside Parliament soon after the presentation of the budget, Rahul described it as repetitive, saying the budget does not address the main issue of unemployment confronting the country’s youth and the poor state of the economy.

“The main issues confronting this country today are unemployment and the situation as far as the economy is concerned. I did not see any concrete idea, any strategic idea that would help our youngsters get jobs. I saw a lot of tactical stuff, redundant things, I did not see any central idea,” the former Congress chief said.

“The speech was over 2.5 hours long and I did not find any strategic thing in it. The main issue is employment and economy. There is redundancy and income tax has been complicated instead. The Government’s approach is visible in this budget. It did not have anything in it. It was hollow,” he said and later tweeted the Prime Minister and Finance Minister both looked like they have absolutely no clue what to do next.

Addressing a Press conference at Congress headquarters, Chidambaram said there is nothing in the Budget that leads one to believe that growth will revive in 2020-21 and the claim of 6 to 6.5 per cent growth next year is “astonishing and even irresponsible”, the former finance minister said at a press conference.

The former Finance Minister said Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved, and the incumbent Finance Minister has not acknowledged these two challenges. “It was a laundry list of old (that is current) programmes. I am pretty certain that even the most loyal BJP MP or supporter cannot latch on to any idea or statement in the Budget speech and take it to the people,” Chidambaram said.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said it did nothing to alleviate “people’s miseries”. “Just platitudes & slogans. Nothing substantial to alleviate peoples’ misery, the growing unemployment, rural wage crash, farmers’ distress suicides and galloping prices,” he tweeted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/opp-slams-budget.html
128,02-2-20,Trump lifts US restrictions on anti-personnel landmines,"US President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday lifted US restrictions on landmines, saying new technology made them safer, outraging campaigners for the abolition of the explosives that maim thousands of civilians each year.

In the latest reversal of a policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump gave the green light to a new generation of “non-persistent” landmines that can be switched off or destroyed remotely rather than staying active in the ground forever.

“The Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama administration’s policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries,” a White House statement said.

“The president is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops... President Trump is rebuilding our military, and it is stronger than ever.”

Obama in 2014 banned the use of anti-personnel landmines with the exception, under pressure from military planners, of the Korean peninsula where the explosives dot the last Cold War frontier with North Korea.

Obama also ordered the destruction of anti-personnel stockpiles not designed to defend South Korea and said the United States would not cooperate with other nations in developing landmines.

The White House said the US military will now be free to deploy landmines around the world “in exceptional circumstances.”

In rescinding the White House directive, the Trump administration said policy would now be set by the Pentagon, which said it was still prohibiting traditional landmines that cannot be turned off or destroyed remotely.

The new mines are set to self-destruct within 30 days but can be destroyed in as little as two hours if necessary, Vic Mercado, the Pentagon official in charge of the policy, told reporters.

130,02-2-20,Brexit done: UK leaves EU as Boris Johnson hails new dawn,"The UK’s divorce from the European Union (EU) came into force on Friday night as it became the first country to exit the economic bloc after 47 years of membership following the vote in favour of Brexit in June 2016.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the historic moment as the dawn of a new era for the UK in his address to the nation just before Brexit.

Brexit came into force at 11:00 pm (2300 GMT).

“This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama,” said Johnson, in his video message which promised hope and opportunity to every part of the United Kingdom.

“It is not just about some legal extrication. It is potentially a moment of real national renewal and change. This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances — your family’s life chances — should depend on which part of the country you grow up in,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/brexit-done--uk-leaves-eu-as-boris-johnson-hails-new-dawn.html
131,02-2-20,Can Dominic topple Novak?,"“King” Novak Djokovic has won all seven Australian Open finals he has contested, he is on a 12-match winning streak and will become world number one if successful in the Melbourne Park decider on Sunday.

Against those overwhelming odds, few are giving Dominic Thiem much of a chance to wrench the title from his iron grip and clinch a maiden Grand Slam.

But the Austrian, remarkably, is the one with the recent edge.

Djokovic is 6-4 in their career head-to-heads, but Thiem has won four of the last five.

Three of those were on his favoured clay, but he also came from a set down to beat the Serb on hardcourts at the ATP Finals in November.

Djokovic is the first to admit that the slick 26-year-old has successfully refined his game over the past 12 months to compete on all surfaces.

And he acknowledges it is just a matter of time before Thiem wins a Slam.

“I don’t think he’s really anymore ‘next generation’. He’s been around for many years. Now already he’s an established top-five, top-10 player,” said Djokovic.

“It’s just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top three in the world,” he added.

‘It’s his comfort zone’

Thiem, who has beaten four seeds to make the grade, including Rafael Nadal in the last eight, is no stranger to Grand Slam finals, making the last two at Roland Garros.

But this is his best effort outside of the French Open.

He lauded Djokovic as the “king of Australia” and insisted his recent succusses against him counted for little at the Serb's favourite tournament.

“It’s true, I won I think more of the last encounters than he did. But I think it doesn’t count so much. It’s absolutely his comfort zone here,” he said.

“He always plays his best tennis in Australia since many, many years. So I’m expecting that as well in the finals.

“All I can do is my best again, play great tennis again, and of course take a look at the last matches we had... Try to repeat the good stuff that I did there.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can-dominic-topple-novak-.html
132,02-2-20,5-0 whitewash on mind,"Invincible so far, India will eye a rare 5-0 whitewash against a bruised and battered New Zealand in the final T20 International here on Sunday.

New Zealand have never lost all games in a bilateral T20I series (three or more matches) at home.

Since 2005, they have only once lost all games in a bilateral T20I series at home, going down 2-0 to England back in February 2008.

While this puts India in a unique position going ahead, they will still stay fifth in the ICC T20I rankings behind Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa.

India will have their mind set elsewhere though, pertinently the experimentation cycle ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia. The fourth T20I was a step in that direction, but it mostly came to nought with the likes of Sanju Samson and Shivam Dube wasting their opportunities.

Samson has been promoted up the order in his limited opportunities against both Sri Lanka and New Zealand, and has been dismissed while attacking the bowling.

The team management would want him to show more patience, while backing him to come good once again. Meanwhile, Dube has lacked footwork against both spinners and pacers.

Elsewhere, with Manish Pandey firming up the number six spot, Shreyas Iyer could be promoted to number three. The bigger question is about the keeper-batsman spot.

Ever since the Australia series at home, K L Rahul has played with an increased workload in that role. Pre-series, skipper Virat Kohli had more or less confirmed that Rahul would continue to keep in the ensuing three-ODI series. While he has been in great form, the team management could afford to rest him and bring in Rishabh Pant.

There is incentive to do so, for this fifth and final game of this series is the last T20I India will play in the current 2019-2020 season. In the shortest format, there is only the Indian Premier League to look forward to in two months’ time, and the next T20I series - against Sri Lanka later in the summer - is quite far away.

Pant, meanwhile, has been benched since suffering concussion in the first ODI against Australia in Mumbai. While he has fully recovered, his spot in the first-choice playing eleven is long gone. In fact, his status in the current scheme of things is far worse.

At the Westpac Stadium, Rohit Sharma was rested to create an additional space in the batting line-up. Logic dictates that Kohli will take Sunday off and Rohit could lead instead, thus continuing with the one additional batting spot.

In the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah could be rested with Mohammed Shami coming back to maintain the three-pacer theory.

Meanwhile, Kane Williamson is expected to be fit for the clash, after he missed out in Wellington due to a left shoulder niggle. The Black Caps’ team management were confident of his recovery even on Friday.

The hosts will have greater concern over their lack of finishing though, after squandering two last over winning positions in two consecutive games, and the series along with.

Whether the Kiwis can recover mentally and beat an Indian side that is flying high on confidence and momentum, could eventually have a bearing on the ODI series as well.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/5-0-whitewash-on-mind.html
133,02-2-20,Hardik ruled out of NZ Test series,"Flamboyant India all-rounder Hardik Pandya was on Saturday ruled out of the upcoming Test series against New Zealand after failing to regain full match fitness, the BCCI said.

The decision was taken after the 26-year-old consulted spinal surgeon James Allibone in the United Kingdom.

“Team India all-rounder Hardik Pandya has been ruled out of the upcoming Test series against New Zealand. He travelled to London and was accompanied by NCA Head Physio Ashish Kaushik for a review by spinal surgeon Dr James Allibone,” Jay Shah said in a statement.

“Hardik will be under rehab at the National Cricket Academy until he regains full match fitness,” he added.

Pandya underwent a successful surgery in October last year to treat an acute lower-back injury and has remained out of action since.

He last played for India during the T20 International series against South Africa, taking part in the third match in Bengaluru. He has not played Test cricket since the Southampton match against England in September 2018.

According to BCCI sources, Pandya is also unlikely to be available for the three-match home ODI series against South Africa from March 12-18. They said his case is more serious and he is unlikely to come back before IPL.

It is also learnt that BCCI is now aware that his trainer S Rajnikant did not give the Board a complete picture of Pandya’s fitness status.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hardik-ruled-out-of-nz-test-series.html

Kohli has 928 points, 17 more than second-placed Australian run-machine Steve Smith.

Cheteshwar Pujara also remained in sixth place with 791 points. Rahane has 759 points.

India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was the best-placed Indian in the bowlers’ ranking at sixth spot with 794 points, while spinner Ravichandran Ashwin was placed eighth. Seamer Mohammed Shami was the third Indian in the top 10, improving a spot to be placed at the ninth position.

In the all-rounders ranking, Ravindra Jadeja remained static at the third place with 406 points, while Ashwin improved a place to capture the fourth position with 308 points.

Among others, England’s Mark Wood and South Africa’s Quinton de Kock have made notable gains in the ICC Test Player Ranking after the final Test in Johannesburg.

Wood, who was adjudged Player of the Match at Wanderers, has moved up 19 places to 38th position among bowlers after his haul of nine for 100. He has also progressed to 142nd from 151st among batsmen after scores of 35 not out and 18 in his 15th Test.

Ollie Pope (up six places to 55th) and Dom Sibley (up nine places to 67th) are among others to advance in the latest update, which also takes into account the drawn Harare Test featuring Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka.

135,02-2-20,"New highways, corridors to come up","To augment highways development programme, including construction of 15,500 km of highways involving 9,000 km of economic corridors, the Modi Government on Saturday made a budgetary allocation of Rs 91,823,22 crore for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also proposed to provide about Rs 1.70 lakh crore for transport Infrastructure in financial year 2020-21.

The last allocation in her maiden interim Budget was Rs 83,016. Welcoming the Budget as growth oriented, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said it is full of innovative initiatives for aspirational India.

“Accelerated development of highways will be undertaken. This will include development of 2,500 Km access control highways, 9,000 Km of economic corridors, 2,000 Km of coastal and land port roads and 2,000 Km of strategic highways,” Sitharaman said in her budget speech.

Sitharaman said the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will be completed in three years, in addition to two more express highway projects. “Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and two other packages would be completed by 2023. Work on Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway would also be started,” she said.

Terming a sound highways network essential to propel the economy, the Economic Survey had on Friday said the highways sector needs Rs 19.63 lakh crore investment by 2024-25.

Total investment in the roads and highway sector has gone up more than three times in the five-year period of 2014-15 to 2018-19.

Of about 59.64 lakh kms of roads in India, total length of National Highways was 1.32 lakh kms as on March 1, 2019. “The pace at which roads have been constructed has grown significantly from 17 km per day in 2015-16 to 29.7 km per day in 2018-19,” it said.

Gadkari said it has given a massive boost to investment in infrastructure, which in turn would help revive industrial production and generate employment opportunities, creating more that 2 crore jobs.

The annual budget also talked about electronic tolling on national highways, FASTag mechanism that enables greater commercialisation of highways so that NHAI can raise more resources. “I propose to monetise at least twelve lots of highway bundles of over 6000-km before 2024,” she said.

A policy for scrapping of old vehicles “is in the works” and will be announced after concerned ministries “fine tune” it, Sitharaman mentioned. The government on July 26, 2019 had proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/new-highways--corridors-to-come-up.html
136,02-2-20,No hike for Defence,"The Defence Budget on Friday saw almost no hike for 2019-20 as the allocations were nearly the same as provided in the interim Budget on February one this year.

Presenting her maiden Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s speech also found no mention of the Defence outlay for ongoing fiscal. She, however, announced that basic customs duty on Defence equipment will not be levied.

The overall Defence Budget crossed the three Rs 3 crore mark in the interim Budget but in real terms the hike was a modest seven per cent as compared to 2018-2019. The outlay announced provided for by Sitharaman is also nearly same with the capital outlay of Rs 1,03,394 crore. This figure stood at Rs 93,982 crore in the last fiscal. The total budgetary provisions for the current fiscal now is Rs 3,05,296.07 crore. These figures exclude miscellaneous allocations of Defence amounting to Rs 17,065.12 crore.

While capital funds are needed to sustain the tempo of modernisation by inducting urgently required weapon platforms, the revenue expenditure, however, takes a major share of the overall allocations.

The revenue expenditure, which includes expenses on payment of salaries and maintenance of establishments is Rs 2,01,901.76 crore. The huge gap between capital and revenue expenditure is a major issue facing the Defence Ministry and efforts to narrow down the gap has so far not progressed as desired thereby restricting the funds needed for acquiring better weapon systems.

Moreover, the total outlay does not include Rs 1,12,079 crore set aside separately for payment of pensions. If allocation for pension is included, then the total outlay for Defence stands at Rs 4.31 lakh crore which accounts for 15.47 per cent of the total Central Government expenditure for the year 2019-20. “The capital allocation of Ministry of Defence under BE (budget estimate) 2019-20 is 31.97 per cent of the total Central Government capital expenditure, which is Rs 3,38,569.00 crore,” Singh’s office tweeted.

As regards service wise allotment of funds, the IAF gets the highest amount totaling Rs 39, 302.64 crore as against Rs 35,770.11 crore in 2018-2019, followed by the Army Rs 29,461.25 crore (Rs 26,688.42 crore in last fiscal) and the Navy Rs 23,156.43 crore (Rs 20, 890 crore in 2018-19).

The hike in capital outlay will give the IAF an elbow room to go in acquisitions besides meeting contractual obligation for Rafale jet payment. So far, the Government has paid nearly Rs 40,000 crore to France for 36 jets. The overall cost of the deal is Rs 60,000 crore. The increase in the Army Budget will enable it to acquire modern rifles numbering more than four lakh, anti-tank guided missiles, artillery guns and armoured personnel carriers. The Rashtriya Rifles (RR), the anti-insurgency force of the Army engaged in operations in J&K, has been allotted Rs 24.64 crore as against Rs 22.40 crore for the last financial year.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-hike-for-defence.html

In the equities segment, FPIs invested Rs 7,547.8 crore in September, Rs 12,367.9 crore in October, Rs 25,230.6 crore in November and Rs 7,338.4 crore in December.

According to depositories data, a net sum of Rs 12,122 crore was pumped into equities last month by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).

However, a net amount of Rs 11,119 crore was withdrawn from the debt segment during the same period. This translated into a net investment of Rs 1,003 crore.

""Starting off on a rather placid note on account of brewing geopolitical tension between the US and Iran and fast changing trend with regards to the US-China trade war, FPIs regained their risk appetite as these concerns started to wane,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

He, further, said that several measures announced in the Union Budget are likely to boost foreign investments into the Indian market in the interim period.

However, from the long-term perspective, the focus would continue to be on the country's macro-economic stability and other influencing global factors, he added.

On Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors, adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent.

Besides, the government also proposed to remove dividend distribution tax (DDT) on companies, and henceforth the tax burden will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

The removal of DDT will help enhance returns for foreign investors, experts said.

""Non-availability of credit of DDT to most foreign investors in their home country used to result in lower return for them on their equity investments. With this, foreign investors can now claim credit for the same in their home jurisdictions,"" Srivastava said.

India are on top of the points table after the Harmapreet Kaur-led side beat England by five wickets in the tournament opener on Friday.

143,02-2-20,Kenin is new Aus queen,"America’s Sofia Kenin stunned two-time Major champion Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open on Saturday, completing a surprise run where she has come from nowhere to win her first Grand Slam title.

Despite making her debut in a Major final Kenin, 21, showed all her trademark aggression as she fought back from a set down to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 in 2hrs 3mins against the shellshocked Spaniard.

The 14th seed, who will now jump as high as seventh in the world and usurp Serena Williams as America’s number one, was in tears at the end and headed straight for her father Alexander, who is her coach.

It was the final twist in a tournament of upsets, after Williams went out in the third round and Kenin upset Australia’s world number one Ashleigh Barty in the semi-finals.

“My dream officially came true, I can’t describe this feeling,” said Moscow-born Kenin.

“It’s amazing, dreams come true. If you have dreams, go for it, it’s going to come true.”

Spain’s Muguruza, 26, was unseeded for the first time at a Slam since 2014 having suffered a marked loss of form in the last 18 months.

She was resurgent in Melbourne over the past fortnight, but after grabbing the first-set lead, her serve failed her spectacularly.

She totted up eight double-faults in all, three of them in the final game -- including one on the second championship point, handing the title to her younger opponent.

Kenin fights back

Muguruza drew first blood at Rod Laver Arena, where the roof was closed for rain in Melbourne, getting the first break of serve.

Moscow-born Kenin, who ended the fairytale run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff on her way to the final, bounced her American stars-and-stripes racquet on the hardcourt in irritation.

The 2016 French Open and 2017 Wimbledon winner Muguruza took the first set in 52 minutes when the young American planted her forehand out.

But the aggressive Kenin upped the ante in the second set, breaking her more experienced opponent in the fourth game and easily holding to sprint into a 4-1 lead.

Kenin, who won their only previous encounter in three sets, grabbed the second set in an emphatic 32 minutes. A rattled Muguruza was seen briefly by a physio for what appeared to be a lower-back problem.

Into the deciding set and the gutsy Kenin saved three game points in a pivotal fifth game, tossing the ball back over her head by way of celebration.

Kenin, who was overshadowed in the build-up to Melbourne by the likes of Williams, Osaka and Barty, adds by far the biggest title of her fast-burgeoning career to the three WTA crowns she won last year.

“The past two weeks have been the best of my life,” she told Rod Laver Arena, as her father — who left the Soviet Union in 1987 to give the family a better life — filmed her victory speech on his phone.

“I love you guys from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much,” she told the crowd.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kenin-is-new-aus-queen-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kenin-is-new-aus-queen-kenin-is-new-aus-queen.html
144,02-2-20,Indian women struggle to 103,"A poor batting display saw the Indian women struggle to 103 for nine against Australia in their T20 tri-series match here on Sunday.

In the first flight on early Saturday, 324 Indians were evacuated and were admitted to the two quarantine facilities set up by the Army and the ITBP, though none of them have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to officials.

Wuhan is the epicentre of outbreak of novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 300 people in China.

Two Indians, both from Kerala, have been tested positive for novel coronavirus.

Due to the outbreak, IndiGo has suspended all three flights between India and China. Air India has suspended its Delhi-Shanghai flight and curtailed the flight operations on the Delhi-Hong Kong route.

An Air India spokesperson said at 9.45 am, ""323 passengers and seven Maldivians were there in the second special flight from Wuhan, which landed at Delhi airport just now.""

Five doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, who were onboard the first flight, were also present in the second flight, the spokesperson said.

Out of the 324 people that have been evacuated through first Air India flight, 56, 53 and 42 are from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, respectively.

Air India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ai-s-2nd-flight-lands-in-delhi-with-323-indians-from-coronavirus-hit-wuhan-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/ai-s-2nd-flight-lands-in-delhi-with-323-indians-from-coronavirus-hit-wuhan.html

147,02-2-20,"Shaheen Bagh shooter a 'simple boy', not radical: Family","He is not radical and is a ""simple boy"" but he was ""tired"" of travelling extra kilometers as roads are blocked due to protests at Shaheen Bagh, said family members of Kapil Gujjar, who was arrested for firing in the air at the south-east Delhi locality on Saturday.

Kapil, who owns a dairy business in Dallupura village on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, fired two rounds in the air at Shaheen Bagh, the epicenter of anti-CAA protests due to which a major road connecting south Delhi to Noida is blocked for over a month now.

""On normal days it takes two hours to reach the Badarpur Dairy (in south Delhi). He had to travel just 10 kilometres. But due to the protests, he had to travel 35 kilometres and he reached home at 1am.

""He was tired with this but definitely not that disturbed to do anything like that (shooting),"" Kapil's uncle Fateh Singh said.

The Gujjar family has a small dairy unit in Dallupura and a larger one at Badarpur, and the business was getting affected as Road No 13 at Kalindi Kunj is blocked, he claimed.

""I was in my house till 12 pm and left for office after that. Till that time Kapil was in the house. Later, I received information that he fired rounds in Shaheen Bagh,"" Kapil's father Gaje Singh told reporters.

The family is shocked. He left without informing anyone and all thought he went to play cricket, said Singh, who had contested the assembly elections from Jangpura on a BSP ticket in 2010 but lost.

""We have no idea how he has done it, from where he procured the weapon. He is a very simple boy and never messes with anyone,"" he said.

Twenty-five-year-old Kapil, who has a one-year-old daughter, wanted to become a reporter, but he dropped out of college and joined the dairy business, family members said at his tow-storey house in the village.

He had joined the media course at IMS College in Delhi after passing out from a local school at Vasundhara, they said.

Kapil didn't have any ""radical thoughts"" or influence of any religious or political groups, his family members claimed.

""He is a simple boy who can only think about buffaloes and expanding his father's dairy business. Today at 12:30 pm he left his house after greeting me like every day.I thought he left for the dairy in Badarpur but later in the evening we learnt from news channels that he has been arrested for firing,"" said Satish Kumar, a relative.

He also added that a week ago the Gujjar family had to drop its plan to attend a wedding because they did not want to take a long detour to go to south Delhi.

According to a senior police officer, during Kapil's interrogation it was learnt that he had to go to Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi and he felt very inconvenient to take a detour. This claim is being verified, the officer said.

Kapil, after being overpowered by police at Shaheen Bagh, had chanted 'Jai Shree Ram' and said, ""hamare desh me aur kisi ki nahi chalegi, sirf Hindu ki chalegi (only Hindus shall have a say in our country, no one else),"" as he was taken into custody by the Delhi Police.

""We suspect that he was instigated by someone at Shaheen Bagh but he was not carrying a pistol with him when he left from home. We just saw him being taken by police and later Azad Nagar police reached home for investigation,"" Singh said.

""Had we known Kapil was going to Shaheen Bagh we would have never let him go,"" he said.

The Saturday shooting incident was second at Shaheen Bagh. On Thursday, a man fired his pistol on a group of anti CAA protesters in the area, injuring a Jamia Millia Islamia University student.

Kapil's brother said, ""I think he has been framed. Some could have instigated him"".

Kumar said the family has a ""good reputation"" in the village and has rented out houses to eight Muslim families.

""He has Muslim friends and they visit our home for festivals. He never had any hatred for Muslims or extremist thoughts for any religion. He didn't have any association too with political groups. His every day routine is limited to dairy business,"" he said.

Kapil or anyone in his family doesn't have any licensed or unlicensed arms, a family member said, adding that he is not a very outgoing person but maintained good relations with all residents in village.

The Dallupura village which is a Gujjar dominated village too claims that Kapil has been framed.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-shooter-a--simple-boy---not-radical--family-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/shaheen-bagh-shooter-a--simple-boy---not-radical--family.html
148,02-2-20,"Unfazed by attack, Shaheen Bagh protestors say they won't leave site","Unfazed by the firing incident at Shaheen Bagh on Saturday, protestors said they will continue their stir at the site until the government revokes the amended citizenship law.

A 25-year-old man fired two rounds in the air in the southeast Delhi locality, triggering a panic on Saturday evening. The man was later taken into custody and no one was injured in the incident.

Soon after, more protestors were seen flocking to the site. Some sung the national anthem, while others formed a human chain and offered namaz.

The protestors also raised slogans against the Delhi Police.

A woman protestor, who didn't wish to be named, said the incident created a panic among them as well as the children.

""Many women and children were inside the tent when the incident occurred. We rushed to the spot on hearing a gunshot. Everyone is scared. But we won't leave,"" she said.

Farjana (35), who did not share her second name, said she had been sitting at the protest site since the last three weeks.

""Nobody wants violence. We welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to Shaheen Bagh and see how people have been protesting here peacefully. No one from here is involved in any kind of violence whether it is firing or something else. We just want the government to revoke this law. Till then we will not leave the site,"" she said.

Farhan Akhtar (30), who lives nearby, alleged that the government thought it could scare away the protestors and dilute the movement.

""I want to tell them that people are sitting here for their rights. They want the newly amended Citizenship Act abolished and till that time, nobody will move,"" Akhtar said.

Rehman (28), who did not share his second name, blamed provocative statements by BJP leaders for the attack.

""We don't want CAA and NRC. The people of this country want jobs and education. Don't divide us on the basis of religion.

149,02-2-20,JK DSP case: NIA raids multiple places in south Kashmir,"The National Investigation Agency on Sunday morning carried out searches in connection with a case in which a senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer was arrested while ferrying terrorists outside the valley, officials said here.

Multiple NIA teams fanned in various parts of south Kashmir and carried out the searches at some private offices and residences, they said.

The NIA had taken over the case in which Jammu and Kashmir's Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh, who has since been suspended, was caught in south Kashmir while ferrying two terrorists out of the valley on January 11.

The searches come days after NIA officers interrogated all the accused arrested in the case.

Besides Singh, the others arrested were: Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmed alias Naveed Babu, who is a self-styled commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, Rafi Ahmed Rather and Irfan Shafi Mir, who claims to be an advocate.

They were arrested from the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway near Qazigund in South Kashmir.

Later, Naveed's brother, Syed Irfan Ahmed, was also arrested on January 23 after he was brought from Punjab.

He was in constant touch with his brother and had asked him to look for an accommodation in Chandigarh where they could escape the harsh winters months of Kashmir.

Mir, who was driving the vehicle when they were caught by the police from a national highway in Kulgam district, may become a prize catch for the NIA as it is alleged he was acting on the orders of his masters in Pakistan.

He had visited the neighbouring country five times on an Indian passport.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jk-dsp-case--nia-raids-multiple-places-in-south-kashmir-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jk-dsp-case--nia-raids-multiple-places-in-south-kashmir.html
150,02-2-20,Paes gets Tata Open wild card,"Legendary Leander Paes will be back in Pune one last time as the Indian tennis icon received a wild card entry in doubles at the third edition of Tata Open Maharashtra which is scheduled at Mhalunge Balewadi Stadium in Pune from February 3-9.

The widely anticipated wildcard announcement was made during the draw ceremony on Saturday.

The 46-year-old, who has partnered alongside Australian Mathew Ebden, will face stiff challenge from yet another Indian star and defending champion Divij Sharan in the first round. Sharan, who clinched doubles title in the last edition with Rohan Bopanna, has teamed up with New Zealand's Artem Sitak.

“We are really happy to welcome the tennis legend back in Pune. He has serviced the nation and won countless laurels for the country. He has inspired many Indian youngsters. It will be great for Pune crowd to come to the stadium and watch the legend play one last time,” Sutar said.

The third edition of South Asia’s only ATP Tour tournament will be the last appearance for the eight-time doubles Grand Slam Champion Paes. “It will be the last tournament for Paes in India. We decided to give him wild card entry as it is going to be tribute to what he has done for the country,” Iyer said.

Another ace Indian doubles player Rohan Bopanna, alongside local boy Arjun Kadhe, will face French pair of Antonie Hoang and Benoit Paire.

151,02-2-20,"Mo Salah, more success","Liverpool surged 22 points clear at the top of the Premier League with a dominant second-half display as Mohamed Salah scored twice in a 4-0 rout of Southampton on Saturday.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jordan Henderson also scored and the runaway leaders have collected an astonishing 100 league points from the last 102 available to them.

A 24th victory in 25 league matches this season and ninth clean sheet in 10 games underlined how Jurgen Klopp's side have turned the title race into a procession.

Southampton’s spirited performance at Anfield was undone, in controversial fashion, two minutes into the second half after Danny Ings appealed that he had been tripped by Fabinho on his way into the home area.

Liverpool broke immediately upfield, Oxlade-Chamberlain spearheading a counter-attack which ended in an exchange of passes with Roberto Firmino, and a brilliant finish into the bottom corner of the Southampton goal.

The visitors appealed furiously that they should have been awarded the earlier penalty only to be met with an unfavourable decision from VAR.

That proved to be a moot point eventually with Henderson and Salah adding goals in quick succession after the hour.

Henderson doubled the lead from a move started when he closed down a clearance from keeper Alex McCarthy and Trent Alexander-Arnold returned it upfield.

Firmino chased the pass down and laid the ball off for Henderson to drive in an unstoppable finish.

Twelve minutes later Henderson himself set up the third, with a magnificent pass which just eluded Jan Bednarek and allowed Salah to chase through and lift the ball over the keeper.

Firmino and substitute Takumi Minamino wasted glorious chances to add to the score before Salah did just that in the final minute to give Liverpool their 20th successive home league win.

Rampant Reds

It came from more strong play by Firmino, who held off defender Jack Stephens before squaring for his Egyptian team-mate to score with an untidy, deflected shot.

Yet, despite the impressive weight of statistical form that Liverpool brought into the game, Southampton were themselves looking for a fifth consecutive league away win and could have been on course for it by the interval.

The first period ended with the Saints actually out-performing the leaders and, with better finishing, they would have been in control.

Instead, Liverpool could point to their best, and only real, chance of the first half and bemoan the fact they were denied what looked a strong penalty appeal on the half hour.

Virgil van Dijk missed a good opportunity with only McCarthy to beat, back-heeling at the keeper who then did well to block Firmino's follow-up effort.

Liverpool retained possession and Jordan Henderson crossed into the six-yard area where Firmino appeared to be brought down on the goalline by Shane Long.

Despite the vocal appeals from Liverpool players and crowd alike, VAR chose not to overrule referee Kevin Friend, a reprieve that Southampton looked in the mood to take advantage of before the half expired.

They were helped by a series of uncharacteristic Liverpool errors, both forced and unforced, which gifted the visitors a series of chances.

An Ings shot was well blocked by Joe Gomez, after Firmino gave the ball straight to him, a Gomez error allowed Long a strike which Alisson parried while Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Ings, again, had promising openings.

It was all part of an enthralling, if goalless, first half, with Moussa Djenepo’s shot having been tipped over earlier by Alisson and McCarthy doing likewise at the other end to deny Oxlade-Chamberlain.

But Liverpool's strong start to the second half altered the dynamic of the game and moved the Reds another step closer to their first English title since 1990.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mo-salah--more-success.html
152,02-2-20,Bangladesh axe Mustafizur for first Test,"Bangladesh on Saturday dropped pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman and recalled Rubel Hossain for the first Test of the two-match series against Pakistan which begins in Rawalpindi next week.

“Mustafiz was dropped for his poor performance. He is in and out of the team for quite some time and doesn’t play longer-format matches regularly. His white-ball performances are not satisfactory,” said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.

Opening batsmen Imrul Kayes, Shadman Islam and off-spinner Mehidy Hasan were also left out for injury while wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim opted out due to security concerns.

Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal returned to the Test side after skipping the India series for family reason while Bangladesh also recalled batsmen Najmul Hossain and Soumya Sarkar.

“Soumya has been picked as a backup player. Our first choice openers are Saif Hasan and Tamim. We have picked Soumya in the squad if coach makes plan to play him at seven as an all-rounder as they (Pakistan) have good number of quality fast bowlers,” said Minhajul.

Squad: Mominul Haque (Capt), Tamim Iqbal, Saif Hasan, Najmul Hossain, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mohammad Mithun, Liton Das, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan, Ebadat Hossain, Abu Jayed, Al-Amin Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Soumya Sarkar.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bangladesh-axe-mustafizur-for-first-test.html
153,02-2-20,NEW seal semis spot,"World No. 10 Michelle Li staved off a spirited challenge from Rituparna Das to take the North Eastern Warriors to a commanding 5-0 win against the Pune 7 Aces at the GMC Balayogi SATS Indoor Stadium here in Hyderabad today as they sealed their semi-final spot at the Star Sports Premier Badminton League. The loss snapped Pune’s three-match winning streak as the Guwahati-based franchise bagged their third victory in five ties with a fabulous performance that saw them win four of the five matches of the day.

With the 15-8, 13-15, 15-13 win against the resilient Das, Li has remained unbeaten in four ties. With the responsibility of the Warriors’ Trump, Li was expected to cruise against the Pune player but the World No. 100 displayed remarkable courage under pressure despite losing the first game 8-15.

In a spectacular turnaround, Das put the former Commonwealth Games gold medallist under pressure with her smart placement of the shuttle before grinding out the second game. A visible injury on her right hand could not deter the 23-year-old whose composure left the crowd in awe.

In the tight decider, Das even moved ahead to 11-10 as the match headed to a close finish. Li had to dig deep to level the score at 12-12 and then inched ahead to 14-12 to have a couple of match points in hand. Das, who made it to the semi-finals of the Syed Modi Int’l in November, even saved a match point before Li wrapped up the match to take the North Eastern Warriors to victory.

But what really helped the Guwahati team dismantle the high-flying Pune 7 Aces was their win against the Aces Trump of Chris and Gabrielle Adcock. The Commonwealth Games champions had come into this tie having not lost a single match this season. But against the supreme combination of Lee Yong Dae and Kim Ha Na, the two failed to bring their best game and slumped to a one-sided 6-15, 8-15 loss.

Earlier, PBL veteran Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk set the stage for the North Eastern Warriors’ win with a narrow 15-13, 15-14 win over World No. 73 Kazumasa Sakai. Tanongsak had won both his previous matches in the Hyderabad leg and brought that momentum today. With the two being tied 1-1 on the BWF circuit, a hard-fought match was always on the cards. The Thai was able to lift his game at the latter stages of every game to finish off the win for the Warriors.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/new-seal-semis-spot.html
154,02-2-20,Benzema decides Madrid derby,"Zinedine Zidane’s double substitution at half-time transformed the Madrid derby on Saturday as Real Madrid edged past Atletico 1-0 to move six points clear at the top of La Liga.

Karim Benzema scored the winner at the Santiago Bernabeu after Zidane’s decisive intervention turned a contest that Atletico had dominated into another comfortable Real Madrid victory.

Vinicius Junior, one of the substitutes, was a key to the goal.

Second-place Barcelona can cut the gap back to three points by beating Levante at home on Sunday but Atletico now trail the leaders by 13 points.

While Diego Simeone’s side were excellent in the first half, they were yet again blunt in front of goal and then failed to respond when their opponents found a different gear.

This is Atletico’s fifth game without a win. The worry is that on this form, they should worry not about the title race but about missing out on Champions League qualification.

It is a far cry from pre-season when Atletico thrashed Real 7-3 and many were tipping them as serious challengers.

Zidane was under pressure then, but his team are on a relentless run, now 21 games unbeaten, the latest due in large part to his changes.

The decision to ditch a failing system and revert to 4-3-3, with Vinicuis Junior and Lucas Vazquez coming on for Isco and Toni Kroos, was both brave and effective.

Real’s form is impressive and they have Eden Hazard, out since November, on the brink of a return, perhaps on Thursday in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals against Real Sociedad.

Gareth Bale’s absence was not related to fitness. The Welshman was left out of the squad despite training for most of the week after an ankle injury.

Atletico were without the injured Kieran Trippier, meaning Sime Vrsaljko came in a right-back. January signing Yannick Carrasco was named on the bench, after rejoining from Dalian Yifang the day before.

Simeone’s side were significantly better in the first half and should have taken one of a handful of decent chances as Vitolo hit Thibaut Courtois, Saul Niguez flashed wide and Angel Correa poked past the post after going through one-on-one, even if he probably would have been called offside.

Real Madrid’s cluster of central midfielders looked unsure of their 4-3-2-1 shape. Fede Valverde looked particularly uncomfortable as he spent much of the first half as a right winger. Luka Modric was virtually anonymous in his more advanced role.

Zidane’s double change was a recognition of Atletico’s superiority as he reverted to the more familiar 4-3-3 with Modric deeper in midfield.

The balance shifted immediately. Real dominated the start of the second half.

In the 56th minute, Vinicius cut in from the left and slipped in the overlapping Ferland Mendy, whose cross to the back post gave Benzema a simple finish.

Atletico had been weakened shortly before when Alvaro Morata, perhaps the best player on the pitch in the first 45 minutes, went off with an injury. He was replaced by Thomas Lemar, whom Simeone expected to be sold in the January transfer window.

Real retreated a little, perhaps waiting for an Atletico push that never came.

Valverde enjoyed a spontaneous standing ovation for a burst forward, an appreciation too perhaps for his brilliant breakthrough season. Another roar of approval greeted the final whistle.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/benzema-decides-madrid-derby.html
155,02-2-20,Another double for Haaland,"Erling Braut Haaland made it seven goals in three games for Borussia Dortmund after scoring a double in Saturday’s 5-0 Bundesliga thrashing of Union Berlin while Bayern Munich went top of the table.

The 19-year-old Haaland, who had netted five times in his first two appearances since signing from Salzburg, scored either side of half-time at Signal Iduna Park after being handed his first Dortmund start by coach Lucien Favre.

Haaland’s tally is the most by any Bundesliga player in their first three league matches.

Dortmund moved to third in the table, three points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who beat Mainz 3-1.

Previous leaders RB Leipzig can regain top spot if they later beat fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach at home.

In Dortmund, 19-year-old England winger Jadon Sancho became the first teenager to score 25 goals in the Bundesliga when he started the rout with a looping shot past Union goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz.

Haaland then added to his record run on 18 minutes when he was presented with a simple tap-in from a Julian Brandt cross.

The hosts were dominating as Haaland won a penalty, which captain Marco Reus converted mid-way through the second half.

Central midfielder Axel Witsel made it 4-0 on 70 minutes, firing home after Sancho's brilliant pass took out two defenders and set up his Belgian team-mate.

Haaland completed the rout when a Brandt back-heel fell into his path and he drilled his shot past the despairing Gikiewicz.

In Mainz, goals by Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara sealed Bayern’s away win to go two points clear.

Bayern wasted no time taking the lead despite the sodden conditions as the Bundesliga’s top scorer Lewandowski netted his 22nd league goal after just eight minutes to herald a powerful first-half by the defending champions.

Mueller hit their second on 14 minutes, finishing a move he started after Lewandowski and Leon Goretzka shredded Mainz’s defence.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/another-double-for-haaland.html
156,02-2-20,Superstarz move past Warriors,"Chennai Superstarz notched up a thrilling 4-3 win over Awadhe Warriors to seal their semi-final spot at the fifth Premier Badminton League here on Saturday.

The enthralling tie went down to the wire and was decided only in the fifth rubber when Chennai’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and his mixed doubles partner Jessica Pugh beat Awadhe's Christinna Pedersen and Ko Sung Hyun 15-11, 13-15, 15-14 at the GMC Balayogi SATS Indoor Stadium here.

Earlier, World No. 32 Lakshya Sen bounced back to winning ways as he beat Subhankar Dey of the Awadhe Warriors 15-7, 15-8 in the first match. This was the former Asian Junior champion’s fourth win in five appearances.

Sen’s win was complimented by the 2014 World Championships Bronze medallist Tommy Sugiarto who showed the same confidence and conviction in an effortless Trump win for the Superstarz.

The Indonesian, who is yet to lose this season, grabbed his fourth win on the trot as he demolished Wong Wing Ki Vincent 15-10, 15-8.

While Chennai emerged victorious in the two men's singles rubbers, Awadhe Warriors had the upper hand in women's singles and men’s doubles in an absorbing encounter.

World No. 14 Beiwen Zhang used her experience against rising star Gayatri Gopichand of the Chennai team to post a 15-10, 15-5 win.

The men’s doubles match then turned out to be an engrossing affair as Dhruv Kapila and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy of Chennai edged the Awadhe Trump pair of Ko Sung Hyun and Ivan Sozonov in the initial stages of the match.

But the undeterred Warriors veterans made a stunning comeback in the next two games to claim a 12-15, 15-11, 15-10 win.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/superstarz-move-past-warriors.html

162,02-2-20,Short on aspirations!,"Budget cuts income tax, to spend more on agriculture, infrastructure to boost growth

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered one of the longest Budget speeches in recent memory in just under three hours and the biggest takeaway for most taxpayers was her announcement of a new tax regime which reduced tax slabs for income taxpayers whose annual income was less than 15 lakhs per annum.

However, that reduction of tax slabs has come at a massive cost, which is the removal of several exemptions ranging from medical insurance, house-rent allowance and leave travel allowance to many of the varied exemptions previously available under various provisions of Section 80.

The other major headline is the defibrillation shock that the Government plans to give to its moribund disinvestment process through the planned partial divestment of the Life Insurance Corporation in India which could become the most valuable company in India.

However, there is an overwhelming feeling among both economists and businessmen, who are not always on the same page that this Budget is a major missed opportunity. For one, there is a feeling that it does not seriously enough recognise the economic growth malaise in India. There is no booster for the manufacturing sector and with infrastructure spending not dramatically enhanced, little that will boost rural spending. The fact that there was not much for industry was reflected in an all-round decline in the bourses.

In one of the strongest negative reactions to the Budget, the benchmark Sensex tanked 2.43 per cent or almost 1000 points on Saturday. The headline Nifty index of India’s top 50 companies declined dropped 3.1 per cent, as investors gave the Union Budget two thumbs down.

Part of the decline could be because of the Government’s reluctance to infuse more funds into the public banking sector and with credit growth at multi-year lows and the government still owning two-thirds of banking capital, it is difficult to imagine how credit offtake will increase.

While certain sops have been announced that will make India a more attractive destination for foreign sovereign investment funds as well as the abolition of the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) which might hurt Indian promoters but will benefit foreign-based shareholders of Indian companies. There are the standard price increases with higher excise duties on certain sin items, of course cigarettes continue to be on that list, as strangely enough were toys.

The single-window clearance for infrastructure projects as well as the move towards encouraging cleaner energy production as it moves towards meetings its obligations under the Paris Climate Treaty are positives as is the dramatically enhanced Rs 4,000 crore that will be poured into ensuring “clean air” in large cities.

In every Budget there are both positives and negatives but there is a feeling that this Budget has left most Government and industry watchers disappointed because it has not done enough. While there is a level of fiscal balancing done by the Government, the confidence with which it stated several of their numbers have been questioned because there is a lack of confidence in the ability of this Government to pull off the disinvestment proposals required that will raise the funds needed to keep the fiscal deficit in check.

This Budget might have been fine if the Indian economy was purring along at a believable 8-10 per cent actual growth rate but with the need to boost the economy and create millions of new jobs every year, this is a deeply unambitious and dull Budget, not one that India needed as it finds its economy in a funk.

The revised estimated expenditure for FY20 has been pegged at Rs 26.99 lakh crore and receipts at Rs 19.32 lakh crore.

It has been proposed to remove dividend distribution tax on companies, and henceforth the tax will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

A price stabilisation fund (PSF) is also in the pipeline to control prices of food items like onion and tomato that pushed retail inflation to a five-year high in December.

In a marginal hike, the Defence Budget was increased to Rs 3.37 lakh crore for 2020-21 against last year’s Rs 3.18 lakh crore, belying expectations of a significantly enhanced allocation to fast-track long-pending military modernisation. The net market borrowings would be at Rs 4.99 lakh crore in FY2019-20 and are estimated at Rs 5.36 lakh crore in the next fiscal.

The Minister announced cuts in personal income tax, extended tax benefits for affordable housing and gave relief to companies on payment of dividend as it looked to boost consumption to bring the economy out of the worst slowdown in 11 years.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/short-on-aspirations--2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/short-on-aspirations-.html
163,02-2-20,Govt to sell stake in LIC via IPO route,"It’s part of plan to raise Rs 2.1L crore through divestment

On the lines of Saudi Arabia’s Aramco that had the largest public offering in world’s history, the Modi Government has decided to list the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) through the Initial Public Offer (IPO) route to mobilise non-tax revenue to meet the fiscal challenges.

This could be a blockbuster listing considering that LIC’s estimated valuation is of over Rs 36 lakh crore. Saudi Aramco, which is currently valued at $117.82 billion, was listed on Saudi Stock Exchange in December last year.

Established in 1956, LIC is fully-owned by the Central Government and has the highest market share in the life insurance segment in the country. According to Union Budget documents, for year 2020-21, disinvestment receipts are budgeted at Rs 2.1 lakh crore which is inclusive of Rs 90,000 crore from sale of Public Sector Banks and other Financial Institutions.

Industries have hailed the Government’s move while political parties including TMC chief Mamata Banerjee lambasted the Government decision to this effect.

Presenting the Budget 2020-21, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced selling of part Government stake in insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), beside selling the balance holding of the Government in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors. “In the last few years, the Government has taken concrete steps to bring our banking system to be robust. However, there is a need for greater private capital. Accordingly, it is proposed to sell the balance holding of Government of India in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange,” she said in her Budget Speech.

She further said that the listing brings in more financial discipline among the entities.

In 2021-22 and 2022-23, disinvestment receipts are expected to be up. The Government failed to meet the target for the current fiscal of Rs 1.05 lakh crore. In the current financial year so far, the Government has mopped up about Rs 18,000 crore by way of disinvestment. The Revised Estimate pegs disinvestment proceeds at Rs 65,000 crore for this fiscal ending March 2020.

Criticising the Government move, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee lashed out at the Centre over the Union Budget 2020 saying she is “appalled” at the Government’s proposal to sell shares of public institutions and termed it the “end of the sense of security”. “I am shocked and appalled to see how the Central Government plans to ambush the heritage & legacy of public institutions. It’s the end of a sense of security. Is it also the end of an era?” the Chief Minister tweeted, hours after Sitharaman concluded her longest Budget speech in Parliament. LIC employees’ unions has opposed the Centre’s plan to sell a part of its shares in the state-run insurance behemoth through an initial public offer (IPO), insisting that the move is “against the national interest”. The employees’ unions across the country will stage nationwide protests if the Government goes ahead with its plan.

Hailing the Government move, Kajal Gandhi, Analyst, ICICI Direct said that LIC is likely to become the country’s biggest company by market capitalisation on the day of the listing given that it is the largest company in terms of assets under management (AUM). Vijay Bhushan, President, Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) also appreciated the Government decision.

The Government currently holds 47.11 per cent, while LIC is the majority shareholder holding 51 per cent stake in IDBI Bank.

In August last year, the Cabinet approved selling the Government’s controlling stake in IDBI Bank to LIC, which is currently 100 per cent Government-owned.

The Modi Government has also planned to sale Air India.

In the financial year 2016-17, the Government had missed the budgeted disinvestment target. While the Budget had pegged target at Rs 56,500 crore, the Government was able to mop up Rs 46,247 crore.

In 2019-20, after a gap of 2 years, the Government has missed the disinvestment target set in Budget.

In 2017-18, it bettered the target of Rs 1 lakh crore and raised a record Rs 1,00,056 crore. In 2018-19, the disinvestment mop-up stood at Rs 84,972 crore as against the Budget target of Rs 80,000 crore.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-to-sell-stake-in-lic-via-ipo-route-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-to-sell-stake-in-lic-via-ipo-route.html

168,02-2-20,Centre against stay of execution in Nirbhaya case: Delhi HC commences hearing,"Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Sunday told the Delhi High Court that there is a deliberate, calculated and well thought of design by the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case convicts to ""frustrate mandate of law"" by getting their execution delayed.

Mehta told Justice Suresh Kait that convict Pawan Gupta's move of not filing a curative or a mercy petition is a deliberate, calculated inaction.

The four Nirbhaya case convicts are playing with judicial machinery and trying patience of the nation, Mehta said.

""There is deliberate, calculated and well thought of design to frustrate mandate of law,"" Solicitor General Mehta told the high court.

The high court is hearing the Centre's plea challenging stay on the execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

Advocate A P Singh appeared for convicts Akshay Singh (31), Vinay Sharma (26) and Pawan gupta (25) opposing the Centre's plea to set aside stay on execution of death sentence.

Senior advocate Rebecca John, representing the fourth convict Mukesh Kumar (32), raised preliminary objection on the Centre's plea saying it was not maintainable.

She contended that the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court and while the government was accusing the convict of delay, it has woken up just two days ago.

""It was the victim's parents who moved the trial court for issuance of death warrants against the convicts. At no point the central government or the state government approached the trial court to immediately issue death warrants,"" John contended.

The proceedings are currently underway.

John told the high court that the Centre has moved a plea in the Supreme Court seeking clarification whether co-convicts can be executed separately and this petition is pending before the apex court.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road.

She died on December 29, 2012 in Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The top court, in its 2017 verdict, had upheld the capital punishment awarded to the convicts by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-against-stay-of-execution-in-nirbhaya-case--delhi-hc-commences-hearing-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/centre-against-stay-of-execution-in-nirbhaya-case--delhi-hc-commences-hearing.html

170,02-2-20,NRI tax not to apply on bonafide workers in Middle East : FM,"The government on Sunday clarified that the proposed tax on NRIs will not apply on bonafide Indians working in tax-free foreign countries and is intended to tax only those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2020-21 had proposed to tax Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who do not pay taxes in any foreign country.

This provision raised anxiety in minds of those working in the Gulf region where countries don't tax income earned by individuals.

First Sitharaman clarified that only Indian income of NRIs is proposed to be taxed under the new provision, and later the tax department issued a statement to say that ""the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries"".

The Union Budget for 2020-21 presented on Saturday had tightened the screws on those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status. While earlier it was possible to be classified as a non-resident by staying out of the country for 183 days or about six months in a year, this has now been, in effect, enhanced to 245 days.

In an interview to PTI, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the new rule was ""an anti-abuse provision planned to plug loopholes in the system and not intended to tax income earned by those working overseas"".

He said the wording in the Budget document may have created confusion and so a clarification has been issued now.

""What we are doing now is that the income of an NRI generated in India will be taxed here. If he's earning something in a jurisdiction where there is no tax, why will I include that into mine that has been generated there,"" Sitharaman told reporters here on Sunday.

She said Indian earnings of NRIs such as rental income from property in the country is what was intended to be taxed by way of the new provision.

""Whereas if you have a property here and you have rent out of it, but because you are living there, you carry this rent into your income there and pay no tax there, pay no tax here ... Since the property is in India, I have got a sovereign right to tax,"" she said in a post Budget interaction with media.

""I am not taxing what you're earning in Dubai but that property which is giving you rent here, you may be an NRI, you may be living there but that is revenue being generated here for you. So, that's the issue.""

Pandey said Indians working in the Middle East, as well as those in Merchant Navy, will not be taxed using the new provision.

""Somebody who is a citizen of India and sitting in a tax haven and not paying taxes then he has to pay tax,"" he said. ""By issuing clarification, we have kept them (workers in the Middle East) out. Same for merchant navy because their income is also not arising out of India.""

Asked if raising the duration of overseas stay to qualify for NRI status would not deter Indians from making visits home, he said: ""These are anti-abuse provisions. If someone faces any difficulty because of this, we will see what can be done. The policy that you make, you have to see that a larger section of people is benefitted because of this. If he is a non-resident, he has to live substantially out of India. Now, substantially out of India means what? Earlier it was 50:50. Now we have made 2/3rd: 1/3rd.""

He said the new provision was brought in because people were taking advantage of the existing one. ""These are the anti-abuse provisions, and not to inconvenience any genuine persons.""

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in a statement said the new provision is not intended to include those Indian citizens in the taxation net, who are bonafide workers in other countries.

An ""Indian citizen shall be deemed to be resident in India if he is not liable to be taxed in any country or jurisdiction. This is an anti-abuse provision since it is noticed that some Indian citizens shift their stay in low or no tax jurisdictions to avoid payment of tax in India,"" it said.

""The new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries,"" it said.

It stated that it was not correct to say that those Indians who are bonafide workers in other countries, including in the Middle East, and who are not liable to tax in these countries will be taxed in India on the income that they have earned there.

""In order to avoid any misinterpretation, it is clarified that in case of an Indian citizen who becomes deemed resident of India under this proposed provision, income earned outside India by him shall not be taxed in India unless it is derived from an Indian business or profession. Necessary clarification, if required, shall be incorporated in the relevant provision of the law,"" it added.

At present, if an Indian or a person of Indian origin managed his stay in India such that he remained a non-resident in perpetuity, he was not liable to pay tax on his global income in India.

The Union Budget has proposed to introduce a deeming provision that every Indian citizen who is not liable to tax in any other country, by virtue of his domicile or residence, shall be deemed as a resident of India. Consequently, his global income would be taxable in India.

Tightening the residency provisions, the Budget also proposed to reduce the period of stay in India to 120 days from 182 days earlier for persons of Indian origin (PIOs) to be categorised as non-resident Indians (NRIs).",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nri-tax-not-to-apply-on-bonafide-workers-in-middle-east---fm-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nri-tax-not-to-apply-on-bonafide-workers-in-middle-east---fm.html
171,02-2-20,Djokovic beats Thiem in five-set epic to win eighth Australian Open,"Novak Djokovic battled through a five-set thriller with Dominic Thiem to maintain his dominance at the Australian Open Sunday, claiming a record eighth title and returning to world number one in the process.

The indomitable Serb stretched his unbeaten streak this season to 13 but he had to rally from two sets to one down to beat the courageous fifth-seeded Austrian 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a nearly four-hour marathon.

It was his 17th Grand Slam title, moving him within two of Rafael Nadal and three of Roger Federer on the all-time list.

""Definitely my favourite court, my favourite stadium in the world and I'm blessed to hold this trophy once again,"" said Djokovic.

Victory put him alongside his fellow legends as only the third man in history to win eight or more titles at the same Slam after Nadal (12 at the French Open) and Federer (eight at Wimbledon).

It also ensured he will once again be world number one when the new rankings are released on Monday, usurping Nadal. Federer remains third with Thiem moving up a place to a career-high fourth.

But it wasn't easy with the Serb looking lethargic and out for the count in sets two and three before regaining his mojo after a medical timeout to grind down the talented Thiem.

Djokovic had never before won a Slam final in seven previous attempts when finding himself two sets to one down.

""You and two other guys (Nadal and Federer) brought men's tennis to another level. I am happy I can compete in these times,"" said Thiem.

""I fell short today but I hope soon I can compete with you again.""

- Nerveless start -

The Serb, 32, was the overwhelming favourite, but the supremely fit and fast Thiem, 26, always had the weapons to trouble him, which he deployed successfully for much of the match, taming his serve and unleashing some explosive groundstrokes.

It was a nerveless start from Djokovic, who comfortably held then put big pressure on the Austrian's serve, with a forehand into the net giving him an immediate break and a psychological edge after some monster rallies.

Thiem, though, is as strong mentally as he is physically and he finally got on the scoreboard after another tough service game.

And against the run of play, with Djokovic seemingly in control, he broke back, unleashing pinpoint groundstrokes to make the most of some loose Djokovic shots.

But the world number two was unrelenting, breaking again as Thiem served to stay in the set, with the Austrian sending down his first double fault of the match at the crucial moment.

Remarkably, a rare Djokovic double fault handed Thiem a break to go 2-1 up in set two with the courageous Austrian refusing to go away.

The Serb was getting frustrated, looking at his coaching box and pointing at his head.

He refocused and once again began attacking the Thiem serve, breaking back for 4-4, pumping his fists when the fifth seed sent a backhand wide.

But two time warnings on his serve in the next game rattled Djokovic and he was broken again, with the Serb losing his cool by patting the umpire's foot at the changeover and telling the official: ""Great job... You made yourself famous.""

- 'Tough luck' -

With Djokovic still looking distracted, Thiem served out the set -- the first the Serb had dropped in an Australian Open final since 2015.

Djokovic appeared dejected and was immediately broken twice in set three as Thiem raced to a 4-0 lead, having won six games in a row with Djokovic imploding.

The Serb was heard telling a trainer he was tired and after losing the set, he went for a medical timeout.

He came back and the fourth set went with serve until a Thiem double fault handed the Serb two break points and he converted to regain control, serving out the set with an ace.

Djokovic drew on all his experience to force another break in the deciding fifth set to take a 2-1 lead and kept his foot on the gas to claim an eighth crown from the last 13 Australian Opens.

""It wasn't meant to be tonight,"" Djokovic told Thiem. ""Tough luck. It was a tough match. But you were very close to winning it.

""You know, you definitely have a lot more time in your career and I'm sure that you will get one of the Grand Slam trophies. And more. More than one.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/djokovic-beats-thiem-in-five-set-epic-to-win-eighth-australian-open-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/djokovic-beats-thiem-in-five-set-epic-to-win-eighth-australian-open.html

The Philippines on Sunday reported the first death outside China from the deadly virus that has spread to 25 countries, including India, taking the total toll to 305.

The victim, a 44-year-old Chinese man, was the companion of a 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in the Philippines on January 21 from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

So far over 140 coronavirus cases have been reported from abroad, including India where a second case of virus was reported from Kerala on Sunday.

India airlifted 647 Indians and seven Maldivians on Saturday and Sunday from Wuhan. The evacuated Indians would be monitored for any signs of infection for two weeks by a qualified team of doctors and staff members.

India also temporarily suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China in view of the rapid spread of the virus.

Two Indians who were not allowed to get into the special flight in Wuhan on Friday after they reported high fever told PTI that their temperatures have now come down to normal level and wished to travel back home.

A total of 10 Indians were not allowed to board the AI flight by Chinese immigration officials after they were found to have high fever.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri told PTI that about 100 Indians are still believed to be residing in Hubei province.

By the end of Saturday, a total of 304 people had died of the disease in the country, China's National Health Commission said.

The state-run CGTN reported that there were 14,411 confirmed cases of virus. However, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said that the virus has infected 14,562 people.

The commission said 19,544 people were suspected of being infected with the virus of which the condition of the 2,110 patients remained severe.

Chinese health experts have been saying that the casualties will increase sharply for the next two weeks before they start declining.

This is so because millions of travellers especially those from Wuhan and Hubei province who travelled to China and abroad during the New Year holidays are returning home.

A top Chinese official said that about five million residents of Wuhan have travelled out of the virus-hit city before it was locked down on January 23.

China is bringing back by charter flights hundreds of its citizens who had travelled abroad during holidays. They are directly being flown to Wuhan.

The commission also highlighted that number of virus affected patients are recovering, saying that 328 people have been discharged.

Since the virus is transmitted human-to-human, over 1.63 lakh close contacts had been traced of which 1.37 lakh are still under medical observation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China has intensified measures to contain the virus by isolating the patients. Wuhan health authorities announced that people suspected of infection will be isolated in designated areas effective immediately.

Wenzhou city in Zhejiang Province regulated that only one family member is allowed to step out of the house every other day for grocery shopping from Saturday to February 8, amid efforts to contain the epidemic, state-run Global Times reported.

The National Health Commission also directed that bodies of coronavirus victims should be cremated close by and immediately. Burials or transfer of the bodies are not allowed, the Commission said.

China also reported an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu in Hunan province, which lies on the southern border of Hubei province.

""The outbreak occurred in a farm in the Shuangqing district of Shaoyang city. The farm has 7,850 chickens, and 4,500 of the chickens have died from the contagion. Local authorities have culled 17,828 poultry after the outbreak,"" a statement by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Saturday.

No human cases of the Hunan H5N1 virus have been reported, the Post reported.

The bird flu is highly deadly to humans who contract it, with a mortality rate of more than 50 per cent in cases over the last 15 years.

China also geared up to open the makeshift 1,000 bed hospital built in Wuhan in record nine days. Another 2,300 bed hospital is getting ready in few days.

President Xi Jinping has ordered 1,400 medical staff from the armed forces to treat patients in the newly-built Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan starting from Monday.

Huoshenshan Hospital, with a capacity of 1,000 beds, is a makeshift hospital dedicated to treating patients infected with the coronavirus, Xinhua reported.

The medics include 950 people from hospitals affiliated to the People's Liberation Army Joint Logistic Support Force and 450 from medical universities of the army, navy and air force of the PLA.

Meanwhile, a joint expert group of 15 people has also been set up to guide the hospital's epidemic prevention and control on the spot.

While India, the US, Sri Lanka and many countries evacuated their nationals from Wuhan, Pakistan has declined pleas by its stranded citizens in Wuhan to airlift them.

Pakistan's Ambassador to China Naghmana Hashmi on Sunday said that Pakistani students should not be evacuated from Wuhan as medical facilities back home do not meet the standards required to treat a patient diagnosed with coronavirus.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-toll-soars-to-304-in-china-s-coronavirus--cases-goes-up-to-1430-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-soars-to-304-in-china-s-coronavirus--cases-goes-up-to-1430.html
174,02-2-20,"Police: 2 dead, 2 wounded in shooting after Florida funeral","Gunfire erupted after a funeral Saturday in Florida, killing a teenager and a man and leaving two other people wounded, police said.

Riviera Beach police said in a statement that the shooting happened near the Victory City Church shortly after 2:30 p.M. They said a 15-year-old boy and the man died at the scene. A woman and a teenager were taken to the hospital. Their conditions were not released, nor the names of the victims. No arrests have been made.

Police said listening devices in the area that detect the sound of gunshots counted 13 rounds fired.

Pastor Tywuante D. Lupoe said in a video statement posted on Facebook that the church was “very aware” that violence was a possibility at the funeral because of a family dispute and that it had provided armed security. A Riviera Beach police officer also was present, he said.

He said the security guards and police officer had left after the service when there were only a few stragglers remaining in the area. He said that's when a fight broke out across the street from the church and the shooting erupted. He said none of the victims are church members and no one was injured on its property. He did not provide further details about the funeral.

“This is an isolated incident and it had nothing to do with Victory City Church,” Lupoe said.

175,02-2-20,Republicans prepare to defend Trump's expected acquittal,"Republicans prepared to defend their expected acquittal of President Donald Trump, on Sunday's TV talk shows, after their Senate votes to reject witness testimony at his impeachment trial sparked criticism they were aiding a cover-up and abdicating their duties.

Criticism only intensified late Saturday after US media reported that US officials cited presidential privilege in redacting 24 emails related to Trump's hold on military assistance to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of his impeachment trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Trump on Saturday claimed his polling numbers were up after the Senate paved the way for his acquittal next Wednesday.

However, according to the RealClearPolitics website, Trump currently has a 44.6 percent approval rating in collated polls, almost exactly the same as when he came to office in January 2017.

His assertion, made on Twitter, came with Washington also awaiting the results of Monday's all-important Iowa caucuses.

The first vote in the US primary process will be closely watched as a sign as to which of 11 Democratic candidates are gaining early momentum to challenge Trump in November's election.

As Democratic contenders raced across the Midwest state, the US Senate on Friday rebuffed Democratic calls for witnesses at only the third impeachment trial of a US president.

Trump is all but assured of being acquitted by the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats to 47 for the Democrats. A two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is needed to remove a president from office.

""Trump poll numbers are the highest since election, despite constant phony Witch Hunts!"" the president tweeted on Saturday from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

He was impeached for abuse of power over pressure on Ukraine to open investigations including into a leading Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.

On Friday, just two Republican senators -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine -- joined Democrats in voting to introduce witnesses into the impeachment trial.

Democrats argued that every other impeachment trial of US officials has called witnesses.

But they failed to muster the four Republican votes needed to allow testimony from Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and others.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""grand tragedy."" ""America will remember this day -- a day when the United States Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, turned away from truth and instead went along with a sham trial,"" Schumer said.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, which impeached Trump on December 18, accused Republicans of being ""accomplices to the president's cover-up."" Democrats had been eager to hear from Bolton following reports that, in a forthcoming book, he says Trump told him military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev's investigating former vice president Biden.

That is the crux of the case against Trump. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Trump ally, said House prosecutors -- known as ""managers"" -- had already presented enough evidence to make their case and there was no need for further witnesses.

Among the material was more than 28,000 pages of documents gathered during the House impeachment inquiry.

Just hours after the vote to reject any witness testimony, reports pointed to new potential evidence.

The administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said in a court filing that it ""has redacted portions of 24 documents pursuant to the Presidential Communications Privilege,"" according to US media.

These emails ""reflect communications by either the President, the Vice President, or the President's immediate advisors regarding Presidential decision-making about the scope, duration, and purpose of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine,"" OMB's deputy general counsel Heather Walsh said in the court document cited by media.

McConnell said the Senate would resume as a court of impeachment on Monday to hear final arguments, before voting on Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment passed last month in the House.

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who had been considered a possible swing vote on witnesses, said there was no need for more evidence.

""If you have eight witnesses who say someone left the scene of an accident, why do you need nine?,"" he told NBC in an interview to air Sunday.

But, he added, ""I think he shouldn't have done it. I think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I'd say -- improper, crossing the line."" Four contenders for the Democratic nomination -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- were required to be present at the impeachment trial. Monday's vote is headed to a photo finish, with leftist Sanders holding a narrow polling lead over Biden.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/republicans-prepare-to-defend-trump-s-expected-acquittal-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/republicans-prepare-to-defend-trump-s-expected-acquittal.html
176,02-2-20,Philippines reports first virus death outside China: WHO,"The Philippines has reported the first death outside China from the coronavirus that has killed over 300 and spread to other countries, the World Health Organization said Sunday.

The fatality is a 44-year-old Chinese man from the city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, and appears to have been infected before arriving in the Philippines.

""This is the first reported death outside China,"" Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO representative to the Philippines, told reporters.

""However, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak,"" Abeyasinghe added.

The man, who died in a Manila hospital, arrived in the Philippines with a 38-year-old Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said.

She was the Philippines' first case of the virus and is recovering in hospital.

The news of the man's death was released shortly after the Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China.

The Philippine government has also told citizens not to travel to mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/philippines-reports-first-virus-death-outside-china--who-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/philippines-reports-first-virus-death-outside-china--who.html
177,02-2-20,Twenty killed in Tanzanian church stampede: official,"At least 20 people in Tanzania were trampled to death at an open-air evangelical Christian church service in the north of the country, officials said on Sunday.

Government official Kippi Warioba, District Commissioner in the northern town of Moshi, said he feared the number of dead could still rise from the accident, which took place on Saturday afternoon.

""So far, 20 people have died, but the death toll could increase as there were also wounded,"" Warioba told AFP.

At least 16 others were injured in the crush, he said.

The tragedy happened when a crowd of worshippers was attending a prayer ceremony on Saturday led by the popular preacher, Boniface Mwamposa, who heads the Arise and Shine Ministry Tanzania.

The stampede occurred when Mwamposa, who calls himself the ""Apostle"", poured what he said was holy oil on the ground and the crowd surged toward to touch it in the hope of being cured of sickness, witnesses said.

""The Apostle Boniface Mwamposa poured sacred anointing oil on the ground,"" one witness, Jennifer Temu, told AFP.

""Dozens of people immediately fell being jostled and trampled, and some died. We have counted 20 people killed -- but there are also wounded."" - Preacher on the run -

""It was horrible, people trampled on mercilessly, jostling each other with elbows,"" said another witness, Peter Kilewo.

""It was like the preacher had thrown bundles of dollars about... And there were all these deaths!"" Mwamposa, the preacher, fled the scene after the stampede.

Tanzanian police chief Simon Sirro, who confirmed the toll of 20 dead, spoke on national television on Sunday morning in an appeal to Mwamposa to hand himself in for questioning.

""We are looking for him,"" Sirro said, on the state-run TBC1 television channel. ""Police have launched investigations into the matter and Mwamposa should immediately report to police. He is famous, there is no way he can escape,"" Sirro added.

He said police would also look into how church organisations handle such large-scale crowd events in general.

""We pray for them, but I must say that some churches are troublesome -- and we will see how to handle them,"" Sirro added.

President John Magufuli also issued a statement mourning the death of 20 people in Moshi, as well as 20 others killed by floods in Tanzania's southern Lindi region this week.

""I'm very sorry for these deaths of these Tanzanians in the two events,"" Magufuli said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/twenty-killed-in-tanzanian-church-stampede--official-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/twenty-killed-in-tanzanian-church-stampede--official.html
178,02-2-20,Shaheen Bagh nears climax,"Man opens fire, overpowered, held; none hurt

Two days after a teenager opened fire at anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protesters at Jamia injuring a Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student, another firing incident was reported from Shaheen Bagh where protest against CAA is going on for 47 days. A 20-year-old man fired two aerial shots from a country-made pistol at nearly 100 metres behind the stage at Shaheen Bagh protest site on Saturday at 4.53 pm.

The gunman was nabbed by protesters on the spot and handed over to police, said an eyewitness. However, police claimed the man was overpowered by police.

“The accused fired in air near police barricades. He was overpowered by police personnel and taken into custody. Further investigation is on,” said Chinmoy Biswal, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast).

Even while the man was in the grip of police, he was heard chanting Jai Shri Ram and was also shouting “Hamare desh mein kisi ki nahi chalegi, sirf Hinduon ki chalegi.”

The accused has been identified as Kapil Baisla, a resident of East Delhi’s Dallupura village, and he is a milk supplier, said sources. However, police are yet to ascertain his identity.

Mirza Azhan Beg (25), a local resident who was standing in front of the accused, said the accused started raising slogans Jai Shree Ram, Desh ke gaddaro ko goli maro salon ko. Yaha bas Hinduon ka raj chalega.

“Police were standing a few metres away when the accused fired. Police overpowered him. He has thrown his weapon, suspected to be a country made pistol, in the bushes,” said Beg.

One of the women protestors, who didn’t wish to be named, said they were inside the tent when the incident happened. “We rushed to the spot after hearing gunshots. Many women and children were there inside the tent when incident happened. Everyone is scared about their safety,” she said.

Another woman protestor said that those who are against their protest are trying to scare them but the protestors will not step back. “The outsiders are trying to derail this movement but we will not let this happen,” she said.

A police official said that the man is not associated with any political outfit and he was angry at the ongoing protest and wanted to scare the protestors.

Reacting to the incident, AAP leader Sanjay Singh said they had already warned the Election Commission that a conspiracy is being hatched by the BJP to postpone the polls.

“There is no law and order in the country. The gun-toting men are making Delhi their bastion (adda).We have been seeking time from the Election Commission since yesterday so that we can make them aware of these developments but they have not given us any time,” he said.

In a veiled attack on the BJP over the incident, the Congress said the shooter has changed but the ideology pulling the trigger in 1948 or 2020 has remained the same.

Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill tweeted, “Shooter changes but ideology pulling the trigger either in 1948 (Nathuram Godse) or 2020 remains the same ‘Goli Maro’ -- Hands which should be pulling India’s growth are now firing guns.”

“Instead of ‘Make in India’ focus is on ‘spreading hate in India’”, he alleged.

However, senior BJP leader B L Santhosh insinuated involvement of party’s rivals in the recent shooting incidents, saying the “great drama party of Delhi is becoming too costly for the country”.

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during a poll rally in Delhi’s northwest Rohini area alleged that those who support terrorists in Kashmir are staging protest at Shaheen Bagh.

Hitting out at the AAP dispensation, Adityanath said that the Arvind Kejriwal Government “supplies biryani” to protesters at Shaheen Bagh.

This is the second incident in Delhi at an anti-CAA protest which has taken place just two km away from Jamia Millia Islamia where on Thursday a 17-year-old Class 12 boy from Uttar Pradesh fired a crude pistol at unarmed protesters with dozens of policemen behind him.

The teenager, who left home claiming he was going to school, took a bus to Delhi intending to target Shaheen Bagh but landed at Jamia next-door after an auto-driver dropped him off there to avoid the traffic chaos.

The Shaheen Bagh protest has attracted attention from across the country in the protests against the CAA and NRC.

On Monday, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur while addressing an election rally had raised the slogan of ‘desh ke gaddaron ko’ (traitors in the country) as the crowd responded with ‘goli maaron sa***n ko’.

The next day, BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma said protesters at Shaheen Bagh could “enter homes and rape our sisters and daughters”.

The Election commission asked the BJP to remove both Thakur and Verma from the list of star campaigners.

It also barred Thakur from campaigning for three days and Verma for four days for their controversial remarks.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shaheen-bagh-nears-climax-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/shaheen-bagh-nears-climax.html
179,02-2-20,"Bigg Boss 13: Asim Riaz, Mahira Sharma's Jammu connection","People expected Asim Riaz and Mahira Sharma to get along with each other when they entered the ""Bigg Boss"" house, considering their Jammu and Kashmir connection. Now, after over 100 days of the show, it is clear that they might share their roots but vehemently remain divided by the game.

Jammu-born model Asim has turned out to be the ultimate poster boy on season 13 of the controversial reality show, while Mahira adds to the oomph factor.

Asim got popular first as a ""vanilla"" boy and then as the angry young man of ""Bigg Boss 13"". On the other hand, Mahira made headlines for her ""maslas"" (fights) with the contestants, and her close bond with actor and housemate Paras Chhabra.

They might play a different game, but one can see similarity in the pattern.

Asim, born on 13 July 1993, received his primary education at Delhi Public School in Jammu. He now lives here and has been featured in many TV commercials including Blackberrys, B'lue and Numero Uno. He has an elder brother named Umar Riaz who is a doctor by profession.

Asim started his journey on the show as the ""vanilla"" boy, flaunting his chiselled body and rapping skills, before gradually morphing into the angry young man of ""Bigg Boss"" with his constant verbal (and aggressive) spats with the other housemates.

As he entered the show he created a buzz after getting into a fight with Paras. It all started when Mahira ended up calling Asim her ""brother"", because both of them hail from Jammu and Kashmir, at the launch of the show in September last year.

The other male contestants asked Asim not to let Mahira call him ""bhai"" because then he could romance her in the show. Paras advised him to channel his anger, and in no time, they got into a heated argument, during which Paras said he would slap Asim.

That set the foundation of his relationship with Mahira, who started her career as a model.

From locking horns over duties to accusing him of disrespecting women to seeking sympathy from audience to instigating fights -- Mahira has levelled many accusations on Asim, and doesn't get along with him.

For the uninitiated, Mahira is also from Jammu and Kashmir. In 2016, she bagged the role of Shilpi in ""Y.A.R.O Ka Tashan"", and going on to appear in comedy serials like ""Partners Trouble Ho Gayi Double"" and ""Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah"". She is also known for featuring in romantic drama ""Kundali Bhagya"" and ""Naagin 3"". In addition to TV shows, she has also featured in the music videos of many Punjabi songs including ""Nikk's relation"", ""Love you oye"", ""Lehanga"" and ""Gal karke"".

In fact, when Mahira's mother entered the ""Bigg Boss"" house as part of a task, she called Asim her son. Still, there's no improvement in Asim and Mahira's bond.

As the show nears its finale, it will be interesting to see if Asim and Mahira's use their connection to get ahead in the game, or still remain foes.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bigg-boss-13--asim-riaz--mahira-sharma-s-jammu-connection-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/bigg-boss-13--asim-riaz--mahira-sharma-s-jammu-connection.html

*ing: Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Alaya Furniturewala, Kubra Sait, Chunky Pandey, Farida Jalal, Kiku Sharda

Rated: 7/10

Saif Ali Khan, guys, is out to have fun. That too as the solo Punjabi munda with a high libido ji and a low commitment yaraa, selling property-shoperty in the heart of little India in London. His nights are lit up at his friend’s night club where women flow in and out of his bed as smoothly as the peg-sheg, notwithstanding the hair-dye and kala chashma for the girl-shirls.

Does he have a heart too? The film, knd of makes it its business to find out and insert one when all you think will be lost on this fiercely anti-marriage all fun old man with young drives.

It is a fun film with Saif hogging the show with his demeanour till, of course, his daughter from a Norwegian one night stand appears at his doorstep, with a being human worksheet.

Star child Alaya Furniturewala is a beauty not just because she looks good but because she acts well too and has her own kind of screen presence which is obviously young and also refreshing.

Tabu is a let down because she is no good but because she is on the sidelines with a 10-minute presence as a gonner hippy mom of the Alaya, who incidentally is 21 and pregnant.

In one go, Saif becomes papa and nana from being this cool dude engaged in alcoholic downer campaigns in his singleton life.

Chunky Pandey as the friend who gives him life lessons, Farida Jalal as the silent mom and Kiku sharda as the doctor who gives him DNA proof of Alaya being his daughter are all short-shrifted and could have added many more moments in the film.

But then Jawaani Jaaneman is only about Saif’s journey from haze and daze to a phase of responsibility and familyhood, to realisation and humanness. Thanks to the director, this journey is punctuated with laughter and jokes, making the mount an unlikely candidate for a hit film. Must go and enjoy with your popcorn, cola and, of course, the old time songs that add lots to the film.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saif--fun---frolic-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/saif--fun---frolic.html

Rated: 6/10

When the first Bad Boys movie had released back in 1995 — yes more than two dacades back — nobody would have thought that the series would surive this long. More so, since the last Bad Boys movie was released back in 2003. In these intervenng years, a lot has changed for the Miami Police Department finest — Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett.

The duo in their career spanning over 20 years, put away over 800 criminals and each one of them wants to kill them. Who is after Mike, so much so that they want to make him suffer before putting a bullet in him? That is what this last movie in the series is about — the last ride so to say.

Interestingly, Mike and Marcus want different things from life after Marcus becomes a grandfather. The two parts ways with Mike saving his partner’s name in his phone as Quitter. But they are bad boys for life. And time and circumstances throw the two together for a ride that has car chases, bulltes flying, bodies dropping like flies all over the place.

Then there is the whole detecting the case old school versus using technology to chase a case throws interesting moments that make you smile and brings in the much needed lighter moments amidst all the blood.

Will Smith may not have lost his touch as the bad boy but he does look like age has finally caught up with him and maybe he is way past the age where he fits this role.

But it still doesn’t take away the fun from the film. We just hope that Bod Boys for Life are there in the future as well.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/these-bad-boys-are-explosive-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/these-bad-boys-are-explosive.html

184,02-2-20,High-tempo music may improve benefits of endurance training: Study,"Researchers have demonstrated for the first time that listening to high-tempo music may increase the benefits of exercise, and reduce perceived effort, particularly during endurance training.

According to the researchers, including those from the University of Verona in Italy, while earlier studies have documented some of the beneficial links between music and exercise, the specific properties of music that affect us during training remains unknown.

The current study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, assessed 19 active women in their mid 20s during endurance walking for 10 minutes on a treadmill, and high intensity exercise under four different randomly assigned conditions -- without music, and with music played at low, moderate, and high tempo.

The scientists recorded a variety of parameters, including the volunteers' opinions about the effort required to complete the exercises, and their heart rate while exercising.

""We found that listening to high-tempo music while exercising resulted in the highest heart rate, and lowest perceived exertion compared with not listening to music,"" explained study co-author Luca P. Ardigo of the University of Verona in Italy.

""This means that the exercise seemed like less effort, but it was more beneficial in terms of enhancing physical fitness,"" Ardigo added.

According to the researchers, the effects were more noticeable in volunteers completing the endurance exercise sessions, compared with those performing high-intensity exercises.

Based on this finding, the scientists suggested that people performing endurance activities such as walking or running may receive the greatest benefit from listening to high-tempo music.

However, the researchers cautioned that the sample size of the study was small, and larger studies in the future are needed to continue exploring the nuances of how music affects our training.

""In the current study, we investigated the effect of music tempo in exercise, but in the future we would also like to study the effects of other music features such as genre, melody, or lyrics, on endurance and high intensity exercise,"" Ardigo said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/high-tempo-music-may-improve-benefits-of-endurance-training--study-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/high-tempo-music-may-improve-benefits-of-endurance-training--study.html
185,02-2-20,"Get post-Brexit budget done quickly, say 15 EU states","EU countries need to reach a swift agreement on the bloc's next budget after the loss of Britain and its hefty financial contribution, 15 member states agreed in Portugal Saturday.

The ""Friends of Cohesion"" group of 17 eastern and Mediterranean countries, the EU's poorer members, also agreed to fight any move to cut the EU Cohesion Fund reserved for the bloc's weaker economies.

""More than ever we have to affirm the cohesion of the European Union, as it is now more fragile with the departure of the United Kingdom,"" Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa told journalists in Beja, southern Portugal.

Fifteen countries agreed to defend the Cohesion Fund.

Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain all signed the closing statement.

Italy chose not to sign. Croatia was the other non-signatory, choosing to remain neutral as it holds the rotating EU presidency.

Charles Michel, president of the European Council which represents the 27 member state governments, has called a special budget summit in three weeks' time to agree the bloc's budget for 2021-2027.

Members are divided on the budget, and some observers fear the talks may drag on for days.

""It's urgent to reach an agreement on the next European budget and the member states who met today made it clear they want to reach an definitive agreement on February 20,"" Costa said.

With Britain leaving, so is its 12-billion-euro (13-billion) contribution to EU finances -- even if it will keep making contributions this year under the agreed post-Brexit transition period.

The Cohesion Fund is for member state whose per-capita gross national income (GNI) is less than 90 percent of the EU average.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/get-post-brexit-budget-done-quickly--say-15-eu-states-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/get-post-brexit-budget-done-quickly--say-15-eu-states.html
186,02-2-20,"Iraqi president names new PM, dividing protesters","Iraq's president named former communications minister Mohammad Allawi as the country's new prime minister on Saturday after an 11th-hour consensus among political blocs, but the streets seemed divided on his nomination.

Baghdad and the mainly Shiite south have been gripped by four months of anti-government rallies demanding snap elections, a politically independent prime minister and accountability for corruption and protest-related violence.

Faced with pressure from the street and the Shiite religious leadership, Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi resigned in December and political life came to a standstill.

In a bid to end the paralysis, President Barham Saleh gave political blocs until Saturday to name a replacement to Abdel Mahdi or else he would appoint his own candidate.

On Saturday evening, Allawi posted a video to Twitter saying Saleh had nominated him as the new premier.

""After the president appointed me to form a new government a short while ago, I wanted to talk to you first,"" he said, addressing the camera in colloquial Iraqi dialect.

""I will ask you to keep up the protests, because if you are not with me, I won't be able to do anything,"" Allawi said.

There was no announcement from Saleh but Abdel Mahdi congratulated his successor and powerful cleric Moqtada Sadr swiftly endorsed Allawi.

""This is a good step,"" tweeted Sadr, who controls the largest bloc in parliament and key ministerial posts.

""I hope the president's appointment of Mohammad Allawi is acceptable to the people and that they have patience,"" he wrote.

But many protesters across Iraq were unconvinced.

Within minutes of the announcement, many in Baghdad's main protest camp of Tahrir Square began chanting ""Allawi is rejected, Allawi is rejected!"" Demonstrators hit the streets in the holy city of Najaf, pledging to escalate their movement further as Allawi was not the independent they had long demanded.

""Mohammad Allawi's nomination came with the approval of the same corrupt political blocs we've been protesting against for over four months,"" said lawyer Hassan Mayahi, marching in the southern hotspot of Diwaniyah.

Meanwhile, the United States issued a carefully worded statement, saying it hoped Allawi's nomination would lead to ""an independent and honest government committed to addressing the needs of the Iraqi people."" Despite the prime minister-designate's call for them to keep rallying, protesters were skeptical he would be able to implement their demands.

According to the constitution, he now has one month to form a cabinet which would need a vote of confidence from parliament.

In Iraq, the cabinet is typically formed by consensus among political rivals after intense horsetrading over influential posts.

""If the (political) blocs try to impose their candidates on me, I'll come out and talk to you and leave this nomination,"" Allawi said.

Allawi, a Shiite Muslim, was a member of the secular Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc which was headed by his cousin and former prime minister Iyad Allawi.

He served as communications minister twice under former PM Nuri al-Maliki but resigned both times, alleging corruption and interference in personnel appointments.

Maliki, who still holds sway in Iraq's parliament, is said to have rejected Allawi's candidacy but other political blocs came to a consensus amid pressure by the president. Sadr, too, had renewed his push for an end to the political crisis after suspending his support for the rallies for one week.

He endorsed the protests in October then appeared to change his mind last month, saying he would no longer ""interfere"" in the movement.

His hard-core backers -- the most well-organised of the demonstrators -- promptly dismantled their tents in protest camps across the country.

But on Friday he seemed to flip again, calling for his supporters ""to renew the peaceful, reformist revolution."" They flooded in the streets on Saturday afternoon, setting up tents in Tahrir with portraits of Sadr and blaring music praising him just hours before Allawi's nomination.

The move came after both the United Nations and Iraq's top Shiite religious authority both called for an end to the political paralysis gripping Iraq.

The UN's top official in Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert had tweeted Friday that solutions were ""urgently needed"" to ""break the political deadlock"".

And the country's top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani urged Iraq's political parties to ""accelerate the formation of a new government"".

""It is imperative to speed up holding early elections so that the people will have their say,"" he said in his sermon, which also demanded an end to bloodshed.

More than 480 people have died in protest-related violence since October, the great majority of them demonstrators killed by live rounds or military-grade tear gas canisters.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iraqi-president-names-new-pm--dividing-protesters-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iraqi-president-names-new-pm--dividing-protesters.html

188,02-2-20,We need everyone to be the best version of themselves: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Sunday said he wants his players to be the ""best version of themselves"" in order to dominate world cricket in the coming years.

India notched up a rare 5-0 whitewash over New Zealand with a seven-run win in the fifth and final T20 International here.

""We need everyone to be the best versions of themselves. It is all about laying the vision in front of the boys, the way you think, prepare. The guys are taking notice of it and they realise that the team needs 120 percent from them every time,"" Kohli said.

""Because only then you will find ways to win. That has been a massive change for us in the last two-three years. We have seen the results; we obviously won't win everything and these victories give a lot more pleasure than the one-sided victories.""

With Kohli resting himself from the inconsequential final game, Rohit Sharma was the stand-in skipper, but the opener suffered a calf injury while batting and had to retire hurt.

In his absence, K L Rahul led the side to victory.

Heaping praise on the team at the presentation ceremony, Kohli said: ""All of us are really proud of how we played. It's about finding ways to win. Today, all these young guys were on the field after Rohit's unfortunate injury and them coming together and handling the pressure.

""That gives me a lot of pleasure watching from the outside and they will take this momentum going forward for many years.""

Kohli also backed under-fire New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, saying he is the right man to lead the Black Caps despite the 0-5 drubbing.

""Kane and me have similar mindsets, similar philosophies. It is amazing that despite being from different parts of the world, we have similar thinkings and we speak the same language,"" he said.

""Despite what the scoreline suggests, I feel that New Zealand cricket is in the best hands and he is the right guy to lead this team. He is the perfect, perfect man to lead them. I wish him the best of luck and power to lead this side in the future. They are a side everyone loves to watch and play against.""

It was the first time that New Zealand lost three or more matches in a bilateral T20I series at home. The hosts had gone down 0-2 to England back in February 2008.

New Zealand stand-in skipper Tim Southee said there wasn't much difference between the two sides.

""It's another close one, unfortunately on the wrong side again. If you give them a sniff, they take it with both hands. I don't think it is a massive gap, the scoreline does suggest that, but we only need to do the smaller things better,"" he said.

The two teams will next play a three-match ODI series beginning on February 5 and Southee hoped that the hosts will put up a better show with new players coming into the side.

""The ODIs are a different format, new personnel come in and it is a format where we have done well,"" he said.

India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for his three-wickets haul, said he always had the belief that a couple of good overs can change the complexion of the game.

""Feeling very good. The match got close at one point but we had belief that if we can squeeze in one or two good overs, the match can get close,"" he said.

""It was windy, I was trying to use the wind and the longer side of the boundary. Very happy with the learnings, different ground dimensions, first time in New Zealand, great result.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-need-everyone-to-be-the-best-version-of-themselves--kohli-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/we-need-everyone-to-be-the-best-version-of-themselves--kohli.html
189,02-2-20,0-5 series whitewash by India hurts: Taylor,"Senior New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor on Sunday admitted that the 0-5 whitewash by India has hurt his side badly and the whole T20I series has been a disappointment for them.

Taylor, however, said his side played better cricket than the results suggest though they knew from the beginning that it was going to a be tough task against a strong Indian team.

""The whole series has been a disappointment, the way we put ourselves in good positions and just were not able to capitalize. When you are up against a world-class side like India, we have played a lot worse and got better results than this,"" Taylor said after New Zealand lost the fifth and final match by seven runs to hand India a rare series whitewash.

""Even though it's a different format (than ODI and Test), it still does hurt. Winning is a habit and losing those tight games. But we are going into a format that is one of our strengths. In ODI cricket, hopefully Kane's shoulder is all right, new personnel and some world-class players coming back and we are looking forward,"" he said of the three-match ODI series from February 5-12.

He said New Zealand have given a strong Indian side room to take advantage out of it and they had suffered from that.

""You can't give this Indian side an inch, we gave them a lot more than that and they took advantage. You got to learn a lot quicker than we are now with both bat and ball. Until then, we will get similar results,"" he said, referring to the instances when New Zealand lost two matches in Super Over.

Taylor, however, hailed the Indian team for being able to win series away from home.

""More often than not it is tough to win away from home but to come over here with a couple of their star players missing that would add a different balance to their side. I am sure it is very good for Indian cricket.

""I probably say this, we were completely outplayed in the series last year and we came back and won that semi-final in the World Cup. Whenever we play India in a T20I game, we know it will be an uphill task but we know we can still beat them when it counts hopefully,"" he added.

Taylor, who hit 53 on Sunday, said the target of 164 was achievable but the Kiwis came up short in a tight chase and could not recover from a poor start.

""I thought we were under pressure when I came out there. The way Tim Seifert came out and batted, we got ourselves to what once again would normally be a comfortable scenario with 66 off 60 balls. You win, maybe 95 times (from there),"" said the 35-year-old right-handed batsman.

""When you got a world-class bowler like Bumrah, you have got to skin the cat slightly differently and he is able to be their X-factor for them. The way (Navdeep) Saini and others bowled put us under some pressure and wickets fell at different times,"" he said, explaining how New Zealand batsmen lost their plot.

Talking about the 34 runs conceded by Shivam Dube in one over, he said, ""Up until the over where we got 30-odd runs, it was probably in India's favour. With that short boundary, we knew we had to put them under pressure.

""We were only trying to get 15 or 16 off the over. So, we will take the 30. Once again, we got out ourselves in some really good positions in this series. We just were not able to capitalize and put the foot on throat,"" he said.

Taylor became the first male New Zealand cricketer to play 100 T20I on Sunday but he said his joy was was not complete as his side lost the match.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/0-5-series-whitewash-by-india-hurts--taylor-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/0-5-series-whitewash-by-india-hurts--taylor.html

Aditya said Bhatt pushes his actors to give their best.

""He is such a beautiful director to work with. He gets you into a certain emotional space and believes it is his job to get you there. It is a priceless thing to have as an actor for a director to come and explain it to you.

192,02-2-20,Anil Kapoor: You can play a cop again and again,"Actor Anil Kapoor is one of Bollywood's favourite cops, thanks to his roles in movies such as ""Ram Lakhan"" and ""Race"". He has donned the khaki uniform once again for his upcoming film ""Malang"".

Bollywood has had many actors essaying the role of police officers. Asked what makes him a different cop in ""Malang"", Anil told IANS here: ""My early memories of cop is 'Ardh Satya'. Om Puri gave one of his finest performances in it. I was really shaken up when I saw the film. I really loved the film. Om was terrific as a police officer.

""Then of course, there was 'Zanjeer' which was a mainstream commercial film. After that I think it was 'Ram Lakhan' - a mainstream commercial film where I played a cop who just wanted to be rich, even if he had to go against the system. I did other films as well where I played a cop"", he said.

The list of actors playing police officers in films goes on.

""There is Ajay (Devgn) who played a cop in 'Singham', Salman (Khan) in 'Dabangg'. When this role (in 'Malang') was offered to me, first I said 'let me not do this role because I have already played a cop'. There is a tendency of people saying that 'You are playing a cop again',"" he said.

But then he realised that ""cop is something that you can play again and again"".

Sharing an example from Hollywood, he said: ""Clint Eastwood has played so many of these roles (cop roles) like in 'Dirty Harry'.""

Talking abut his role, Anil said: ""It is a pretty dark role. I said 'I have not played such a dark character'. I wanted to be little more fun and watchable also. It's a commercial film. I have tried to make it as interesting as I could.""

His look in the upcoming film has already got a thumbs up from many people. Did he give inputs to his cop look, he said: ""Yes, it is a collaborative look. Mohit (Suri) wanted an all-black look but I said 'No, you know all-black... I am playing a cop so it might not look real. It might look slightly stylised'.

""Then I added the cop shirt. The red glasses was his (Mohit's) idea. The tattoo was also his idea,"" he added.

He let his natural grey hair shine in the film.

""There is a lot of anger which he (his character) has towards the department, the system and a lot of anger towards Goa. He feels that Goa is not the way it used to be. Keeping all this in mind, I thought my hair and all should be dishevelled and he is 50 plus, so he should look like he is 50 plus. I have grey hair. I said 'Let me leave my real grey hair', which you see in the film. It's not artificial,"" Anil said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/anil-kapoor--you-can-play-a-cop-again-and-again-2020-02-02.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/anil-kapoor--you-can-play-a-cop-again-and-again.html
