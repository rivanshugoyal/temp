0,12-3-20,A new beginning,"With the promise of acknowledging the awam as the real stakeholders, the newly-floated JKAP is making a big departure from the prevailing cult of personality-driven politics

March 7, 2020 will be flagged as a very significant date in the short history of the newly-formed Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). On this day, the first major political development took place post the reorganisation of the erstwhile State, announced on August 5, 2019 with the abrogation of Article 370. A new political entity, the Jammu Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP), was launched formally. The intransigent attitude of the “Gupkar gang” to accept the new reality — that separatism and terrorism would be things of the past as would dynastic rule — had brought to a standstill political activity, the heartbeat of democracy. The indifference shown by the Kashmiris towards the Gupkar Gang had not only taken them by surprise but also conveyed a message that the people in Kashmir are fed up with opportunistic parties bordering separatism.

The people were hoping for a new leadership to fill the political vacuum thus created. They were hoping that the old order would give place to a realist regime. However, complexities of Kashmiri politics prevented that from happening. In that scenario, the initiative was seized by a group of old politicians, who were willing to accept the new reality and move away from soft separatism. Unfortunately, the new entity comprises rejects of the old order.

This is significant considering the administration’s attempt to devolve power to grassroot leadership through development of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) has failed to yield the desired results due to various reasons. Though the BJP continued to raise issues of public interest, the people were feeling the lack of a viable alternative. Thus, the formation of the JKAP, drawing from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the National Conference (NC) under the stewardship of ex-PDP Minister Altaf Bukhari, has raised some hope, if not generate reassurance. On the face of it, the new party is an amalgamation of leaders who have parted ways with the parties led by the intransigent Gupkar Gang. The biggest sufferers are the disintegrated PDP and the sinking Sonia Congress. A sangam (confluence) of differing ideologies, beliefs and loyalties, the JKAP has yet to come out with a clear-cut ideology which would guide its future course and survival, since no political party can survive merely with the assurance of raising the current issues faced by the awam in the changed scenario.

Nonetheless, it is a very bold move under the present circumstances, though it could turn into as much of a puppet as the NC or the PDP. The easiest way for it would be to pass the buck without carrying out any introspection within its own house. The new party has an advantage to begin with but it would need political acumen, personal sacrifices and matured leadership to turn this advantage into a successful combination with wide acceptance. It would need to avoid being labelled as yet another Kashmir-centric party by adopting a holistic approach and rising above regional and religious considerations. It appears to be a Herculean task going by the present composition of the party because most of the heavyweights belong to Kashmir and the leaders who have joined from Jammu do not enjoy the same status. Most of the ex-legislators have their own pockets of influence and hence will ensure the party’s penetration among the awam.

The party has chosen a few issues on a priority basis and flagged them to be raised on behalf of the people. However, these will serve no purpose except to keep the people amused temporarily. The reversion to Statehood, which is on the top of the agenda, is a non-issue as it has been repeatedly said that the existing arrangement is temporary with a view to fighting terrorism, separatism and widespread corruption. Both the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, architects of the reorganisation, have assured the nation on more than one occasion that statehood would be restored as soon as normalcy is achieved. To keep its promise alive, the Union Government has ensured separate awards by the 14th and 15th National Finance Commissions for J&K and Ladakh UTs, as a departure from the routine practice of combined awards to the Home Ministry in respect of the UTs.

Negotiating the domicile laws for people of the UT could be controversial and tricky for it. The people fear that such a move will further curtail employment opportunities for the youth of the UT and lead to a demographic disruption in the Valley.

Their apprehensions were further fuelled by the fact that the J&K High Court on December 31, 2019 invited applications from across the country for filling 33 vacant non-gazetted posts. Thankfully, the notification was cancelled after Opposition parties in Jammu slammed the move and pressed for enactment of laws for safeguarding the interests of the local youths. Though the notification has been withdrawn by the Government for the time being, the Centre is reportedly examining other options for opening up employment opportunities, land ownership rights and seats in institutions of higher education, including professional colleges, for non-Kashmiris. This is similar to what has been done in other States like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and other Northeastern states, which are covered under Article 371 of the Constitution.

Fortunately, the party has not set its eyes on early elections and has given adequate hints of it not expecting the elections to be held in the next one to two years, till the process of fresh delimitation is completed. The fact that the party admits to the need for meeting “rational aspirations” of the people, without promising them the “moon and the stars”, sounds good but one only hopes that it sticks to its promise in letter and spirit.

The bane of J&K politics has been the “wada khilafi” (broken promises) made by the Gupkar Gang, that led to the disillusionment of the youth and was one of the causes of the emergence of the “gun culture” in Kashmir. With the promise of acknowledging the awam as the real stakeholders, the newly-floated party is making a big departure from the prevailing cult of personality-driven politics. Another noble thought, but one that needs to be watched as the days go by, since actions will speak louder than words.

Altaf Bukhari in his press conference also mentioned the Jammu & Kashmir Bank and it being “converted into sub-office of the Anti-Corruption Bureau.” Here one wonders if the businessman in him has overshadowed the righteous politician image that he perceives to build. The people are elated by the fact that the Jammu & Kashmir Bank has been saved from becoming a personal fiefdom of the Gupkar Gang and is now being reformed to become a true bank of the people. They want the corrupt to be exposed, nepotism and favouritism prevailing in the bank to end and for the awam be the real beneficiary. Bukhari and his party will have to come out with a clear stand on this. The major issue left with the party immediately is to focus on development and the economic well-being of the UT. It is heartening that Bukhari has chosen to draw inspiration from Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, whose tenure at the helm of the State’s affairs can undoubtedly be termed as the golden era of economic development. Bakshi not only avoided discriminatory politics but also did not allow the rise of fundamentalists in the Valley by encouraging and promoting the Sufi culture. One can just hope that the JKAP rises to those ideals and works for the return of peace, harmony and co-existence, the hallmark of the Bakshi era. The party must come out with its vision document at the earliest and formulate a clear road map for economic revival with alternatives and options rather than sheer rhetoric. Bukhari and his team will do well to remember that there is always resistance to any transition and change management should form the JKAP’s key strategy. Neither should he allow himself to be used as a mouthpiece and implementer of Delhi. His integrationist ways should not result in a trust deficit all over again.

1,12-3-20,A death knell for religious economy,"Like all others, the religious tourism industry is also praying for a quick containment and cure for the Coronavirus epidemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has investors and economists all around the world gravely concerned. The negative impact of the Coronavirus on the global economy and businesses was neither a surprise nor the only outcome. In the light of the risk of exposure to the Coronavirus, several notable summits/meetings/events have been suspended, deferred or postponed. It has had a widespread impact on the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) and event industry globally, not only in terms of the money invested being lost but also brand values seeing a fall.

Many companies have come up with innovative solutions to continue their brand communications and consumer connect in view of cancellations or general aversion to physically attending the events. Keeping safety/health concerns front and centre, brands have showcased solidarity with Governments, the medical and scientific fraternity trying to stem the spread of the Coronavirus and have immediately cancelled or postponed plans for big events.

However, beyond the impact on the manufacturing, production, sports and tourism industry there is another industry that has been severely affected by the Coronavirus that is still to be realised by the world at large. The chaos over the virus has affected the international religious economy. While different industries and brands can utilise innovative solutions to avoid physically attending events, the religious economy is suffering as it does not have that option. Simply put, it operates differently. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised major social distancing among other basic protective measures to avoid the risk associated with exposure to the Coronavirus at any public event involving a global audience. The religious industry, which dogmatically relies on the physical presence of the devotees, has seen a major setback due to this.

So, for starters, Saudi Arabia suspended the entry of pilgrims as a precautionary measure against the spread of Coronavirus. Soon after the number of Coronavirus-related casualties touched 3,000, Saudi Arabia sterilised the Grand Mosque and banned all foreign pilgrims from entering the country. The kingdom has also suspended tourist visas from countries where the Coronavirus is spreading.

Italy is bearing the worst brunt of the Coronavirus. With more than 10,000 people having now been confirmed to have the virus, Italy is under a national lockdown and even tougher measures are being considered. Religious tourism and allied industries have taken a major hit due to the loss of pilgrims coming to Rome and due to Pope Francis cancelling a lot of events in the last few weeks after the virus attacked Italy. The Pope, 83, was also tested for the virus after suffering from illness at the time when the outbreak happened in Italy. He, however tested negative but the Pope still cancelled all major events avoiding large public gatherings as a precautionary measure in a bid to slow the spread of Coronavirus. Authorities have imposed restrictions on the catechism and mass services across the country as well. JP Morgan now expects Italy’s economy to contract 7.5 per cent in the first quarter from the previous quarter, with a modest two per cent pick-up in the second quarter before a full rebound in the third quarter.

Meanwhile, all churches and mosques have been closed in Bethlehem for 14 days, including the world-renowned Church of Nativity. The measure has been accompanied by a closure of all schools in Bethlehem and Jericho areas after Greek tourists staying at a Bethlehem hotel left for Greece and later tested positive for the virus.

At the Sanctuary of Lourdes in France, the authorities have said the pilgrimage season beginning next month will go ahead as usual. However, as Coronavirus cases continue to grow in neighbouring Italy, it is only a matter of time before the pilgrimage season here also comes under threat. As of now, only the pools that sick people bathe in to heal have been closed until further notice.

Another global religious leader, the Dalai Lama also added to the list of cancelled events and postponed them all until further notice, including his annual teachings that were scheduled in March. According to the Dalai Lama’s website, “As a precautionary measure, in view of the Coronavirus outbreak, all engagements of His Holiness the Dalai Lama remain indefinitely postponed. Thank you for your understanding.”

However, the coronavirus epidemic is not the first virus outbreak that has affected the religious economy and spirituality at large. Disease outbreaks have always been a matter of concern surrounding the Haj, for instance and Saudi Arabia’s borders were partially closed to pilgrims from some countries during previous global health scares, such as the Ebola in 2014. Even the Zika virus epidemic of 2016 majorly affected the economic, political, social and religious sector including the cancellation of Haj and suspension of church community activities among others. So, like all others, the religious tourism industry is also praying for a quick containment and cure for this epidemic.

2,12-3-20,Uddhav doing a tightrope walk,"The three partners — Sena, NCP and the Congress — should keep asserting their respective positions for public consumption and Uddhav should keep harping on his Hindutva ideology. This is the only way the coalition can continue

Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray is trying to do a fine balancing act between what he calls his own brand of Hindutva and the secularism of his new-found coalition partners — the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Significantly, Uddhav’s ideological platform revolves around Hindutva, which is at odds with the “secular” political agenda of his ruling coalition partners.

Claiming that his brand of Hindutva is different from that of the BJP he clarified recently, “We don’t have the same thought process. I don’t want a Hindu Rashtra (nation), which is not peaceful. Using religion and grabbing power is not my idea of Hindutva.” The Maharashtra Chief Minister is keen to ensure that his ideological platform remains intact by asserting time and again that he has not abandoned the Hindutva nurtured carefully by the Sena founder, the late Balasaheb Thackeray.

No one knows the perils of having an anti-Hindutva image better than Uddhav and hence the stress on the Hindutva roots. He knows that Sena workers might suffer any humiliation out of love for him but they will never digest being called anti-Hindu. And they want Uddhav to give the BJP a befitting reply to the saffron party’s smear campaign, painting them as anti-Hindu.

Also he has realised that ceding the Hindutva space might cost him big, given his cousin Raj Thackeray’s recent efforts to rebrand himself as a pro-Hindutva leader. Uddhav has to reclaim the space. Hence, Uddhav’s much-publicised visit to Ayodhya last week is part of his new political strategy.

The Maharashtra ruling coalition headed by Uddhav recently completed 100 days in office. To mark the occasion, the Chief Minister visited Ayodhya with his family and announced a donation of Rs 1 crore for building the proposed Ram temple.

“This sum is not from the Maharashtra Government but from my trust,” he announced pointing out that it was his third visit to the temple town, in the last one-and-a-half years.

Addressing a huge crowd in Ayodhya, he said, “I have parted ways with the BJP but not with Hindutva.” The Sena mouthpiece Saamana also in its latest editorial said Lord Ram and Hindutva were not the sole property of any single political party. So it is clear that Uddhav is designing his own brand of Hindutva.

The Chief Minister has been consistent in his assertion and even told the Assembly on December 1, 2019, “I am still with the ideology of Hindutva which cannot be separated from me.” The fact that Uddhav’s coalition partners understand his need for asserting his ideological identity was visible when his plans to visit Ayodhya were announced. The local Congress leaders were quick to make it clear that they had no problem with it because the Congress, too, was in favour of building the Ram temple in Ayodhya. In fact, a significant number of local Congress and NCP leaders feel that the alliance has helped them to counter the BJP propaganda that they were pro-Muslims.

Though Uddhav has kept his party intact after the death of his father these past seven years, heading the Government and running a coalition are new challenges for him.

For instance, despite the bonhomie, the coalition partners had some anxious moments when Uddhav did flip-flops on contentious issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR). In December 2019, Uddhav said the CAA will not be implemented in Maharashtra and subsequently after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi in February, he said the law has been misunderstood. He also spoke in favour of the NPR.

Frowning on this indecisiveness, Congress leader Manish Tewari tweeted, “CM Maharashtra @UddhavThackeray requires a briefing on Citizenship Amendment Rules, 2003 to understand how NPR is the basis of the NRC. Once you do NPR you cannot stop NRC. On CAA he needs to be reacquainted with the design of the Indian Constitution that religion cannot be the basis of Citizenship (sic).”

Now Uddhav has announced a committee to study the NPR and he had also assured the legislators before the start of the Budget Session that contentious issues would not be allowed to disturb the coalition.

However, despite the best efforts on the part of the coalition partners, all these issues have made the delicate equation a little more fragile. Though the stakes are high for all the three partners of the Maha Vikas Aghadi Government to keep the coalition going, the Sena, in particular is vulnerable, as it had to go for this partnership to remain relevant in Maharashtra politics. This was the calculation that the Sena made when it parted company with the BJP. And, with the perception quickly gaining ground that Uddhav was diluting his Hindutva identity due to coalition compulsions, he had to move fast and reassure his cadre that the ideology was intact. Being a regional party, the Sena will have nothing to fall back upon if the party gets weakened and there is a risk that Sainiks might shift to the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) or the BJP. Therefore, all that he is doing is to protect his turf while swearing by the Common Minimum Programme, which swears by secularism.

Meanwhile, as a strategy, the three partners should keep asserting their respective positions for public consumption and Uddhav should keep harping on his Hindutva ideology. This is the only way that the coalition Government can continue.

4,12-3-20,Three rapes rock state,"

|

The state was rocked by three sensational cases of rapes of three minor girls, including murder of two of the victims, on Holi.

In the first incident reported from Unnao, a class 4 girl died of excessive bleeding after she was allegedly raped by a man, who fled after attempting to strangle her in a village, police said on Wednesday.

The girl died while undergoing treatment in Kanpur’s Hallet Hospital.

The incident took place during Holi celebration on Tuesday in a village under Bihar police station and the accused fled the spot, according to Bighapur Circle Officer Anjani Rai.

The police officer said, “The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon when Holi celebrations were going on. The girl was raped after which the rapist tried to kill her by throttling her neck.” He added that the girl became unconscious and the accused fled presuming that the girl had died.

When the villagers came to know about the girl lying in an unconscious state, they informed her parents.

“The girl was first taken to a primary health centre in Patan from where she was taken to the district hospital. Owing to excessive bleeding, she was referred to Kanpur’s Hallet Hospital. However, it was during treatment at Hallet hospital that she succumbed to her injuries,” Rai said.

The victim’s family members have registered a complaint against an unknown person, based on which a case has been registered.

The officer said they would soon crack the case. Senior district police officials, including Unnao Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir, came with a dog squad and forensic team to the district hospital and then visited the crime spot for inspection.

In the second incident reported from Chitrakoot, 13-year-old girl was reportedly raped and murdered and her body was thrown in a well to conceal the crime.

Reports said that Kavita (name changed), a resident of Khandewa locality of Mau in Chitrakoot district, went to her fields along with her mother to save their crop from stray cattle which usually enter the fields and damage crop. After about an hour, the mother went back home to prepare food on the occasion of Holi and left her daughter in the fields, asking her to return after some time.

However, when the girl did not return, the family members went to look for her and were shocked to find her missing from the field. In the late hours, one of the villagers found the body of the girl lying in a well.

The local police were informed and the body was taken out from the well.

Circumstantial evidences pointed that the girl was raped and later killed with some sharp-edged weapon and the body was thrown in the4 well.

Chitrakoot’s Superintendent of Police Ankit Mittal, who rushed to the spot, said that they were waiting for the post-mortem report but all efforts were being made to identify the killer and arrest him.

In Bulandshahr, a class 9 student, hailing from Ramghat area of the district, was raped after she went to attend the call of nature in the nearby field on Tuesday.

Reports said that the victim was nabbed by a youth and raped. The accused also threatened the girl with dire consequences if she informed anyone about the incident.

According to Dibai Circle Officer Vikram Singh, the police had registered a case and sent the victim was medical examination.

The accused was also arrested and sent to jail. Further investigations are on.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/three-rapes-rock-state.html

6,12-3-20,Labourers facing problems in med treatment,"The labourers of Pithampur industrial area are facing problem in their medical treatment as the form no 4 which is required for their treatment has to be submitted in the ESIC empanelled nursing hospital in Pithampur is not available in Pithampur.

There are around 800 small and big industries in Pithampur industrial area in which around 2 lakh workers are engaged in different labour work. One of the labourers told that there are around 4 Government ESIC dispensaries in sector 1 2 3 and 4 industrial area in which Government ESIC doctors are attached to look after the labourers’ treatment and issuing them form 4 which is required to those patients who need a detailed medical test and advance treatment for which they have to go to Sanjeevani Hospital and research centre in Pithampur which is near their factories and houses.

However, the duty doctors present at the ESIC dispensaries do not issue them the form number 4 and for getting that form, they have to travel to 80 kms up and down to Nanda Nagar ESIC head office Indore. It takes a lot of time and money for them to travel to such a long distance. Meanwhile, patients have to wait for the treatment of the problem with the old and the women. This sometimes becomes unbearable .

Director of the ESIC, Madhya Pradesh, Dr BL Bangeria, told The Pioneer that I have given a written order to all the doctors of the ESIC dispensaries at Pithampur industrial area to issue the form no 4 at Pithampur itself. Why the patients are not getting the forms at Pithampur, I will see and if any patient complains me about any particular doctor in writing, I will take strict action.

The public relation officer of the Sanjeevani Hospital and Research Centre, Pithampur, said that if we don’t get the form number 4 from the patients, we cannot claim the expenditure done on the patients from the Government till now we are doing the treatment of the patients without this form number 4 but it will be impossible for us to continue to provide treatment to the patients in near future as it requires lot of expenditure on medical tests which the hospital cannot bear.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/labourers-facing--problems-in-med-treatment.html

10,12-3-20,China’s tainted corona,"While the contagious phase of COVID-19 may ebb and the communist regime may deny the PLA’s role in the battle, the world may not see it in the same light as before

The sudden apparition of Coronavirus on the world stage was unexpected for Chinese watchers. However, it is bound to have deeper implications than the Tiananmen massacre for the future of the Middle Kingdom. Even if the situation stabilises in the next few months, or by the end of the year, the community of nations may not see it in the same light. Undoubtedly, the role of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will continue to be discussed for long after the contagious phase of COVID-19 is behind us. From day one, a PLA unit, the Joint Logistics Support Force (JLSF), has been at the centrestage of what the communist party of China called the “people’s war” against the “demon” virus.

When I say day one, it means nearly two months after the deadly virus surfaced in Wuhan. The communist authorities were lax between December 1, 2019, when The Lancet’s epidemiological retrospective investigation showed the first confirmed case with symptoms of the novel Coronavirus pneumonia, and January 23, 2020, when the JLSF troops first arrived on the scene.

But what is JLSF? The body was created on January 11, 2016, as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s in-depth military reform measure. According to Xinhua, the JLSF “comprises the support forces for inventory and warehousing, medical services, transport, force projection, oil pipelines, engineering and construction management, reserve assets management and procurement.” Coincidentally, it is based in Wuhan. The first task given to the JLSF of the Central Military Commission (CMC) was to build the Huoshenshan Hospital, an emergency speciality field facility that accommodates 1,000 beds. Believe it or not, it was constructed in just eight days.

At first, 450 Army personnel were flown in to Wuhan. They were joined in by 1,400 military medical staff on February 3 and 2,600 additional medical personnel from the armed forces on February 13. Today more than 10,000 troops (including the militia also serving under the CMC) have been deployed.

Though the Generals were probably reluctant in the beginning, it became clearer to the Communist leadership in Beijing that only the PLA could save China. On January 29, Xi, who is also the CMC Chairman, had to personally intervene to exhort the military to save the nation. And the party. He ordered the military to win the battle, emphasising the importance of “keeping in mind the purpose and carrying the burdens.” He exhorted the troops “to keep the original spirit,” adding, “Our Army is a child soldier of the people, breathing with the people, sharing the same fate and connecting hearts.”

The PLA had to face its own problems. The crew of the Type 054A multi-role frigate, Changzho, carrying anti-submarine missiles had to be quarantined. The Navy admitted the fear of an outbreak and the captain of the frigate, Yu Song Qiu, and a number of sailors were placed on lockdown. Shore leave rules for crew members aboard the Shandong were tightened to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on China’s second aircraft carrier. By the end of January, there were 54 declared cases of virus in Sanya in Hainan Island where the Shandong is based.

At the same time, the CMC started regulating the relations between the PLA and the civilians: Thirteen forms of activities were banned, including receiving money/securities and asking non-military organisations/individuals to provide money or commodities. Corrupt officers were warned: No illicit enrichment would be permitted.

Probably sensing the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the PLA to participate in the risky operations, the CMC opened a life insurance scheme for those personnel going to the “frontline.” It further declared that those, who would die combating the virus, would be named “martyr” by the Chinese State.

But the real challenge for the JLSF was to control the spread of the virus in Wuhan, which is the strategic hub for the defence industry — it has more than 350 research centres and industrial institutes as well as 1,700 hi-tech enterprises covering aerospace, satellites, rocketry and biotechnology. The future of all these institutions remained undecided.

According to Xinhua, China had to postpone its military recruitment drive, scheduled for the first half of this year to support the country’s epidemic prevention and control work. Wu Qian, the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, asserted: “Approved by the State Council and the CMC, the postponed conscription will be combined with that of the second half, which will run from August 1 to September 30.” Though Wu said that the overall annual recruitment targets would remain unchanged, experts believe that the PLA could be badly affected.

This was also the time when an enigmatic personage appeared on the scene. Chen Wei, a 53-year-old leading Chinese epidemiologist and a Major-General in PLA, is known for developing the world’s first gene-based vaccine on Ebola in 2014. She was also apparently involved in combating the SARS outbreak.

According to the International Business Times, the controversial Major-General injected herself and her six-member team with an untested Coronavirus vaccine. She has created quite a stir on Weibo by her radical approach, especially after she was posted in the Wuhan lab from where the COVID-19 strain could have escaped (the Chinese authorities denied this).

Was this just a gesture to prove her loyalty to Chairman Xi? Just a month ago, Chen had taken over the controversial Wuhan lab, originally a civilian research lab, partly funded by the French Government. When he visited the research facilities in February 2017, Bernard Cazeneuve, the then French Prime Minister, declared: “France is proud and happy to have contributed to the construction of the first P4 high bio-safety laboratory in China. …This cutting-edge tool constitutes a central element in the achievement of the 2004 inter-governmental agreement on Franco-Chinese cooperation in the prevention and fight against emerging infectious diseases.” Something obviously went wrong.

For India, it is important to analyse the implications of the PLA’s involvement in the battle against the virus. Will the JLSF emerge stronger? Can the PLA become a threat to the party, just in case the “people’s war” against the “virus” is won by the Army? Will it re-emerge stronger despite Xi’s efforts to restrict the Army’s influence? What will be the implications for the PLA’s preparedness on the borders with India? It may be too early to answer these questions but even though PLA activities on the Tibetan plateau have reduced due to the outbreak, intrusions were reported recently from Naku-la, south of the watershed in Northern Sikkim, a border said to be “settled” by China. It is quite ominous.

11,12-3-20,Just another Scindia,"It’s unlikely that Jyotiraditya will get something more from the BJP than what the Congress denied. Is he just a token?

At one level, nothing unexpected has really happened in the Congress. The young Turks, now not so young, are looking to give their political careers some individual purpose as the borrowed legacy of an institution called the Congress is fast ebbing away. Directionless without peer representation, and a leader who has quit the game a long time ago, they feel wasted and helpless with the old guard continuing their stubborn ways of what is right and wrong. Jyotiraditya Scindia’s resignation is just a summary of all that ails the Congress, where the young leaders want to keep the party’s nationalist ideology, passion and legacy alive but are dispirited for lack of recognition or being “too good” in outshining the Gandhi scions themselves. It is also but expected of the ruling BJP to claim the spoils of war, especially if that happens to be harvesting the peels of the shell the Congress has become. In this case, Scindia is the prize pick of the BJP, simply because he and his father before him had been part of the inner circle of the Gandhis and were the cushion around their leadership of the party. The visible impact of a Congress jolted by a trusted insider is far greater than any game of numbers. Frankly, the BJP really did not need Scindia as badly as the latter needed the party. His aunts, Vasundhara and Yashodhara, and grandmother Vijayraje Scindia, had delivered enough in their very influential capacities. So at another level, it is Scindia’s unchanged net worth that is unexpected. He doesn’t get much in the tradeoff, certainly nothing that makes him look like he is starting over. For ideological loyalty is not party loyalty and a man, who claims he has a hold on his former royal subjects, could have easily floated his own unit. But by switching over to the BJP, which he had sharply criticised over the Delhi riots fairly recently and changing his ideology after 18 long years, something that his father Madhavrao resisted for a lifetime, he surely looks like an opportunist. Besides, Scindia Jr is also encashing his family lineage to be of relevance to the BJP and is not casting away his dynastic mantle, something that the Gandhis are always accused of. Undoubtedly, he worked assiduously to shore up the Congress’ fortunes in Madhya Pradesh during the Assembly elections in 2018 and has reportedly been miffed at not being gifted chief ministership. But one cannot ignore that for all his claimed sway over the Gwalior belt, he lost his home turf of Guna in the Lok Sabha elections. Besides, loyalist party MLAs, who quit the party with him, aren’t keen on joining the BJP in a leap of faith. They would have if he had floated an independent State outfit perhaps, something that other young but dejected leaders in the Congress, like Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, are rumoured to be contemplating. A fresh start gets endorsement more easily than jaded defection plots.

The BJP, which has an ideological resonance across Madhya Pradesh, a State which continues to be the crucible of Hindutva and where its long-range grassroots warrior Shivraj Singh Chouhan scripted a success story for 13 long years, is not humouring Scindia’s royal lineage either. All he gets is a Rajya Sabha membership and a Union Ministry, something which makes his move look like personal aggrandisement than a crusade or revolt. The BJP has too many strongmen that it cannot afford to upset for want of a poster boy and won’t be risking its dynamics in a sure shot heartland bastion. The party may have lost the Assembly elections of 2018 but is within snapping distance of power with 107 legislators in the 230-member House. The Congress has 120 MLAs and assuming all its 21 MLAs are gone, will dip to 104, making government formation a skilled and institutionalised game of horse-trading. This wafer-thin anxiety was the reason that the Congress went on the backfoot in effecting a generational change in State leadership and brought in old warhorse Kamal Nath as the Chief Minister, who managed numbers and survival. This is also one of the reasons why the BJP, despite having the edge, has moved its MLAs to a hotel in faraway Gurugram while the Congress has parked its own in Jaipur. Scindia said the Congress is “living in denial” but probably, he is, too, in the process over-selling his chances. The bigger casualty is undoubtedly the Congress itself. No matter who wins what round, the fact is, it is dependent on the age-old structure of self-serving fiefdoms belonging to its hawks, who have passed on timely interests earned to the ruling first family and claimed to have ownership on what works for the party. Scindia’s trigger could very well encourage its disenchanted brigade, who, unlike Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, have no space for growth to bleed out as well. The biggest casualty is politics itself, returning to the age-old ways of manipulation and deceit rather than just relying on a transparent verdict.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/just-another-scindia-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/just-another-scindia.html
12,12-3-20,Flight of fancy,"Aerial mobility may be a solution to urban overcrowding but we should stop putting money in ill-conceived ideas

While planning for the Allied invasion of Europe in World War II, experts realised that they needed mechanised troops on the ground, which is infantry backed up by the armour of tanks. The problem was that tanks were heavy and wouldn’t quite float. So the Americans came up with an ingenious solution, the Sherman “Duplex Drive” or “DD” tank, with floatation devices and a propeller. Nicknamed by American troops as the “Donald Duck” tanks, they proved to be a tactical failure. Many of them can still be found at the bottom of the sea outside the beaches of Normandy. They were not a complete failure but once on the ground, they weren’t as effective as plain-jane Sherman tanks. This brings us to the idea of flying cars. Over the years, many firms have experimented on developing a viable working plane that could double up as a car but have failed. This is because these two engineering marvels are fundamentally different. Reconciling them is not easy. It isn’t about a mobile phone that can be made into a smart phone by combining the functions of a phone, computer, tablet, camera and location sensor among others because that was essentially electronic miniaturisation. A plane still needs wings and a car still needs four wheels. And because they need to carry a human, rather be capable of carrying four people, the end product cannot be too small. As large commercial aircraft companies like Airbus and Boeing have proven time and again, building aircraft according to modern safety norms is not an easy task even for professionals. So why persist on a path that doesn’t have a viable solution?

Maybe some engineer might make a viable portmanteau of a car and an aeroplane. A couple of car firms themselves are looking at an aerial solution but this is a stand-alone solution, one that appears to be more driven ironically by drone design than by a car or a plane. These flyable drones, one showcased by Hyundai and another by Mercedes-Benz as a form of shared high-speed intra-urban transportation, could potentially be a solution to reach distant suburbs quickly, particularly in disaggregated urban areas with high speed mass transit systems doing the rest. A Dutch firm has even decided to set up a unit in Gujarat to roll out personal air-land vehicles (PALVs). The flying car has remained a dream since the 1950s and while we may not have achieved the future, we have made astounding progress. With limited resources, we should concentrate our efforts on things that work and those that can be deployed quickly. The flying car is not one of them.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/flight-of-fancy-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/flight-of-fancy.html
13,12-3-20,UP govt acquiring land for defence industrial corridor,"



|

With the Uttar Pradesh government starting to acquire land at four nodes, the much-touted UP Defence Industrial Corridor project has got off the ground.

Announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UP Investors’ Summit in February 2018, the defence infrastructure corridor is estimated to attract investments of Rs 20,000 crore in the arid Bundelkhand region and generate employment for 2.5 lakh people.

According to Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), the nodal agency for the defence manufacturing corridor, land for the flagship project is being acquired in two phases.

“Almost 3,788 hectares of land is to be acquired across four nodes as part of Phase I, out of which over 1,455 hectares has been identified in Jhansi, Kanpur, Chitrakoot and Aligarh. Of this, around 1,200 hectares has already been acquired, mainly in Jhansi, Aligarh and Chitrakoot,” said a UPEIDA official.

While Lucknow, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Aligarh, Kanpur and Agra were proposed as the six nodes of the defence industrial corridor project, the interest it has evoked saw the UP government notify another three nodes for investment — Meerut, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar.

The project is being implemented in Bundelkhand given the availability of cheap land and the existence of a strong ancillary base in the region. It is one of the two defence manufacturing corridors being built to meet the modernisation needs of the Indian armed forces, with the second one coming up in Tamil Nadu.

“It would promote indigenisation and support the Make |In India initiative, helping meet equipment requirements worth over $250 billion by 2025. It would also promote ancillarisation and development of MSMEs for the aerospace & defence (A&D) sector, making UP a preferred destination for the purpose and boosting India’s defence exports,” the UPEIDA official said.

At the recently concluded DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow, 23 companies signed MoUs worth Rs 50,000 crore with the state government for investment in the defence manufacturing corridor. At the event, Ancor Research Labs became the first investor in the corridor, being allotted 25 acres of land in the Aligarh node to create high-end defence testing facilities and manufacture defence grade communication systems.

Recently, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the project would serve as a springboard for the state turning into a $1-trillion economy by 2024, as the government had proposed.

“The government would soon create a land bank of 25,000 acres to facilitate setting up of industries on the corridor,” the chief minister said.

“UP’s aim is to become a net exporter; even if half of the MoUs signed at the DefExpo are realised, we will be able to generate employment for 2.5 lakh people,” he said.

Among the investment avenues on the corridor are defence parks at Jhansi, Agra and Kanpur; aerospace parks at Lucknow, Kanpur and Agra; leather and textile hubs at Agra; and engineering/electronics manufacturing hubs at Agra, Kanpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Ghaziabad.

To attract investors, the UP government has offered major incentives in its Defence & Aerospace Policy 2018, including reimbursement of 25 per cent of land cost, transportation subsidy and reimbursement of 75 per cent of the cost of technology transfer to anchor units.

It has roped in IIT-BHU and IIT-Kanpur as knowledge partners to conduct research and help train manpower for industrial units in the defence sector.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-acquiring-land-for-defence-industrial-corridor.html
14,12-3-20,"Akhilesh, Shivpal share stage","Holi festivities in Saifai, the native village of Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, witnessed the warring uncle and nephew, Shivpal Singh Yadav and party president Akhilesh Yadav, share the dais after a long time.

Both the leaders attended the Holi function on Monday.

Akhilesh touched the feet of his uncle Shivpal Yadav and took his blessings. The SP chief and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh also restrained his and his uncle’s supporters from raising slogans. Mulayam Singh Yadav was also present on the dais.

The bonhomie was, however, only skin deep as Akhilesh expressed his displeasure over the slogans raised praising him and his uncle.

Enthused by the bonhomie between uncle and nephew, the local villagers and the party cadre raised slogans hailing the coming together of the estranged family members. They raised slogans of Jai Akhilesh-Jai Shivpal.

Akhilesh however restrained the cadre and asked them to stop raising slogans. He said if they continued to raise such slogans then next time he would not come to Etawah to celebrate Holi.

“This is the time for Holi festivities... politics should be kept out of it... such sloganeering spoils the atmosphere and creates distance... things should be changed, otherwise they will only weaken us,” Akhilesh said and added, “We need to think about the future and move ahead... I take a decision only after giving it a proper consideration and not under anyone’s influence.

Akhilesh added that if slogans had to be raised, they should be in favour of the ‘cycle’, the SP symbol.

Shivpal, who has formed a new political outfit, the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), touched the feet of his elder brother Mulayam Singh Yadav and then wished others, including Akhilesh.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shivpal had contested from Firozabad, leading to the defeat of his nephew Akshay, son of Ram Gopal Yadav, and enabling Bharatiya Janata Party to win the seat.

Shivpal and Akhilesh have been involved in a bitter feud in the party since 2016.

On the occasion, Shivpal said, “Festivals are more fun if people have love for each other in their hearts. In villages, people give importance to trivial issues that create animosity and the clever people take the advantage...people need to sit, talk and remove the misunderstandings... this will not give an opportunity to others to take advantage of the situation... people need to forget their differences on Holi.”

Though senior party leader Ram Gopal Yadav, a confidant of Akhilesh, was not on the dais, other members of the Yadav family, including MPs Dharmendra Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav, were present.

The Yadav family celebrates Holi in Saifai every year with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav joining family members, villagers, party workers, supporters and friends in the festivities. Shivpal Yadav had not taken part in the Holi festivities at Saifai last year and celebrated the occasion with his supporters at his Etawah residence instead.

16,12-3-20,UP govt moves SC against HC order on name-shame posters,"The Uttar Pradesh government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Court order directing the Lucknow district administration to remove the hoardings of anti-CAA protesters put up in the state capital.

Shalabh Mani, one of the media advisors to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said the UP government had filed a petition against the High Court order asking Lucknow administration to remove hoardings carrying pictures of anti-CAA protesters. “The hearing is slated for Thursday morning,” he added.

In its March 9 order, the Allahabad High Court had asked the Lucknow authorities to remove the hoardings carrying pictures of anti-CAA protesters and report to the court on March 16.

In its order, the court said that the action of Lucknow administration was “highly unjust” and was an encroachment on the personal liberty of the people concerned.

UP’s Law Minister Brajesh Pathak said that the state government was determined to exercise its legal right to ensure that the people who had taken law in their hands and damaged property were punished.

He said that a handful of people were trying to blackmail the government and “we will not let them do so”.

The Lucknow administration has put up hoardings with photos and addresses of 53 anti-CAA protesters across the city, identifying them as rioters and projecting them as defaulters who have failed to pay for the damages caused by them during violence on December 19 last year.

The hoardings include pictures of Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas, retired IPS officer SR Darapuri and Congress leader Sadaf Jafar, drawing a sharp reaction from social activists and retired bureaucrats.

The Lucknow administration has assessed the damage caused by anti-CAA protesters during violence that broke out during the protests at Rs 1.55 crore. Officials claim that 16 people have been served recovery notices of over Rs 69 lakh till now. Shia cleric Maulana Saif Abbas and son of Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, Sibtain Noori are among the 16 who have been served notices.

The hoardings were put up despite on January 31 the Supreme Court asking the Yogi Adityanath government to respond to a petition against the Uttar Pradesh administration’s move to confiscate property of people who protested against the amended citizenship law in December last year.

Parwaiz Arif Titu, a lawyer who had moved the apex court, also asked the Supreme Court to order a judicial inquiry into the violence that took place in UP during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-name-shame-posters.html

25,12-3-20,Assembly Speaker is in spotlight as both Cong and BJP out to hide their legislators,"While both ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP are out to hide their legislators, in the wake of Rajya Sabha polls, Assembly Speaker is in the spotlight.

A day after senior BJP leaders visited Assembly Speaker’s residence in Bhopal on Tuesday handing over resignations of 19 Congress rebels, the Congress party delegation met the Speaker NP Prajapati on Wednesday and demanded disqualification of six Jyotiraditya Scindia supporter ministers’ from Assembly.

Led by JP Dhanopia, the delegation referring to rules urged the speaker to expel these MLAs from assembly. The speaker assured them of proper action at the opportune moment.

The State Government has already written to State Governor to remove these ministers from state cabinet.

Prajapati also had assured the BJP delegation of ‘action as per constitutional procedures’ after he was handed over hard copies of the resignation letters from 19 MLAs camping in Bengaluru.

Some of these MLAs had uploaded video messages on social media claiming that they were standing with Jyotiraditya Scindia and refuted Congress party claims that they were in touch with Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

Meanwhile, as the speaker, who belongs to Congress party, has not taken any decision on resignations of MLAs, there is eagerness to know what he would eventually do in the matter.

As a possible floor test would follow polling for Rajya Sabha on March 26 in Madhya Pradesh Assembly, the Speaker is expected to buy time before meticulously taking a final call on the fate of Congress rebels.

The BJP camp and rebels are claiming that in all 22 MLAs have resigned recently.

There are two conditions for an MLA or an MP if they want to tender their resignation. First, the resignation has to be drafted in the official format. It has to be very brief. Secondly, the resignation shouldn't be tendered under pressure, constitutional experts say.

The resignation letter has to be a simple statement of intent expressed by the MLA that he/ she is resigning from membership of that particular assembly with immediate effect. Any extra word, describing one’s reasons for resigning etc, will make the resignation letter unacceptable.

Secondly, if the resignation is written by hand and handed over to the speaker personally by the MLA, the speaker can make enquiries on whether the member is resigning under duress. After fully satisfying himself/ herself the speaker can accept the resignation.

However, if the letter is typed and sent by a medium, the speaker will be in his/ her right to call on the person to make enquiries about the reasons for resignation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/assembly-speaker-is-in-spotlight-as-both-cong-and-bjp-out-to-hide-their-legislators.html

29,12-3-20,Teachers ‘burdened’ under Padho Punjab: Panel,"Punjab Government’s decision to open a new chapter of ‘Padho Punjab, Padhao Punjab’ in the State’s academics has virtually left the teachers feeling weighed down.

The Government school teachers across Punjab are feeling “burdened” as they have to teach several other things, under the Padho Punjab programme, along with the basic syllabus. These were the findings of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha’s Estimates Committee, in its latest report on the School Education Department, tabled in the recently-concluded budget session.

Notably, Padho Punjab is the State’s ambitious learning enhancement programme, for the Classes VI up to X, and has succeeded in achieving encouraging results — owing to the Government school teachers’ efforts.

Taking note of the improvement among students under the programme, the House panel has suggested appointing separate volunteers for the same, besides extending this learning enhancement course right from the pre-primary level “so that the students could take full advantage”.

“The programme should be implemented from nursery level and every primary school should have a separate room for Anganwadi children where they can be provided good and quality education,” suggested the House panel in its report.

The ‘Padho Punjab, Padhao Punjab’ project was a part of the Congress party’s election manifesto ahead 2017 Assembly elections, and was initiated soon after the party came to power in 2017. The State Government is focusing on making this project a success, as the programme has yielded results in “difficult” subjects of Maths, Science, Social Studies and English.

As per the data provided in the report, the students of upper primary classes (VI-VIII) have recorded 24 per cent progress in Math and Science, while 21 per cent and nine per cent was registered in Social Studies and English, respectively.

Students of Class IX and X have recorded 36 per cent and 35 per cent improvements in Maths, respectively, 19 per cent in English, 24 per cent in Social Studies, and 24 per cent and 25 per cent in Science, respectively.

The committee, in its report, has also expressed concern over the “very low” salary of the cook-cum-helpers under the Mid Day Meal programme, and that of the volunteers working at the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) centres.

Underlining that the cook-cum-helpers are poorly paid, the Committee pointed out that the neighbouring Haryana is paying them more remuneration and Punjab should also pay them on par with them.

The Committee recommended increasing their salaries from Rs 1,700 to Rs 3,000, adding that they should be paid for 12 months instead of the current system of 10-month-salary. The panel noted that the Education Department has sent the proposal to the Finance Department on September 24, 2019, regarding enhancing the salary and no response has been received so far.

The panel also recommended increasing the remuneration of EGS volunteers to Rs 3,000.

The Committee has also suggested to set up a panel for the Best School Award. The award will be given on the basis of annual result of the school children and teachers’ availability, school infrastructure, co-curricular activities, students’ attendance and teachers’ availability, among others.

The committee is surprised to note that despite the installation of biometric attendance systems in the schools, it could not function as many schools do not have electricity. It has recommended making required budget provision to pay power bills.

The Education Department had informed the panel that biometric machines have been installed in 950 Government senior schools in the State.

“The committee recommends the Education Department to pay the electricity bills of all the schools at the earliest, by making the provision of the same in the budget.

The committee has also noticed theft of gas cylinders, used for cooking the mid-day meal, from the government schools situated in the villages. To check the same, the Committee has recommended the appointment of watchmen and other necessary staff in the schools.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/teachers----burdened----under-padho-punjab--panel.html
30,12-3-20,Expedite Tribune flyover project: Parl committee,"While the Punjab and Haryana High Court has virtually put brakes on contentious Tribune flyover by putting stay on axing of trees for the project, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs has recommended the UT Administration to expedite the project, aimed at better traffic management in and around the city.

In its report tabled in Rajya Sabha recently, the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs has acknowledged the fact that the case is sub-judice but at the same time, recommended that all projects including Tribune Flyover for better traffic management must be completed expeditiously.

The High Court had in November last year stayed the transplanting and axing of 473 trees for the Tribune flyover project, on an NGO’s plea and asked the Administration to look for other solutions to the congestion problem at the Tribune Chowk.

Since then, uncertainty looms over the future of this project. The Administration will now be submitting a report regarding the public hearing held on the proposed project and other alternatives explored for the congestion problem at the Tribune Chowk to the High Court, which is scheduled to hear the case this month.

The controversial project has remained under fire since its inception as many experts have termed it a violation of Chandigarh Master Plan

2031. According to the Chandigarh Master Plan 2031, over bridges or flyovers are not recommended to be constructed in entire city of Chandigarh due to heritage considerations, since they impact the visual city scape, and cause inconvenience to the pedestrians.

Making observations on the project, the report of Parliamentary Standing Committee stated, “The Committee is aware that the matter of Zirakpur-Tribune Road is sub-judice. The Committee reiterates its recommendation given in previous report on demand for grants (2018-19) which stated the flyover project be undertaken with NHAI funds for early completion for improving traffic in and around Chandigarh,.”

“The Committee was given to understand that the UT Administration, in coordination with NHAI, is working on this project from Zirakpur to Tribune Chowk (flyover) road section for better traffic management. It recommends that all projects undertaken must be completed expeditiously,” the report stated.

Following the HC’s directions, the Administration had held public hearing on December 23 last year, in which 53 of the 78 participants had opposed the flyover. Seven persons were even called for detailed deliberations on alternative proposals mooted by them.

However, the Administration had recently rejected all the seven shortlisted alternative proposals to the Tribune flyover.

Notably, the UT Technical Committee constituted to explore alternatives to the project, had recently recommended Administration to again seek Union Ministry’s opinion on the project.

However, the Administration has decided to take up the matter in the meeting of UT Administrator’s Advisory Council, constituted to advise the higher authorities on developmental issues and policy matters.

Contentious flyover project

The 1.6 km flyover is proposed to be built from near the GMCH-32 roundabout up to the railway overbridge on Dakshin Marg after passing over Tribune Chowk. Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore had laid the foundation stone of the Rs 184 crore project in March last year. It was proposed as a solution to the traffic congestion at the stretch of Tribune Chowk. More than 1.43 lakh vehicles cross the rotaries of Dakshin Marg and Purva Marg near Sector-31 Tribune Chowk daily.

Regarding the progress of the flyover at Tribune Chowk, the Administration submitted to the Parliamentary Committee that the work has been approved by the Union Ministry of Road Transport & Highways in letter dated February 11, 2019 amounting to Rs 183.74 crore.

Accordingly, the bids for the work were invited by the UT Engineering Department. Subsequently, the letter of acceptance was issued to the lowest agency M/s DRAIPL-DMR Builders (JV) amounting to Rs 137.40 crores. Meanwhile, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court regarding the cutting of trees and the matter is sub-judice.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/expedite-tribune-flyover-project--parl-committee.html
31,12-3-20,Sukhbir seeks action against cops who assaulted teachers,"Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Wednesday demanded immediate registration of a criminal case against police personnel who launched a brutal assault on peacefully protesting unemployed teachers in Patiala to please their political masters as well as action against those who ordered this barbaric action.

“It has come to light in the media that some police officers, including the Patiala Superintendent of Police (City), beat up the unemployed teachers mercilessly without any provocation sorely to earn brownie points,” said Sukhbir.

He said: “With senior officers leading the charge against the youth, other cops also took the cue that there was a direct order from the very top to teach a lesson to the unemployed teachers for daring to march towards the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s residence…This resulted in injuries to a dozen persons, including women with policemen pulling them with their hair and misbehaving with them. The brutality was such that two youth even jumped into the Bhakra canal.”

Sukhbir said that instead of taking action against the police personnel, the Congress Government registered cases against the “victims of the merciless assault” by registering cases against 70 unemployed teachers.

Stating that it was actions like these which were signs of a dictatorial regime, the SAD president demanded that cases being withdrawn immediately.

He also demanded registration of a criminal case against the SP (City) as well as other cops involved in this gruesome attack besides action against those who ordered it.

Asking the Chief Minister not to play with the lives of youth, Sukhbir said that “first you failed to implement your ‘Ghar Ghar Naukari’ promise, then you lied that 12 lakh youth had been given employment when your own Government submitted a written reply in the Vidhan Sabha that only 34,000 youth had been given government jobs in three years”.

“Now when the youth are demanding their legitimate right and only asking that the 12,000 vacant posts of ETT and TET be filled, you are launching your police force against them,” he said.

SAD president said that the Congress Government had proved that it did not have any intention to recruit qualified candidates who had passed the TET examination by advertising 1,664 posts even when there were 12,000 vacancies.

“What new posts will you create when you are not even filling vacant posts,” he asked adding that SAD would launch a sustained campaign soon to force the government to fill all vacant posts as well as create new ones to provide employment to the youth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sukhbir-seeks-action-against-cops-who-assaulted-teachers.html

34,12-3-20,Cong walks out of HP Assembly,"The opposition Congress on Wednesday walked out from Himachal Pradesh Assembly after expressing their dissatisfaction over Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur's reply on pay anomalies of outsource employees.

The Chief Minister, however, said the opposition party was ""frustrated"" by the latest developments in Madhya Pradesh where their leader, Jyotiraditya Scindia, quit the party and joined the BJP.

Speaking during the question hour in the ongoing Budget session in the State Assembly, Thakur accused the Congress of making walkouts a ""routine affair"".

The Congress legislators walked out from the House when the chief minister held the previous Congress Government responsible for exploitation of outsource employees.

The previous Congress Government did nothing to regularise the outsource employees during its tenure of five years, but promised to regularise them right before the last Assembly elections in 2017, Thakur said.

Earlier responding to Barsar Congress MLA Inder Dutt Lakhanpal's question, the Chief Minister informed the House, ""Recruitment and promotion rules do not apply for outsource employees as they are not Government employees.

They are employees of service provider companies with whom their agreements have been made."" As per the agreement, service provider companies are bound to pay outsource employees minimum wages, he added.

The State Government is trying to ensure that the outsource employees are not exploited, the BJP leader said, adding provisions have been made to provide travel allowance, daily allowance and medical leave to them besides the provision of maternity leave. It has also been made mandatory that the outsource employees be provided monthly salary slips, the chief minister added.

SOLAN VARSITY ASSISTANT REGISTRAR HELD IN FAKE DEGREE SCAM, SAYS CM

The Himachal Pradesh Police has arrested the assistant registrar of Solan-based Manav Bharti University in an alleged fake degree scam.

Giving a statement in the State Assembly during the Budget session on Wednesday, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur told the House that it was evident from the documents seized from the Solan university that they were playing with students' future by issuing fake degrees for long.

Thakur further stated that an FIR was also registered against Una-based Indus University at the Haroli police station on March 9.

Stating that all four FIRs were being thoroughly investigated, the CM said a complaint received against APG University of Shimla was also being probed by a special investigation team (SIT) of the Crime Investigation Department (CID).

The CM said one of the three FIRs against the Solan university was lodged on March 3 on the complaint of Haryana''s Charkhi Dadri resident Mamta, in which she alleged that she was given a fake degree.

Earlier, Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri on February 27 had pointed out that there were reports about the involvement of two private universities of the state in a fake degree scam.

Replying to it, Education Minister Suresh Bhardwaj had then said that the University Grants Commission (UGC) had received a complaint alleging that 18 private universities, including two in Himachal Pradesh, were selling fake degrees.

The State police was probing the matter and strict action will be taken if any university is found selling fake degrees, he had added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-walks-out-of-hp-assembly-cong-walks-out-of-hp-assembly.html

In a memorandum to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik through the RDC Southern Range, the party demanded action against officials in BeMC who collected water cess in excess of the stipulated rate and flouted the rule by not depositing the same with the PHED.

Similarly, it alleged that whenever the Government took a decision to hike rates of taxes on land sale and purchase, benchmark valuation, holding tax, etc, it first implemented the same in Brahmapur. It lamented the misutilisation of crores of rupees under Swachh Bharat and protested the plan to collect Rs 600 from each household for maintaining hygiene.

44,12-3-20,UT mulls to cap number of occupants in PGs,"After last month’s fire tragedy at an unregistered paying guest accommodation in Sector 32 here that claimed three young lives, the Chandigarh Administration is now mulling to put a cap on number of occupants that would be allowed to live in a paying guest accommodation in the city.

Another proposal has been mooted to fix number of rent deeds to be allowed in a house.

Recently, certain new provisions were added in the revised PG policy of Chandigarh which included mandatory fire clearance, annual renewal of license, indemnity certificate from PG owners. The Administration had also decided not to exempt the requirement of house owners staying in the PG accommodation.

As per the rules framed by UT Administration, a PG facility can operate only in a house with an area of at least 7.5 marla. It is mandatory to get it registered and thereon pay commercial rates for water and electricity.

Also, PGs are not allowed to run their own kitchen in the accommodation. “A proposal has been chalked out to put a cap on the number of occupants to be allowed to live in a PG facility here.

The number will be decided as per the area of the accommodation. At present, the minimum usable area for one paying guest is 50 sq. ft,” said a senior officer of Chandigarh administration.

He said that the clause of rent deed is often misused by the owners who do not register their houses as PG facilities. Considering this, we have also proposed to fix number of rent deeds to be allowed in a house, the officer added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-mulls-to-cap-number-of-occupants-in-pgs.html

47,12-3-20,Protests at old site illegal from today,"Despite the notice issued by Dehradun City Magistrate Anuradha Pal to vacate the protest site near Parade Ground, the protesters did not leave the site claiming it to be the State Government’s plan to suppress the voice of protesters. On the other hand Pal stated that conducting protest in the old protest site would be illegal from Thursday as the approval to protest in the old protest site is revoked.

Recently, the protesters at the protest site near Parade Ground were issued notice to shift their respective protests in the new protest site at Adhoiwala after Holi. However, no protest has been shifted to the new protest site by protestors so far. While talking to The Pioneer, Pal said that the notice was served to the protesting groups in the old protest site to shift their protest in the new site by March 11.

The permission to protest at the old protest site has been revoked and if the protest is not shifted then necessary steps will be taken against the protestors. “For now, we are just appealing the protestors to evict the site on their own. The approval granted for protests at the old site has already been revoked and if anybody is found to conduct any kind of protest at the old site, it will be against the law,” said Pal.

However, the protesters are not ready to vacate the old protest site as they consider it the government’s plot to smother their ongoing protests. “Government is sending us to a location where no one can see or hear people like us who are protesting against their oppression.

We will not budge from this place until the government annul the forest guard recruitment exam,” said one of the protesting members of Uttarakhand Unemployed Organisation (UUO) Suryakant Arya. According to one of the protesting members of Gairsain Rajdhani Nirman Abhiyan (GRNA) Manoj Dhyani, the administration has not made any arrangements in the new protest site like sanitation facilities, electricity or drinking water. Several diseases are spreading these days like Coronavirus and the administration is sending protestors to the location where hygienic conditions are quite poor, said Dhyani.

However, Pal said that the arrangement to provide all the basic facilities have been made in the new protest site near Adhoiwala.

The basic facilities that include mobile toilets, electricity, and drinking water are made available for the protestors said Pal. Pal also stated that it is important to shift the protest site to the new location because the construction under the Smart City Project will begin there soon.

In the meantime, delegations of an organisational and public group met the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat regarding the shifting of the protesting site to Adhoiwala stating this move to be against the system of democracy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protests-at-old-site-illegal-from-today.html

On Wednesday, hectic parleys between the office bearers of the general and OBC association and different employees organisations took place to discuss the modalities of the strike.

The general secretary of the association, Virendra Singh Gusain told The Pioneer that 60- 70 percent of essential services would cease to operate from Thursday. On the appeal of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in which he has requested the employees to take back their strike in the interest of the state, Gusain said that time of appeal has ended and the chief minister should take a decision on the issue.

Meanwhile on Thursday, the association constituted committees for monitoring and inculcating enthusiasm among the employees in different districts. On single point demand of implementing the order of Supreme Court (SC), the general and OBC employees are on strike from March 2.

It is pertinent to mention here that the SC on February 7 while hearing a Special Leave Petition (SLP) of Uttarakhand government had said that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and reservation is not a fundamental right.

The SLP was filed by the Uttarakhand government against the Uttarakhand High Court (HC) order in Gyanchand Vs state case. This order has brought a sharp schism among the employees on caste lines. The general and OBC employees want that there should be no reservation in promotion while the SC and ST want that the benefit of reservation should be extended to them in promotions also.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/general--obc-staff-to-intensify-stir-from-today.html

52,12-3-20,Why Naveen is adorably invincible in Odisha,"Naveen Patnaik has proven himself to be the most popular Chief Minister in India. Even late West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu from the Marxist fold, who held a record for the longest-serving CM, did not have the invincibility Naveen commands today. Basu had a chequered graph -- rising and falling in number of election victory seats; and he never enjoyed the mass adulation like Naveen, whose popularity graph is just incredibly steady.

This story is not meant to eulogise Naveen. What makes him so strong and invincible is an amusing case in point. When Naveen first showed up as legendary Biju Patnaik’s least-known younger son, people imagined he would only play puppet in the hands of rogue politicians who wanted to encash on the Biju legacy. Bijubabu was deified much before he died. He was considered the only politician who meant as well as did good works for the State. So, anyone from his family would do the magic in the game of popular politics.

Naveen agreed to take over, but he had made his mind clear before the self-serving rogues that he would work for the State’s development by serving the poorest of the poor in a strictly disciplined manner. He knew seasoned bureaucrats would be the best community to guide him properly, without which the political gangsters would eat up the State along with him. So came in Pyari Mohan Mahapatra, the long-time trusted lieutenant to Bijubabu, who was inducted as principal guru and guide. Thereafter, how political detractors got fixed or axed is only ordinary history by now.

Naveen has made sure right from the beginning that politicians, especially the self-serving, loudmouths listened to gutsy, spotless and honest bureaucrats, particularly from the IAS cadre, who would determine what is important for the State, design people-friendly schemes and call all critical shots. The political executive would only act as the front and ensure that the people benefitted on all counts. The masses got to know this special arrangement quite early and are pretty much happy as the going is good. Further, any bureaucrat who is too willing to take the extra mile is naturally closer to the boss than others who are not in a position to remain engaged in a glued manner due to personal circumstances. Detractors and opponents keep ranting about Naveen running a bureaucracy in Odisha because they fail to realise the fact that bureaucrats only guide the political executive critically and do nothing more. Today, the political class, by and large dumb in head and populist, feel safe to be guided by the prudent bureaucrats by keeping away from risks of law and rule violation.

Naveen hasn’t changed his style of functioning once in all these twenty years. Good governance is his primary objective. For this, all the trusted core group officials have been asked to keep him updated on all fronts and take his final orders to carry out without fail.

There is another big reason why Naveen is enormously popular.The opposing parties including BJP and Congress have never been able to match his popularity as they have no charismatic leader in their midst. The BJP has lately made some insignificant, flimsy impact due to Modi's dramatic moves like Article 370 scrapping and Balakote strikes. Obviously, the BJP has emerged as a popular alternative because of terrible Congress blunders on countless fronts. The Odisha Congress party has been reduced to an intangible idea only. Infighting has never stopped, even during their worst times. The incumbent president has lost everything, political seat, face and reputation. He is just a skeletal symbol of a vanquished outfit. The Odisha Congress is fast degenerating into a bitter episode in pages of the State’s political history. Even in Madhya Pradesh, the frontline leaders are out to topple the Kamal Nath Government by defecting into the BJP as they have to survive as politicians.

But Naveen is gaining in popularity by the day. He has been particularly adored for a few specific reasons: he is unmarried; has the simplest-ever lifestyle; speaks only when necessary and that too in two or three sentences; never speaks ill of even the worst enemy or detractor no matter how vitriolic or scandalous he or she is. His legendary father, despite his immeasurable popularity, did not enjoy such love and respect as Naveen is basking in the popularity glory today.

For the first time in Odisha's political history, mainstream career politicians are expected to behave well with the people and do as told by the well-meaning bureaucrats who go by the rulebook in hand.

Even while choosing candidates for elections, Naveen puts his lieutenants to do a thorough due diligence on the antecedents of the potential candidates and chooses those who are adored and respected by the masses. A few exceptions occur though, only when political compulsions are extremely high.

His latest choice of Rajya Sabha candidates is superbly made on accurate calculations. Only those highly qualified or people’s guys with a heart and mind for the poor are eventually chosen. The latest selected candidates include Sujit Kumar who has been an international bureaucrat after having been at the best universities of the world including Harvard and serving at the most prestigious global institutions like the World Economic Forum, Davos in Switzerland. He has been part of several flagship programmes and schemes of the government as an experienced, highly exposed professional. Subas Singh, once a firebrand unionist, has been a hardcore people’s leader for quite some time. He was one of the frontline spokespersons for the BJD. Munna Khan, a Biju-devotee movie idol and a popular leader from the minority community has been going places for long. And most admirably, Naveen chose a nondescript woman social worker called MamataMahanta who has been working for the poorest of the poor women of the tribal Mayurbhanj district since a decade without expecting any reward. She is from a very backward Kudumi community found only in Keonjhar and Mayurbhanj districts. She has been closely working with hundreds of Self-Help Groups that promote socioeconomic empowerment through micro enterprises and thrift activities. By the time World Woman’s Day was around, Mahanta got her due recognition from Naveen. No wonder why Naveen is so popular among the people.

Lastly, on this day in March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi's Dandi March had commenced. Seventy-eight people had walked with the Mahatma across 240 km between his ashram in Sabarmati and the coastal village of Dandi. The march was an act of civil resistance against the British law that banned production of salt by poor people for livelihood.

Naveen, a staunch Gandhi follower, has invariably been advocating for inclusion of ‘nonviolence’ in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution, and logically so.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/why-naveen-is-adorably-invincible-in-odisha.html

Pandian was happy to take stock of the matter as the State Government will soon take up the job on a priority basis.

Dr Kumar along with his team earlier made a survey and assessed the requirement, said sources. CMD OSRTC Arun Bothra, RDC Central Division Anil Samal among others were present.

The locals of Sheeshambada are incessantly speaking about the improper treatment of leachate at the waste management plant which is allegedly mixing with groundwater and polluting it.

According to them, the polluted water is coming through the taps at their homes too and those who use tap water are compelled to use it for drinking. However, Joshi has rejected all the allegations regarding the pollution of groundwater due to the improper treatment of leachate. According to him, around Rs six crore was spent on the layering of the surface of the plant to ensure that no percolation of leachate occurs during its treatment. Besides, the proper treatment is being done through Leachate Treatment Plant (LTP) so there is no way of its getting mixed with groundwater and polluting it, said Joshi.

57,12-3-20,Snoring can be a noisy killer if untreatedDehradun,"March 13 is observed as World Sleep Day. Ahead of this this occasion, Dr Lav Kush Chaudhary, senior consultant, Respiratory Medicine and Sleep Specialist at Synergy Institute of Medical Sciences explains, how this noisy killer can be deadly. Snoring is a sign of further complication in human system, if snoring gets louder including the symptoms such as gasps for air or interrupted breathing, it should be immediately checked. There are basically two types of snores, one is just a rhythmic type of snore, and usually the volume level stays about the same.

The other type of snoring, which about 75 per cent of people who snore will have, is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a potentially serious sleep disorder. It causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep.There are several types of sleep apnea, but the most common is obstructive sleep apnea. Nearly one billion people globally are suffering from obstructive sleep apnea.

Snoring in simplest terms is vibration of tissue, the most obvious tissue that would vibrate when somebody is snoring is the uvula, or the back of the palette that hangs down. During sleep, throat muscles relaxes, sometimes the tongue falls back in the mouth and partially blocks. The greater the obstruction in the airway, the louder snoring gets. Bigger health concerns involve severe snoring and when the airway collapses completely, causing obstruction of airflow, followed by people waking up just enough to start breathing again. However, people with sleep apnea typically don’t wake to consciousness and are often unaware of it.

Obesity also contributes because the body has to work harder at breathing in sleep. Another factor might be that the nose is obstructed, tonsils could play some role, although, it’s less frequent, but children can have snoring and sleep apnea.

Excessive daytime sleepiness, observed episodes of stopped breathing during sleep, abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking, awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat, morning headache, difficulty concentrating during the day, experiencing mood changes, such as depression or irritability, high blood pressure, night-time sweating, decreased libido etc are symptoms of OSA.

With OSA there’s increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and obesity. Further, frequent bathroom breaks at night due to decrease in the oxygen level actually effect kidneys, followed by poor memory, difficulty in concentrating and co-morbidities such high blood sugar levels and blood pressure.

OSA patients may experience worse breathing problems after major surgery, especially after being sedated.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure therapy (CPAP), is a gold standard treatment for sleep apnea. Doctors now can set a range of pressure, and the device detects when a patient needs a higher level.

However, with new research and development machines have become smart enough to know when the patient needs a higher pressure, if patient is on their back or in REM sleep.

Moreover, there has been drastic innovation in masks, earlier the masks were bulky and claustrophobic however, with time masks have become smaller and fit more comfortably which hardly effects patient normal activities, including reading and watching television.

Along with CPAP therapy it is also advisable to avoid smoking, alcohol and muscle relaxant before bedtime and keep weight controlled. The other treatment options are surgery and oral appliances.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/snoring-can-be-a-noisy-killer-if-untreateddehradun.html

60,12-3-20,Dola Utsav is the swing fest for Puri Lords,"Vrindavan is the place of Lord Krishna and Puri is the sacred ‘Dham’ of Lord Jagannath. When Vrindavan is famous for Lord Krishna’s Holi Utsav, many people across India do not know the importance of Dola Purnima or Dola Utsav in Puri.

As the scared Puri Dham is more known for Lord Jagannath’s annual Rath Yatra, Dola Utsav has not been highlighted as it should be.

Lord Jagannath is worshiped as “Dola Govinda” during the Dola Utsav. Dola means swing and utsav is festival. So this is the swing festival of Lord Jagannath which is celebrated with equal pomp and show as that of the festival in Brundavan.

Dola Purnima or ‘Basanta Utsav’ or spring festival in Odia almanac is observed on the full moon day or Poornima. ‘Krishna’ or “Dola Govinda’ becomes the center of attraction with various forms of worship all over Odisha.

Jagannath Dham is the pioneer of the Basant Utsav being celebrated across the State. Lord Balabhadra, Devi Subhadra, Lord Jagannath and Lord Sudarshan are decked up in Suna Besa or the golden attire on the Ratna Sinhasan. The godly attire is also called Raja Rajeswar Besa.

Lord’s representative or Govinda along with Sridevi are placed in Dola Bedi where devotees throw different colours on them. The six-day festival, also known as Dola Jatra in Odisha, begins from Falguna Dasami when idols of Lord Krishna are carried in decorated ‘Vimans’ (palanquin).

The devotees and carriers of Vimans are smeared with Abhira or dry colour. The idols are taken on procession and halt at the door step of villagers who worship Lord Krishna to get his blessings.

Like Dussehra, Dola Purnima is also celebrated as a festival marking victory of good over bad. According to Hindu mythology, demon Hiranya Kashyap attempted to kill his son Prahallad, a great devotee of Lord Krishna.

The demon king asked his sister Holika to sit in fire with Prahallad in order to kill him. Holika was blessed by God that she would not be burnt down in fire. However, Holika was burnt alive while Prahallad escaped from fire unhurt. The Holi festival, therefore, derived its name from Holika.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dola-utsav-is-the-swing-fest-for-puri-lords.html
61,12-3-20,Ruskin’s romance with reading blossomed in Shimla,"Renowned writer Ruskin Bond has become synonymous with the Doon valley and Mussoorie as he has spent many long years in this region. Most of jos works talk about Doon and Mussoorie , especially Landour (Old Mussoorie) where he has been living since 1963.

However, there is another hill station, now in Himachal Pradesh, which has an important role in shaping his literary life and personality. When Bond was born in Kasauli in 1934, the town was in Punjab in colonial India. And when he studied at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, it was again in the years when Shimla was in Punjab. However, today Himachal Pradesh takes pride in the fact that the great writer was born in this region and also did his schooling here.

I was at this famous hill station of Himachal Pradesh, its capital, recently for a literary event.

While I was talking to young students about Bond’s relationship with the hills and dales of Shimla, I realised that the manner in which his years there would have influenced him would have been indeed special.

I spoke to the writer about this and came to know about his days at Bishop Cotton School. “As a school boy at Simla’s Bishop Cotton School, I was made incharge of the Anderson Library there for my last two years in school.

This library contributed greatly to my love for reading and writing. I would allow myself to be transported to another world through the pages of Somerset Maugham, Hugh Walpole ,J.B.Priestley ,P.G.Wodehouse , J.M.Barrie,Compton Mackenzie,Dornford Yates and other successful novelists ,poets and playwrights of the 1930s and 40s,” said Bond while recalling those years.

“Another time that I was brought a trolley of books when I was down with jaundice in 1949 at school and was taken to Simla’s Ripon Hospital .It was a kind matron who, in a way, introduced me to O.Henry, Saqi and Barry Pain.

It was at Shimla that he read through a large number of books between the years 1947 and 1950 till he completed his schooling and came back to the Doon valley.”I think it would be fair to say that when I was a boy ,reading was my religion .

It helped me to discover my soul”, Bond says. In his book Confessions of a Book Lover he takes us into his inner world and gives us an insight into his childhood and adolescence when he developed a close relationship with the world of literature.

His earliest encounters with some of his favourite writers have been brought to us in this work which is a sort of sequel to his earlier Love among the Bookshelves .

He gives us a prelude before sharing with us some excerpt or chapter from the writings of the authors whom he has loved all his life. “These writers were important to me at various stages of my personal and writing life,” he says in his introduction to the book .

Talking to this correspondent ,he has often said that reading has always been a minority pastime. “When I was in school, out of 35 boys in my class, just three or four were readers.

Those days, the minority was in hundreds –now it may be in lakhs”, he says.By now, most of us know from Bond’s writings that he has been a great fan of Charles Dickens , especially David Copperfield with which he could identify himself easily .

Here he tells us that Nicholas Nickleby was also his favourite –“full of humor,pathos and memorable scenes”.It was in the winter of 1948 -49 that Bond, still a school boy, discovered Dickens in an old cupboard in Dehradun.

And indeed it is a great coincidence that Mussoorie, that has been Bond’s home for decades now, has a connection with Dickens as John Lang was a correspondent for Dickens’ Household Words while he(lang) lived in Mussoorie.

When Bond first visited Bengaluru in 1960, he came across the Select Bookshop of KBK Rao at MG Road ( now it is on Brigade Road) . He became friends with Rao and later with his son KKS Murthy who , even now, sends him handwritten lists of books that he thinks would interest Bond. The books keep piling up in his room and study at Ivy Cottage!

Bond says that he loves to discover “the unusual ,the little-known ,the forgotten , and even the eccentric…sometimes a little gem turns up or a neglected masterpiece”.

And he discovered many such gems at Bishop Cotton library in Shimla!He has written about his school friends in Shimla and fondly remembered them in many of his works.His bond with the Himalayas began in the Doon valley as well as during his years at Shimla.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ruskin---s-romance-with-reading-blossomed-in-shimla.html

She was addressing a talk on World Sleep Day. She said that according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), approximately 18 million people have sleep apnea, with up to 80 percent of people undiagnosed.

It is to be noted that World Sleep Day is an annual event organized by the World Sleep Day Committee of the World Sleep Society, formerly World Association of Sleep Medicine, since 2008. The goal is to celebrate the benefits of good and healthy sleep and to draw society's attention to the burden of sleep problems and their medical, educational, and social aspects, and to promote the prevention and management of sleep disorders.

She further said that inadequate rest or sleep can also lead to lack of motivation to exercise or plan meals. Sleepiness also can cause people to forget to take their medications and lead to further diabetes complications.

Sleep apnea may be genetically linked and it is most commonly found in those who are overweight or obese, people who smoke and are over the age of 40.

To diagnose sleep apnea, you can undergo a sleep test called a polysomnogram, which is a test that records body functions while you sleep. The test measures eye movements, electrical brain activity, muscle activity, heart rate, breathing and blood oxygen levels.

Revellers splashed colours on each other as they exchanged embraces across the lanes and by-lanes in the city to celebrate the festival of colours. Children had most of the fun as they sprayed coloured water using water guns and hurled water-filled balloons on people from the safety of their rooftops.

The young and the old splashed colours on each other with religious songs in the background adding to the perfect ambience in several areas. Effigies of Holika, the sister of Hiranyakashyap, the demon king, were set ablaze at several places symbolising the destruction of evil.

Nevertheless, the security alertness on the day that is on the day of Holi, was moderate with no special arrangement for traffic movement and people had easy access to their destinations. However, patrolling of the police vans at higher pace was the only highlight of the administration as far as security measures for the Holi was concerned.

“Past record suggest that Holi has never been a festival inviting trouble to the district administration so far, and therefore security has never been a big concern for the police barring of course, the petty incidents of brawl involving people in drunken state of mind,”said, a district official.

The police had issued warning against hooliganism in the guise of revelry. Commuters faced inconveniences in the morning as the public transport, such as buses and metro were shut till late afternoon. Notwithstanding, the security arrangements the police have registered few incidents of clash between the excited Holi enjoyers in Telco, Sonari and Chota Govindpur police stations.

He has discovered 17 houses meant for primitive tribe group Parhaiyya far from completion since 2017 -18 when Panki had a Congress MLA.

Mehta said, “These 17 highly poor and vulnerable group of Parhaiyyas have been cheated of their houses under Birsa Yojna. These houses are of the year 2017 -18. The fund for these houses has been siphoned off and this primitive tribe group is rotting in pains.”

Mehta further said, “As per the version of the victim parhaiyyas each house was worth 1.31 lakh. But only one foot to three feet wall has been raised and house has been shown to have been completed and money taken by the middlemen.”

The BJP MLA said, “The Assembly is in the session. I will raise this issue as a starred question. This is the height of the crime against the poor. Can only middlemen do this?”

Mehta said, “There is loot all around, be it house scheme or road or culver making etc in the year 2014 -19.”

This last Assembly election 2019 Mehta gave a crushing defeat to Congress’ Bittu Singh and now Mehta is all out to expose the corruption in public or beneficiary utility schemes like these 17 houses under Birsa Awas for PTG Parhaiyyas, which are not by any stretch worth calling any house as there is just a few feet walls only.

The MLA said, “A particular pragya Kendra operator in Panki, two or three middle men and unscrupulous officials of the Panki block have so duped the innocent Parhaiyyas.”

Mehta spoke to district welfare officer Nisha Tirkey from the site of these duped Parhaiayya families who live in their shattered earlier houses at Jaspur 58 kms away from Daltonganj asking the lady officer to visit Jaspur first to have a feel as to how these poor have been so left in lurch of a housing scheme of 2017 -18.

This correspondent also spoke to Nisha Tirkey in this regard to know as to how this case of fraud in housing scheme never came to light in all these years since 2017 -18 to which Nisha Tirkey said, “I will seek a report from the Panki BDO in this connection.”

Panki BDO S Murmu said, “I took over charge of Panki only this last October and hence have not much of this idea and information about this racket.”

Nand Kishore Parhaiyya, Nirmal Parhaiyya, Rajoya Devi, Matia Devi and many others there at Jaspur mobbed the MLA asking him to first punish the middle men whom they called Yadavs who has so cheated them by obtaining their thumb impressions and diverting fund for their houses into these middlemen’s accounts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/panki-mla-finds-shelter-scheme---s-skeletons.html

Seventy-six-year-old Soren, a three-time Chief Minister and an eight-time MP from Dumka Lok Sabha constituency, was a unanimous choice of JMM party workers for the RS candidature, party leaders said.

Popularly known as ‘Guruji’ in the political circuit here, Soren is looked up to by leaders across Jharkhand irrespective of ideologies and political affiliations. Soren was one of the pillars of the Jharkhand Movement, which led to the formation of a separate State. He is still seen as the most influential ‘people’s leader’ in the tribal-dominated Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand by many political experts.

Soon after Soren filed his nomination to Vidhan Sabha Secretary Mahendra Prasad, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that he was sure of the his father’s election in the upper house of the parliament. “Guruji will be elected to the upper house of the parliament. We are also eyeing the second Rajya Sabha seat in the State, and our candidate for it will be announced soon,” he said.

Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon, who also happens to be the President of Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC), said that both the Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand will go to the UPA fold this year. Later in the day, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fielded its State President Deepak Prakash for the Rajya Sabha elections. JMM has 29 seats in the 81-member Assembly, while Congress party has 16 seats. The third partner, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has only one legislator in Jharkhand. BJP, the second largest party in the Assembly, has 26 legislators.

Elections will be held for two of six Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand, currently occupied by BJP’s Parimal Nathwani and RJD’s Premchand Gupta, this year. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced that the elections for the two seats in Jharkhand will be held on March 26. The notification for the elections was issued on March 6 and March 13 will be the last date for filing nominations.

The nominations will be scrutinized on March 16 and candidates can withdraw their nomination by March 18.

One of the veterans of Jharkhand Movement, senior Soren lost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Sunil Soren in Dumka – a JMM stronghold – during the Lok Sabha elections held last year.

“We have issued a circular asking all Government offices across Jharkhand to stop the use of biometric attendance temporarily as a precautionary measure against Novel Coronavirus,” Personnel and Administrative Reforms Secretary AK Singh said. Almost all Government offices in Jharkhand, and also schools and colleges, use biometrics to mark the attendance of employees. Their attendance, sources said, will now be marked manually in registers.

Meanwhile, Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS) in Ranchi on Wednesday sent samples of three persons to labs for Coronavirus tests.

The premiere State-run hospital has already sent eight samples for tests in the past month or so, and none of them came out positive, said RIMS Superintendent Dr. Vivek Kashyap. “The three fresh samples sent today (Wednesday) are all of people staying in and around Ranchi. We will get the test results by Friday,” he said.

RIMS has also arranged for 450 pieces of N95 masks for protection of caregivers at the hospital, said Kashyap, adding that as per the current situation in the hospital, the number of masks available was sufficient. “We do not have any positive cases of Cornavirus yet. We are only keeping symptomatic patients and the ones who have travelled to affected countries under observation,” said Kashyap.

N95 masks are special protective masks used by medical practitioners and caregivers working in close proximity with patients.

However, it is not for use by commoners as they do not come in close contact with patients, said Kashyap, adding that three-layer surgical masks were as effective as N95 masks in case commoners wish to wear masks for their safety.

RIMS has also set up an 18-bed Isolation Ward for Coronavirus patients. All the nurses and doctors working in the ward have been provided N95 masks and elaborately explained about the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in case a patient complains of symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus and is admitted in the hospital.

State BJP vice president Pradeep Verma said that the Election Commission of India (ECI) has approved the merger of JVM-P with BJP and order in this regard has been also issued by the commission in which it has agreed that JVM-P as party has become non-existent and its symbol has been also seized.

He said that now as per the norms Babulal Marandi should be made the Leader of Opposition without further delay so that the house can function without any hindrance. Verma indirectly attacking the Soren Government behind delay in granting LoP status to Marandi said, “The State Government is continuously exerting pressure on Speaker and he is prevented from fulfilling his duties which is an attack on the soul of the democracy.”

The BJP leader without naming any leader directly said that the ruling party should understand that the chair of the Speaker is impartial and Opposition had a great role to play in the development of the state therefore for the betterment of the State, the House should immediately declare Babulal Marandi as Leader of Opposition.

The BJP plans to carry out state wide agitation assume importance as last week (March 6), the Election Commission of India (ECI) approved the merger of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) party, led by Babulal Marandi with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The ECI in this connection has even issued letter which reads, “Taking into consideration all the documents on record including the report of CEO, Jharkhand, the Commission is satisfied that JVM(P) has merged with the BJP, a National Party.

Following the allegation made social that Ghasi died due starvation, Chief Minister Hemant Soren had ordered a probe in the case.

Kasmar BDO Rajesh Kumar Sinha said, “We have carried out a probe in the death and came to know that the man was suffering from some disease and was undergoing treatment from local doctors.”

Sinha said, “Ghasi’s three brothers informed district administration officials that in July/August Ghasi returned from Bangalore. His body was swollen. He was undergoing treatment from a local doctor.”

The BDO claimed that the victim’s brother also informed that Gomia MLA Lambodar Mahto too had agreed to provide medical treatment to Ghasi at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS).

On the intervention of Gomia lawmaker ambulance was arranged at Ghasi’s house twice.

He was to be admitted at RIMS, but as there was no attendant for patient so he was not admitted.

Sinha also claimed that the district administration also went through the economic condition of victim’s.

The victim (Ghasi) and his three brothers jointly owned 1 acre 35 decimals land at Kamra village.

Ghasi is survived by five children who included three daughters and two sons. One daughter and son are married. The district administration also came to know that both his sons are earning while one son works at a local brick kiln the other one works at hotel in Petarwar.

The district administration also came to know that as Ghasi was living with his father the ration card was in the name of Bhukhal Ghasi’s father Ramu Ghasi, but after the death the ration card had expired and Bhukal’s family members had applied for it.

93,12-3-20,Resort politics on to avert poaching of MP legislators,"Amid a political crisis triggered by former Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia's exit from the party, the Congress on Wednesday afternoon flew its remaining 88 MLAs from Bhopal to Jaipur in order to prevent poaching by the BJP.

The MLAs, who were received by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at the airport, are likely to stay at the Buena Vista Resort in Jaipur. Two MLAs of the BSP, one from SP and independent accompanied the Congress legislators.

The BJP MLAs are staying put in ITC Grand Bharat in Manesar in Haryana.

Around 20 rebel Congress MLAs have been lodged in a resort in Bengaluru. They have claimed to have resigned from the legislative Assembly. The Congress has sent two of its leaders, Sajjan Singh Verma and Govind Singh, to Bengaluru in order to pacify some of the rebel MLAs and bring them back to the party.

The grand old party has been witnessing an internal turf war in Madhya Pradesh since the party formed the Government in the State in 2018. The crisis deepened on Tuesday after Scindia resigned from the party and at least 22 MLAs close to him announced to withdraw support from the Nath Government.

In 2018 Assembly results, the Congress, which won 114 seats in the 230-member Assembly formed the Government with the support of four Independent MLAs and two BSP MLAs and a legislator from the Samajwadi Party (SP). The BJP had secured 109 seats in the State Assembly.

While there are clear indication that the present Nath Government would not survive for want of the required number of MLAs, Congress leader Verma on Wednesday said they (leaders who are in Bengaluru) are neither willing to support Scindia nor in favour of joining the BJP as they were misled and taken to Bengaluru in Karnataka.

""Nobody is ready to go with Scindia. They said they were misled and taken to Bengaluru, most of them said they are not ready to join BJP,"" Verma claimed.

""I just came from Bengaluru and now I am going to Jaipur. Besides 5-6 Ministers and one MLA, we all are going to Jaipur. They (MLAs) have said they have the blood of Congress and they will remain in the party. Since Scindia was a senior party leader, all our MLAs followed his order as a courtesy,"" he said.

He also claimed that he is in contact with 7-8 BJP MLAs.

Senior party leader Digvijaya Singh claimed on Wednesday that thirteen of the 22 rebel Congress MLAs don't want to quit the party and were led away only to create pressure on the leadership to nominate Scindia to the Rajya Sabha. He also asserted that the Nath-led Government in the State, pushed to the brink of collapse with the resignation of 22 MLAs, will win a floor test.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bala Bachchan said the Nath Government will prove the majority in Assembly and complete its five-year term. ""The Congress is in a safe and strong position. Everybody is in touch with the Chief Minister, everything will be alright soon. We will prove majority on the floor of the Assembly and our Government will continue till 2023,"" said Bachchan while speaking to reporters here.

Besides, Congress MLA Umang Singhar said the resignations of MLAs who are in Bengaluru have not been accepted yet. ""All MLAs are in touch with us; their resignations have not yet been accepted,"" he said.

However, Madhya Pradesh Women and Child Development Minister and rebel Congress MLA Imarti Devi on Wednesday reaffirmed her loyalty to Scindia and said she will always stand alongside him ""even if I had to jump into a well"". The Minister said she and 21 other rebel Congress MLAs are camping in Bengaluru out of their own volition and with the blessings of Scindia. Imarti welcomed the former Congress leader's decision to join the BJP.

After Scindia quit the Congress, around 10,000 of its office-bearers have resigned from the party in Madhya Pradesh and several more are likely to do so, a former leader of the grand old party claimed on Wednesday.

118,12-3-20,Lekhi lauds Shah in LS for containing Delhi riots in 36 hrs,"The BJP on Wednesday alleged that the communal violence in Delhi was a pre-planned conspiracy and lauded Union Home Minister Amit Shah for containing the Delhi violence within 36 hours. The Opposition hit out at the Government as the riots had international ramifications and called for an impartial probe.

Participating in the debate in Lok Sabha on Delhi riots that have claimed 52 lives, BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi defended the Home Minister Amit Shah and said the violence was brought under control within 36 hours which, if you look at in hindsight, was in the making for months.

She also claimed that the Home Minister did not go to the violence-hit areas of northeast Delhi to avoid “splitting of security forces to guard him”. “What do you expect? That Home Minister would go and sit in a police station? Would that have not caused splitting of security forces just to guard him?” Lekhi asked.

The Lok Sabha discussed the Delhi riots under Rule 193 of the House proceedings which means there will be no voting after the debate.

Earlier, initiating the debate in the Lok Sabha, Congress leader sought resignation of Shah, a demand echoed by TMC’s Saugata Roy and NK Premachandran of RSP.

Responding to Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhury allegations, Lekhi defended party leaders Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra, who have been accused by the Opposition of setting the stage for the violence that rocked northeast Delhi and left more than 50 people dead. Anurag and Verma made comments on January 20 and January 28, while the violence started on February 23. Kapil Mishra was held responsible for acts of Amanatullah Khan, Sharjeel Imam and Tahir Hussain, she said.

Without naming the Congress, she blamed the grand old party for the riots and said the Government had controlled the violence in 36 hours. “During 1950 to 1964, as many as 243 riots are documented. When Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister, 337 riots happened during 1966 to 1977 and 1980 and 1984. Similarly, when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister, 291 riots occurred during 1984 and 1989. Out of 1094 riots, 871 happened during Congress regime, which was 73 per cent,” she said.

Lekhi countered Chowdhury’s remarks on the role of Mussolini in the RSS ideology. She said that Chowdhury’s leader’s - who is sitting behind him (pointing at Rahul Gandhi without mentioning his name) - maternal grandfather was Mussolini’s soldier. Somehow Congress did not pick this mention as an issue, though Treasury Benches were supporting Lekhi with thumping in the desks.

Lekhi, alleged that some people are taking political benefit out of the incidents of violence. Referring to the killing of IB officer Ankit Sharma during the riots, she said 400 wounds were found on his body. “What kind of hatred was this... We should discuss that also,” she said, adding the riots were pre-planned. The BJP leader alleged that the opposition are defending minority vote bank politics and have forgotten about Sharjeel Imam and AAP MLA Amanatullah. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla expunged certain names taken by Lekhi and asked her not to name people.

She alleged that after the speech of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi at Ramleela maidan, people started gathering. Similar speeches were given by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi as well, Lekhi said. “Why the opposition is spreading rumours,” she said.

Tejasvi Surya of BJP alleged that while there wasn’t anything anti-Muslim in CAA, the anti-CAA protests had “a lot of anti-Hindu” feelings. BJP MPs Nalin Kateel also countered the Opposition accusations. BJP leader Nishikant Dubey said the transfer was recommended by the Supreme Court collegium and the Government had nothing to do with it.

AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said there is a “tsunami of Hindutva hate” and called for an impartial probe to find the prepatrators of the violence. Some of his remarks evoked sharp response from the Treasury benches, with at least two Union Ministers — Ravi Shankar Prasad and Kishan Reddy — registering their protests. Reddy accused Owaisi and his party for erasing Hindus population from certain areas of Hyderabad.

This led to heated argument between the ruling and the opposition benches. Reminding members to keep cool and avoid mention of any communities, Speaker Om Birla ordered to expunge certain remarks made by Owaisi.

T R Baalu (DMK) said that the Delhi riots and the law and order situation of the national capital were discussed in parliaments of the UK, Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Malaysia. These countries “are making fun of us”, he said.

Baalu said that “what went wrong” as over 50 people were killed in the Delhi violence. He said that although Delhi Police is efficient in manging the issues, “why all went wrong” on those days.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lekhi-lauds-shah-in-ls-for-containing-delhi-riots-in-36-hrs.html
119,12-3-20,ITBP chief SS Deswal given additional charge of BSF DG,"ITBP Director General SS Deswal on Wednesday took additional charge of the BSF after its incumbent VK Johri was repatriated to parent cadre to take over as the Director General of Police of Madhya Pradesh.

An official order issued on Tuesday said Deswal will handle this charge “till the appointment and joining of the successor or until further orders, whichever is earlier”.

The Kamal Nath-led Congress Government in Madhya Pradesh had recently issued an order appointing Johri, a 1984-batch IPS officer, the new Director General of Police.

In the same order, the MP Government has shifted incumbent DGP VK Singh to the Sports and Youth Welfare Department as its Director.

DG of Cyber Cell of MP Police, Rajendra Kumar, a 1985-batch officer, has been asked to officiate as the DGP till Johri takes over.

Johri is expected to reach State capital Bhopal on Thursday and subsequently take over his new assignment soon. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had issued an order on Wednesday approving the proposal of the home ministry for repatriation of Johri to his parent cadre with an immediate effect.

120,12-3-20,"RS adjourned over Delhi riots, Kerala media gag","The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday witnessed repeated adjournments over a clutch of issues, including Delhi riots, ban on some media channels in Kerala and the treasury and the Opposition differing on taking up two ordinances which are lapsing on Thursday. All the parties finally agreed to discuss the ordinances pertaining to mines and minerals and insolvency code on Thursday morning followed by a discussion on the Delhi riots.

The first adjournment till 2.00 pm came minutes after the House met for the day at 11.00 am when the Opposition parties raised the issue of communal violence in Delhi and the Government ban on two Malayalam news channels for their coverage of the riots.

While Left parties raised the issue of the Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry imposing a 48-hour telecast ban on Asianet News and Media One TV, the Trinamool Congress(TMC) raised the issue of recent communal violence in the national capital. Some Congress members raised the political happenings in Madhya Pradesh. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the proceedings till after lunch at 11.05 am.

The afternoon session commenced with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar making a suo moto statement on the Government’s efforts to bring back stranded Indians from Italy and Iran. Several Elders from several parties expressed concern over the issue. However, when Deputy Chairman Harivansh moved to the other business of taking up the two ordnances namely the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 and the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, several Opposition MPs including Derek O’Brien objected.

With the treasury and the Opposition sticking to their guns with the former insisting on discussing the two ordinances on Wednesday and the latter on Thursday,

the chair adjourned the

proceedings.

With no agreement in sight for some time, the house was adjourned repeatedly till at 3:40 pm Deputy Chairman Harivansh called Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi to give his statement.

Joshi told the House as agreed in the meeting in the Deputy Chairman’s Chamber, the two ordinances (listed in supplementary agenda) would be discussed on Thursday at 11 am. Thereafter, there would be a discussion on Delhi violence in the House.

Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad then said all parties have agreed that they will finish the discussion on two ordinances in the morning and discuss the Delhi violence in the afternoon.

He then requested the chair to adjourn the House for the day and Harivansh did so saying it was the sense of the house.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rs-adjourned-over-delhi-riots--kerala-media-gag.html
121,12-3-20,"Govt focusing on bringing back Indians from coronavirus-hit Italy, Iran","Terming the situation in Iran and Italy as “extreme” due to coronavirus, the Government on Wednesday said it is focusing on bringing back those stranded Indian citizens who test negative. Giving this information in the Rajya Sabha, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said a medical team from India will leave for Italy on Thursday for screening the Indians there.

Giving this assurance to the elders after they expressed concern over the plight of Indians, including students, pilgrims and fishermen, the Minister said the situation in Italy and Iran is “a cause of great concern” and the Government is making all efforts to bring back Indians after appropriate testing and screening. The entire House lauded the efforts of the Government in reaching out to the Indians in those two countries.

Making a suo moto statement, Jaishankar said Iran and Italy have an “extreme” situation and the Government is “focusing on those countries where coronavirus is strong.” He also said the two countries are under stress due to pandemic and are doing their best.

Noting that the disease has spread to about 90 countries, Jaishankar said if the Government starts the process of bringing back Indians worldwide, then it will be only add to the panic.

Elaborating upon this aspect, he said India only intervened in Wuhan, China and brought back Indians. Similarly, the fishermen from various parts of India now in Iran were relatively safe as the pandemic was not prevalent there. However, the Government will make all arrangements including food and water to the fishermen stranded there, Jaishankar said after several MPs raised the issue.

He informed the House that over 6,000 Indian nationals in various provinces of Iran are stranded which includes about 1,100 pilgrims mainly from the union territories of Ladakh and Jammu&Kashmir and Maharashtra.

The Minister said there are nearly 300 students primarily from J&K, about 1,000 fishermen mainly from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, and others who are on longer term stay in Iran for pursuing their livelihood and religious studies.

Jaishankar said the Government will first focus on bringing pilgrims to India from Iran and then students. He pointed out that infrastructure situation in Iran is stretched. He said 58 Indian pilgrims have already come back from Iran and have tested negative for coronavirus. As many as 529 samples have been collected in the second batch and whosoever tests negative will be brought back in the next flight, he added.

On Italy, he said the Government will hopefully send a medical team for carrying out testing facilities for Indians stranded there like it was done in the case of Iran.

“The situation in Italy is now emerging as a cause of great concern,” Jaishankar said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-focusing-on-bringing-back-indians-from-coronavirus-hit-italy--iran.html

123,12-3-20,Rajini to meet RMM members today,"Less than a week after his meeting with members of Rajini Makkal Manram(RMM), an outfit of his fans and friends, film star Rajinikanth would be meeting them again on Thursday. Though there is no official announcement from the RMM about the agenda of the meeting, it is speculated that the film star may disclose some details about the political party he is planning to launch.

Though there were reports in a section of the media that Rajinikanth may announce the launching of his party on April 14, the Tamil New Year Day, his close associate Tamilaruvi Manian told The Pioneer on Wednesday that it was not correct. “I saw some reports like that which appeared in some dailies with the claim that it was disclosed by me. I was being misquoted by these dailies,” said Manian.

While Manian said the stage is set for the launching of the political outfit by Rajinikanth, he is in the dark about the name of the party and its programmes. “Rajinikanth is the sole authority who could give you details about the programme of the party and its stance on various issues. All I could say is that there would be a political party led by Rajinikanth contesting the 2021 assembly election,” said Manian, a former Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president who had quit the Grand Old Party in disgust.

Maalan, Tamil Nadu’s leading political commentator is of the view that the entry of Rajinikanth into the political arena is expected to make some major impact in State politics. “The AIADMK is in power since 2011 and some anti-incumbency factor has set in. If Rajinikanth does not enter the scene now, chances are that these anti-incumbency votes may go to the DMK. There is a section of voters in Tamil Nadu which are disgusted with the kind of politics practiced by AIADMK and the DMK. Both these parties are known for corruption, nepotism and favouritism. That section of voters are anxiously waiting for an alternative option and Rajinikanth fits the bill,” said Maalan.

But Maalan said that possibilities of Rajinikanth’s party crossing the half-way mark in the Assembly is highly unlikely. “At the best he may be one of the factors deciding who constitute the next government,” he said.

Kolahala Srenivaas, author and commentator, is expecting Rajinikanth to disclose on Thursday the reason behind his “disappointment” about which he mentioned last week. “He may also reveal some more details about the outfit because he has been functioning till now as per the script prepared by his advisors. It all sound very dramatic,” said Srenivaas.

Insiders who are in the know of things said that the manifesto, party programmes and blue print for the development of Tamil Nadu has been drawn out by the close aides of Rajinikanth. Pandhappilli Gopala Menon, well known Thanthric scholar, said April 14 being the Tamil New Year Day, chances of the actor launching the party are high. “First day of Chithirai, the first month as per Tamil Almanac is an auspicious day for all new ventures,” said Menon.

Once Rajinikanth discloses his future plans, another political narrative that could arise in Tamil Nadu is the possibility of coalition governments in the State.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajini-to-meet-rmm-members-today.html

127,12-3-20,RS polls: Pawar files nomination,"NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday filed his nomination for the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls from Maharashtra, even as the ruling BJP named former MP and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s descendent Uddhayanraje Bhosale and Union Minister Ramdas Athavale as its candidates for the polls.

Seventy-nine-year-old Pawar was accompanied by Shiv Sena President and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president and State Minister Balasaheb Thorat, State NCP president and Minister Jayantrao Patil and a host of leaders from the three MVA constituents, when he filed his nomination for the RS polls.

The elections for seven Rajya Sabha seats are being held on March 26. The last date for filing nominations is March 13. Elections, if needed, will be held on March 26.

The elections to seven RS from Maharashtra have been necessitated by the impending end of the terms of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Union Minister Ramdas Athawale, Congress’ Hussain Dalwai, Sena’s Rajkumar Dhoot, BJP’s Amar Sable, BJP-backed Independent Sanjay Kakade and NCP’s Majeed Memon, on April 2.

Meanwhile, the BJP announced Udayanraje Bhosale -- the 13th descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from the Satara royal family who had switched over from the NCP to BJP in the run-up to 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls but was trounced in the October 2019 – and Union Minister and Dalit leader Ramdas Athavale as its candidates for the RS polls.

With less than 36 hours to go for the closure of the nominations, the ruling Shiv Sena and Congress have not yet announced their candidates for the polls.

The electoral college for these seven RS seats is the 288-member Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. While the BJP has a strength of 105 members in the lower House, while the seat tally of the ruling constituents is: Shiv Sena-56, NCP -54 and Congress -44.

The rest of the MLAs in the 288-member comprise: Bahujan Vikas Aghadi --three seats, SP, AIMIM and Prahar Janshakti Party --two each and MNS, CPM, PWP, Swabhimani Paksh, RSP, Jansurajya Party, Krantikari Shetkari Party – one seat each and 13 Independents.

With its own tally of 105, the BJP claims that it has the support of 14 members from smaller parties and independents. With a combined tally of 154, the ruling MVA –comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, the MVA has the support of another 16 members comprising members of smaller parties and independents, which takes its tally to 170.

The number of members required for winning one RS seat is 41. While the BJP can easily can two seats, it can try to win the third seat with the support of 14 MLAs – from the smaller parties and Independents -- that it claims to have.

On their part, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – with their respective strengths – can win one seat each. Together, they can attempt to get one more RS seat.

However, there will be a stiff contest for the sixth and seventh seats in the March 26 elections.

The Congress, which has to remain content with only seat, is witnessing intense lobbying. Among the Congress aspirants for the RS ticket are: former Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde, Congress general secretaries Avinash Pande, Rajiv Satav, Mukul Wasnik, former South Mumbai MP Milind Deora and AICC Tamil Nadu secretary Sanjay Dutt.

On the Shiv Sena front, the names that are doing rounds are: former minister Anant Geete and Shiv Sena spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi, who had joined the Sena after quitting as Congress spokesperson.

The NCP, which is lobbying with the Shvi Sena for extra numbers may put up state minister Fauzia Khan, as its second candidate.

The suggestion to shut down such public places for 20 to 25 days was made by Congress MLA Naushad Solanki during a discussion on coronavirus in the State Assembly here.

Solanki also asked the Government to start screening of passengers at bus stations and railway stations, on the lines of screening being done at the international airports.

In his response, Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said there is no need to create panic among people by shutting down places like malls and cinema halls.

“Even in China, only five to six worst affected cities have been sealed while life is going on normally in other parts of that country. Thus, we don't have to create panic here at this stage. We are taking all necessary steps to contain the spread of coronavirus,” Patel said.

“Screening of international passengers is being conducted at Ahmedabad and Surat airports as per the Centre's guidelines. We are also screening foreigners staying at luxury hotels in the state,” said Patel, who holds charge of the state health department.

133,12-3-20,TMC accuses BJP of horse-trading,"War of words ensued between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP after the former accused the saffron outfit of ‘horse-trading’ in Madhya Pradesh even as senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit his party to join the BJP along with an impressive bunch of party legislators.

Hours after Scindia’s somersault TMC and BJP traded fire as senior Trinamool MP Sudip Bandopadhyay said that the latest development in MP would go down in the history as yet another shameful chapter in Indian democracy.

Not ruling out “horse-trading” in that State causing Scindia to join the BJP, Bandopadhyay said “our Trinamool Congress is of the firm opinion that the party that has been voted out of power should not try to stage a backdoor entry and the party that has been voted to power by the people should not be deprived from discharging its responsibility of running the Government for five years.”

Citing how the BJP had been pulling down Governments or indulging in horse-trading in States like Karnataka, Manipur and other states where “they are forming Government with parties that are in second or third position,” Bandopadhyay said “in such circumstances people cannot be faulted for suspecting horse-trading.”

“This incident” (of Scindia joining the BJP) would go down as yet “another shameful chapter in the history of Indian democracy,” he said inviting strong condemnation from the State BJP which said the TMC should first search its own basket of wrongs before blaming the others.

“It is a shame that a party which is itself guilty of horse-trading in Bengal is blaming the others,” State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

“There are numerous instances to show how the TMC either arm-twisted or purchased dozens of Congress and Left leaders to join their ranks. Everyone knows how Congress and the Left lost several of their MLAs who joined the TMC without even being expelled from the Assembly,” he said.

Meanwhile in an unrelated development the Trinamool Congress kept its decision reserved on whether to field a fifth candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections.

For the five vacant positions the party has nominated four former MPs --- Dinesh Trivedi, Mausam Benazir Noor, Subroto Bakshi and Arpita Ghosh. For the fifth vacant place the Left has decided to field former Kolkata Mayor and senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya with the backing of the Congress. Jointly the Congress and the Left has 70 MLAs in Bengal House.

“We can’t say as to whether we will field the fifth candidate,” TMC general secretary Partho Chatterjee said adding “talks are on and let us see whether we can field a fifth candidate or support anyone from some other party or not.”

Bhattacharya a former Advocate General of Tripura Assembly had successfully appeared for senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan the main petitioner in the Sharada chit fund case and the Narada pay off case to obtain a Supreme Court order directing CBI investigation into these cases.

135,12-3-20,"Sena calls BJP’s bluff, says MP virus won’t enter Maha","Amid claims by the BJP that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government would not last long, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said here on Wednesday that the Madhya Pradesh’s virus would not spread to Maharashtra, while NCP chief Sharad Pawar and State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Government would complete its full term.

A day after senior BJP leader and former State Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar went town — in the wake of political developments in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia – saying that the Shiv Sena-led MVA Government would collapse within a month and half, Sena MP Sanjay Raut rubbished him through a tweet.

Maintaining that the BJP’s “operation Lotus” would not succeed in Maharashtra, Raut tweeted: “Maharashtra’s Pa(o)war is different. One operation failed miserably 100 days ago. After that, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi performed a by-pass operation and saved Maharashtra. The Madhya Pradesh virus will not make inroads into Maharashtra. There is nothing to worry. Jai Maharashtra”.

Talking to media persons at Vidhan Bhavan after filing nominations for the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls, Pawar expressed confidence that the Sena-led MVA would complete its full five-year term and that Maharashtra would not witness a situation similar to the one currently witnessed in Madhya Pradesh.

“There would not be a repeat of the Madhya Pradesh situation in Maharashtra. I know Maharashtra well. I have no doubt at all that the Maha Vikas Agadhi would complete full five year term. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is running the government well and is taking all the constituents with him,” Pawar said.

“Yes. I am told that there was an attempt by the BJP to pull down the MVA government some time ago. But, they failed. They are not left with any special occasion that they can use to bring down our govenrnment,” the NCP chief said.

On the fluid political situation in Madhya Pradesh, Pawar said: “We will wait and see if the Kamal Nath government will survive or fall. People have confidence in the leadership of Kamal Nath. They think that he can perform a miracle. There is no point in predicting as to what will happen in MP. Let’s wait for two more days,” the NCP chief said. State Congress President and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said that “the MVA government in the state is stable, and all three allies will foil any coup attempts by the BJP with complete coordination”.

There was an intense speculation in the Maharashtra political circles that the BJP might pull off a coup ahead of “Gudi Padwa” festival that it had tried in November last year, when it roped in NCP leader Ajit Pawar and installed its government for a brief 80-hour period.

However, Ajit Pawar returned to the NCP, foiling the BJP’s attempt to have government in the State on a term basis.

136,12-3-20,AI pilots' body seeks relief from breath analyser test,"An Air India pilots' grouping has urged civil aviation regulator DGCA to exempt pilots from the mandatory pre and post-flight alcohol tests, amid the coronavirus scare.

In a letter to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation chief Arun Kumar, the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG) said the virus is “highly dangerous” for the airline's crew involved in international flight operations as it poses an “elevated risk” of exposure to the cockpit crew.

IPG, which has around 600 members, represents pilots of Air India's wide-body planes.

“The present outbreak of coronavirus is highly dangerous for our crew given the elevated risk of exposure involved in our global operations.

“While this epidemic lasts, mass use of any equipment without proper sterilisation compounds the possibility of propagation of this deadly virus through any individual during the early incubation stages of the virus,” the IPG said in the letter dated March 10.

Under the Aircraft Rules, crew members are not allowed to consume alcohol 12 hours before the commencement of a flight.

All flight crew are subjected to mandatory Breath Analyser (BA) tests prior to operating a flight as well as post the flight in case pre-flight test is not possible, according to the rules.

“In fact, recently, due cognizance was taken of this risk by your good office and communicated to all operators on February 7, 2020, under which crew operating out of Kerala were exempted from Breath Analysers,” the letter said.

139,12-3-20,FM to review bank merger preparedness,"As the bank merger becomes effective April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to meet the chief executives of the amalgamating banks on Thursday to review the preparedness for merger.

The Union Cabinet already approved consolidation of 10 public sector banks into four, earlier in the month.

The meeting would deal also on readiness of anchor banks to minimise disruption to customers and ensuring credit flow to productive sectors of the economy.

Sitharaman is likely to check the readiness and capacities of the amalgamating banks to handle and address customer queries and difficulties. The banks may also be asked to set up a common call centre with regional language support, so that customer issues are addressed and responded at the earliest.

In one of the biggest consolidation exercise in the banking industry, the government last year announced amalgamation of the Oriental Bank of Commerce and the United Bank of India with the Punjab National Bank, of the Syndicate Bank into the Canara Bank, of the Andhra Bank and the Corporation Bank into the Union Bank of India, and of the Allahabad Bank into the Indian Bank.

The amalgamation would result in creation of seven large PSBs with scale and national reach with each amalgamated entity having a business of over Rs 8 lakh crore. The mega consolidation would help create banks with scale comparable to global banks and capable of competing effectively in India and globally.

The Punjab National Bank would be the second largest public sector bank after the amalgation of Oriental Bank of Commerce and the United Bank of India with it, with over 10,900 branches. It would have a business of Rs 17.91 crore and have a CRAR of 14.46 per cent.

The amalgamation of Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank would form the fourth largest PSB with over 10,300 branches and business of Rs 15.64 crore and CRAR of 13.90 per cent.

The merger of Union Bank, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank would form the fifth largest PSB in the country with 9,593 branches and a business of Rs 15.08 crore. The banks would also present their business and financial plans to the minister, including credit and deposits growth and year-wise synergy realisation plan.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fm-to-review-bank-merger-preparedness.html
140,12-3-20,SBI cuts interest rate on savings accounts to 3%,"SBI on Wednesday cut interest on savings bank accounts to 3 per cent and also waived minimum balance requirement, as it set the trend of lowering interest rates in the banking sector.

The country’s largest lender has 44.51 crore savings bank (SB) accounts.

More banks are likely to follow to the market leader in slashing interest rate on SB accounts and waiving minimum balance requirements.

Earlier in the day, State Bank of India (SBI) reduced its fixed deposit rates and marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) for various tenors.

Keeping in mind the ‘Customers First’ approach, the bank said it has also waived SMS charges, which will bring significant relief to all the customers.

“Bank has also rationalised interest rate on SB Account to a flat 3 % p.A. For all buckets,” it said in a statement.

Currently, the interest rate on SB accounts is 3.25 per cent for deposits up to Rs 1 lakh in SB accounts, and 3 per cent for deposits above Rs 1 lakh.

SBI said it has decided to waive maintenance of Average Monthly Balance (AMB) for all SB accounts.

“The charges on maintaining AMB are now waived off on all 44.51 crore SBI savings bank accounts,” it said.

Currently, SBI customers need to maintain AMB of Rs 3,000, Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,000 in metro, semi urban and rural areas, respectively.

The bank used to levy a penalty of Rs 5 to Rs 15 plus taxes on non-maintenance of AMB. SBI had introduced penalty on breach of minimum balance in SB accounts in April 2017 after 2012. However, later in October it slashed the penalty amount.

Making it the second reduction in as many months, the public sector bank reduced interest rates for retail term deposits (less than Rs 2 crore) by 10 to 50 basis points for a few tenors. Fixed deposits (FDs) maturing between 7 days to 45 days will offer an interest rate of 4 per cent as against 4.50 per cent earlier.

Interest rates on FDs maturing in one-year and above have been reduced by 10 basis points.

One-year to less than two-year tenor FD will earn an interest rate of 5.90 per cent against 6 per cent earlier.

FD for similar tenor will fetch an interest rate of 6.40 per cent instead of 6.50 per cent for senior citizens.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sbi-cuts-interest-rate-on-savings-accounts-to-3-.html

142,12-3-20,Saudi Arabia to boost oil output capacity by 1 m barrels per day: Aramco,"Energy giant Saudi Aramco on Wednesday said it plans to raise its crude production capacity by one million barrels per day to 13 million bpd as a price war with Russia intensifies. “Saudi Aramco announces that it received a directive from the ministry of energy to increase its maximum sustainable capacity from 12 million bpd to 13 million bpd,” the company said in a statement to the Saudi Stock Exchange.

The decision comes a day after the world’s top exporter, Saudi Arabia, decided to hike production by at least 2.5 million bpd to a record 12.3 million from April.

The Saudi moves come after the collapse of an oil production reduction agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, including Russia. The deal proposed by Saudi Arabia called for additional output cuts of 1.5 million bpd to cope with the severe economic impact of the coronavirus which has sharply reduced world demand for crude. Boosting production capacity normally takes a long time and requires billions of dollars of investment.

Several years ago, the kingdom had shelved plans to boost its crude production capacity beyond 12 million bpd after demand for OPEC oil declined in the face of stiff competition from North American shale oil and other sources.

Russia on Tuesday said it was open to renewing cooperation with the OPEC cartel even as its kingpin Saudi Arabia escalated a price war with Moscow by announcing it would flood markets with new supplies.

144,12-3-20,Indian economy to benefit from slump in oil prices,"The Indian economy will likely see significant benefits in the form of lower current account deficit, reduced inflation and higher GDP following a slump in international crude oil prices, Kotak Institutional Equities Research said on Wednesday.

The collapse in cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia has triggered a plunge in oil prices that shows no signs of abating. Saudi Arabia has been cooperating with Russia to limit supply to the oil market and prop up prices.

Market participants had expected OPEC+ (OPEC nations plus 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries including Russia) to extend production cuts set to expire in March. But faced with the news that Russia would not participate, Saudi Arabia has decided not to go for it alone. The kingdom has signalled it will boost production above 10 million barrels per day.

With coronavirus already savaging demand for travel and transportation, “the world is now drowning in a glut of crude oil that appears likely to persist for months,” said Chris Lafakis, Energy Economist at Moody’s Analytics.

For India, this may be a boon to pull out the economy from an 11-year low growth rate and rising inflation.

“Lower oil prices provide significant tailwinds to the Indian economy in the form of lower current account (50 basis points of GDP or $15 billion for every $10 a barrel decline in crude prices), lower inflation (30 bps for every $10/bbl fall) and improved government finances/household savings,” Kotak said in a note.

The government’s tax revenues saw a spike in FY2016 when crude prices fell sharply. States will, however, lose meaningfully from lower product prices given the ad valorem nature of state VAT on petroleum products; they may also raise VAT on automobile fuels though.

Lower crude prices will benefit automobiles (lower cost of ownership), aviation (lower fuel bill), cement (lower pet-coke prices), consumer companies (lower packaging costs), city gas companies (lower gas prices), oil marketing companies (higher marketing margins on automobile fuels) and paints, it said.

“The Indian economy will likely see significant benefits from lower crude oil prices — lower current account deficit, lower inflation, lower fiscal deficit and higher GDP growth (one-time impact of lower imports).”

However, upstream oil and gas companies such as Oil India and ONGC may make losses if net realized price is below $35 per barrel, it said.

Lafakis said to restore oil prices, global fears about coronavirus must ease, oil exploration and production must fall significantly and the geopolitical rift between Saudi Arabia and Russia must be healed.

“Their cooperation has put a floor under oil prices in recent years. But without that alliance, the oil market becomes a Wild West where only the producers with the strongest means of production can profit,” Lafakis said.

Even if the coronavirus scare fades, excess supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia will persist.

In a separate note, Moody’s Investors Service said current oil price fall are lower in severity than the commodity price drop of 2015-16 and did not view these as a structural shift at this stage.

“We expect that oil and gas companies will actively manage their liquidity in 2020, reducing capital spending and potentially reducing or suspending distributions to shareholders amid lower operating cash flow and limited access to capital markets,” it said.

Heightened price volatility and depressed oil and natural gas prices most directly affect the exploration and production (E&P) and oilfield services (OFS) companies, particularly those facing refinancing needs over the next 6-12 months.

By contrast, the midstream sector benefits from its low commodity-price exposure and protective contracts for gathering, transporting and storing hydrocarbons, it said adding the refining sector is balancing the benefit of a sharp decline in feedstock prices with the reduced demand for fuel products in 2020.

The nearly 20 per cent decline in oil prices to less than $35 per barrel (bbl) strains all global oil production and leaves insufficient margin for sustainable replacement of the product, it said.

On March 9, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) US reference crude price fell to $31/bbl and the Brent international reference crude price fell to $33/bbl. The disruption of liquefied natural gas imports by China related to coronavirus further pressures weak natural gas prices in an oversupplied market.

“On top of higher volatility in oil and gas prices for 2020, we now expect that the average WTI price will fall outside our medium-term $50-70/bbl price range in 2020,” Moody’s said.

“While a modest price recovery is likely later in 2020, assuming the coronavirus is contained and economic activities start to normalize, overall 2020 price realizations will still be significantly lower than the 2019 average WTI benchmark price of $57/bbl.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-economy-to-benefit-from-slump-in-oil-prices-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-economy-to-benefit-from-slump-in-oil-prices.html

146,12-3-20,"Coronavirus may critically hamper vehicle production, says SIAM","Vehicle production across all categories is likely to be critically hampered due to the coronavirus outbreak in China as many automakers in India import about 10 per cent of their raw materials from the neighbouring nation, auto industry body SIAM said on Wednesday.

Indian auto industry had already maintained an inventory in the beginning of the year in anticipation of the Chinese New Year holiday but with the current lockdown in China, supply for BS-VI vehicles is likely to get impacted, SIAM President Ranjan Wadhera said in a statement.

The auto industry body said disruption in availability of these parts was likely to critically hamper production across all segments, namely passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and gravely affecting electric vehicles. “Manufacturers are exploring alternatives to fulfil their supply chain demands but that would also take a substantial amount of time to reach stable production scale as these components would need regulatory testing,” he said, adding Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers was in touch with the government with specific recommendations on behalf of the auto industry.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-may--critically-hamper-vehicle-production--says-siam.html
147,12-3-20,Inflows to equity mutual funds touched 11-month high in Feb,"Inflows into equity mutual funds surged to Rs 10,730 crore in February, the highest level in 11 months, even as the broader market witnessed heavy volatility amid concerns over the impact of coronavirus.

Overall, mutual fund industry witnessed a net outflow of Rs 1,985 crore across all segments, mainly owing to withdrawal from liquid or money market category. This comes following an inflow of Rs 1.2 lakh crore in January.

According to data released by Association of Mutual Funds in India on Wednesday, net inflows into equity and equity-linked schemes rose from Rs 7,547 crore in January to Rs 10,730 crore in February.

This is the highest investment since March 2019, when equity schemes attracted an inflow to the tune of Rs 11,756 crore. As the spread of coronavirus epidemic scared global equities, Indian stock market too found itself in its grip and registered a fall of almost 6.5 per cent (for S&P BSE 100) in February 2020.

“However, showing maturity, Indian investors viewed this fall as an opportunity to buy into equities and invested in equity funds,” said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst (manager research) at Morningstar India. The inflow is well spread between the category of funds such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap and multi-cap, among others.

Multi-cap, large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap funds saw inflows of Rs 1,625 crore, Rs 1,607 crore, Rs 1,451 crore.

Investors continued to focus on multi-cap category as it provides them exposure in all the three segments of the equity markets (large, mid and small caps). The aim is to benefit from the opportunities arising in all three market segments by staying invested in one fund, Srivastava added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/inflows-to-equity-mutual-funds-touched-11-month-high-in-feb.html
148,12-3-20,Slow ‘vikas’ of industrial corridors irks Parl panel,"Taking note of slow pace of work on five industrial corridors-Delhi-Mumbai, Chennai-Bengaluru, Amritsar-Kolkata, Vizag-Chennai and Bengaluru-Mumbai Corridors, a Parliamentary Committee on Ministry of Commerce and Industry, expressed its displeasure at their slow pace of their development and urged the Department to expedite their construction to provide much needed thrust to the Indian industry.

The Committee also took note of the various schemes such as Transport/Freight Subsidy Scheme, package for special category States for J&K (now UTs of J&K and Ladakh), Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, refund of Central and Integrated GST to industrial units in North Eastern Region and Himalayan States, North East Industrial Development Scheme and expressed displeasure at slow pace of utilisation of funds and urged timely disbursal of incentives, subsidy and tax refunds to industrial units and adequate allocation of funds under the schemes in the ensuing financial year.

Appreciating the government to come out with a new Agriculture Export Policy aimed to double farmers' income by 2022 and boost agricultural exports by integrating farmers and agricultural products with the GVCs, the Committee recommended the department to ensure active participation of the State Governments in effective implementation of the policy in agriculture clusters for promoting exports in the year ahead. The Committee noted that the Scheme of Price Stabilisation Fund aimed at providing financial relief to small growers of tea, coffee, rubber, tobacco, etc. has discontinued since 2013 and in its place a new Scheme of Revenue Insurance Scheme for Plantation Crops (RISPC) has not been implemented.

The Committee has recommended to launch a new crop insurance scheme at the earliest to provide security to the plantation growers in terms of price stabilization and crop protection and thus contributing to the welfare of farmers in the plantation sector.

The Report has also expressed its deep concern on the substantial reduction of the budgetary allocation made to Agencies/Commodity Boards viz. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board from the proposed outlay under the Medium Term Expenditure Framework. The curtailing of funds will, thus, impact the functioning of the schemes and programmes of the Agencies and Boards and the shortfall may lead to upsurge in liabilities in the coming years. It, therefore, recommended the Department to engage with Ministry of Finance for additional allocation at the supplementary grants stage for their optimal functioning.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/slow----vikas----of-industrial-corridors-irks-parl-panel.html

According to traders, volatility peaked in global markets after WHO's announcement describing the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.

160,12-3-20,"Coronavirus pandemic, US-China trade negotiations to keep base metal prices low in near term","India Ratings on Thursday revised its outlook on the country's base metals sector to negative from stable for the coming fiscal, stressing that the coronavirus outbreak, continuing US-China trade dispute and subdued global demand would keep prices low in the near term.

Prices may gradually improve as the pandemic is contained and the second phase of US-China trade negotiations is concluded, the rating agency said in a statement.

As part of its study, the agency has covered the copper, zinc, aluminium and coal sectors.

India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra), however, has maintained a stable outlook for FY21 on the key rated sector entities, given the majority of them have an adequate liquidity position, strong financial flexibility, a low-cost position and a dominant market position.

The key sector participants include Vedanta, National Aluminium Company and Hindalco Industries.

""Ind-Ra expects the entities to record, on a consolidated basis, revenue growth of 5.5-6 per cent year-on-year, EBITDA margins in the range of 18-19 per cent and a steady net leverage at around 3x in FY21,"" it said.

The outbreak of coronavirus shall result in a temporary zinc inventory pile up, as against the low levels at end-2019.

Until the containment of the virus outbreak, zinc prices will be low and treatment charges and refining charges will moderate; and both with gradually reverse as the impact of the pandemic reduces.

The zinc market is expected to be in marginal deficit over FY21.

Copper prices will also be low due to the coronavirus outbreak, and will be supported once the epidemic is contained.

Treatment charges and refining charges shall be high during this period due to limited smelter availability due to higher inventories of both refined copper and sulphuric acid (by-product) and would subsequently fall.

From a domestic standpoint, India shall continue to be a net importer of copper in FY21, pending the resumption of Vedanta's copper smelting facility.

The agency expects aluminium prices to experience downward pressure, due to a weak-end user demand and surplus market supply, despite Chinese environmental constraints.

The heightened US-China trade tensions or a surge in Chinese production in 2020 upon the containment of the new coronavirus may trigger the prices to dive down further.

India is dependent on imports of alumina and will have to find newer sources, it said.

Coal price weakness is likely to continue. Higher domestic volume output remains dependent on the availability of evacuation infrastructure.

Coal India Limited's volumes are likely to remain stable and coal cost would gradually improve over the mid-term as rake availability improves.

Despite the recent regulations to privatise the coal sector, Coal India's monopoly is likely to continue over the near term due to the time duration required for new entrants to obtain regulatory approvals and to set up the logistical and infrastructure necessary for commercial production.

Thermal coal imports shall gradually reduce upon the privatisation of the sector. However, coking coal imports are likely to be high over FY21, as India increases its steel production, the agency noted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-pandemic--us-china-trade-negotiations-to-keep-base-metal-prices-low-in-near-term-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-pandemic--us-china-trade-negotiations-to-keep-base-metal-prices-low-in-near-term.html

163,12-3-20,RBI to sell dollars worth USD 2 bn on Monday to sooth forex market,"The Reserve Bank will sell USD 2 billion worth of American currency to banks in a bid to infuse liquidity in the domestic forex market roiled by mounting concerns over coronavirus pandemic and crash in global oil prices.

The central bank also stressed it is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and spillovers.

Also, it stands ready to take all necessary measures to ensure that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy are mitigated, and financial markets and institutions in India continue to function normally.

The level of forex reserves at USD 487.24 billion as on March 6, 2020 remains comfortable to meet any exigency, the central bank added.

As part of its efforts to sooth the forext market, the RBI will undertake 6-month US Dollar sell/buy swaps. The swaps will be conducted through the auction route in multiple tranches. The auctions will be multiple price based -- successful bids will be accepted at their respective quoted premiums.

""On a review of current financial market conditions and taking into consideration the requirement of US Dollars in the market, it has been decided to undertake 6-month US Dollar sell/buy swaps to provide liquidity to the foreign exchange market,"" the RBI said in a statement.

In the first tranche, the RBI will sell American dollars worth USD 2 billion on Monday.

The swap will be in the nature of a simple sell/buy foreign exchange swap from the Reserve Bank side.

A bank will buy US Dollars from the RBI and simultaneously agree to sell the same amount of US Dollars at the end of the swap period. Financial markets worldwide are facing intense selling pressures on extreme risk aversion due to the spread of COVID-19 infections, compounded by the slump in international crude prices and a decline in bond yields in advanced economies.

""Flight to safety has led to spike in volatility across all asset classes, with several emerging market currencies experiencing downside pressures,"" the RBI said.

Mismatches in US dollar liquidity have become accentuated across the world.

The RBI also said the minimum bid size for the swaps auction will be USD 10 million and in multiples of USD 1 million thereafter.

166,12-3-20,Russia passes bill allowing Putin to stay in power past 2024,"The Russian parliament approved a sweeping constitutional reform in the third and final reading Wednesday, a move that will allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power for another 12 years after his current term ends in 2024.

The Kremlin-controlled lower house, the State Duma, endorsed a set of amendments to the constitution and a provision resetting the term count for Putin after the revised constitution goes into force.

It passed by a 383-0 vote with 43 abstentions, and was approved by the upper house, the Federation Council, several hours later.

A nationwide vote on the proposed amendments is set for April 22.

Kremlin critics condemned the move as a cynical manipulation and called for protests.

Putin, a 67-year-old former KGB officer, has ruled Russia for more than 20 years. After serving for two consecutive four-year terms — a limit outlined in the current version of the constitution — Putin shifted to prime minister's seat in 2008, with his close ally Dmitry Medvedev becoming a placeholder president.

The length of the presidency was extended to six years under Medvedev, and in 2012 Putin returned to the Kremlin as president. In 2018, he was re-elected for another six years.

Putin has weathered several international storms during his 20 years in power. The 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, which prompted a drawn-out, years-long conflict with Ukraine, significantly boosted his approval ratings back at home.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/russia-passes-bill-allowing-putin-to-stay-in-power-past-2024.html

Addressing women students and faculties at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, on the occasion of International Women’s Day, she said, “If a woman decides her priority, she should come forward and do it.” She pointed out that there are only 14 percent women entrepreneurs in India and that is too low.

She further emphasised: “Women need to take up more responsibilities. There will be challenges and the path to success is not an easy option.”

She added, “Technology is at your fingertips, so take charge of the environment around you. The education that you have should help you bloom in different ways. Also, don’t be too sensitive to comments. When you do multitasking, it takes a toll on your physical and mental health, so take care of yourself.”

A short video which focussed on women empowerment and education, was screened on the occasion.

Guest of honour, V Vijayakumari, Municipal Commissioner, Maraimalai Nagar said, “Nowadays, there are several opportunities for women and our society has started to look at things in a better outlook. There is a lot more freedom to pursue one’s true passion.” She also focussed on the importance of taking care of one’s health. “Be bold, strong, and independent.”

173,12-3-20,‘Forthcoming deals can transform US-India security partnership’,"The increasing defence and security cooperation between India and the United States is a very important aspect of our strategic partnership,” said Prime Minster Modi last week during the US President Trump’s visit. The increasingly close security partnership between the two nations has the potential to unlock unprecedented amounts of advanced US technology for India and access to supply chains of US suppliers for Indian manufacturers.

While the visit of President Trump coincided with only the announcement of $3B in defense sales — completely in military helicopters — it is the deals in the coming years that have the potential to transform the US-India security partnership. With the signing of the COMCASA and the ISA-1 agreement and BECA likely to be signed soon, these foundational agreements pave the way for release of the most advanced technology to India which will enhance joint interoperability as envisioned by the creation of the CDS and allow greater battlefield integration.

It has been widely reported that India is considering additional P-8 aircraft and the NASAMS missile shield built. But the largest deal is also likely to be the most significant — the sale of 30 MQ-9B Guardian armed drones from General Atomics for all three Indian Armed Forces. As a joint sale, this aircraft will revolutionise the situational awareness paradigm, allowing seamless monitoring and armed response to threats across India’s vast land and maritime borders.

The Guardian aircraft is highly modular and is easily configured with a variety of payloads, even after the aircraft have been delivered. Consistent with President Trump’s commitment to providing India with the United States’ highest technology, it is expected that the aircraft will include the most advanced sensors and weapons from the United States including SIGINT capability and next generation synthetic aperture radars.

The weapons capability of the aircraft is rumoured to include both, short range Hellfire missiles as well as stand-off missiles, which will allow it to strike targets from a longer distance. Future capabilities are rumored to include carrying jamming pods and other systems necessary for the disabling of enemy systems and performing Anti-Submarine Warfare missions.

Given that the Indian Defence budget is strained to meet the rising demands for security in its neighbourhood and anticipated for the years ahead, it is imperative that the Modi government give top priority to finalising the Guardian acquisition this year in order to sign the deal in early 2021.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---forthcoming-deals-can-transform-us-india-security-partnership---.html

“T20 is a different thing but if we do well here, we will have confidence going into the IPL which is necessary.”

With rain predicted on Thursday, Bhuvneshwar also hinted that India would prefer to bowl first if they win the toss.

By late Tuesday night, 77-year-old Biden had 788 pledged delegates in his kitty as he scored wins in the States of Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri as against 633 pledged delegates for 78-year-old Sanders. He also won Idaho. Sanders secured victory in North Dakota. The result from Washington state is awaited.

Either of the candidates need at least 1991 of the 3,979 pledged delegates to win the presidential nomination of the Democratic party.

Biden had lagged behind his Democratic rivals in early voting states, but rebounded after winning nine of the 14 states on “Super Tuesday” last week, the most important day in the race for the White House.

His wins in Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho on Tuesday has cemented his position as front-runner in the Democratic race to take on President Donald Trump in the presidential election in November.

Biden's win in Michigan is crucial as Sanders had clinched the victory in the state defeating Hillary Clinton four years ago.

In his speech in Pennsylvania, Biden said that democracy is at stake in this election and the country cannot afford to have another four years of President Trump who is seeking his second term this November elections.

“Winning means not only having a president who knows how to fight but how to heal,” he said.

178,12-3-20,Two bottles and a chef,"Chef Maria Goretti brings together a menu that blends the flavours of the East Indian bottle masala, which have only been limited to Mumbai, and good old Scotch. By Team Viva

The gourmet experience tilted, East India Bottle Masala and Double-Aged Scotch, focusses on the idea — drink less, drink better. Do you think minimalistic food and beverage trends are the way forward?

I believe minimalistic food is something that is debatable. It depends on the perception of different people because what is minimalistic for me might not be the same for my parents or anybody out there. For me, minimalistic would be Baked chicken. My mother used to prepare the dish for us a lot and hence, I never even think of it too much. But you would probably know somebody who didn’t eat that while growing up and wouldn’t look at it as minimalistic. But I think its flavour is one thing that dictates less is a little more.

Much has been talked about your journey from a VJ to chef... what has been your motivating force throughout?

I think I have been led by passion in whatever I do. I have been blessed that the steps I followed have started to bear fruit. Every person’s journey could be hard and everything that one decides to do comes with its own set of ladders that go on and on, one just needs to keep climbing, learning and improving throughout the way. But I would say a person has to love what they do. I think if you really enjoy doing what you do, you back it with hard work and then, I see no reason for it to not take off in a positive direction.

Was it challenging to make a switch and carve your niche in this field?

I never thought about it. I just stepped into this industry. I started learning how to cook because I could not and I had to feed my kids. So for me, it was just cooking that I was doing and I grew so passionate about it that I decided to learn from level zero. From how to cut an onion to making designs on a mushroom, from learning the right timing of the perfectly baked chicken to preparing fish in an oven, from learning how to make pastry to making bread... When I started all this, I didn’t think I would be doing what I am doing today. It’s all just a big bonus.

Do you think writing helps you understand the intricacies of food in a better way?

Writing a cookbook is the most difficult thing I have ever done. I did it alone and realised that it is a lot of trouble. It’s something which seems to be never ending. One day you write it and are fine with it. When you revisit the writing after two months, you start questioning it again. You feel like, ‘Oh my god! I don’t want to do this recipe. I can make a better one.’ And the process goes on but yes, it’s a lot of fun too. What I love about the book that I wrote (From My Kitchen to Yours) is that I actually use all of that in my daily life. It’s a collection of recipes that I have always loved. I have put them out there for people to try them.

When I was writing this book, I decided there are two ways in which I could it. First, in a difficult manner, where people will be impressed by its language but wouldn’t be able to understand it or implement it in their cooking. Second, where I put everything in such a simple way that anyone can cook from it. So I chose the latter and I think I am going to do the same even for my next book.

What went behind collaborating with The Doer’s Club and creating an experiential platform?

I have a special connection with Dewar’s and The Doers’ Club because they have always let me be and never restricted me. The idea #DoubleIsBetter is really exciting. I had complete freedom to put this together and they happily included my opinions too.

I was very happy and excited about using the East Indian bottle masala, which is just something that is restricted to Mumbai and precisely our community. I wanted to bring this flavour out and was thrilled to put together the menu with East Indian bottle masala and Dewar’s scotch.

I worked with an team of three amazing chefs on this. We call ourselves the ‘travelling chefs.’ I think all four of us have combined our forces and put this meal together, which has a little of all of us in it. So when I sent the menu to Dewar’s, they really liked it and instantly gave a green signal for it. I like this kind of freedom that all of us could sit together, put out a menu and do the best of what we are doing.

How well have Indians accepted global food trends?

I think the Indian audience is one of the most accepting audiences in the world. We are open to any kind of cuisine. Our favourite cuisine is Italian, seconded by Chinese. One of the reasons why Indians are able to adapt to a new cuisine and flavours easily is because we have a varied palate due to a diverse range of regional cuisines.

What is your signature dish and how did you come up with such an experiment?

I don’t have a signature dish. I would say I love East Indian bottle masala and I like playing with it in different ways. Sometimes I make sourdough with it, sometimes I put it in chicken, sometimes I even put it into soufflé for the little tang. So, I just play with that a bit. That’s what we have used for The Doers’ Club too.

I have also used Dewar’s double-aged scotch along with it in meat and prawns. We have prepared siracha using the two elements and I love this combination. Like Dewar’s says, ‘Double is Better.’",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/two-bottles-and-a-chef-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/two-bottles-and-a-chef.html

Kourtney goes therapy weekly

Reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian has opened up about her struggle with anxiety, saying that she has been going to therapy over the past three years.

“For the past three years, once a week, I go to a double session therapy. I look forward to it every week. Having that awareness, I find that I can almost catch things before they become a bigger deal. When those harder moments do happen, I think, ‘What’s the lesson that I’m supposed to be learning?’,” Kourtney said in an interview.

She went on to detail other things she did to support her therapy sessions.

“My workouts are key, too. And I go to church once a week if I can. I go with friends and we go to dinner afterwards. I’m such a homebody. It’s important for me to force myself to do something social!” she said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-03-12.html
180,12-3-20,Milan doesn’t stop. Not anymore,"Italy’s lockdown reshapes family life in the time of coronavirus

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte’s decision to lock down the entire country brought some welcome clarity to my family life after weeks of growing uncertainty about how to behave in a time of coronavirus.

I live that stereotype of the multi-generational Italian family, next door to in-laws, both over 80, and suffering from a collection of non-debilitating ailments common for their age. I also live with two teenagers, one of whom in particular has chafed against any suggestion that his social life should be curtailed just when the virus has freed him from that age-old adolescent burden — school.

So as I continued to commute to my job as a correspondent based in Milan, the capital of Lombardy, from a small town in neighbouring Veneto, the virus seemed both near and far. Near, because the two regions were quickly identified as hotspots with growing numbers of infections and two so-called red zones — but far, because no one we knew was sick, and many of the restrictions were still theoretical. They boiled down to frequent hand-washing.

Virus fear escalated in mid-February as I covered Milan Fashion Week, shoulder-to-shoulder with fashion types from all over the globe, and where the closing show by Giorgio Armani was streamed without an audience as a precaution. But the closest cluster — not yet a red zone — was still an hour away.

As the first restrictions took effect in Veneto and Lombardy — closing schools, museums, cinemas and bars after 6 pm — we scoffed at the reactive panic shopping. What were people doing with all that toilet paper? We had flour and pasta aplenty at home. And who needs a shopping cart full of bottled water? The taps weren’t being turned off.

The first day of the new measures was supposed to be the start of a three-day family break for Carnival in Nice, on the coast in neighbouring France. But our sociable son woke up with a fever and stomach flu symptoms and we decided it was better not to chance crossing the border as Italy became a focal point in coronavirus coverage.

Normally, we would have gone, stomach flu or not, and instructed the teen to sleep in the car, reasoning that the sea air would do him good. The painful decision to cancel seemed particularly wise after hearing reports of Italian cars being stopped in France for temperature checks. Imagine being found out transporting a feverish 16-year-old — the personal horror, the probable headlines.

Back at work, I wrote about social distancing, about how Italians’ habit of kissing could be part of the problem, before the 1-meter (yard) distancing rule started to gain currency. At home, we began a weeks-long struggle to impress upon invincible youth how vulnerable the elderly are to the virus.

I compensated for our dashed holiday by taking my daughter spring clothes shopping in teen-focussed stores where we no longer had to queue for dressing rooms. We ate out in empty restaurants. We had facials. We had to order ice cream at a table, not at the counter. It was the same when we wanted a quick refreshment after 6 pm — sit at a table, don’t just stand at the bar.

Cities were empty, parking places were too easy to find, but we didn’t feel particularly discouraged to be out. In fact, hashtags began to circulate — #MilanoNonSiFerma and #MilanDoesntStop. By being out — as long as we washed our hands frequently — we were doing our civic duty.

Then virus cases skyrocketted, with Italy registering the most infections outside of China. My in-laws stopped going to the grocery store, instead started ordering online. And they stopped kissing their grandchildren every morning and evening, as has been their habit. Finally, my children got remote homework assignments, and teachers started organising video classes — even if the app sometimes failed. The notion of a holiday was over.

Then this past weekend, we saw the red zone expand from two distant dots on the map — east and west — to provinces just 30 minutes each direction. A Sunday family dinner with my kids’ four cousins — who are also going stir-crazy with no school — was cancelled by the new travel ban out of Lombardy.

Also scratched were my plans to hop over on a free day and see Venice in its newfound quiet after a hotel-owner with zero rooms booked because of the virus described the glassy surface of the Grand Canal absent boats transporting Venetians and their wares.

Finally, on a recent evening, the red ink of the restricted travel zone soaked through the entire map of Italy, which had become one big hotspot. The same day, the first confirmed case was announced on Facebook by the mayor of our town. Suddenly, the virus was just near. And Conte declared the new Italian motto — “I stay at home.”

When I told my son, standing at his Playstation, about the national lockdown until April 3, he looked dejected. “How many days is that? What am I going to do for a month?” But for the first time in three weeks, he accepted he couldn’t go out that night.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/milan-doesn---t-stop--not-anymore-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/milan-doesn---t-stop--not-anymore.html

182,12-3-20,Seniors need to guide youngsters: De Dock,"South Africa captain Quinton de Kock urged the senior members of his team to own up responsibility as well as guide the youngsters during the three-match ODI series.

De Kock said former captain Faf du Plessis’ comeback after being rested for the Australia series, will hold the visitors in a good stead in the upcoming ODIs.

“Obviously, Faf (du Plessis) has comeback. He plays a big role for us from the leadership point of view. He is here to help out the younger guys in the team. He adds a lot of value for us. He also knows he has lot of value to give to this team. His experience will be a big help for us in this series,” De Kock said.

“We understand that we are coming here with quite an inexperienced side in these conditions but it’s important Faf, me, David Miller to help out these guys around, lead the way. Pass on our knowledge to the youngsters.” The Proteas skipper said the visitors are brimming with confidence coming into the tour after drubbing Australia back home.

“India is an unbelievable team, They have got great balance, but I am sure we are also coming here with a lot of confidence,” De Kock said.

De Kock said left-arm seamer Beuren Hendricks has recovered from his illness and is available for selection but batsman Temba Bavuma is uncertain as he is yet to fully recover from the hamstring injury.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/seniors-need-to-guide-youngsters--de-dock.html

184,12-3-20,No fans allowed in India Open,"The India Open Super 500 tournament, a crucial event for the Tokyo Olympic qualification, will be held without any spectators due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak, Badminton Association of India (BAI) said on Wednesday. The $400,000 tournament was under threat in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 4000 lives and infected more than 100,000 people globally.

However, BAI and the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Wednesday issued a joint statement, making it clear that the event will go ahead as originally planned adding that precautionary measures will be taken for the smooth conduct of the tournament.

“The YONEX-SUNRISE India Open 2020 to be staged in New Delhi from 24-29 March will go ahead as planned,” the statement said.

“Enhanced precautionary measures will be in place to ensure the welfare and safety of players, their entourage and officials.” One of the precautions taken by the organisers is to restrict the entry of people inside the stadium.

“The India Open will be held as planned at the KD Jadhav stadium in Indira Gandhi Indoor stadium but to ensure safety of everybody we have decided not to allow any spectator this time,” BAI General Secretary, Ajay K Singhania said.

“Fans can watch the matches on YouTube for the initial days while Hotstar will show the matches from quarterfinal onwards,” he said.

186,12-3-20,Dream run continues,"Four-goal Ilicic guides Atalanta into first ever European quarters

Atalanta’s fairytale Champions League run continued inside an empty stadium on Tuesday as Josip Ilicic scored four times in a 4-3 win over Valencia that sent his team into the quarter-finals 8-4 on aggregate.

A frantic contest inside an echoing Mestalla stadium was the first of several in the competition to be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus, with 55,000 vacant seats creating a surreal atmosphere that was never likely to deliver a momentous Valencia comeback.

They had been tasked with overturning a 4-1 defeat from the opening game in Italy and any hopes were all-but dashed inside 90 seconds when Mouctar Diakhaby conceded the first of two penalties, each converted by Ilicic.

In between, Kevin Gameiro had levelled for Valencia and then scored again shortly after half-time before Ferran Torres lobbed in to leave the hosts needing three in just over 20 minutes.

Yet any chance of a revival was quickly snuffed out as Ilicic completed his hat-trick and added a fourth to ensure Atalanta ended a strange evening with their names in the draw on March 20.

The Slovenia international also became the first player to score four times away from home in a Champions League knockout match.

Atalanta’s progress remains the greatest surprise of this year’s tournament, in which they lost all three of their opening group games and are featuring for the first time in the club’s 113-year history.

“After a difficult start to this competition, we got the hang of it,” said coach Gian Piero Gasperini afterwards.

Atalanta are based in Bergamo in northern Italy, one of the worst-hit regions in a country that has had 631 people killed by the virus so far.

After the final whistle, the players held up a shirt to a television camera that had the message, ‘Bergamo, this is for you!’ written across the front.

“We are very happy with how we have represented a region that suffers so much,” said Gasperini.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dream-run-continues.html
187,12-3-20,Not so special anymore,"Weak Spurs exposed as Leipzig cruise into Champions League last 8

Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli questioned his side’s mental strength after RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-0 win on Tuesday to progress 4-0 on aggregate to the quarter-finals for the first time.

Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer struck twice in the first 21 minutes before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on with his first touch.

“We were second to a lot of balls. To concede them goals shows our mentality wasn’t strong enough,” added Alli.

“We had to show maturity and fight and we didn’t do that and we were punished.”

Unlike many fixtures across Europe this week, there were no restrictions on supporters attending due to the spread of coronavirus and the Leipzig fans were able to enjoy a nerve-free evening.

Spurs travelled to eastern Germany shorn of striking options without the injured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Steven Bergwijn.

However, it was at the other end that they buckled inside the opening quarter of the game as two errors from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris turned a tough task into an impossible one.

Leipzig took just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Lloris did not get a strong enough right hand to stop Sabitzer’s strike from outside the box finding the bottom corner.

Timo Werner then fired home from close range only to be denied by the offside flag as Leipzig opened up the Tottenham defence at will.

And the visitors did not learn their lesson as Sabitzer met Angelino’s cross with a powerful header, but Lloris should still have done better to keep the ball out at his near post.

Tottenham have now failed to win their last six games in all competitions — the longest winless streak of Jose Mourinho’s managerial career.

And the Portuguese again blamed that run on his lack of options due to an injury list that also includes Moussa Sissoko, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies.

“People can say excuses but I’m pretty sure it is bad for anyone,” said Mourinho. “I don’t think anyone would resist to such a situation.”

Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season’s semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club’s history thanks to Lucas Moura’s hat-trick.

But in keeping with their collapse since that night in Amsterdam last May, Mourinho’s men lacked the quality and belief needed to reproduce that thrilling fightback.

Forsberg took just 32 seconds after replacing Sabitzer to fire the third goal into the far corner three minutes from time.

“It’s a great moment for the history of the club, for me as a manager, and for my young team,” said Leipzig’s 32-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann.

“It’s totally deserved we go to the next round. We were the better team, scored four goals, conceded none, so we are very happy.”

Tottenham’s season now hinges on refinding their domestic form if they are not to miss out on the Champions League next season for the first time in five years.

Spurs are eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four, and in desperate need for Mourinho to exact revenge on Manchester United for his sacking last season when the Red Devils visit north London on Sunday.

“We know this hasn’t been a good season but we can’t hide,” added Alli. “Confidence is gone at the minute but we have a big game at the weekend and we have to pick ourselves up and go again.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-so-special-anymore-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-so-special-anymore.html
188,12-3-20,"NBA shut down, fans shut out as coronavirus hits US sport","Sport across the United States and Canada was gripped by coronavirus fears, with the NBA suspending its season after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19.

The NBA's move followed a dramatic last-minute postponement of Utah's scheduled game against the Thunder in Oklahoma City, league officials taking action after deliberating during the day how best to proceed in the face of the outbreak.

""The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight's schedule of games until further notice,"" the league said.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.""

The move came days after the Indian Wells tennis tournament in California became the first high-profile casualty of the crisis.

Mounting concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 also prompted Canadian authorities to cancel the World Figure Skating Championships, which were due to take place in Montreal from March 16-22.

The decision came after escalating anxiety about the potential for unchecked transmission of the virus among fans attending sporting events.

Shortly after the NBA's decision, the NHL said it would update the status of its season on Thursday.

""The National Hockey League is aware of the NBA's decision tonight to indefinitely suspend its season due to a player testing positive for the coronavirus,"" the NHL said in a statement.

""The NHL is continuing to consult with medical experts and is evaluating the options. We expect to have a further update (Thursday).""

Pending league-wide action, the NHL's San Jose Sharks said they would play the three home games remaining this month without fans after a ban on mass gatherings in Santa Clara County in California.

The Santa Clara County edict also forced the postponement of a March 21 Major League Soccer game between the San Jose Earthquakes and Sporting Kansas City.

The NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets said they would host the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday behind closed doors after an order banning mass gatherings in Ohio, set to be the first major professional sports event to be played in an empty arena.

The San Francisco Giants baseball team said a planned pre-season game against the Oakland Athletics on March 24 would be rescheduled.

In Washington state, authorities announced a ban on all gatherings of more than 250 people in three counties until at least the end of March, including the area which covers Seattle.

'More aggressive position'

""It is clear that our state needs a more vigorous and more comprehensive and more aggressive position if we are going to slow the spread of this epidemic,"" Washington governor Jay Inslee said.

The MLS's Seattle Sounders later said a game against FC Dallas on March 21 had been postponed.

The Seattle Mariners baseball team said they would seek to reschedule the club's opening home games of the 2020 season, which had been set for late March.

Meanwhile, the wildly popular climax to the US college basketball season -- ""March Madness"" -- will be played in virtually fan-free arenas after the NCAA said only relatives and essential personnel would be allowed at games.

""I have made the decision to conduct our upcoming championship events, including the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, with only essential staff and limited family attendance,"" National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) president Mark Emmert said.

The NCAA took the unprecedented move after consulting public health officials. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a US Congressional panel in that the agency believed any large gatherings of people represented a risk of COVID-19 spreading.

""We would recommend that there not be large crowds. If that means not having any people in the audience, as the NBA plays, so be it,"" Fauci said.

""Anything that has large crowd is something that would give the risk to spread."" Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracker put the number of known US cases at around 1,300, with 36 dead.

Golf's US PGA Tour said Wednesday it has no plans to postpone its schedule, but added it has not ruled anything out either. The Players Championship tournament is set to start on Thursday.

""The Players Championship will continue as scheduled, although we will absolutely continue to review recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control, World Health Organization and local health administrations,"" the statement said.

""Players in the field have been notified to be prepared to play round 1, as scheduled."" The Tour said it would provide a further update on Thursday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nba-shut-down--fans-shut-out-as-coronavirus-hits-us-sport-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nba-shut-down--fans-shut-out-as-coronavirus-hits-us-sport.html

190,12-3-20,Saurashtra step closer to maiden title,"Saurashtra maintained their grip over the Ranji Trophy final on day three despite a fighting stand between Bengal veteran Manoj Tiwary and Sudip Chatterjee on a deteriorating pitch here on Wednesday.

Chatterjee (47 not out off 145) and Tiwary (35 off 116) took a leaf out of Cheteshwar Pujara’s book to share a gritty 89-run partnership off 226 balls after Bengal were in a spot of bother at 35 for two at lunch.

Batting is only going to get tougher on this surface with the ball keeping low right from day one, making it a steep challenge for Bengal to get past Saurashtra’s first innings total of 425.

Bengal reached 134 for three in 65 overs at close of play, trailing Saurashtra by 291 runs with Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha (4 off 43) in the middle.

Saurashtra, who resumed the day at 384 for eight, went on to bat for one hour and 10 minutes in the morning session to add 41 valuable runs with the last wicket pair of Jaydev Unadkat and Dharemendrasinh Jadeja producing 38 runs.

Bengal coach Arun Lal asked his players to remain optimistic and stretch the fight.

“Fight on. It was an important toss. First couple of days the wicket still played better now it is misbehaving. There is rapid wear and tear but we will fight it till the end,” Lal said.

Saurashtra coach Karsan Ghavri said, “We are doing okay at the moment. But cricket is a funny game, things can change quickly. It is not a bad wicket. Our batsmen showed it. The odd ball is keeping low. That is it.”

On day two, Pujara and Arpit Vasavada batted together for five hours to put Saurashtra in a strong position and Bengal too will have to come up with something special to stay in the game.

While Saurashtra are aiming for their maiden title, Bengal have not won Ranji Trophy since 1989-90.

The home team’s bowlers will be aiming for the stumps on day four like they did on Wednesday, hoping the pitch does the rest. Tiwary’s dismissal clearly showed how tough it has become to bat on the uneven surface.

Chirag Jani had him trapped in front of the stumps with a ball that came back in sharply at a low height and there was not much Tiwary could do about it. It was a sort of redemption for Jani, who had overstepped when Tiwary, batting on 18, played on to his stumps.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saurashtra-step-closer-to-maiden-title.html
191,12-3-20,India ready for fresh start,"Hardik Pandya’s eagerly-awaited international comeback adds a lot of context to India’s three-match ODI campaign against South Africa starting today where the hosts would be aiming to put the ‘New Zealand Nightmare’ behind them.

Amid the ever-rising danger of Novel Coronavirus and threat of rain once again playing spoilsport, Pandya’s all-round flamboyance will keep skipper Virat Kohli in a good headspace as he would be desperately trying to forget the 0-3 mauling in the last series in New Zealand.

Pandya last played an ODI against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final in Manchester and his last international game was a T20 against the Proteas in Bengaluru in September last year.

He forced his way back into the national team with his all-round performances at the DY Patil Corporate Cup, where he looked completely fit and ready to go.

Skipper Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri has spoken openly about ODIs being least of priority in a World T20 year. But his men can ill-afford to lose another series against an inexperienced South African side which is buoyed after crushing Australia 3-0 in their own den.

Especially having lost five international games (two Tests included) on trot, the Indian skipper, enduring one of his rarest of rare bad patches in last six years will be keen to buck the trend.

Kohli managed just 75 runs against the Kiwis, and going by his standards the Indian skipper would be itching to silence his critics, who have raised eyebrows after his statement on ODIs not having context in the current calendar.

The presence of Pandya along with a fit-again senior opener Shikhar Dhawan (shoulder dislocation) and seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (sports hernia surgery) makes India favourite on paper against a South African side that comprises of seasoned campaigners like Quinton d Kock, Faf du Plessis and David Miller in their ranks.

The three players automatically pick themselves in the playing XI while Manish Pandey might just get a longer run at No 6 now that Kedar Jadhav has finally been dropped from the squad.

In the absence of Rohit Sharma, who is yet to recover from a calf injury, Dhawan’s return would lend valuable experience to the Indian top-order, which badly missed both the openers in New Zealand

Bhuvneshwar’s return will give India good depth during the slog overs where Shardul Thakur had seemed completely misfit.

Mohammed Shami has been rested for the series after getting a blow on his shoulder in the second Test in New Zealand.

Ravindra Jadeja is expected to be the lone spinning option on a seamer-friendly Dharamsala track unless team management feels the urge to include Kuldeep Yadav in the team.

South Africa, on the other hand, are coming into the tour brimming with confidence after whitewashing Australia in the three-ODI series.

Faf du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen, who were rested for the ODIs against Australia, are part of South Africa’s touring party. Since quitting as captain, du Plessis has not had a good run and would like to do the course correction in his most preferred format.

Heinrich Klaasen and Kyle Verreynne, both of whom played crucial roles in South Africa’s ODI series win over Australia, would look to carry on their form in India while Temba Bavuma has also returned.

Janneman Malan earned his maiden India tour call as the 16th member of the squad after his match-winning ton in the second ODI against Australia.

This will be South Africa’s maiden ODI at this venue while India have played four ODIs here, losing two and winning two.

194,12-3-20,Indian boxing records best qualifying show,"World Bronze-medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) on Wednesday became the ninth Indian boxer to book an Olympic berth with a brutal box- off win at the Asian Qualifiers as the country recorded its best-ever qualifying numbers for the quadrennial showpiece.

Kaushik defeated Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside 4-1 to make the cut for Tokyo 2020 after a draining showdown which left the Australian with a bloodied face and the Indian exhausted by painful hits to his ribs.

However, there was no Golden finish to the qualifying flourish as Olympic-bound finalists Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Simranjit Kaur (60kg) ended with Silver medals for varied reasons.

While Krishan had to pull out owing to an eye injury, world Bronze-winner Kaur was outwitted by Asian Games champion Yeonji Oh of South Korea.

It was a repeat of the 2018 CWG final for Kaushik; only this time, the 24-year-old Indian ended up on the winning side. The top six in the 63kg category were entitled to Olympic berths in the ongoing event and Kaushik and Garside were taking a second shot at qualification after losing in the quarterfinals.

“It was my dream to play at the Olympics and today it has finally come true for me and my family. My coaches have made a huge contribution in this,” Kaushik said after the win.

“I sustained an injury in the opening round itself but my coaches told me to keep fighting hard and I did. It got me the result that I wanted,” he added.

The other Indians to have qualified for Tokyo Olympics are M C Mary Kom (51kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg).

Before this, India’s highest qualifying number for an Olympic Games was eight for the 2012 edition in London. That too was achieved over more than one qualifying tournament.

However, in a disappointing result, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) was pummelled by Shabbos Negmatulloev of Tajikistan in his box-off final to bow out of contention for an Olympic place at this event.

“We still have the World Qualifiers in May and I am confident that India will qualify in all 13 categories. Our mission is to win Olympic medals and these 9 qualifications are an indication of the potential that Indian boxers posses,” said Boxing Federation of India President Ajay Singh.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-boxing-records-best-qualifying-show.html
195,12-3-20,Max aims to make podium at every race,"Red Bull’s Max Verstappen is aiming for a podium finish at every race this season and Honda’s Formula One chief is backing his lofty ambition.

The Dutchman made the podium nine times last year, winning three grands prix, to end the 2019 season behind only world champion Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

He has set his sights much higher for 2020, starting at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on Sunday in a bid to dethrone Hamilton, who is chasing a seventh world title and fourth in a row.

Red Bull engine manufacturer Honda, who also supply the AlphaTauri team, formerly known as Toro Rosso, said they had worked hard in the off season to maintain reliability and deliver more power.

“We are making every effort to be there and fight for the championship,” said Honda F1 managing director.

“We had some unfortunate races last year, losing out in some of them, but we must avoid having those sort of races this year. “Max says he wants to get on the podium at all the races, which is an aim we must support.”

Max, who finished third in Melbourne last year, said “we are pushing hard as a team. Everybody here knows that to be successful you need to fully understand the car, do a lot of laps and we were pleased with our testing in Barcelona,” he said.

“We got good mileage, things ran pretty smoothly and that’s exactly what we wanted.

“I’d like to start the season strong,” added the Dutchman, whose bravado and energy have made him a blockbuster talent.

“Because then it’s really on but we won’t know where we stand until Q2 and Q3 on Saturday in Melbourne, that’s where all the hard work over the winter really counts.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/max-aims-to-make-podium-at-every-race.html
196,12-3-20,PL has first postponement as Arsenal players quarantined,"Arsenal’s game at Manchester City on Wednesday has been postponed after players from the London club were put into quarantine, making it the first Premier League football fixture to be called off because of coronavirus.

Arsenal said players and four staff had been isolated at their homes after coming into contact with the owner of Greek club Olympiakos, Vangelis Marinakis, who has since tested positive for COVID-19.

“We are strictly following the government guidelines which recommend that anyone coming into close contact with someone with the virus should self-isolate at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact,” an Arsenal statement said.

“As a result, the players are unavailable for tonight’s (Wednesday’s) match against Manchester City and the Premier League has decided the game should be postponed.”

Arsenal were knocked out of the Europa League by Olympiakos on February 27. Marinakis, owner of the Greek club and English side Nottingham Forest, announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.

But Arsenal said the players and staff, who met Marinakis after the game at the Emirates Stadium, will return to work on Friday ahead of Saturday’s trip to Brighton.

Olympiakos players, staff and board members have all tested negative, the club said.

Nottingham Forest also said none of their players had tested positive.

The postponement of the Manchester City v Arsenal game means Liverpool’s hopes of winning their first Premier League title since 1990 without kicking a ball have been dashed.

However, should City lose to Burnley on Saturday Jurgen Klopp’s side can secure the title on Monday with the added spice of doing so by beating city rivals Everton.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pl-has-first-postponement-as-arsenal-players-quarantined.html
197,12-3-20,Real Madrid soccer team put in quarantine,"Real Madrid's soccer and basketball teams were put in quarantine Thursday after a basketball player for the club tested positive for the coronavirus.

The Spanish club said that its soccer team was affected because it shares training facilities with the basketball team.

The decision by the club came moments before the Spanish league said the next two rounds of the top two soccer divisions will be suspended because of outbreak.

The league said in a statement that it had taken the decision after becoming aware of “the quarantine established in Real Madrid and the possible cases in players from other clubs,” without mentioning those suspected cases.

No player from a Spanish soccer team has been reported to have the virus.

The league added that the suspension of play will be “re-evaluated after the completion of the quarantines decreed in the affected clubs and other possible situations that may arise.”

For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

The Spanish government had already announced this week that all major sporting events in the country would be held without spectators as the southern European nation grapples to control an outbreak that has paralyzed Italy, where all retail establishments except for pharmacies and supermarkets have been closed.

Spanish state broadcaster TVE says the country has 2,600 virus infections and 63 resulting deaths, more than half of those in Madrid.

Valencia's Champions League match against Atalanta on Tuesday was played without spectators, and two Europa League matches involving Spanish and Italian teams have been postponed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/real-madrid-soccer-team-put-in-quarantine-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/real-madrid-soccer-team-put-in-quarantine.html
198,12-3-20,"Posters of anti-CAA protesters in Lucknow: No law to back UP govt's action, says SC","The Supreme Court told the Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday that as of now, there was no law that could back their action of putting up roadside posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests in Lucknow.

An apex court bench refused to stay the March 9 Allahabad High Court order directing the Yogi Adityanath adminstration to remove the posters.

The top court, which grilled the Uttar Pradesh government for putting up such posters in public, described the plea as a matter that needed ""further elaboration and consideration"".

A vacation bench of justices U U Lalit and Aniruddha Bose said a ""bench of sufficient strength"" would consider next week the Uttar Pradesh government's appeal against the Allahabad High Court order directing the state adminstration to remove the posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests.

It directed the apex court registry to put up the case file before Chief Justice of India (CJI) S A Bobde so that a ""bench of sufficient strength can be constituted at the earliest to hear and consider"" the case next week.

During the hearing, the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, that it was a matter of ""great importance"".

It asked Mehta whether the state government had the power to put up such posters.

The top court, however, said there was no doubt that action should be taken against rioters and they should be punished.

Mehta told the court that the posters were put up as a ""deterrent"" and the hoardings only said that these persons were liable to pay for their alleged acts during the violence.

Senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for former IPS officer S R Darapuri whose poster has also been affixed in Lucknow, told the bench that the state was duty-bound to show the authority of law backing its action.

He said the action of the Uttar Pradesh government amounted to a ""mega blanket"" approach of naming and shaming these persons without final adjudication and it was an open invitation to common men to lynch them as the posters also had their addresses and photographs.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/posters-of-anti-caa-protesters-in-lucknow--no-law-to-back-up-govt-s-action--says-sc-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/posters-of-anti-caa-protesters-in-lucknow--no-law-to-back-up-govt-s-action--says-sc.html

200,12-3-20,"Speaker issues notices to 22 rebel MLAs, seeks reply by Friday","Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker N P Prajapati has issued notices to 22 Congress MLAs who have resigned, asking them to appear before him by Friday and clarify whether they have quit voluntarily or under pressure, a legislature official said on Thursday.

The BJP, meanwhile, has said it will seek a floor test in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly on March 16, while the Congress said it is ready to face the test only after a decision on the resignations of the 22 MLAs.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said Speaker Prajapati has issued notices to the 22 MLAs, including six ministers, who have resigned.

Singh also sought to know why the MLAs were not meeting the Assembly speaker to submit their resignations.

The speaker has asked the 22 MLAs to appear before him by Friday to clarify whether they have resigned voluntarily or under any pressure, Vidhan Sabha principal secretary A P Singh said.

The 15-month-old Kamal Nath-led government has been facing deep crisis following the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs after former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party on Tuesday.

""Since the government is in minority, we are going to request the governor and the Assembly speaker for a floor test on March 16 when the state budget session begins,"" BJP's chief whip in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Narottam Mishra told reporters here.

The governor and the speaker have the resignations of 22 MLAs. Now it is up to them to take a call, he said.

""This government has lost majority,"" senior BJP leader former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said here.

BJP spokesman Rajnish Agrawal also said that on the opening day of the state Assembly's budget session on March 16, they will press the Speaker for a floor test.

When asked about the BJP's demand, Digvijaya Singh said the chief minister is ready for a floor test.

""As Kamal Nathji has already said we are ready for the floor test. But, there should be a decision on the resignation of MLAs before the floor test,"" Singh said, while blaming the BJP for the constitutional crisis in the state.

""The resignations will be accepted when the MLAs meet the Speaker one-on-one and verify their signatures without any pressure. Then the resignations will be accepted and the floor test can be conducted,"" he said.

He said the speaker has already issued notices to the rebel MLAs, who should now go to him and clear the air.

""Nineteen Congress MLAs are in their (BJP's) captivity. The family members (of MLAs) are unable to talk to them. Their phones were taken away. It is also strange that the resignation of Congress MLAs were submitted to the speaker by BJP leader Bhupendra Singh,"" he said.

""Now, they (BJP) are expecting that their resignations should be accepted,"" the Congress leader said.

The BJP claimed this is an ""internal matter"" of the Congress, but at the same time leaders of the saffron party submitted the resignations of ruling party (Congress) MLAs to the speaker, he pointed out.

The Congress veteran also said people of the country should understand what kind of ""manipulation the BJP has been doing to form its government"".

Digvijaya Singh further said he never comprised with his ideology and believes in political accountability.

On Tuesday, 22 Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh resigned soon after Scindia quit the party.

Of these legislators, 19 are currently staying in a resort in Bengaluru while three are still in Madhya Pradesh, sources said.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228- member Assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114.

It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP.

If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 206.

The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats, while the BJP has 107 seats with the magic number for a majority being 104.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/speaker-issues-notices-to-22-rebel-mlas--seeks-reply-by-friday-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/speaker-issues-notices-to-22-rebel-mlas--seeks-reply-by-friday.html

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Thursday also criticised the Congress for neglecting the aspirations of its youth leaders.

It also said the BJP in Maharashtra should stop ""daydreaming"", and remember that just like the unexpected political drama in the western state a few months ago, a ""shock experiment"" can take place in Madhya Pradesh.

Former Union minister Scindia quit the Congress on Tuesday along with 22 MLAs in Madhya Pradesh, putting the 14- month-old Kamal Nath-led government in deep crisis.

He joined the BJP on Wednesday and slammed the Congress for ""denying reality"" and ""not acknowledging"" new thoughts and new leadership. He has also been named as BJP's Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh.

Commenting on these political developments, the Shiv Sena criticised the Congress for neglecting the aspirations of its youth leaders, saying even though Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh are at the ""helm"" of the Madhya Pradesh Congress, it was not necessary to completely sideline a leader like Scindia.

Hitting out at the BJP, it said during the Lok Sabha elections last year, the saffron party used its full mightto defeat Scindia, but now it has welcomed him into its fold with ""open arms"".

""Kamal Nath is also a shrewd and daring politician and will not give up easily. Just like the unexpected political drama in Maharashtra, a shock experiment can take place in Madhya Pradesh,"" the Marathi daily said.

The Congress lost the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh under the leadership of Ashok Gehlot and Kamal Nath, respectively, the Sena pointed out.

""When seniors fail, the young leadership should be encouraged. This is not happening and that is why (Rajasthan deputy chief minister) Sachin Pilot and Gehlot are at loggerheads. If the matter is not resolved, it is believed that Rajasthan may go the Madhya Pradesh way,"" it claimed.

It noted that eight months ago, Scindia criticised the BJP, calling it a ""murderer of democracy"" after the Congress- JD(S) coalition government in Karnataka was toppled.

""Fifteen days ago, he criticised BJP leaders for making hate speeches and now after joining the BJP, he says Congress is not the party it used to be earlier,"" it said.

""What were Scindia's demands - the state (Madhya Pradesh) unit president's post or the Rajya sabha ticket? Both were denied to him.

It is alleged that Sagir Ahmed, Deputy General Manager of Navratna government enterprise NBCC, had allegedly demanded Rs 80,000 for three roads -- Rs 25,000 each plus Rs 5,000 -- built by JC Infra Corporation, they said.

Ahmed allegedly repeatedly demanded the bribe from JC Infra promoter Subhash Jhunjhunwala. The latter assured him that he was sending Rs 2.30 lakh in an envelop through an employee, the officials said.

The bribe amount included Rs 80,000 demanded by Ahmed and Rs 1.50 lakh for clearance of other bills worth Rs 54 lakh, they said.

213,12-3-20,Suspension of 7 Cong MPs lifted,"The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed a motion to revoke the suspension of seven Congress MPs as Speaker Om Birla returned to the House for the first time since the ugly incidents of March 2 when a scuffle between ruling and Opposition members was witnessed.

The seven Congress members — Gaurav Gogoi, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, R Unnithan, Manickam Tagore, Benny Behanan and Gurjeet Singh Aujla — were suspended on March 5 for the remaining period of the Budget Session for utter disregard for House rules and gross misconduct after they snatched papers from the Speaker’s table.

The motion to revoke their suspension was moved by Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal and passed by a voice vote on Wednesday.

The Speaker then announced that the suspension stands revoked with immediate effect.

After the unruly scenes on March 2 when the House met after a recess, a “pained” Speaker had stopped coming to the House and the proceedings were presided by a panel of chairpersons in Birla’s absence.

After a meeting with leaders of all parties on Wednesday, Birla came to the House at 1.30 pm and chaired the proceedings of the House.

Members from across the political spectrum welcomed the Speaker and expressed happiness that he was again presiding over the House. The members from various parties also sought revocation of suspension of the seven Congress MPs.

Birla said he was personally pained and hurt over the happenings in the House in recent days and actions of some members who tore papers in the Well, snatched papers from marshals and displayed placards.

“In this House we can agree, disagree on issues, or use sarcasm, but decorum should be maintained,” Birla said. Birla also assured the Opposition that he would allow time for discussion on issues demanded by members.

“It is necessary to keep the dignity of the Chair intact to retain the faith of people in India’s democracy,” Birla added.

Seeking revocation of the suspension of the seven members, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said his party never wanted to dishonour the Chair or disturb the functioning of the House.

Asserting that it is the responsibility of both the Opposition and the Treasury Benches to maintain the dignity of the House, Chowdhury said, “You don’t give life sentence to someone for just killing a pigeon.”

DMK’s TR Baalu and TMC’s Saugata Roy said the House should function in harmony and members will refrain from any action which impinges on the dignity of the House.

“Their (seven suspended members’) actions were not desirable.... I am not defending them. 1.5 million people who elected these members would be deprived if the House functions without them,” Roy said.

BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said this is the first time in the history of Lok Sabha that the Speaker did not attend the House for four days because he was hurt by actions of members, especially from the Congress.

On March 2, the BJP and the Congress members had pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha, as Opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. The Opposition members shouted slogans, displayed placards and some even tore papers and hurled them in the air.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/suspension-of-7--cong-mps-lifted.html
214,12-3-20,Resort politics on to avert poaching of MP legislators,"Congress flies away remaining 88 MLAs to Jaipur, rebels stay put in K’taka

Amid a political crisis triggered by former Guna MP Jyotiraditya Scindia’s exit from the party, the Congress on Wednesday afternoon flew its remaining 88 MLAs from Bhopal to Jaipur in order to prevent poaching by the BJP.

The MLAs, who were received by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot at the airport, are likely to stay at the Buena Vista Resort in Jaipur. Two MLAs of the BSP, one from SP and independent accompanied the Congress legislators.

The BJP MLAs are staying put in ITC Grand Bharat in Manesar in Haryana.

Around 20 rebel Congress MLAs have been lodged in a resort in Bengaluru. They have claimed to have resigned from the legislative Assembly. The Congress has sent two of its leaders, Sajjan Singh Verma and Govind Singh, to Bengaluru in order to pacify some of the rebel MLAs and bring them back to the party.

The grand old party has been witnessing an internal turf war in Madhya Pradesh since the party formed the Government in the State in 2018. The crisis deepened on Tuesday after Scindia resigned from the party and at least 22 MLAs close to him announced to withdraw support to the Nath Government.

In 2018 Assembly results, the Congress, which won 114 seats in the 230-member Assembly formed the Government with the support of four Independent MLAs and two BSP MLAs and a legislator from the Samajwadi Party (SP). The BJP had secured 109 seats in the State Assembly.

While there are clear indication that the Nath Government would not survive for want of the required number of MLAs, Congress leader Verma on Wednesday said they (leaders who are in Bengaluru) are neither willing to support Scindia nor in favour of joining the BJP as they were misled and taken to Bengaluru in Karnataka.

“Nobody is ready to go with Scindia. They said they were misled and taken to Bengaluru, most of them said they are not ready to join BJP,” Verma claimed.

“I just came from Bengaluru and now I am going to Jaipur. Besides 5-6 Ministers and one MLA, we all are going to Jaipur. They (MLAs) have said they have the blood of Congress and they will remain in the party. Since Scindia was a senior party leader, all our MLAs followed his order as a courtesy,” he said.

He also claimed that he is in contact with 7-8 BJP MLAs.

Senior party leader Digvijaya Singh claimed on Wednesday that thirteen of the 22 rebel Congress MLAs don’t want to quit the party and were led away only to create pressure on the leadership to nominate Scindia to the Rajya Sabha. He also asserted that the Nath-led Government in the State, pushed to the brink of collapse with the resignation of 22 MLAs, will win a floor test.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bala Bachchan said the Nath Government will prove the majority in Assembly and complete its five-year term. “The Congress is in a safe and strong position. Everybody is in touch with the Chief Minister, everything will be alright soon. We will prove majority on the floor of the Assembly and our Government will continue till 2023,” said Bachchan while speaking to reporters here.

Besides, Congress MLA Umang Singhar said the resignations of MLAs who are in Bengaluru have not been accepted yet. “All MLAs are in touch with us; their resignations have not yet been accepted,” he said.

However, Madhya Pradesh Women and Child Development Minister and rebel Congress MLA Imarti Devi on Wednesday reaffirmed her loyalty to Scindia and said she will always stand alongside him “even if I had to jump into a well”. The Minister said she and 21 other rebel Congress MLAs are camping in Bengaluru out of their own volition and with the blessings of Scindia. Imarti welcomed the former Congress leader’s decision to join the BJP.

After Scindia quit the Congress, around 10,000 of its office-bearers have resigned from the party in Madhya Pradesh and several more are likely to do so, a former leader of the grand old party claimed on Wednesday. The ruling Congress, however, refuted this claim and said the supporters of Scindia were creating pressure on other leaders to leave the party.

“About 10,000 office-bearers of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh- from state-level to block-level, including some district presidents, have resigned from the Congress since Tuesday morning owing their allegiance to Scindia ji,” former state Congress spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi, who also quit the party along with Scindia, told PTI on Wednesday.

The district presidents of Guna, Sagar, Ashok Nagar, Gwalior, Indore, Shivpuri and some other districts have resigned from the party, Chaturvedi, a staunch Scindia supporter, said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/resort-politics-on-to-avert-poaching-of-mp-legislators-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/resort-politics-on-to-avert-poaching-of-mp-legislators.html
215,12-3-20,"Besides Scindia, BJP names 8 for March 26 RS polls to 55 seats","Besides Jyotiraditya Scindia, the BJP named 8 others for the March 26 Rajya Sabha elections to 55 seats across 17 States.

BJP’s alliance partner Janata Dal (United) too announced that it would field Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh and Upper House member Ram Nath Thakur, whose terms end next month, for the upcoming election to the Upper House.

Other candidates named by the BJP included Bhubaneswar Kalita from Assam, Vivek Thakur from Bihar, Udayanraje Bhosale from Maharashtra and Rajendra Gehlot from Rajasthan. Abhay Bhardwaj and Ramilaben Bara from Gujarat, Deepak Prakash from Jharkhand and Leishemba Sanajaoba from Manipur were also named by the party as its Rajya Sabha nominees. Prakash is the State party president.

The BJP also said it has allotted two seats to its allies with Dalit leader and Union Minister Ramdas Athawale getting renominated from Maharashtra and Biswajit Daimary of Bodoland People’s Front to contest from Assam.

Almost all these candidates are certain to enter Rajya Sabha as the BJP has numerical strength in the respective Assembly to ensure their win.

Scindia is an influential leader of Madhya Pradesh where 22 Congress MLAs, 19 of whom loyal to him, have resigned in a bid to topple the Kamal Nath-led Government.

Vivek Thakur is the son of former Union Minister CP Thakur, whose term is ending, the BJP’s decision to field him underscores its bid to keep Bhumihars, a strong support base for the party, in good humour in Bihar where Assembly polls are due later this year.

Bhosale, who traces his lineage to Maratha king Shivaji, had left the NCP to join the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but had lost from Satara.

The list does not include the names of Vijay Goel and Prabhat Jha, among the incumbents whose terms will expire next month.

BJP’s Rajasthan vice-president and former Jails Minister Rajendra Gehlot will be the party’s Rajya Sabha candidate from the State.

Bihar’s JD(U) chief, Vashishtha Narayan Singh, made the announcement about the two RS nominees of the party at a Press conference at Patna in the presence of its national general secretary RCP Singh, who is the JD(U)’s leader in the Rajya Sabha.

Elections to five Rajya Sabha seats from the State, which will fall vacant next month, will be held on March 26. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) holds three of these and its alliance partner BJP, the remaining two.

Harivansh is a veteran journalist and was the editor of Prabhat Khabar for many years.

Ram Nath Thakur, besides being from an extremely backward caste, is the son of late Karpoori Thakur, a former Bihar Chief Minister and arguably the tallest OBC leader in the State whom Nitish Kumar and socialists of his generation consider their political mentor.

The JD(U)-BJP coalition’s strength in the Assembly this time, however, is poised to win only three out of these five seats because the Congress-RJD combine, which had fought the 2015 State Assembly polls in alliance with the JD(U), had seen dramatic rise in their tally and are slated to bag two Rajya Sabha seats.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/besides-scindia---bjp-names-8-for-march-26-rs-polls-to-55-seats.html

217,12-3-20,Modi to take Yoga to new ‘heights’ on June 21,"Hopeful that the increase in temperature in the summer months will slow down the coronavirus spread, the Prime Minister Office has picked high-altitude Leh, the Capital of the newly created Union Territory of Ladakh, to host the main event of International Yoga Day (IDY) on June 21.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected to lead the mega event, which is likely to be participated by over 20,000 yoga enthusiasts, the idea is to give fillip to the economy and ensure better health of the locals including tribals in Leh, Ladakh. This will be the first of its kind yoga programme on such a huge scale in the high-altitude region.

Sharing details of the proposed event with reporters here, Union Minister of Ayush, Shripad Naik said the PM is expected to perform 45 minutes yoga asanas based on the Common Yoga Protocol. The event is likely to be attended by 15,000 to 20,000 people.

“The event of IDY 2020 promises to be unique and different since such a large congregation for yoga will be taking place in a high altitude location like Leh for the first time,” said the Minister.

In a reply to a query, he said by the time the event will be held, which will be summer then, it is expected that coronavirus proliferation might go down in high temperature.

Industry bodies like CII, FICCI, Institute of Company Secretary and educational bodies like CBSE, NCERT, UGC and DAV have already prepared programmes for June 21. Last year the event was held in Ranchi.

A senior official said the high altitude Leh has been picked up for yoga event with an aim to create awareness about yoga on one hand and promote tourism in the region on the other hand. The Ministry has already been training yoga to the groups of women in the region to ensure their participation at the mega event as well engage them in yoga activities.

In Delhi, the main event will be held at Rajpath and it will be organised by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) along with the Ministry.

Naik also talked about the proposed National Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh, Ladakh which was approved by the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister last year. The institute will have the mandate to undertake interdisciplinary education and research programmes in Sowa-Rigpa in collaboration with premier national and international institutes and facilitate the integration of different systems of medicine.

Naik also said the proposed institute aims at bringing a valid and useful synergy between traditional wisdom of Sowa-Rigpa and modern science, tools and technology. It will help to promote interdisciplinary research & education of Sowa-Rigpa.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/modi-to-take-yoga-to-new----heights----on-june-21-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/modi-to-take-yoga-to-new----heights----on-june-21.html

The deadly novel coronavirus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,200 lives and infected more than 117,330 people across 107 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) describing the outbreak a pandemic.

""I also spoke to the prime minister of India, my friend Narendra Modi. We are dependent on supply lines from various countries. We are looking into it all the time,"" Netanyahu told a press conference on Wednesday.

His remarks came during joint statements with the finance minister, the economy and industry minister, the Bank of Israel's governor and the finance ministry director general on dealing with the economic implications of the coronavirus.

The Israeli Prime Minister's Office, however, did not clearly spell out the subject of Netanyahu's discussions with Modi in its press release.

The Israeli prime minister has announced a package of 10 billion NIS (USD 2.86 billion) to facilitate economic activity in the midst of challenges posed by the spread of the virus.

""The Israeli economy is in a better situation than most economies in the world: Unemployment is low, growth is high and the debt to GDP ratio is good,"" Netanyahu said.

""However, we have a great challenge here that we all are feeling and which we are all aware of. In our view, we can also deal with it in a way that will allow us to get through it successfully in peace,"" he said.

""Not without difficulty, and not without sacrifice, but in the end, in peace, and I think that we can do this together in an optimal manner,"" Netanyahu asserted .

219,12-3-20,"Healthy lifestyle reduces risk of disease, mortality","The longer you lead a healthy lifestyle during midlife, the less likely you are to develop certain diseases in later life, according to a new study.

The more time a person doesn't smoke, eats healthy, exercises regularly, maintains healthy blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels and maintains a normal weight, the less likely they are to develop diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease or to die during early adulthood, the research added.

""Our results indicate that living a longer period of time in adulthood with better cardiovascular health may be potentially beneficial, regardless of age,"" said study author Vanessa Xanthakis from Boston University in the US.

""Overall, our findings underscore the importance of promoting healthy behaviours throughout the life-course,"" Xanthakis added.

While unhealthy lifestyle behaviours are associated with higher risks for certain diseases and death, the association of the duration in which people maintain a healthy lifestyle with the risk of disease and death had not yet been studied.

For the findings, published in the JAMA Cardiology, researchers from Boston University School of Medicine observed participants for approximately 16 years and assessed the development of disease or death.

They found that for each five-year period that participants had intermediate or ideal cardiovascular health, they were 33 per cent less likely to develop hypertension, approximately 25 per cent less likely to develop diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, and 14 per cent less likely to die compared to individuals in poor cardiovascular health.

According to the researchers, this study will help people understand the importance of achieving an ideal cardiovascular health early in life and motivate them to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

223,12-3-20,"Scindia shuns inertia, joins parivar","Jyotiraditya hits out at Cong in parting shot, says country secure in PM Modi’s hands

Shaking off his 18-year-long Congress legacy, Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday joined the BJP saying he has come to the “parivar” (family) as his previous organisation is seized with “inertia and out of sync with reality” and the country’s future is “fully secure in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hands”.

While BJP president JP Nadda described him as part of the ideological “blood family” recalling the association of his grandmother Vijayaraje Scindia with ‘Bharatiya Jana Sangh’ and the “very democratic” BJP, the party announced him as one of the candidates from Madhya Pradesh for Rajya Sabha, denial of which was one of the reasons for his parting company with the Congress.

But then, the entry of Scindia with his loyalist MLAs could create uneasiness to the homegrown BJP leaders and legislators, some of whom had lost Assembly polls contesting against the Congress in December 2018 in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP as also Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to do the fine balancing act as they accommodate Scindia both in the Government and the party lest it ruffles feathers of party’s old guards. Scindia may be given a Cabinet berth in the reshuffle on card anytime from now and his camp followers in Madhya Pradesh may be fitted in the ‘new BJP Government’, as and when it happens.

The Madhya Pradesh BJP had, understandably, sent a list of around 22 names, including national general secretaries Ram Madhav and Kailash Vijayvargiya, to the party’s Central poll panel to pick two candidates for the March 26 Rajya Sabha elections to three seats in the State, a senior leader said. The names of Satyanarayan Jatiya and Prabhat Jha, both sitting Rajya Sabha members from the State, also figure in the list. Thus, the move to elevate and accommodate an “outsider” may already have led to some disquiet in Madhya Pradesh.

Awarding Scindia, who lost his Lok Sabha seat to the BJP in 2019, from Guna, could not go well with the core workers. Guna has gone back to the BJP after two decades, even though the party’s candidate was an outsider. Incidentally, the BJP had last won the seat in 1999, when Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia — Jyotiraditya’s grandmother — won it.

BJP leaders, however, maintain that it was necessary to induct leaders of influence from the Opposition into the party to achieve a “Congress-mukt” India, a pet theme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

As Congress removed Scindia’s nameplate from Parliament House (as Deputy leader of the party in Lok Sabha) , Scindia quietly “moved on” and joined the saffron party in its headquarters here saying it was no longer possible to serve public by being in the Congress. He said the Congress was no longer the same party as it was earlier and “inertia” has set in and leadership has neither courage nor vision to face the “realty” on the ground.

The BJP president who welcomed him as part of “parivar” recalling his grandmother’s contribution to establishing the BJS and the BJP, said he was free (unlike the Congress) to serve the party as he liked as “ BJP is a very democratic party”. “Entry of Jyotiraditya Scindia in the BJP is like a family member coming”, Nadda added.

On his part, Scindia thanked Nadda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, saying they have given him the platform to serve the people.

Hailing Modi for his leadership, Scindia said the country’s future is secure in his hands. Prior to sending his resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Scindia along with Shah met Modi at latter’s residence for over an hour on Tuesday.

Talking about Madhya Pradesh, the erstwhile Congress leader said the dream which he saw with his former colleagues for the State has been shattered in the last 18 months. Instead of creating employment, there is corruption, and transfers and postings (of officials) is a business, he said. “Rojgaar ki jagah bhrastachaar ho gaya,” said the four-time MP who first got elected from Guna in MP in 2002 after winning a bye-election necessitated by his father’s demise. He was only 31 years old at that time.

Scindia wields political influence mainly in and around Gwalior region including Guna and Shivpuri and his overarching presence in the State could add political muscle to the BJP in Madhya Pradesh which has an overwhelming presence of the RSS network that almost anchors the parivar’s advances in the Hindi Heartland.

Blessed with family legacy, Scindia, 49, may not find it difficult to dye himself well in the saffron colour and as he said “serve Bharatmata”. Besides the ‘Rajmata’ connection, two of Scindia’s aunts are in the BJP, one being Vasundhararaje, former CM of Rajasthan and Yashodhara Raje, a former Minister in MP. His father too was an MP from Jana Sangh in 1971 before moving to the Congress.

The BJP would like the former Congress leader to prove his utility to the party by outflanking Congress in Madhya Pradesh as also come handy in other States, particularly in UP of which he was appointed general secretary by his erstwhile party.

The first task ahead of Scindia would be to dislodge the Kamal Nath Government and win at least two of three Rajya Sabha seats, elections for which are due on March 26. Prior to his entry to the BJP, one seat each was fixed for the BJP and the Congress with third set for a keen contest with the vote of first preference. Now with 19 of Scindia loyalists sending in their resignations, the BJP is game for two RS seats. Of the three seats, two were held by BJP’s Jha and Jatiya and one is with Congress’s Digvijay Singh. The BJP would again pin hopes on Scindia’s coup to get hold on the third RS seat too. But, here, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is from Congress, would hold the key.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/scindia-shuns-inertia--joins-parivar-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/scindia-shuns-inertia--joins-parivar.html
224,12-3-20,"Govt suspends all visas, save a few","Corona tally 60

With 10 new coronavirus cases — eight in Kerala and one each in Delhi and Rajasthan — the total number of confirmed cases in India rose to 60, including 16 Italian tourists, the Government on Wednesday suspended all visas, except a few categories such as diplomatic and employment, till April 15.

The decision was taken at a meeting of a group of ministers held here under the chairmanship of Health Minister Harsh Vardhan. “All existing visas, except diplomatic, official, UN/International organisations, employment and project visas, stand suspended till 15th April 2020. This will come into effect from 1200 GMT on 13th March 2020 at the port of departure,” the statement said.

The Government also geared up its health system and stepped up tougher border measures since most of the patients have a travel history to affected countries.

The Union Health Ministry asked overseas firms to initiate ‘work from home facilities’ to its employees coming from a few virus-hit countries for 14 days.

On the international front, India has evacuated 948 passengers from coronavirus-affected countries. Of these, 900 are Indian citizens and 48 are foreigners. External Affairs Minister Jaishankar told Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the 58 Indian pilgrims who returned from Iran have tested negative and as many as 529 samples have been collected in the second batch and whosoever will test negative will be brought back in the next flight.

The Government will hopefully send on Thursday a medical team to Italy for carrying out testing facilities for Indians stranded there, he said.

Also, a total of 83 individuals, who arrived from Italy on Air India flight on Wednesday, have been quarantined at Army facility at Manesar, Haryana. Of them, 74 are Indian, six are Italian and rest three people are from the United States.

The officials also said a team of doctors will be sent to Italy on Thursday to collect and bring swab samples of Indian students stranded there so that they can be tested before being brought back to the country.

The Ministry further said the Government is undertaking measures to ensure safety and security of its citizens in Iran after it became clear that the country was facing a COVID-19 outbreak.

Indian nationals in Iran include pilgrims, students and fishermen, the Ministry said.

On March 7, 108 samples were received from Iran. These samples are being tested at the laboratory of AIIMS. Also, six scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have been stationed in Iran and they so far have collected swab samples of over 400 Indians stranded there.

Equipments and reagents have also been dispatched to enable them to setup a lab. “The first batch of 58 evacuees from Iran has arrived on March 10 with 25 men, 31 women and 2 children on board. All evacuees are asymptomatic at present,” the Ministry said.

Giving State-wise breakup, the Union Health Ministry said five positive cases have been reported in Delhi while nine people were diagnosed with the infection in Uttar Pradesh till Wednesday evening.

Karnataka and Maharashtra have reported four and two confirmed cases of COVID-19 respectively. Ladakh has recorded two positive cases. Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab have reported one case each, the Ministry said while Kerala has 17 cases, including the three patients who were discharged last month following recovery.

According to reports, two employees from tech companies Mindtree and Dell have tested positive for the deadly coronavirus here, having travel history to abroad. Besides, in what could be the first death due to coronavirus in India, a patient suspected of being infected with COVID-19 virus, has died in Hyderabad. However, no official confirmation has been received from the Telangana Government so far.

Amid rising cases of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, India on Tuesday barred entry of the nationals of three more countries -- France, Germany and Spain -- suspending the regular as well as e-visas granted to them till date.

“All regular (sticker) visas/e-visas granted to nationals of France, Germany and Spain and issued on or before March 11 and who have not yet entered India stand suspended with immediate effect,” said a Bureau of Immigration notification issued late Tuesday night.

Regular visas, including e-visas, granted to all foreign nationals who have travel history to these countries on or after February 1 and who have not yet entered India also stand suspended, it said.

Issuing a travel advisory, the Health Ministry also called for passengers with travel history to China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy, Thailand, Singapore, Iran, Malaysia, France, Spain and Germany to undergo self-imposed quarantine for a period of 14 days from the date of their arrival, and their employers to facilitate work-from-home for such employees during this period.

The Union Health Ministry has strongly urged people to refrain from travelling to China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, Japan, France, Spain and Germany and advised them to avoid non-essential travel abroad in view of the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministry further said that a total number of 10,57,506 passengers have been screened so far at the airport.

The Tripura Government has decided to temporarily shut two border ‘haat’ (markets) along the India-Bangladesh border as a precautionary measure to check the spread of coronavirus while India has already suspended visas granted to the nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan and China

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) has locked down its southern centre as a precaution measure while places of public gatherings like cinema halls have been closed in Jammu and Kerala has also gone for a lockdown.

Meanwhile, the Group of Ministers (GoM) which undertook elaborate discussions on the various precautionary measures expressed satisfaction with actions taken, preparedness and efforts put together by various stakeholders.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-suspends-all-visas--save-a-few-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-suspends-all-visas--save-a-few.html

226,12-3-20,"Delhi riots a conspiracy, says Shah as Opp slams inaction","Rioters will not be spared, says HM

Maintaining that the Delhi riots “prima facie appear to be a pre-planned conspiracy”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday told the Lok Sabha that those behind the communal violence will not be spared irrespective of their religion, caste or party affiliation.

With the Opposition seeking his resignation and the Congress staging a walkout in the middle of Shah’s reply, he said the Government has identified the hawala financiers and certain elements in social media behind the flare up and that the Government has written to Delhi High Court Chief Justice with regard to attaching the properties of the rioters.

After hearing the Opposition’s attack during the debate for more than three hours, the Home Minister in counter offensive cited Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s speech in Ramlila Maidan as “violence inciting.”

“After this speech asking people to come out to roads to fight, Shaheen Bagh started in December. If this is not hate speech, which is hate speech,” he asked the Opposition Benches, adding that “January onwards we are aware that hawala money is flowing to incite protests against CAA.”

Shah said three financiers of the protests are in police custody and the cops will go to the bottom of it to find the truth.

Earlier, initiating the debate, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury attacked Shah for non-action and failure to contain the three-day long violence in Delhi.

Demanding the Home Minister’s resignation, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was acting like Emperor Nero playing fiddle when Rome was burning. When Delhi was witnessing violence, Modi was hosting US President Donald Trump in Ahmedabad, the Congress leader said.

He said the situation came under control soon after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visited the violence-hit areas. “Why could not the Home Minister go... NSA reports to the Prime Minister. Does this mean that the Prime Minister’s Office had lost faith in the Home Ministry,” Chowdhury said hitting out at Shah. Chowdhury alleged that Delhi High Court judge S Murlidhar was transferred out as he had questioned the failure of the Delhi Police in containing the violence. He said the “midnight” notification was aimed at preventing adverse strictures against the Government.

BJP MPs objected to the mention on Judges and Speaker OM Birla reminded the members to avoid mentions on Judges.

Facing Opposition criticism over alleged inaction by the Delhi Police during the violence last month, Shah appreciated the police for not allowing the riots to spiral. While expressing grief over the death of people in the violence, Shah said the Delhi Police succeeded in controlling riots within 36 hours. He said a total of 2,647 people have been detained or arrested.

Shah said that around 3,000 people entered through UP border to create chaos in the North Eastern area of Delhi. “We will identify these people through face identifying software. Already many involved in violence around 1,200 persons identified. More than 50 social media accounts were created to incite violence and wrong narratives. Some accounts have closed by February 26. By account closing none is going to escape,” said the Home Minister detailing the probe findings.

Reacting to Opposition accusation that he was in the programme of US President Trump, Shah said he attended only the programme in Ahmedabad only as it is his constituency. “Then I was fully engaged with the Delhi Police and Intelligence officials to control the situation. I have not gone to lunch and dinner of US President in Delhi. I was fully with officials and monitoring,” he said.

“We will spare no one irrespective of their religion, caste and political affiliation. Such action will be taken that it will be lesson for the country on what befalls those who indulge in rioting,” he reiterated, asking AIMIM leader Assaduddin Owasi to control his colleague Waris Pathan from hate speeches.

Responding to the Opposition’s criticism on not visiting riot-affected areas, Shah said he didn’t want to divert the attention of Delhi Police at such a sensitive time. “I did not go to the ground because I did not want the police to get distracted and divert their resources for my security,” he said.

Shah said it was on his request that Doval visited the riot-affected areas to raise morale of the Delhi Police. Taking on the Opposition, Shah said the Government wanted a discussion on the Delhi violence in Parliament after Holi to avoid communal flare up during festival time, but some have other priorities.

Strongly defending CAA, he said there were more than 25 laws drafted on the basis of religion, while CAA doesn’t discriminate with anyone. He also said 76 per cent of riot related deaths so far have been under the Congress rule and the party had “no moral right to question us”. He cited the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the controversial statement made by a Congress leader to attack the Opposition party.

Giving details of the casualties due to riots, Shah said, “52 Indians lost their lives during the violence”. Unlike the Opposition, Shah said he doesn’t want to name how many Hindus or Muslims died. “I won’t give figures in ‘Hindu-Muslim’. 52 Indians have died, 526 Indians have been injured. Shops of 371 Indians were set ablaze and houses of 142 Indians were burned,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-riots-a-conspiracy--says-shah-as-opp-slams-inaction-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-riots-a-conspiracy--says-shah-as-opp-slams-inaction.html
227,12-3-20,Congress acts to limit Trump on military action in Iran,"Defying a veto threat, Congress has approved a bipartisan measure to limit President Donald Trump's authority to launch military operations against Iran.

The House gave final legislative approval to the measure Wednesday, 227-186, sending it to Trump. The president has promised to veto the war powers resolution, warning that if his ""hands were tied, Iran would have a field day.""

The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., declares that Trump must win approval from Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Kaine and other supporters say the measure is not about Trump or even the presidency, but instead is an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war.

Six Republicans joined 220 Democrats and independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan to support the measure. Six Democrats and 180 Republicans opposed it. In the Senate last month, eight Republicans backed the resolution. The resolution ""sends a clear message that the American people don't want war with Iran and that Congress has not authorized war with Iran,'' said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

While tensions with Iran have abated since a US drone strike that killed Iran's top general in early January, the resolution clarifying Congress' power to declare war is still important, Engel said.

""Congress doesn't have to wait until the president alone decides to use military force again,'' Engel told House members during floor debate Wednesday. ""It's our responsibility to do something, because we know the tensions could flare up again at a moment's notice. Iran has not been deterred as the administration promised.''

Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, called the war powers measure “divisive and irresponsible” and based on a false premise.

""It orders the president to terminate hostilities against Iran. The problem is, for the other side, we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran,'' McCaul said.

If the US military launches strikes in Iran, “I believe that the president would need to come before this body to ask for a new authorization” for the use of force, McCaul said.

""But that is not what we are facing.'' The House vote marked a rare exertion of authority from Congress, which also moved to impose restrictions on US involvement with the Saudi-led war in Yemen last year after US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a gruesome murder at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey. Trump promptly vetoed that measure.

The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding resolution on Iran in January, a few weeks before the Senate approved Kaine's resolution. Two-thirds votes in the House and the GOP-run Senate would be needed to override an expected Trump veto.

Kaine hailed the House vote.

""For years, Congress has abdicated its responsibility on matters of war, but now a bipartisan majority in both the Senate and House has made clear that we shouldn't be engaged in hostilities with Iran without a vote of Congress,'' he said in a statement.

The legislation “doesn't prevent the president from defending the United States against imminent attack,'' but instead “demands that the decision of whether or not we go on offense and send our troops into harm's way should only be made after serious deliberation and a vote of Congress,'' Kaine added.

""If President Trump is serious about his promise to stop endless wars, he will sign this resolution into law.”

In a statement of administration policy, the White House said the resolution should be rejected “because it attempts to hinder the president's ability to protect” US diplomats, forces, allies and partners, including Israel, from the continued threat posed by Iran and its proxies, including militia groups and foreign fighters in Syria.

""Iran has a long history of attacking United States and coalition forces both directly and through its proxies,” the White House said, adding the congressional resolution could hinder Trump's ability to protect US forces and interests in the region.

""This joint resolution is untimely and misguided. Its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,'' the White House said.

Tehran responded to the US attack on its top general, Qassem Soleimani, by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. The attack caused traumatic brain injuries in more than 100 US soldiers, the Pentagon said.

Democrats and Republicans alike criticized a briefing by the Trump administration shortly after the drone strike, saying US officials offered vague information about a possible attack being planned by Iran but no substantial details.

Kaine has long pushed for action reasserting congressional power over military conflict. At the request of Republican senators, he removed initial language that targeted Trump in favour of a generalized statement declaring Congress has sole power to declare war.

The resolution also directs Trump to terminate use of military force against Iran or any part of its government without approval from Congress and commends Trump for killing Soleimani, who was long designated a terrorist by the US.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/congress-acts-to-limit-trump-on-military-action-in-iran-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/congress-acts-to-limit-trump-on-military-action-in-iran.html

229,12-3-20,Cong’s response on exit muted,"Jyotiraditya was the only chap who could enter my home any time, says Rahul

On a day it lost Jyotiraditya Scindia — one of its most promising and prominent young leaders — to the BJP and its Government in Madhya Pradesh runs the risk of losing power after the 19 party MLAs reiterated their loyalty to the “Maharaj”, the Congress on Wednesday chose to speak on falling crude oil prices even as the threat of many others following in Scindia’s footsteps is being sounded from within the Congress camp itself.

If four-term Congress MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi has openly asserted that devoted leaders across the country are feeling “alienated, wasted and discontented”, those like Sachin Pilot — another restive leader caught in the generational clash with Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot — has warned against ignoring party faithful for candidature for a Rajya Sabha seat from the State. Pilot, like Scindia, too has been undergoing a similar grind in the party.

While the Congress chose to ignore Scindia, former party chief Rahul Gandhi said, “He was the only chap who could enter my home any time.” Scindia used to assist the Gandhi scion by prompting relevant points during debates in Parliament and used to share chits to Rahul to speak at times. Scindia’s exit from the party is also being attributed to his failure in getting heard by Rahul.

“He was with me in college,” Rahul said, breaking his silence on the exit of Scindia from the party. Rahul also shared a photo of December 13, 2018 of him with Scindia and Kamal Nath ahead of the deliberations over nomination of chief ministership in Madhya Pradesh.

However, Scindia’s departure seems to have forced the Congress to make the much delayed appointment of party presidents in Karnataka and Delhi. While young face Anil Chaudhary was appointed as its Delhi unit chief, party’s trouble shooter DK Shivakumar took over as the head of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee.

As for Scindia, sources said, he had been making attempts to reach out to other young leaders in the Congress and he allegedly contacted Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot, former Union Ministers RPN Singh, Milind Deora, Jitin Prasada, Haryana MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi and others - all close aides of Rahul Gandhi.

Speculation is rife that his brother-in-law and another senior Congress leader from Jammu & Kashmir Vikramaditya Singh may also follow his footsteps. Sources said senior most Congress leader Dr Karan Singh too made futile attempts to convince Scindia to reconsider his decision to go with BJP.

“It is unfortunate that Jyotiraditya Scindia has been pushed to the corner by his own leaders with damaging results for the Congress party. This is a huge blow to the party that will have strong ripple effects down to the grassroot level,” Vikramaditya, son of Karan Singh, tweeted.

Scindia’s cousin and erstwhile Tripura royal, Pradyot Manikya Debbarman, claimed that the miffed leader had tried to meet Rahul for months before he quit the party. “I know for a fact that Jyotiraditya Scindia was trying to meet Rahul Gandhi for months; no appointment was given. If he (Rahul Gandhi) did not want to hear us, why did he even bring us to the party?,” said Debbarman who was the Tripura Congress chief before he too decided to quit the party a few months ago.

The Congress accused the BJP of being in the “business of poaching and abducting MLAs, and stealing Governments”, claiming that the party has fine-tuned the art. Terming the developments in Madhya Pradesh an insult to democracy, senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said the BJP has fine-tuned the art of poaching and abducting MLAs and stealing Governments.

At a time when acute crisis prevails, the Congress demanded that the Modi Government bring down the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG to the pre-2004 levels as global crude oil prices have fallen drastically. Rahul asked the Prime Minister to slash the price of petrol to under Rs 60 a litre.

The exit of key men from the Congress started with former Congressman Himanta Biswa Sarma (now Assam Finance Minister). At least, five former Chief Ministers and half a dozen former Union Ministers of the Congress quit the party since 2014, when the Congress was reduced to its lowest tally. Most of these leaders had strong community appeal and have helped the BJP reach out to new voters’ constituencies.

Scindia’s exit was imminent almost 15 months ago when ahead of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly election, Rahul had assured him that he would be under consideration for chief ministership after the polls only to opt for Kamal Nath, a move many young leaders in the party privately attributed to Sonia Gandhi’s reluctance to make a young leader CM who might outshine her son and emerge as his challenger.

That was exactly why, these young leaders said, Sonia kept the post of deputy leader of the Lok Sabha vacant for two years after 2017 even though Scindia was keen on it.

Scindia was made general secretary of Western Uttar Pradesh and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, as general secretary in-charge of eastern UP who overruled Scindia in appointments across the State. Scindia also expressed his view on abrogation of Article 370 against the party lines.

On a day when he made hectic parleys with BJP leadership including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Scindia was expelled from the party due to anti-party activities.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong---s-response-on-exit-muted-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/cong---s-response-on-exit-muted.html

232,12-3-20,Emily Blunt wanted to be a pop star,"Actress Emily Blunt says veteran star Judi Dench talked her out of becoming a pop star.

During her appearance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"", Blunt revealed that she wanted to be a pop star, reports eonline.com.

""I could have been Britney (Spears),"" she joked, noting that her dreams were short-lived because of one minor detail.

""I realised I wasn't good at dancing and I didn't want to be Britney…I don't know,"" she added.

The ""A Quiet Place Part II"" star admitted that she had recorded some songs and even tried dance lessons.

""I don't want to tell you too much because I feel like someone is going to find these songs. Do you want to know the name of one of them? ‘Ring It Up'. It will never see the light of day,"" she said.

After getting a laugh from Kimmel, Blunt assured the late night host that she didn't help write the tune.

""I can't write. I can't really sing - no, I'm just kidding,"" she said, adding: ""They said, ‘I think you have a nice voice and I think that you could be a pop star'. I said, ‘I can't dance'. They said, ‘Don't worry about it. We'll teach you'. It didn't work. I tried to learn.""

Then she got an advice from one of her A-list co-stars that helped her make the right decision.

""I was doing a play…my first job was with Judi Dench - which was incredible and she was wonderful to me,"" she recalled.

""And I went to her for advice because I was really, really nervous about this career that I didn't know was right for me -- I didn't think was right for me -- and she was like, ‘Oh no, darling. You can't do both. You can't act and do that'. She talked me out of it,"" she added.

""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" is aired in India on Star World.

At the moment, Blunt is looking forward to ""A Quiet Place"" sequel.

""A Quiet Place"" was about a post-apocalyptic world where humans are the prey of fast-moving creatures who track victims by sound. The 2018 film revolved around a family struggling to survive in a world where making the slightest sound draws the attention of a predatory alien species that has taken over the planet.

The official synopsis for ""A Quiet Place Part II"" read: ""Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe) must now face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. Forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realise that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path.""

The movie will release in India in March. It will be exclusively distributed in India by Viacom18 Studios.

234,12-3-20,Vicky Kaushal: Struggled to build my confidence,"Actor Vicky Kaushal initially felt that ""a lanky guy"" like him would never be able to make it big in Bollywood, adding that he struggled hard to build his confidence.



""Life has been wonderful, I have learned so much over the period of time. My parents always made sure I am grounded and it's their upbringing which has helped me reach here. While we were growing up, our parents were very clear between necessity and luxury. Luxury was something which Sunny (Kaushal) and I had to earn ourselves,"" Vicky said, adding: ""I struggled to build my confidence at first because choosing acting as a career, appearances needs to be on point. Always thought a lanky guy will never have a chance, but here we are.""



Talking about pursuing his passion for acting, Vicky said: ""During my engineering tenure, I never thought of being an actor. Visiting an industrial place gave me clear goals and made me realise what I didn't want to do in life. I channelled my thoughts and interest only to realise performing is what I love the most.""



""My father was quite astonished when I broke out the news of pursuing acting as a career. He was always of the opinion that one of the family members would have a sedentary life with a desk job paying fixed income on monthly basis and vacationing in Diwali with all the family members,"" added the son of Sham Kaushal.

235,12-3-20,Twitter makes work from home mandatory,"Amid rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, Twitter is making it mandatory for its nearly 5,000 employees to work from home.

The social media company announced the decision on Wednesday after ""strongly encouraging"" its employees to work from home earlier this month.

""Our top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic,"" Jennifer Christie, Vice President, People at Twitter, wrote in a blog post.

""To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of 'strongly encouraging work from home' provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home,"" she said.

The World Health Orgaziation (WHO) on Wednesday declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic.

The virus has spread globally, infecting over 118,000 people and killing more than 4,000.

""We understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times,"" Christie said.

For contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labour costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter's work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect, she added.

While Twitter has taken the ""unprecedented step"" of making work from home mandatory, a number of other companies inlcuding Google and Amazon have encouraged their employees in some areas hit by coronavirus to work from home.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/twitter-makes-work-from-home-mandatory-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/twitter-makes-work-from-home-mandatory.html
236,12-3-20,"Tom Hanks, wife Rita Wilson test positive for COVID-19","Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced that they have tested positive for the novel coronavirus while filming in Australia.

Hanks and Wilson, both 63, sought medical advice after experiencing symptoms of a cold in Queensland, the BBC quoted the actor as saying in an Instagram post on Thursday.

Hanks wrote on Instagram: ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that come and went. Slight fevers too.

""To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.""

He said they would keep the world ""posted and updated"".

""We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

The couple will now spend time in isolation, he added.

They had been on the Gold Coast, where Hanks was working on a film about the life of Elvis Presley.

According to the Guardian newspaper, the cast and crew attached to the film received an email early Thursday morning instructing them to stay away from the set after a member of the production tested positive for the virus.

In a statement the US production company behind the film, Warner Bros, said that it was ""taking precautions"" to protect its employees.

According to the New York Times, production on Baz Luhrmann film, which currently does not yet have a title, was set to begin on Monday.

Warner Bros added that it spans ""over 20 years, from Presley's rise to fame to his unprecedented stardom, against the backdrop of the evolving cultural landscape and the loss of innocence in America"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tom-hanks--wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-for-covid-19-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/tom-hanks--wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-for-covid-19.html
237,12-3-20,Trump suspends travel from Europe to US for 30 days amid coronavirus outbreak,"In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced the US will suspend all passenger travel from Europe, except the UK, on Friday for the next 30 days to stop the spread of coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 4,500 lives, including 37 in America, and sent global markets into a tailspin.

In a televised address to the nation from his Oval Office in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump said the new restrictions will come into effect from Friday midnight and there will be exemptions for Americans returning to the US after undergoing multiple screenings.

""To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight,"" he said.

Trump said the European Union had ""failed to take the same precautions"" as his administration had implemented to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

The president said he was monitoring the situation in China and South Korea, and asked citizens to suspend all non-essential travels. He urged them to adopt best hygiene, wash their hands and stay away from large gatherings to reduce the chance of infection.

""This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation and a world,"" Trump said.

""We are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people,"" he said.

Global stocks and oil plunged immediately after Trump's announcement, triggering a flurry of panic selling that sent American stock futures into a tailspin.

Dow (INDU) futures plunged more than 1,100 points, or 4.73 per cent. S&P 500 (SPX) futures fell 4.6 per cent and Nasdaq (COMP) futures were down 5 per cent, and Japan's Nikkei and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 down more than 4 per cent.

Oil prices, which crashed at the start of this week on the prospect of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, plunged about six per cent on Thursday.

International benchmark Brent crude was down 6.6 per cent at USD 33.43 a barrel, while US marker West Texas Intermediate fell the same degree to USD 30.81.

The president announced that his administration will begin extending loans to small businesses who will be affected by the coronavirus slowdown.

He was askew for payroll tax relief and said some tax filings will be delayed to help provide extra liquidity.

""We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity,"" Trump said.

""Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before,"" he said.

""We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world,"" Trump said, asserting that no nation is more prepared or more resilient than the US.

The president said he took the decision to suspend travel from Europe to the US after consulting with top government health professionals, to protect all citizens from the coronavirus.

The deadly virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,500 lives and infected more than 124,000 people across 107 countries and territories.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) characterised the outbreak as a pandemic on Wednesday. China remains the hardest-hit with over 80,000 infections and 3,000 deaths while 37 people have died and 1,300 infected in the US.

Over a dozen States in the US have declared a state of emergency with cities and counties announcing to take sweeping measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

The US State Department on Wednesday advised Americans to reconsider foreign travel in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

""The Department of State advises US citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19,"" as the illness is known, it said in a statement.

Giving details of the travel ban, Department of Homeland Security in a statement said Trump signed a Presidential proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the US.

These countries, known as the Schengen area, include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of US citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation, it said.

In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, people have been running to grocery stores to stock supplies of essential items, while office goers are trying to do teleworking.

Several public events, including those related to sports, have been cancelled, and several schools and universities have either shut down or considering closing.

In a letter, several senators urged Trump to immediately consider disaster declarations that allow FEMA to utilise USD 40 plus billion disaster relief fund to aid State and local government's responding to the outbreak.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-suspends-travel-from-europe-to-us-for-30-days-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-suspends-travel-from-europe-to-us-for-30-days-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html
238,12-3-20,"Coronavirus cases drop to single-digit in Wuhan, China reports rise in 'imported cases'","The coronavirus cases continue to drop sharply in China which has reported 11 new fatalities, taking the death toll to 3,169, while in the worst-hit Wuhan, the confirmed cases for the first time dropped to single digit with eight new infections, amid a surge in ""imported COVID-19 cases"" in the country.

China's National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Thursday it received reports of 15 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and 11 deaths on the Chinese mainland on Wednesday.

However, there is a surge in total number of ""imported COVID-19 cases"" (people arriving from abroad) which rose to 85 on Wednesday, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.

As of Wednesday, a total of 80,793 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 had been reported on the mainland, and 3,169 people had died of the disease.

Among the new deaths, 10 were in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan and one in Shaanxi province, it said.

In Hubei province and Wuhan, where over 50 million people are still under lockdown, the coronavirus cases, for the first time, dropped to a single digit. Wuhan reported eight cases on Wednesday, it said.

The latest report by the local health commission brought the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the hard-hit province to 67,781.

As of Wednesday, Hubei had seen no new confirmed COVID-19 cases for seven consecutive days in its 16 cities and prefectures outside Wuhan.

Among the 12,769 hospitalised patients, 3,453 were still in severe condition and another 727 in critical condition in Wuhan.

The Chinese mainland reported seven new confirmed cases of the COVID-19 on Wednesday outside Hubei Province, the NHC said.

Of them, six cases - three in Guangdong, two in Gansu and one in Henan - were imported from outside (foreigners and locals coming from abroad) into the Chinese mainland. The total number of imported COVID-19 cases on the mainland rose to 85 as of Wednesday.

Capital Beijing on Wednesday reported no new confirmed cases, but five new suspected cases among foreigners, including two from Italy, one from Britain and Spain each, according to Beijing Municipal Health Commission.

As of Wednesday, a total of 435 confirmed cases had been reported in Beijing, including eight deaths.

The deadly coronavirus virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 4,500 lives and infected more than 124,000 people across 107 countries and territories.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday characterised the COVID-19 outbreak as a ""pandemic"" as the virus spreads increasingly worldwide.

""We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.

Tedros said the WHO was ""deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, as well as by the alarming levels of inaction.""

He urged the international community to take urgent and aggressive action to contain the pandemic, the report said.

""We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,"" Tedros said, stressing ""all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.""

While the coronavirus cases declined sharply in China, the cases of infection have been rising rapidly in Europe and other parts of the world, with Italy being the hardest-hit country.

The total number of confirmed cases in Italy had surged past 12,000 as of Wednesday, despite its drastic measure of locking down the entire country.

Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, has said the pandemic ""is a characterisation or description of the situation."" He denied that such a move would trigger anything other than more aggressive and intensive action.

The WHO has made many internal and external consultations in assessing the use of the word ""pandemic"" as a characterisation of COVID-19, he added, warning against the danger of using the word to make people give up rather than act.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-cases-drop-to-single-digit-in-wuhan--china-reports-rise-in--imported-cases--2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus-cases-drop-to-single-digit-in-wuhan--china-reports-rise-in--imported-cases-.html
239,12-3-20,Trump officials emphasise that coronavirus 'Made in China',"There's one thing the Trump administration wants Americans to remember about the coronavirus pandemic: It carries the ""Made in China"" label.

Trump administration officials, on the defensive about their own handling of the virus, have repeatedly reminded people that the virus started in Wuhan, a city in China's Hubei province, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referring to it as the ""Wuhan coronavirus."" President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, went even further on Wednesday.

""Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,"" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington.

""There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months.""

O'Brien said that if experts would have had those two months to get ahead of the spread of the virus, ""I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world.""

O'Brien's remarks seemed to be aimed at countering a disinformation campaign that Sen Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says China's Communist Party is waging to blame the US for the virus so it can dampen discontent in China, distract from true infection rates and ""save face internationally.""

""The Chinese military portal Xilu.Com recently published an article baselessly claiming that the virus is 'a biochemical weapon produced by the US to target China,'"" Rubio wrote.

China, however, says it is helping the international community battle the virus. UN Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters at UN headquarters in New York that Beijing is working closely with other countries and have provided medical supplies to nations, including Korea, Japan and Italy.

""We are sending medical teams to countries that need that, and we will do whatever to join the international community to fight this virus ... Because we have only one world, we need to join hands, we need to show solidarity.""

Rubio claims that besides China, disinformation is coming from Russia and Iran, the hardest-hit country in the Middle East.

""In Qom, ground zero of Iran's coronavirus outbreak, a prominent cleric accused the United States of introducing the virus 'to damage (the city's) culture and honor,'"" Rubio wrote.

While Trump has lauded Chinese President Xi Jinping's work to respond to the virus, Trump himself has referred to “China's Coronavirus situation.""

Trump has been criticised for playing down the virus, contradicting his own public health officials and concentrating more on the economic fallout from the outbreak.

In a speech to the nation Wednesday night he referred to the “foreign virus” that ""started in China.""

(He also worked in some digs at Europe for letting it spiral out of control there.) For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.

Health professionals, who depend on China for access to the country, have publicly praised Beijing for its response, noting that it is difficult to spot a new virus during flu season when there are numerous alerts about atypical pneumonia and other respiratory problems.

On Capitol Hill, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, praised China's work to control the spread of coronavirus. ""They really have now got control of their outbreak,"" Redfield told the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Wednesday.

Chinese health officials informed the WHO about the new virus on December 31. By January 8, it had been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family that causes the common cold and more serious illnesses including SARS, which also began in China.

A recently submitted complaint to the country's National Health Commission alleged that during this period, officials with the Wuhan health commission told doctors they were not allowed to report about the new virus, letting patients wander around freely instead of being isolated.

China's foreign ministry has taken offense at people blaming China. After Pompeo called it the ""Wuhan coronavirus,"" the ministry's spokesman said the description was ""despicable,"" disrespected science and stigmatized China. Other Republicans also have specifically pointed how the outbreak was first reported in China.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-officials-emphasise-that-coronavirus--made-in-china--2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-officials-emphasise-that-coronavirus--made-in-china-.html
240,12-3-20,Italy shuts stores across country to fight virus,"Italy on Wednesday shut all stores except for pharmacies and food shops in a desperate bid to halt the spread of a coronavirus that has killed 827 in the the country in just over two weeks.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the latest wave of restrictions in a dramatic appeal to the nation that came with the country of 60 million battling its biggest crisis in generations.

""Thank you to all Italians who make sacrifices. We are proving to be a great nation,"" Conte said in his nine-minute evening prime time address to the nation.

Italians have watched ever tighter restrictions slowly eat away at the very fabric of everyday life.

An existing clampdown on public gathering and basic travel had already emptied streets and shuttered everything from churches to restaurants.

AFP photographers spotted masked sanitation workers in white nylon suits and rubber gloves spraying Florence's deserted Saint Mark's Square with disinfectant through a long hose.

Cathedrals posted hand-written notes cancelling mass and cafes apologised to their regulars for having to turn them away.

""I can't even recognise Rome now,"" 30-year-old Muscovite Yekaterina said while posing alone for a photo by the usually bustling Trevi Fountain in the heart of Rome.

Conte said the closure of nearly everything that had remained open would run for at least two weeks.

How Italians will get by in the meantime is not entirely clear.

""All shops will be closed except for basic necessities, such as pharmacies and food stores,"" said Conte.

""Bars, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and canteen services will close. Home delivery is allowed."" ""No need to rush to buy groceries,"" he stressed.

Conte's announcement came hours after his government promised to spend up to 25 billion euros (USD 28 billion) to fight a disease that has put hospitals and the economy under intense strain.

The size of Rome's rescue was the same as one the European Union announced for the entire 27-nation bloc on Monday.

Italy's Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said half the money would be used immediately and the other half stowed away and tapped should the health crisis spiral out of control.

Part of the government's cash injection is meant to help small businesses that are suffering the brunt of an implosion in the number of tourists who visit Italy's art-filled churches and achingly beautiful hills.

The government also put more meat on the bones of an emerging plan to let families temporarily suspend some mortgage and social tax payments.

Gualtieri said ""partial state guarantees"" were being discussed to help Italy's creaking banks survive a resulting cash crunch.

Italy has witnessed nearly 60 percent of the deaths recorded outside China since the epidemic first started spreading from the Asian giant's central Hubei province in January.

The government responded to the outbreak last month by quarantining 50,000 people in 11 villages that were worst affected in the north.

That was followed on Sunday with social distancing measures in Milan's Lombardy region and surrounding areas in which more than 15 million live and 40 per cent of the nation's economic activity occurs.

The Lombardy measures were extended to all Italy on Tuesday morning.

Conte's announcement on Wednesday ratcheted the restrictions up another notch. The multitude of measures have had a profound and slightly surreal effect on Italian life.

The central streets of Rome were deserted on Wednesday evening and buses that are usually crammed with commuters ran almost empty.

Tourists have essentially disappeared and the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square has closed to all but those who want to enter the basilica to pray under its soaring dome overlooking Rome.

People have been told to keep at least a metre (three feet) from each other and handshakes are frowned upon. Italians have found themselves starting to talk to each other a few steps apart -- while often laughing about the regulations along the way.

""As soon as the emergency has passed, we will organise a free carbonara day for doctors, nurses and healthcare workers,"" a closing note by a restaurant in Rome's popular Trastevere neighbourhood said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/italy-shuts-stores-across-country-to-fight-virus-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/italy-shuts-stores-across-country-to-fight-virus.html
241,12-3-20,Australian court delays final verdict on Cardinal Pell appeal,"Australia's High Court on Thursday delayed judgement in Cardinal George Pell's appeal against child sex abuse convictions, with a decision now not expected for months.

The court adjourned after two days of dense legal argument over the case of the 78-year-old former Vatican treasurer, who is trying to overturn a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in the 1990s.

Pell, who once helped elect popes, is the highest-ranking Catholic Church official ever convicted of child sex crimes.

He was not present for the two-day hearing and will remain behind bars while seven of Australia's top judges consider his fate.

A court official told AFP it typically took between three to six months for a decision in cases where judgement had been reserved.

Pell's lawyer, Bret Walker, on Thursday urged them to quash the conviction rather than order a retrial, saying it was ""the power and duty of this court"".

He also accused the prosecution of an ""inappropriate and over-engineered attempt at improvisation to make matters fit that won't fit"".

The defence has argued Pell would not have had the time or opportunity to molest the boys in the sacristy, which would have been a ""hive of activity"" after Mass.

Judges pressed prosecutor Kerri Judd on many of her arguments, including when she suggested the time it would have taken Pell to abuse the boys was ""not precise"" or ""clockwork"", despite lower courts previously hearing the offending took place in a five-to-six minute period.

In stark contrast to Wednesday's hearing, when Walker was largely able to speak uninterrupted, the judges grilled the prosecutor at length.

University of Melbourne law professor Jeremy Gans said the questioning was notable for being ""mostly directed at arguments that support Pell's argument for acquittal and were not particularly sympathetic to the prosecution"".

""It's always difficult to know why they ask those questions but, to the extent that you can read anything into those questions, every single judge at some point was asking questions that seemed to be indicating a possible view of acquittal,"" he told reporters outside the courtroom.

The case relied solely on the testimony of Pell's surviving victim, as the other -- who is not known to have ever spoken of the abuse -- died of a drug overdose in 2014. Neither man can be identified for legal reasons.

It has proved highly divisive in Australia, attracting protesters and supporters on Thursday to the High Court in Canberra, where they carried rival signs that read ""Criminal Pell: pedophile icon"" and ""We love you, Cardinal George Pell and genuine victims."" Local media reported a Melbourne man was charged Wednesday with threatening to kill Pell and making a bomb threat.

Pell has been removed from top Church bodies by the Vatican but remains in the priesthood.

The Vatican previously said it would avoid launching an investigation into his conduct until after all legal avenues are exhausted.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australian-court-delays-final-verdict-on-cardinal-pell-appeal-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/australian-court-delays-final-verdict-on-cardinal-pell-appeal.html
242,12-3-20,"'Angrezi Medium': Irrfan, Deepak Dobriyal shine in aimless film","A couple of great performances can actually turn an utterly mediocre film into okay stuff, you realise watching Irrfan and Deepak Dobriyal in ""Angrezi Medium"".



Homi Adajania's follow-up to Saket Chaudhary's 2017 comedy hit ""Hindi Medium"" is a standalone story that bears no link with the first film by way of plot or characters and is, quite frankly, not a patch on the original. There are the sporadic brilliant scenes and the random bursts of humour, but the overall storytelling simply falls short, faltering every now and then. It's almost as if the writers were not quite sure how to push the narrative beyond a point, especially in the second half.



The film begins by introducing Irrfan as Champak Bansal, owner of one of two Ghasitaram sweet shops in the same locality of Udaipur -- the other belonging to his brother Gopi (Deepak Dobriyal). The two brothers are normally busy bickering over whose shop represents the ‘real and original' Ghasitaram brand. Champak is a single parent, taking care of his teenage daughter Tarika (Radhika Madan). The girl has a big dream. She wants to pursue higher studies at a top university in the United Kingdom.



The film tries setting up adequate drama using that premise, as the narrative moves from Udaipur to London. In the process, the story also tries creating space to talk of too many issues. There is the obvious theme of the young generation's fetish for foreign universities, and the question of how expensive world-class education continues to be. The screenplay also talks of teen rebellion and generation gap. A cameo by Dimple Kapadia is used to highlight loneliness among the aged.



Somehow, all of these comments don't add up to much, owing to weak writing. As the minutes pass, you sense the classic 'Sequel Syndrome' taking over -- it is almost as if this film was made because the idea worked the first time, and it seemed lucrative enough for a second outing.



The urge to squeeze in too many sub plots and characters takes its toll as the film, after an engaging build-up in the first hour, meanders in the post-interval portion before reaching a rather insipid ending. What rescues the film from sinking are the three performances that matter. Irrfan, Deepak Dobriyal and Radhika Madan are first-rate.



Towering above all with a simply flawless performance, Irrfan proves once again why he will always be special for Bollywood buffs. He clearly relishes every bit of being Champak, bringing alive the nuances that define the goodnatured, smalltown businessman's quirks with ease.



Perhaps his performance would have seemed incomplete without the comic-melodramatic chemistry he shares with Radhika Madan, as Champak's daughter Tarika. ""Angrezi Medium"" is primarily a father-daughter story and Radhika matches Irrfan's screen presence admirably to light up the screen in their scenes together.



Deepak Dobriyal is a delight to watch as ever -- if only Bollywood had more imaginative roles for him than the hero's sidekick. To his credit, Dobriyal finds a zillion ways to reinvent that stereotype, you realise watching him go in ""Angrezi Medium"".



Pankaj Tripathi elicits a few laughs in a cameo, Kareena Kapoor was quite honestly never needed in this screenplay, and Dimple Kapadia could have done with a stronger role. Ranvir Shorey and Kiku Sharda bring alive their roles with innate talent.



What amazes you is that Adajania has employed a battery of four writers -- Bhavesh Mandalia, Gaurav Shukla, Vinay Chhawall, Sara Bodinar -- to come up with such an aimless script that offers utterly half-bakes characters to a cast that seemed awesome in the opening credits.



We would perhaps have ended saying ""Angrezi Medium"" is a good idea gone waste -- except that as the storyline slips with every passing minute - you begin to wonder if there was an idea to begin with.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-angrezi-medium---irrfan--deepak-dobriyal-shine-in-aimless-film-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-angrezi-medium---irrfan--deepak-dobriyal-shine-in-aimless-film.html

244,12-3-20,"Airtel leads in download speed, quality consistency: Report","Airtel leads the race among the telecom operators in terms of download speed and consistency in quality among other parameters, according to a Tutela report.

The report said that Airtel was the fastest network, offering a median download speed of 7.4 Mbps. Vodafone Idea provided a download speed of 6.5 Mbps followed by Jio, which had a 5.3 Mbps median download speed.

""Airtel had a noticeable lead for 'excellent consistent quality' nearly 10 per cent Abetter than joint second-place Jio and Vodafone Idea,"" it said.

In terms of upload, Vodafone Idea led the race with a median upload speed of 3.7 Mbps, followed by Airtel (3.5 Mbps) and Jio (3.2 Mbps).

The report noted that fact that India's telecom industry has become a fight as much for survival as for network dominance as disputes over revenues subject to tax have lead to potential difficulties for both Airtel and Vodafone Idea, while Jio, the youngest national operator in India, has now become the leading operator by both market share and revenue.

""This level of disruption, coupled with the upcoming merger of BSNL and MTNL and the advent of 5G networks potentially at some point in the next year makes it a pivotal moment in the industry as each operator looks to make the most of the current changes, or even just weather the storm,"" it said.

247,12-3-20,Rain washes out first India-South Africa ODI in Dharamsala,"The first ODI between India and South Africa was on Thursday abandoned without a ball being bowled due to incessant rain here.

It was the second match in less than six months to be abandoned at the picturesque Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium because of inclement weather.

Incidentally, that match was also an India-South Africa clash in September last year.

The first ODI of the three-match series was always in doubt after the weatherman forecast widespread rains and thundershowers over the region on Thursday and Friday because of fresh western disturbance over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir.

Fans and organisers had offered prayers at the Indrunag Temple in the hills overlooking the stadium in an attempt to appease the rain gods.

Heavy rain had also lashed the hill town just after the two teams' practice sessions on Wednesday, forcing the organisers to cover the entire playing area.

If that was not enough, it rained the entire night on the eve of the match.

It was overcast for major part of the day and heavens opened up just before the start. It rained on and off after that, forcing the toss to be delayed and bringing ground staff into action.

The rain was not that heavy but was enough for water to accumulate, forcing organisers to press three super-soppers into action.

But despite working tirelessly, the ground staff failed to clear the ground, forcing the on-field umpires to call off the match.

The cut-off time for a 20-over game was 6.30pm (IST) but the on-field umpires made their final inspection and decided to abandon the match much before that.

The novel coronavirus outbreak and adverse weather conditions affected ticket sales as well.

The second ODI of the series will be played in Lucknow on March 15 while the third and final match will be in Kolkata's iconic Eden Gardens on March 18.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rain-washes-out-first-india-south-africa-odi-in-dharamsala-2020-03-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/rain-washes-out-first-india-south-africa-odi-in-dharamsala.html
