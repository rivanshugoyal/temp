0,13-3-20,A ticking time-bomb,"Both the Hindu and Muslim communities have to factor in new attitudes that govern them since the old equation has collapsed. A new formula is needed to co-exist peacefully

It’s obvious to anyone, who has seen the videos and read the first-hand accounts of residents in the troubled north-east area of Delhi, that what happened there was a bloody Hindu-Muslim communal riot. Tensions were building up ever since some citizens launched a nationwide protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which often turned violent and disrupted normal life in many Indian cities for over two months. Videos shot in the affected areas of Delhi show huge pile of petrol bombs, acid, bricks and stones on the terraces of Muslim residents, including that of a Delhi legislator, burqa-clad women thrashing hapless policemen and joining the lynch mob. Such was the ferocity of the attacks that several senior officers suffered grievous injuries and a Hindu Intelligence Bureau (IB) official was hacked to death by his Muslim neighbours. He is said to have been stabbed several hundred times. One had heard of such barbarity during the Moplah uprising in 1921 and the Kolkata riots after MA Jinnah’s call for “direct action” on August 16, 1946, to secure an Islamic nation. It was a blood bath.

This is not to say that the Hindus in north-east Delhi were silent and innocent spectators. They were not and as much guilty. Seeing the build-up in the Muslim mohallas, they stocked up, too and, therefore, when the riots broke out, the streets resembled a battle field. One had not seen such hatred and violence between the two communities in a long time. So, what triggered this time around?

One, having got used to a standard diet of appeasement for seven decades, the Muslims find the “no-appeasement” policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi unacceptable and, therefore, there has been simmering discontent in the community, which only needed a trigger to explode. Some leaders of the community added fuel to the fire by citing the abrogation of the special status of Jammu & Kashmir last August and the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case as developments that hurt the Muslims. The community was, therefore, looking for a cause and the CAA came along. Then, the riots happened and it found a chance to play the victim card again.

It must also be said that this time around, there is gross miscalculation among the Muslims about the response of Hindus to their assertiveness and violence. Having watched the sociological transformation of the Hindus over many decades, it must be said that the Hindu of the 1950s or 1960s, who would stoically bear with the demands of this aggressive minority in the hope that eventually things would settle down, no longer exists. The attitude of the Western media and its Indian cohorts, who are busy spreading Hindu phobia, has proved to be highly provocative. They are actually promoting hatred and violence among these communities. The role of social media and the videos in circulation is the new-age fuel for communal conflagration. Both communities have to factor in the new attitudes that govern them. The Muslims have to realise this and arrive at a new equation for peaceful co-existence. The Hindus have to understand the anxieties plaguing this religious minority and find ways to restore harmony. Both communities must now accept that the old equation has collapsed.

Following Partition, the Muslims of India on this side of the border had the option to either cross over and become part of an Islamic State or stay put and become citizens of a secular, democratic India. Around 35 million of them chose to stay back and live in a democratic nation. They constituted about 10 per cent of the 350 million people in India after Partition. Latest estimates indicate that the Muslim population has swelled to 175 million over the last seven decades and this community is well spread out across the length and breadth of this country.

The integration of the Muslims into a secular, democratic nation that emerged in 1947 would have been easy if only the then Government, headed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, had given them the option of either living in an India with a common civil code that would be uniformly applicable to all citizens across communities or to cross the border and live in an Islamic State. Nehru’s Muslim appeasement policy encouraged the hotheads among the Muslims to such an extent that even after Partition and the creation of Pakistan, some Muslim members of the Constituent Assembly demanded separate electorate for the Muslims in democratic India. Sardar Patel and other leaders felt that this demand was preposterous.

The concession Nehru made to the Muslim clergy after independence is indeed the time bomb that is ticking away and threatens to destroy India’s unity and integrity. After Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, in order to muster the Muslim vote after she split the Congress in 1969, continued to molly-coddle the ulemas. The Congress got the best opportunity to wash away its sins vis-à-vis Muslim appeasement when the Supreme Court delivered the historic judgment in the Shah Bano case and declared that divorced Muslim women were entitled to maintenance like other divorcees, as provided for in Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court took the opportunity to draw the country’s attention to Article 44 of the Constitution, which committed the State to bring in a Uniform Civil Code. It said such a code would help the cause of national integration.

While this judgment was hailed across the country, the Muslim clergy was up in arms against the apex court’s decision. Even though Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had won the biggest mandate ever in the country’s parliamentary elections — over 410 seats — he was unable or unwilling to stand up to the mullahs and brought in a law to undo the top court’s verdict. This law, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, declared that Muslim men had no obligation to pay maintenance to their divorced wives like other men.

Given this history, the vicious propaganda unleashed by Muslim communalists in the international media against India is bunkum. India was and is the world’s biggest secular, democratic nation and its Hindu majority is very proud of it. The Muslims must acknowledge this and be wary of the false narrative being spread my mischief-makers. For once, the Union Government has begun to assert itself to correct the follies of Nehru and his progeny. This is the only way by which we can preserve the core values of our Constitution and protect India’s unity and integrity. The majority cannot allow some malcontents among a minority to wreck this.

1,13-3-20,Cricket shutdown?,"With sports leagues taking drastic measures across the world, it is time for the IPL to study what to do next

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of the richest and most successful global sports leagues in the world. Almost every teenager in the world is aware of superstars like LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kawhi Leonard. But after one of its players tested positive for COVID-19 virus, the league suspended its games indefinitely. It even abandoned an ongoing match. Only a day earlier, the league had suggested that some games be played behind closed doors, with just the players and no fans. But as the player tested positive the very next day, he forced the NBA’s hand. This episode holds lessons for other such spectator sports or events that call for mass gatherings to not waste time and take a firm and quick decision, even if it comes at the expense of entertainment or money. Rightly so, with the Coronavirus death toll crossing the 4,000 mark across the world, nations have become cautious and are taking every step to eliminate the possible dangers of “mass gatherings.” It’s common sense that these increase the chances of transmission of respiratory pathogens and, thus, large gatherings of people are generally inadvisable in such situations. Summits, conferences, festivals and sporting events are all getting truncated, cancelled or postponed across the world. The F1 season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne may be cancelled anytime soon. The Indian Wells tennis tournament has already been called off. In light of this, what fate does India’s festival of professional sport, the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world’s leading professional cricket league, hold? The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has already suggested that this IPL season be postponed. With the Government imposing visa restrictions until April 15 to contain the threat, a vast number of foreign players, including coaches, staff, broadcast crew and even cheerleaders, may not be allowed to enter the country even if they have valid work visas or are quarantined. While one may see the foreign players and commentators as the face of the IPL, the broadcast of a global event has a globalised workforce and without them, a viable IPL is impossible.

The Government has done its bit in giving sage advice to not hold the IPL but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been digging its heels on this issue for a while. Following the MEA’s advisory, it was quick to rule that the next two matches of the India-South Africa series will be played behind closed doors. A panic economy and self-curfew have anyway resulted in a poor spectator turnout. But the BCCI seems to be worried about a hit on the micro-IPL economy that depends a lot on ticket sales, a felt experience, a bit of glamour and drama. Undoubtedly, stakes are really high: The cricketing body has already pocketed massive sponsorship revenues — such is its popularity and viewership that the IPL is today valued at $6.7 billion. Star TV has already paid Rs 16,000 crore to acquire media and digital rights for five years. Players are all too well- compensated. With the season on, more than 200 brands advertise on prime slot. This makes it clear why it is a hard ball game for the BCCI. The problem is that the IPL season cannot be postponed either but cut down. But because the window is carved out by cricket authorities across the world, the IPL 2020 already looks like a lost cause. If it is cancelled, the losses will be humongous for all stakeholders but can public health be jeopardised? Matches behind closed doors may lack colour and fire but at least some recovery can happen through broadcast fees? We must take a page out of Italy, which has confirmed that all sporting events would be staged behind closed doors until April 3. Even back home, for the first time, a full-fledged sporting event — with an Olympic qualifier status to boot — will be played behind closed doors. This is entirely do-able: People can enjoy the action at home. With no mass gatherings, the risk can be averted. Some money can be made yet. Hope the vaccine is out next season.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cricket-shutdown--2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/cricket-shutdown-.html
2,13-3-20,Weinstein in prison,"The verdict serves as a warning to sexual predators that they aren’t above the law; they can’t get away

How the mighty have fallen and what a victory it has been for the #MeToo movement. The once influential and now disgraced Hollywood film producer, Harvey Weinstein, has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault and will now spend 23 years in prison after the New York Supreme Court held him accountable for committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape. This verdict should serve as a warning to all predators that they are not above the law; they can’t just get away with it. Hopefully, it will lead to deterrence in workspaces around the world and stricter gender justice codes. Of course, this is not the last we are hearing of it because the sentence only ends Weinstein’s New York trial, which began on January 6. He is yet to face other rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. For his conviction on the first-degree count of criminal sexual act, Weinstein was given 20 years in prison plus five years of supervised release. On the other convicted charge, third-degree rape, he was given three years in prison. The judge decided to make the sentences consecutive, rather than concurrent, to prolong his pain. To add to the movie mogul’s well-deserved shame, the court will also formally register him as a sex offender. The legacy that the 67-year-old hot-shot film-maker would have liked to leave behind was a repertoire of well-made movies that would be viewed and appreciated for all times to come. Instead, Weinstein’s will be a lifetime of shame that he and his family, which has since then left him alone, will have to face due to the verdict. His legacy is now clouded by abuse, harassment, rape and intimidation of over 100 hapless women and the lifelong scars and trauma they had to live with after he sexually assaulted them.

One hopes that this verdict brings a sense of justice and closure to his victims and gives other women around the world, who are facing abuse — at home, work or elsewhere — the courage to call out their tormentors. It has reassured women that they are not to be blamed for their condition. It was not their “ambition”, “dress”, “make-up”, “location” or “that hour of the night”, which was responsible for their plight but sexual predators like Weinstein, who must be held responsible for their actions. That it was this global calling out that got the producer such a major sentence is something even his lawyers have admitted to. If anything, the Indian criminal justice system must take a few lessons from the Weinstein episode: How to expedite such cases, convict criminals speedily and not let the case drag on for years. The Nirbhaya case is yet to be closed as the convicts are trying every trick on the rule book to defer their hanging. Culprits must not be given the liberty to make a mockery of the legal system and exploit every lacunae to subvert justice. We also need to learn not to let power and money influence the way the case goes, not to indulge in victim shaming and instead put the perpetrator on trial, not the victim.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/weinstein-in-prison-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/weinstein-in-prison.html

5,13-3-20,Son held for murder of BSP ex-MLA,"In a major breakthrough in the sensational murder of Bahujan Samaj Party’s two-time MLA Haji Aleem, who was found dead in his house in Bulandshahr in October 2018, the sleuths of Crime Branch, Crime Investigation Department (CB CID) of Uttar Pradesh Police have arrested the former lawmaker’s son Anas.

Anas was arrested from Meerut on Thursday and would be produced before the court in Bulandshahr.

The CB-CID team will also seek police remand of Anas, who they claimed WAS behind the murder of his father.

Superintendent of Police (CB-CID, Meerut Zone) Mohini Pathak said that Haji Aleem was found dead with bullet in his body in his residence on October 9, 2018. A case was registered by his brother Haji Yunus at Kankarkhere police station, alleging that it was a case of murder and not suicide.

Though the CB-CID claimed that the former legislator’s son Anas killed him, they were yet to disclose the motive behind the murder. However, sources said that property dispute was responsible for this murder.

The former BSP MLA from Bulandshahr was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his Bulandshahr residence on October 10, 2018. A pistol was found lying near the body, suggesting that he had committed suicide.

The incident came to light after Aleem (57), failed to come out of his room till around 10 am, forcing family members to break open the door.

The then SP (City) of Bulandshahr, Praveen Ranjhan Singh, said “according to family members , Aleem had retired to his room on the first floor of the house in Uparkot Colony around 2 am on Wednesday. When he did not came out till 10 am and failed to answer calls, the family members broke open a window and sent a child through it to unlock the door from inside. They found his body lying in a pool of blood”.

Preliminary investigation had suggested that Aleem had shot himself on the right side of his head with his licensed pistol. A few days later, the police had closed the case saying it was a suicide case. However, the CB-CID was handed over the probe on the direction of the Allahabad High Court.

It may be mentioned here that Aleem’s first wife, Rehana Chaudhary, was allegedly murdered in her East Delhi residence in 2013. In that case also, Anas and his brother Danish had been arrested for the murder of their stepmother over a property dispute.

Interestingly, when his father was found dead, Anas Aleem had expressed suspicion that someone had murdered him.

Now the motive behind Aleem’s murder is also said to be property.

Haji Aleem was elected to UP Assembly from Bulandshahr in 2007 and 2012 on BSP ticket.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/son-held-for-murder--of-bsp-ex-mla.html
6,13-3-20,"CM for branding of cow dung, cow urine products","Advocating branding of products made from cow dung and cow urine, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that this would increase employment opportunities in the state under micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector.

He also said that over five lakh youth had got employment through One District, One Product (ODOP) scheme in one year.

“Zero budget farming is being promoted through conservation and promotion of cows. Branding of products made from cow dung and cow urine is needed. This will increase employment opportunities. Youth will be linked with employment as well as entrepreneurship in every district of the state through CM Youth Hub scheme. Youth will get Rs 2500 under CM Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme,” the chief minister said while inaugurating the Kaushal Satrang programme organised by the Vocational Education and Skill Development and Labour and Employment Exchange departments at the Lok Bhawan here on Thursday..

On this occasion, the chief minister launched the seven components of Kaushal Satrang.

The chief minister said that this programme was dedicated to employment and self-employment of the youth of Uttar Pradesh. He said the programme, organised by combining the seven components of Kaushal Satrang, was a commendable effort.

The chief minister said that in the ODOP scheme, the state government had found a means for the prosperity of the state. He pointed out that through this scheme, five lakh youth had got employment in a year. He said that on account of the popularity of the ODOP scheme, a separate budget had been earmarked for it for all the states in the Union Budget this time.

“With the employment of potters through the Matikala Board, there has been a big change in their lives,” Yogi said.

The chief minister also declared that one Arogya Mitra each would be deployed in all the primary health centres (PHCs) in the state to inform people about the health related schemes being run by the government.

“Every person gets an opportunity in life, but there are challenges to meet that opportunity. Only the person who turns challenges into opportunities can succeed in life. This is extremely important for our youth and for a state like Uttar Pradesh. The objective of the Skill Development Mission is to inculcate such thinking among the youth,” he said.

The chief minister said that in the fiscal year 2015-2016, the per capita income of the country was Rs 1,20,000 and UP’s per capita income was Rs 42,000 and Uttar Pradesh lagged behind in the competition for the development of the country. “Why was the state lagging behind for the last 65-70 years, is a matter of concern,” he added.

Yogi said there was a lot of talent among the youth of the state but there was a need to give the youth the right direction.

“There should be employment and self-employment programmes for youth at district and tehsil level. Kaushal Satrang will enhance the colours in the lives of the youth, they will get new direction and will get immense employment opportunities,” he said.

Along with the chief minister, Labour and Employment Exchange Minister Swami Prasad Maurya, Minister of State for Vocational Education and Skill Development Kapil Dev Aggarwal, Chief Secretary RK Tiwari and other dignitaries and students were present in the programme.

Seven components of Kaushal Satrang were launched in the programme. They include CM Yuva Hub (Chief Minister’s Youth Entrepreneurship Development Campaign), CM APPS (Chief Minister’s Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme) and District Skill Development Programme (DSDP).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-for-branding-of-cow--dung--cow-urine-products.html
7,13-3-20,Better to be safe than sorry,"If we are to halt the spread of the Coronavirus, we will have to work together and hard decisions will have to be taken now, regardless of their repercussions

If one were to look at the headlines dominating our news channels and the print media these days, the COVID 19 pandemic would be a distant third, behind the political upheaval in Madhya Pradesh following Jyotiraditya Scindia’s departure from the Congress Party and the collapse of Yes Bank amid allegations of fraud and deceit by its former chairman and founder, Rana Kapoor and his family. We would do well to remember that the former two issues, while important, are certainly not life-threatening. The glaring fact is that till about the third week of February, Italy had just about the number of cases that we have today. These crossed the 12,000 mark, with over 600 fatalities, in just a matter of a fortnight. There is of course the possibility that the Coronavirus may not impact us as badly for any number of reasons, ranging from high temperatures that are usually prevalent at this time of the year to the fact that we may be God’s chosen people. It may even be that because general hygiene is not exactly our strong suite and we have a better immunity because of it, we might beat any impact the Coronavirus might otherwise have on us. However, if these are the rationales that we prefer to exercise to ignore the imminent danger that the Coronavirus poses, then we may well be in for a rude shock.

Megan McArdle, The Washington Post columnist and author, uses this old brain teaser to explain the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. “You have a pond of a certain size and upon that pond, a single lily pad. This particular species of lily pad reproduces once a day, so that on day two, you have two lily pads. On day three, you have four and so on. If it takes the lily pads 48 days to cover the pond completely, how long will it take for the pond to be covered halfway?” The answer is of course 47 days and not 24 as some of us may well conclude but more importantly even as late as day 40, one will barely know the lily pads are there as the numbers will still be quite small.

Now here’s the catch. Events in both Wuhan, where the virus is said to have originated, and Italy suggest that the number of people infected by the virus doubles every four-five days, which means a ten-fold increase every fortnight. But since there is no preventive anti-virus drug available yet, leaving aside some rather fanciful suggestions, our complete population is clearly at risk. This obviously implies that if appropriate preventive measures are not adopted, our healthcare system, which has inherent flaws already, is at great risk and is bound to be overwhelmed in a relatively short period of time, once the threshold is crossed. The threshold is the point at which we would just not have the required infrastructure, i.e. the doctors, nurses, beds or even the ventilators essential for treating those affected.

That in turn would have its own repercussions because once that occurs, the doctors would have to play God and select and treat only those patients who have the best chance of survival. Triage, as it is known in military circles, is allegedly already happening in Italy and may well have been resorted to in China. Without doubt, this would be the rational choice as one would rather provide the necessary medical facilities to a 20-year-old with better chances of survival and a brighter future ahead of him, than to a 65-year-old whose chances of making it are infinitely less. However, make no mistake, that if and when such a situation occurs, the medical fraternity will find itself under the spotlight, facing a great deal of scrutiny and controversy for the choices that they will make, given that these will greatly impact social cohesion for reasons not too difficult to visualise.

Therefore, when the Prime Minister and the Health Minister, himself a doctor, tell us not to panic, they undoubtedly make eminent sense, but for the fact that we do not really see the kind of drastic measures being initiated here as we have seen in China, Italy, Hong Kong or even Singapore. This is not a political issue and just talk of “being prepared” or “screening” cannot become the buzzword to suggest that the Government is in control. The sad fact is that in this specific case, for no fault of the Government, it is the Coronavirus that is in the driver’s seat and we, the people, are on the back foot. Fortunately, the Government has taken the important step of cancelling all visas issued for entry into the country for one month. While this will certainly help, whether it goes far enough in preventing infections remains to be seen. Because more than worrying about the virus being transmitted by those coming from the affected regions, we also have to take into account its transmission from within our own communities. The Government thus has little choice but to be ahead of the curve and cannot wait to be overwhelmed before it initiates the necessary curbs on movement and other such drastic measures to firewall the spread of the Coronavirus. Undoubtedly, this will add to our economic burdens, along with a host of other issues. But, that will be far lesser than if we wait till some predetermined numbers are affected, by which time it will be too late to halt the spread of the Coronavirus exponentially. As some experts have suggested, the time for mere containment is gone and we need to look at measures that will help in mitigation.

In this context, the Governments at the State and Centre would do well to remember that we have problems that are peculiar to us, which will greatly impact our ability to effectively implement the measures that they may put in place. For one, we have an extremely large part of our population that is ignorant about matters such as personal hygiene and what is worse, lacking the necessary infrastructure required like toilets and piped water. Issues which are of critical importance here. Moreover, many among us are wholly lacking in the understanding of their own civic responsibilities and tend to be even less inclined to fulfil them unless forced.

That apart, hyperbole, superstition and plain idiocy have run amok and there are those, including prominent political and religious leaders, who have made bizarre and scientifically-unproven claims about how to counter the Coronavirus. Unfortunately, their views receive uncalled for publicity thanks to social media and add to the confusion.

Second, unlike China, we neither have the ability nor the self-discipline to ensure that measures such as lockdowns can be effectively implemented by our police force. If we are to control access and prevent gatherings of crowds, especially for religious events, then there is an urgent need for the Government to mobilise the Central Armed Police Forces and the military with the necessary protective clothing and the requisite training. Mobilisation and training take time, as does deployment, something we are very short of. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the Government acts now and moves the required forces so that they can be effective as early as possible. There is in fact no time for a separate Plan B, it needs to be implemented concurrently.

Finally, there is no space for politics here because the Coronavirus kills without bias and does not respect boundaries, caste or creed. If we are to halt its spread, we will have to work together and hard decisions will have to be taken now, regardless of their repercussions. Just as the Reserve Bank of India was forced to declare a moratorium on Yes Bank to prevent a run on the bank, the Government must take drastic action now if we are to control this pandemic. It would do well to remember that it is always better to be safe than sorry.

8,13-3-20,The way ahead for Israel,"Benny Gantz’s willingness to admit Israeli Arabs to the country’s coalition politics is grudging at best. Yet, it might be the Govt that Israel needs

Benjamin Netanyahu, or “Bibi” as everyone calls him, is the longest-serving Prime Minister in Israel’s history and still in office although he has failed to win three elections in a row. Last June, last September, and again early this month, Israeli voters split their votes in ways that made it almost impossible to put together a new Government. Bibi declared a victory but he has already failed to form a coalition with a majority in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament). He failed despite promising to annex all the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Even the unstinting support of US President Donald Trump, whose “vision” for a permanent peace settlement reads like a check-list of the territorial demands of the Israeli far Right, didn’t do the trick. The “two-State solution” — Jews and Arabs living peacefully side-by-side in separate sovereign States — has been dead for a long time and Trump’s “peace plan” just drove a stake through its heart. But the only alternative is the one-State solution, where the Arabs who are Israeli citizens and the considerably larger number who live in the occupied territories form a Palestinian near-majority within the expanded single State of Israel. That Israel could be a democratic State, where every citizen has an equal say or an apartheid State where most Arabs are subjects, not citizens, but it can’t be both. The major obstacle to forming a majority coalition is the fact that Bibi goes on trial later this month on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Even if he is found guilty, he could technically stay in office until his last appeal is exhausted, a process that could take years. This prospect is understandably unattractive to the leading Opposition party, Benny Gantz’s Blue and White Party. Gantz will only consider a power-sharing left-right coalition with Bibi’s Likud party (which would command a majority) if Gantz gets to be the Prime Minister for the first two years. Then Netanyahu could take his turn if he is absolved by the courts; otherwise not.

This deal is equally unattractive to Bibi: The safest place for him to be at the moment is in the Prime Minister’s chair. Stalemate. A fourth election looms because Bibi can go on calling them and meanwhile the Israeli State drifts aimlessly: No legislation, not even a proper budget. What is to be done? So a few days ago Benny Gantz broke the rules of Israeli politics by asking for the support of the Joint List, the umbrella organisation of all of Israel’s Arab political parties. The Joint List wouldn’t actually be in the coalition Government but the votes of its 15 Knesset members would put the Jewish Opposition parties over the top and make Benny Prime Minister. Presumably they would expect some concessions in return, which alarm those Jewish Israelis who see their Arab fellow-citizens as traitors and potential terrorists. But talks between the parties started on March 11. This ground-breaking deal may never be consummated — the odds are against it — but it is nevertheless a turning point. For the first time, the real Israel of today is showing through the cracks in its hidebound politics.

Five years ago President Reuven Rivlin — “Ruvi” to his friends — made a startling speech in which he pointed out that barely half the children now in Israeli primary schools will grow up to be Zionists. Right down to the end of the 20th century, a large majority of the population was secular Zionists, mostly of Eastern European origin and everybody else was clubbed as “minorities” but that time is gone. Only 38 per cent of the children in primary schools today are secular Zionists. Another 15 per cent are “national-religious”, observant Jews who nevertheless share the Zionist vision. But a quarter of the children are Haredim: Ultra-Orthodox Jews who do not recognise the legitimacy of the Jewish State, regarding it as a rebellion against God — and another quarter are Arab and mostly Muslim. Few people in the latter two groups will even serve in the army.

These four very different “tribes”, as Ruvi calls them, have to share Israel, like it or not. Moreover, the “one-State” Israel that implies, extending from the Jordan Valley to the Mediterranean, will have to include all the Arabs in the occupied territories as well. Learning to live together, given all the bitter history, may be well-nigh impossible, but there are no other options.

However, such a bid remains a long-shot effort as two right-leaning members of Gantz’s party, MKs Yoaz Hendel and Zvika Hauser, have openly rejected it and vowed to oppose it, and it remains unclear whether the Joint List and Blue and White could reach an agreement. One of the demands previously raised by the Arab alliance has been Gantz’s rejection of Trump’s peace plan.

This is certainly not a vision that Benny Gantz shares: His willingness to admit Israeli Arabs to the country’s coalition politics is grudging at best. “This is not the Government we wanted,” he said. And yet, it might be the Government that Israel needs.

9,13-3-20,Not such a smart move after all,"The Smart City Mission needs to change its course of action if it aims to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development. For this we need to draw lessons from failures and build upon the mission’s successes

While presenting the Union Budget 2020-21, Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman proposed setting up five new smart cities to attract investment and drive economic growth. Unlike the metropolises under the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) modelled as light house with area-based and pan city development, the new smart cities will embrace full-fledged new development like GIFT city, Special Economic Zones and so on.

However, a closer look at the progress of the SCM reveals some disappointing trends. As of July 25, 2019, of the total approved projects of under Rs 3 lakh crore, only 18 per cent have been completed; work orders have been issued for 37 per cent projects; tenders have been issued for 16 per cent and 29 per cent of proposed projects are still at the “detailed project report” stage. Moreover, the SCM’s progress has been lopsided as 54 per cent of the completed projects have come from just four States — Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. At the city level, 10 cities (New Delhi, Belagavi, Surat, Indore, Varanasi, Raipur, Tumakuru, Vadodara, Ajmer and Ahmedabad) account for 48 per cent of the completed projects. And 34 smart cities do not have evidence of even a single completed project.

Even the holistic improvement of the cities seems to be unrealistic as, on average, the Area Based Development projects account for up to 80 per cent of the funds but don’t benefit even five to 10 per cent of the city’s population. However, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) and the SCM never leave any stone unturned to highlight cosmetic achievements and announce new measures like pairing sister towns on the basis of best and worst 20 performing cities or establishing a Smart City Observatory. To many observers, the SCM’s initiatives have become futile. For instance, the Ease of Living Index report that MoHUA started for all smart cities in 2018 could not be furnished in 2019 despite floating tenders for the same over six times. Moreover, it was also reported that a SCM 2.0 will be launched in 2020 that would cover all the 4,302 cities in India. Hence, given the Centre’s continued and renewed focus on smart cities, it is imperative to understand the constraints plaguing the SCM since its inception.

Given the capacity problem at the city level, leading private firms are being engaged as consultants and as Project Monitoring Units (PMUs) by the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) for the preparation of the concept plan and execution of the smart city projects. Further, their aim is to create a sustainable revenue model to attract private investment, but, this turns out to be abysmally low.

The SCM guidelines state that the “rights and obligations” of the city will be transferred to the SPVs without specifying the exact terms of the relationship and hierarchy between them. The SPVs, headed by a CEO and regulated by the Companies Act 2013, consist largely of bureaucrats with only a small representation of elected representatives or any experts. The major decision-making powers rests with the SPV and its board of directors. Hence, many of their policy choices are guided by centrally-formulated guidelines. Quite contrary to the ethos of decentralisation and empowerment of city Governments, the SPV-led process of implementing the SCM becomes more bureaucratic and technocratic. Even though it is pragmatic to allow the SPVs to work on smart proposals, that should be in consonance with and not to the exclusion of elected representatives of city Governments.

Public participation has been virtually limited to consultations online on social media or websites with public responses in the form of multiple choice answers. This, in turn, increases the risk of making these proposals more elitist, leaving behind the voices and needs of poor and marginalised citizens. In fact, there is evidence showing preference for costlier infrastructure over the basic needs of majority urban residents. Nearly 40 per cent of transportation projects are focussed on roads and parking lots, while only 20 per cent of the budget is focussed on public transportation and only two per cent on buses.

Regarding the financing of SCM, studies have indicated a clear pattern of not only heavy dependence on public funds for financing the mission, but there has been a movement away from market-oriented sources of funding like public-private partnerships (PPPs) and loans, especially in smaller cities.

The FM’s proposal to develop five new smart cities highlights collaboration with States in a PPP mode. However, the contribution of such PPP projects in value terms as well as the sourcing of revenue from municipal bonds continues to be ambiguous. In the absence of robust economic, legal, financial and project viability, the municipal projects are rarely perceived to be commercially viable. For this, funds can be arranged through PPPs or by accessing the capital market. With the banking system currently under stress with bad debts, the SCM might not receive the necessary investments from the private sector, at least, in the short term.

Nonetheless, some cities have made significant progress in terms of implementation of PPP (Nagpur, Vadodara) while some other cities have taken specific measures (e.g. appointment of transactional advisors) for generating revenue from municipal bonds. Pune, Hyderabad, Indore, Bhopal and Amaravati have successfully launched municipal bonds to finance some of their urban development projects. Emphasis has also been placed on land monetisation as another important source for financing the SCM.

However, since land is a State subject, city Governments cannot exercise their control over it and thus lack the autonomy to use land independently to increase their revenues. Further, the use of land especially in the SCM era has prompted concerns about forced evictions in many cities and raised concerns on the inclusive ideals of the SCM. Solutions to the above problems are well-known and have been recommended by experts many times. The real issues constraining the functioning of cities are age-old in which the SCM has been stuck. City Governments will have to acquire greater capability in raising resources from conventional sources (e.g., property tax, user fee and so on). This would make them attractive for potential private investors.

With the global urban population poised to grow in the coming decades, Indian cities will be enormously responsible for “global growth and well-being.”

Simply trusting specific sectors like manufacturing or services for growth seems outdated for the 21st century, unless the governance of cities is fixed.

In essence, into its fifth year of implementation, the SCM has turned out to be inherently unsmart. It needs to change its course of action if it aims to achieve inclusive growth and sustainable development. For this we need to draw lessons from failures and build upon the SCM’s successes.

The Government must demonstrate its commitment towards local economic development, sustainable development and ease of living by inviting experienced countries to partner in the execution of the SCM and tackle the persisting challenges associated with it in India.

14,13-3-20,"Marandi clears roadblock, assures BJP will not raise LoP issue","The Leader of Opposition issue once again reverberated at Jharkhand Assembly with ruling party lawmakers raising the issue. As the budget session of Jharkhand Assembly resumed today after Holi vacations, the Opposition members started a ruckus in the House with their demands.

BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi intervening on the issue for the first time urged the Speaker to take a decision on the issue. Marandi, the Dhanwar MLA, assured that the BJP MLAs will not enter in the well of house with this demand, at the same said that Speaker has the right to give Opposition leader recognition to whomever he wants.

Marandi raising the issue said, “Speaker Sir, I request you to take a decision on Leader of Opposition. In the budget session lawmakers from both treasury as well opposition benches raise issue concerning with their areas, but due to delay in sorting out the Leader of Opposition (LoP) issue, many important issue are not being raised in the House as discussion is not being held.”

Marandi said, on February 17, 2020, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha Prajatantrik (JVM-P) merged with BJP and regarding this information was given to Election Commission and Speaker of the House. The Election Commission (EC) has also agreed to this on March 6, 2020 issued a letter giving its consent about the merger of JVM with BJP, but despite the Chair has yet to take a final decision.

Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto speaking on the issue said that there are several queries in the mind of opposition members even he was interested to sort out the issue, but he urged to give him some time. “Everything will be crystal clear, I am taking advice of Constitutional experts,” added Mahto. Marandi on Speaker’s assurance said that he will urge his MLAs not to raise the issue again in House.

Meanwhile, outside the House, BJP MLA Anant Ojha told reporters that BJP MLAs in the Assembly are constantly pleading with Speaker to accord Leader of Opposition status to Marandi upholding the democratic values and Constitutional arrangements. He said, “We are urging Speaker to give justice on the issue because the House cannot run without a Leader of Opposition (LoP).

15,13-3-20,Coronavirus fear hits air travel in Ranchi,"The number of air passengers travelling to and from Ranchi has reduced by at least 10 per cent amid Coronavirus fear, officials from the Birsa Munda Airport in Ranchi said on Thursday. On an average, around 2 lakh passengers either fly from or land in Ranchi airport every month, and the number of such passengers was below 1,80,000 in the past one month, the officials added.

“The number of passengers travelling from or to Ranchi by air has reduced by at least 10 per cent. I think it is due to the Coronavirus fear and the panic among passengers,” said Director of Birsa Munda Airport, Vinod Sharma. The largest airport in Jharkhand already has 30 flights connecting Ranchi to important cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The airport also has an international bay, but is yet to get any international flights.

However, there is no screening process in place at the Ranchi airport to check the condition of passengers traveling to the city, Sharma said. Passengers, he said, were screened only at 30 airports across India, especially the ones that have international connectivity.

“There is no intimation from the Government on screening passengers at the Ranchi airport as of now,” he said.

Novel Coronavirus – a mysterious virus that has claimed nearly 5000 lives and infected over 1.2 lakh people across the globe – has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

In India, the lethal virus has affected over 70 people, leading the Government of India to ban entry of foreign nationals, including Non-Resident Indians (NRI), in India. More than 80 people are under observation in Jharkhand and no cases of Coronavirus have been reported here yet.

While many air travelers have cancelled their travel plans, the fear of contracting COVID 19 has not affected railway bookings to a great extent. The flow of passengers has remained more or less constant in the past couple of weeks, officials said. Railways, however, has been spreading awareness about Coronavirus through posters pasted in trains and railway stations, officials from Ranchi Railway Division said.

Despite no cases of Coronavirus reported in Jharkhand, the health machinery here is braced up to fight cases of COVID 19 here.

All Government hospitals across the State have set up dedicated isolation wards for patients who complain of symptoms similar to that of Coronavirus. Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) has arranged for nearly 500 N95 masks and set up an 18-bed isolation ward.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-fear-hits-air-travel-in-ranchi.html
16,13-3-20,"‘Showers both beneficial, harmful for crops across State’","The prolonged winter season being experienced in Jharkhand this year is quite unusual. From mid February, the weather is generally clear with the temperatures gradually rising. In spite of the temperature being on the higher side on some days, it suddenly drops down due to constantly changing weather conditions. Light to moderate showers and hailstorms seem to be affecting the crops across the State.

“This time rainfall has mixed effects on the agriculture sector- beneficial as well as harmful, but mostly beneficial as long as there are no hailstorms and high speed winds. Due to the intermittent rainfall, the temperatures have fallen. Because of the low temperatures the newly sown vegetables and other crops are showing stunted growth,” said A Wadood, an agro- meteorological scientist at Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), Ranchi.

This is the season for rabi or winter crops the sowing for which starts in October and harvesting is done in April- May. During this season, it is difficult for farmers to irrigate these crops with limited resources available. Presently, the major crops include wheat, gram, oil seeds like mustard and vegetables.

“Crops need good temperature but due to the showers and changing weather conditions, the temperature is falling. With the temperature continuously being on the lower side, it is affecting the crops by giving them stunted growth. The growth and development of crops is not as desired,” added Wadood.

The official further stated that during this period if there is rain provided it is not coupled with hail and gusty winds, it is always beneficial for agriculture. Most of the crops will be benefitted with this rainfall barring those which are about to be harvested.

“The present wind speed of about 20 to 30 Km per hour and that too for a few minutes is not going to harm the crops. Hailstorms certainly damage the tender crops like cauliflower, cabbage, tomatoes and wheat also. Rain showers add to the soil moisture which will help in the coming months,” said the agro- meteorological scientist

As per the MET Observatory Centre, Ranchi on March 13 wide spread showers accompanied with thunderstorm and lighting is expected across Jharkhand. Parts of southern and central Jharkhand will witness light showers from March 14 to March 17. No heavy showers are predicted during this time across the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---showers-both-beneficial--harmful-for-crops-across-state---.html
17,13-3-20,18 Govt schools to be made as model schools in Capital,"In an attempt to impart quality education to the students of government schools and to get them at par with their private counterparts, the Ranchi district administration is all set to transform 18 government schools in the State capital.

The first phase of the project will be launched in the second week of March where 18 government schools will be transformed into model schools. These institutions will have all the basic facilities as compared to that of a private school. Students from class I to class VIII about 10,000 in number are expected to benefit from this project.

“The district administration is making these 18 model schools equipped with smart class, library and other facilities for the holistic development of the children. These schools with a creative learning space will help in improving the learning outcome of the children,” said Ranchi Deputy Development Commissioner, Ananya Mittal.

In order to make the schools attractive and to provide a better ambience to the students, the buildings will be painted using a technique called BaLA- Building as Learning Aid. To inculcate a habit of reading in the children, a library will also be set up in the school. To make it more interesting, activity materials like puzzles, globes, comics, pictographs will also be kept here for the students.

The administration also plans to set up a science laboratory in these schools. To improve the learning outcome of the students and also to enable them to grasp things better, one smart class equipped with computers, LED screens and white boards will also be made in each school. These class rooms will be aided with virtual learning techniques and follow the JCERT- Jharkhand Council of Education Research and Training curriculum

The initiative is being taken under the Aspirational District Programme of NITI Aayog to revive the educational sector where all government schools will be included. In the second phase of the project, 30 more schools will be included in it. The second phase of the initiative will be launched in the financial year 2020-21.

“The model school project will help the Ranchi district administration in setting an example in the field of the education for others. It will help in creating and providing the students with a great learning atmosphere in government schools,” said Aspirational District Fellow, Ranchi Pooja Kumari.

The first phase is being sponsored by the district administration while for the second phase onwards various Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) will be approached for Corporate Social Responsibility fund (CSRs).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/18-govt-schools-to-be-made--as-model-schools-in-capital.html

24,13-3-20,Sex ratio in UT below national average,"The “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” programme, seems to have failed to stem the tide in the Union Territory of Chandigarh, where the sex ratio at birth (SRB) remains below the national average.

“In 2018-19, Chandigarh recorded the SRB of 914, lower that the national average of 931 in the same fiscal year,” stated a report of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development tabled in Rajya Sabha recently.

The report stated, “Chandigarh recorded SRB of 921 in 2016-17 which declined to 897 in 2017-18. An improvement was recorded in 2018-19 when the SRB was 910. However, still the SRB remains lower than the national average of 931 in 2018-19.”

Chandigarh is among the 13 States/Union territories which has recorded lower SRB than the national average. The names neighboring States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal also figured in the list.

Commenting on these Sates/Union Territories, the Committee observed that BBBP scheme is one of the major programmes aimed at correcting a deep routed societal bias against the girl child and funds remain under-utilized under such a scheme is a cause of deep concern for the Committee. The Committee, accordingly, recommended that causes for under utilisation may be identified and remedial measures undertaken immediately.

“It also recommended that more efforts are required to be made in these States/UTs to bring the SRB over and above the national average of 931. The concerned Ministry could conduct socio-economic studies at district level in these States/UTs to understand the causes of low SRB and frame suitable strategies to get effective results,” the report added.

Chandigarh was allotted funds to the tune of Rs 19.53 lakh in 2017-18 and Rs 0.65 lakh in 2018-19 under the programme. The BBBP programme was launched in January 2015 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address the issues related to girl child survival, health, nutrition, education and empowerment.

Notably, Chandigarh, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana had recorded the lowest sex ratio among rural areas in the country in census 2011. The National Health Profile-2019, the annual health data publication of the Ministry of Health released last year had stated that Chandigarh has the worst rural sex ratio of 618 females per 1000 males (2011 census) in the country.

As per the census 2011, the overall sex ratio in Chandigarh was 818 against national average of 940 while the child sex ratio was 880 against the national average of 919.

Recently, the Chandigarh Administration had announced to reward informers who alert UT officials about illegal sex determination tests and help in cracking down on illegal centres. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was announced for the informers, in a bid to keep a check on those involved in sex selective abortions.

To keep a check on female foeticide, the Administration had already made it mandatory for ultrasound centres to take photocopies of identity cards and address proof of couples going in for ultrasound test for any reason, including determining the general health of the foetus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sex-ratio-in-ut-below-national-average.html
25,13-3-20,Congress hits at Centre for DVC’s load shedding,"Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Thursday blamed the State run electricity generation company Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) for disturbing power supply on behalf of the Central Government in the State and demanded that its due payment incurred by former State Government will be paid by the State Government.

State Congress Spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said that due to the arrears of Rs 5000 crores in the State by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government, power cuts are being done in Jharkhand by DVC from Thursday, while arrears in other states of the Country range between Rs 20 to 50 thousand crores but there is there is no power cut there.

“With an intention to malign the reputation of the popular State Government of Mahagathbandhan in Jharkhand, DVC has been load-shedding in several districts of the State for 18 hours since March 10, resulting in Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Koderma, Chatra, Bokaro, Giridih, Dhanbad and East Singhbhum. People living in some areas are having a lot of troubles, electricity is being available for only six hours in seven districts. Inhuman activities of DVC are affecting 8 to 10 lakh people,” said Dubey.

The party Spokesperson said, “Water is our, labor is our, land is our so electricity should also be ours. DVC should stop its action at the behest of the Central Government, why DVC was silent for so many days.”

Load shedding is being done in DVC command area for 18 hours from March 10 itself. Seven districts - Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Koderma, Chatra, Bokaro, Giridih and Dhanbad, besides the Musabani area of East Singhbhum are also affected. The routine of about eight lakh consumers of these districts has deteriorated. At the same time, load shedding is having a big impact on business, farming and industry too. This has caused resentment among the consumers.

The JMM has also expressed resentment on load shedding is done by the power generating company. The party has tweeted on its official tweeter that the DVC’s dues on Jharkhand are owed by the BJP Government. People were not harassed even though there were arrears in the Raghubar Government. Hemant Soren has given a tough fight to the BJP, so the BJP Government sitting at the Center is compensating it by harassing the people through DVC.

According to the information, State owes Rs 4955 crore to the corporation till November 2019. DVC had given the deadline till February 25 for payment of arrears on 10 February 2020, but the State could not pay the arrears on time.

Then DVC gave extension of two days. After this, load shedding was started for a while. Load shedding of 18 hours started from 10 March. JBVNL supplies 600 MW power per day in DVC command area. But from March 10, less than 300 MW power is being supplied in the above areas. In Giridih and other districts, electricity is being given for two hours every six hours.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-hits-at-centre-for-dvc---s-load-shedding.html
26,13-3-20,"Police, CWC at loggerheads in rape case","Child Welfare Committee, Garhwa and district police seem to be at loggerheads over an alleged gangrape case in Garhwa that took place on March 03. A 13-year-old girl had alleged gangrape by two men, against whom FIR was lodged, but on the statement of the girl later a minor was held and sent to juvenile home.

Police said that in her statement recorded under section of 164 of Cr PC the victim had said that she was seen in compromising position with another minor by the two men, against whom she had leveled rape charges. And due to the fear of parents and society she had complained against the two men, police stated.

However, on Thursday when the victim came to the CWC to record her Statement, police took her back to her house and did not allow her to record the statement, said the victim. Later the Chairman of CWC Upendra Dubey went to her house and recorded her statement.

The victim’s statement was recorded in the presence of District Social Welfare Officer and others villagers. In her statement victim stated, ""I was sexually assaulted by Shami and Sameer, but the police have falsely implicated a minor boy from the village in the case. He was innocent. Minor boy was the eye witnesses.

I demand that my statement under section of 164 Cr. P. C. be re-recorded before the court.”

“On Thursday morning the Chowkidar of the village was guarding my house so that I could not go to the CWC to record my statement. When I went to the CWC with my mother, maternal grandmother, mother's sister, somehow hiding from the Chowkidar, the police reached there and brought us back to our house,” she said.

""It is not justifiable to drag a girl by 25 uniformed policemen. Keeping in mind the safety standards, I also went after them,"" the CWC Chairman said.

The alleged gang rape with 13 years old girl by two co-villagers took place on March 03 in a village under Meral police station.

On the complaint of her maternal uncle, Meral police had registered a case against co-villagers Samir Khan and Shami Khan under Section 376 (D) of India Penal Code and other relevant Sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Meanwhile, DSP headquarter Dilip Khalkho issued a press statement saying that during the investigation , it came to light that both the accused were not involved in the incident of forcibly raping the victim, but a minor boy from the same village was involved .

“The minor boy already had a love affair with the girl, and on the day of the incident, they were seen by two persons (Samir and Shami) making physical relationship, due to which they have been made accused. It was also accepted by the victim in her statement recorded under section of 164 Cr. P. C. Medical examination of the girl was also done,” read the statement.

""The statement issued by DSP in the case of the POCSO Act is not justified. Police are not empowered to issue press release in connection of POCSO Act case,"" said the CWC Chairman adding, ""The police do not arrest those against whom an FIR has been filed, but instead send another minor to jail.""

“The three accused should have gone to jail if the minor was also involved in the incident. I will inform the whole incident to JHALSA, DLSA PDJ, and Child Rights Protection Commission, New Delhi,” he further said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police--cwc-at-loggerheads-in-rape-case.html

38,13-3-20,Maoists thrash villager in Kangaroo court,"Maoist rebels intervening on Monday and Tuesday again made their presence felt in the cutoff region of the Bokaro district.

Sources said that the Maoists held a Kangaroo court at forest area of Chute panchayat and beat one member mercilessly alleging that he was a police informer.

Sources said the ultras dragged body member Raju Prasad Mahto from his house and produced him in the Kangaroo court held inside the forest outside the village.

The ultras warned him of dire consequences if he cooperates with the police and pass any information about them, and they have also ordered Raju Prasad Mahto to move out of his home and village. Sources added later, they released the Mahto. The incident has terrified the villagers.

Notably, recently the Maoists’ Martyr Week had passed off peacefully without any untoward incident due to the vigil maintained by 26th Central paramilitary forces, the Special Operations Group and the local police. So, the Maoists want to make their presence felt in the cutoff region, which the security forces find it difficult to reach because of the inhospitable terrain, said police officials.

Sources said that Maoists brutally thrashed around two or three other villagers, suspecting them to be police informers, in a kangaroo court organised in the forested terrain of Gomia block in strife-torn Bokaro district, about 50 km of its headquarter.

Sources said that nearly 20 to 30 rebels led by Maoist leader Mithlesh Mahto stormed into the village of Raju Prasad Mahto, at Chute and nearby hamlets and organised a jan adalat — their way of on-the-spot trial — inside the jungle and battered the inhabitants of the villages after handpicking them. The condition of body member is stated to be serious”and his mobile got switched off, a villager told the police, who took the injured to a hospital for treatment.

The Maoists are terribly frustrated at losing their cadres who are surrendering or have been arrested, and are also failing to keep up their mass support. They are cowards and are behaving ruthlessly towards innocent people”, the police sources said.

The security forces have launched a search operation to trace the Maoists in Jhumra.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maoists-thrash-villager-in-kangaroo-court.html

45,13-3-20,Don’t try to convert BBSR to Singapore overnight,"After twenty years or so, if you suddenly want your citizen to be law-binding then it will end in political disaster. Imagine those venders who come to Bhubaneswar by bicycles to sell vegetables grown in their backyards or in their cultivation lands. They are farmers as per definition. Poor fellows are treated like criminals by the authorities and driven out from roadside where no cycles or bikes run. They are self-employed poor people doing no ham to any one; rather, they sell garden-fresh vegetables at a reasonable price.

From Patia up to Jayadev Vihar, there is no parking space for cars. Those people who travel by cars and want to help the farmers who are selling fresh vegetables will now think twice because of fear of the cars being towed away and fined. Probably, there might be markings in a survey for different smart cities, but our authorities are more worried about ‘certificates’ rather than giving employment to our poor people. On one hand, our hearts bleed for farmers, but when they start selling their produce we arrest them or throw away their fresh vegetables. We should not try to convert an unplanned city called Bhubaneswar into Switzerland or Singapore overnight!

Fireworks and DJ music are in full blast even after 11pm. If someone tries to inform 100 then the police people may inform the ruffians as to who has objected to the procession and fireworks. Here the rule makers are silent. Bikes run on footpaths; the bicycle tracks are seldom used; most of the Mo Cycles remain unused at roadside in their respective stands collecting dusts and wearing rusts. Very few people use them for fear of death. If someone wants to commit suicide then he can ride a bike. Mo Buses, specially the AC ones, run almost empty. The Government wants people to buy cars and bikes for their own comfort because our public transport system is in a shambles.

Friends, it’s very difficult to change people’s habits and mindsets overnight.

Roadside restaurants, aludam dahibara movable shops, vegetable shops, readymade garment shops are managed by unemployed people. The Government does not spend a single paisa for them. But to increase unemployment these new rules of no parking and towing system is introduced to earn revenue so that that can be used as freebies for vote bank politics. We are told that the Mo Cycle and Mo Bus are a big failure. Only officers got their reward during tender of these vehicles. Huge buses only add problem to the over-congested roads of Bhubaneswar. Those who want to die early should drive on Bhubaneswar and Cuttack roads!

First have parking lots so that people can use them and purchase or do business as most of the banks, offices and shops are situated on the roadsides.

People are now very much frightened to take out their cars for going out. Once you are at mercy of traffic police, they can punish you in different ways. On one hand, the Government gets huge revenue out of vehicles; on the other hand, these sudden ‘Singaporean’ rules look bizarre to most of the people.

If the opposition parties have common sense, they may use slogans of just the opposite what the present Government is implementing at Bhubaneswar.

1. Wearing helmet is optional

2. Using car seatbelt is optional

3. Overriding is not punishable

4.Those who have no valid papers while driving a car or a bike may send it through Whatsapp or e-mail to police or RTO office within seven days. No fine on roadside

5. Separate lanes for two- and three-wheelers

6. No pollution certificates needed for two-wheelers. (One truck can pollute air which hundreds of bike can’t do)

7. Even though law says no to trucks in the city roads at peak hours, still then one can find plenty of them. The big tourist buses are also a big nuisance on Bhubaneswar roads.

8. The shortcut road from Cuttack via Nandankanan has made Patia, Damna and Kalinga Hospital traffic a big headache for the public and traffic police.

To summarise: The change should neither be implemented to get a certificate nor to earn overnight revenue to please the higher authorities. We would request our CM to travel in an unofficial car without police escorts and realise the sufferings of the common people who have made him the king for last twenty years. Give one year’s time for people to change or raise your arms and surrender.

Your body your head take care of it. No Government aid for RTA; its insurance company’s headache.

On an average, around 2 lakh passengers either fly from or land in Ranchi airport every month, and the number of such passengers was below 1,80,000 in the past one month, the officials added.

“The number of passengers travelling from or to Ranchi by air has reduced by at least 10 per cent. I think it is due to the Coronavirus fear and the panic among passengers,” said Director of Birsa Munda Airport, Vinod Sharma. The largest airport in Jharkhand already has 30 flights connecting Ranchi to important cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The airport also has an international bay, but is yet to get any international flights.

However, there is no screening process in place at the Ranchi airport to check the condition of passengers traveling to the city, Sharma said. Passengers, he said, were screened only at 30 airports across India, especially the ones that have international connectivity.

“There is no intimation from the Government on screening passengers at the Ranchi airport as of now,” he said.

78,13-3-20,Punjab issues advisory on milk fortification,"In view of high prevalence of Vitamin A and D deficiency in Punjab population, all milk processing plants in the State have been issued an advisory on milk fortification as per the Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2016 under the Tandrust Punjab Mission.

For the purpose, all the Food Safety Officers in the State have been directed to bring the matter to the notice of all milk processing plants engaged in sale of packaged liquid milk to public. Pertinently, there are about 50 milk plants in the State with maximum being 14 in Amritsar district followed by eight in Ludhiana.

Informing this, Tandrust Punjab Mission Director KS Pannu said that the food fortification is a scientifically proven, cost-effective, scalable and sustainable global intervention that addresses the issue of micronutrient deficiencies.

Pannu informed that in October 2016, FSSAI operationalized the Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2016, for fortifying many staples including milk to reduce the high burden of micronutrient malnutrition in India.

He informed that the ‘+F’ logo has been notified to identify fortified foods. As per the provisions of Schedule-I of Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2016, it has been advised that milk (toned, double toned, skimmed milk or standardized milk) should be fortified with the micronutrients, at the level of Vitamin A 270 µg RE - 450 µg RE and Vitamin D 5 µg -7.5 µg.

Pannu said that since population in Punjab is suffering from acute deficiency of vitamin D and vitamin A, hence milk fortification is required essentially to address such micronutrient deficiencies. “Thus, all milk processing plants in the state, selling packaged liquid milk, have been requested to start the fortification of milk as per the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2016,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-issues-advisory-on-milk-fortification.html

The petition by Heera Lal Gupta, father of Pawan Kumar Gupta, is an appeal against the sessions court's January 27 decision dismissing his plea challenging a magisterial court's January 6 order rejecting his complaint to lodge an FIR against the sole eye-witness in the case.

The sole eyewitness, a friend of the 23-year-old victim, was accompanying her in the bus when the gruesome incident took place and he too was physically assaulted by the culprits.

Gupta, in his plea, has claimed that actions of the witness resulted in a media trial of the case and his son was, therefore, not provided a proper hearing.

The petition refers to tweets by a journalist of a media house who had claimed that the witness had charged money to give interviews to various news channels. The plea claims ""it is clear from the tweets that his (witness) testimony was false and fabricated"" and therefore, it calls for an independent investigation into the alleged perjury committed by him.

Nirbhaya is the name given to the December 2012 victim, a physiotherapy intern, who was raped and brutally assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi by six people.

She had boarded the nearly vacant bus in Munirka in South Delhi along with her male friend on her way back home on December 16 that year. After raping and brutalising the woman and beating her friend, the assailants had thrown them out of the bus.

96,13-3-20,Candid Notes,"Gairsain Gamble

By showing the tenacity to declare Gairsain as the summer capital of the Himalayan state, TSR has etched his name firmly in the history of Uttarakhand. This move which is being touted as a masterstroke has left his detractors both within and outside the saffron party gasping for breath. Basking in the glory of adulations after the historic decision of fulfilling a part of the long held aspirations of the people of the state – the final objective being permanent capital status to Gairsain- TSR is not naive to not understand the future political ramifications of this decision.Though he has talked about constituting an expert committee for a time bound development of Gairsain, setting up infrastructure needed for a state capital and cobbling up bare minimum facilities for a more or less reluctant bureaucracy at a place which at present is bereft of any facilities would be the biggest challenge for TSR. The CM also knows that people would expect his office and top bureaucracy to start functioning from the summer capital and soon questions would be asked about the rationale of having two capitals for a small and poor state.

Yatra peril

Amid unprecedented worldwide scare from the threat generated by novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the dreaded disease as a pandemic, the Uttarakhand government is preparing for the Char Dham Yatra. In the Yatra, devotees from all parts of the country and abroad throng the shrines located in the Himalayan state. Last year an estimated 32 lakh pilgrims visited the Char Dhams. In the current scenario where the threat of the Coronavirus is increasing with each passing day, the mandarins of the state are advised to drastically curtail the size of Yatra in terms of arrival of pilgrims. Though the officials are making tall claims about setting up elaborate health check up facilities along the entire Yatra route, the stark fact is that efforts after the Kedarnath disaster to set up a robust system of registration of the pilgrims have not met with success yet. The condition of the health services in the state is as pathetic as always with near absence of modern facilities needed for quarantine and treatment of the patients of the dreaded disease. In such a dreadful scenario prevention seems the best option the state government has in its hands so it should not hesitate to impose restrictions on the Char Dham Yatra.

A bureaucrat spearheading many important departments in the Himalayan state has made himself very unpopular among his subordinates, politicians and others paying visit to him due to his arrogant and brusque behaviour. Exasperated by his attitude some of the elected representatives are contemplating to register their complaint at the highest level against him. They are of the view that the public representatives should be humble and accessible for everyone and the arrogant Babu should either change his attitude or he should be relieved of the important departments which require a high degree of public dealing. They point out that the present chief secretary of the state, who is humbleness personified should be the role model for the Babus of the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-03-13.html

In a letter to Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy, RBI Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan said, “We would like to point out that the Reserve Bank has adequate powers to regulate and supervise the private-sector banks; and by using these powers it has ensured that the depositors’ money is entirely safe.”

Vishwanathan stated that apprehension on the safety of deposits in private banks is highly misplaced and any reactive decision would not be in the interest of stability of financial system in general and banking system in particular.

He requested the Odisha Government to reconsider any decision to withdraw or transfer funds deposited by the State Government and its entities in private-sector banks.

With an aim to retain depositors’ confidence in private banks and mitigating their hardships, the RBI has drawn up a draft scheme without any delay and is in the process to finalise the scheme, said the RBI Deputy Governor’s letter.

Meanwhile, Union Minister Pratap Sarangi met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi on Thursday and discussed on the safety of Rs 545-crore fund of the Jaganath Temple deposited in the Yes Bank.

103,13-3-20,"MP Speaker summons 22 rebels, Nath messenger detained in K’taka","Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker NP Prajapati on Thursday asked the 22 rebel Congress MLAs to appear before him by Friday and clarify whether their resignations that pushed the 15-month-old Kamal Nath Government to the brink of collapse was voluntary or under pressure.

The development took place on a day when Nath’s firefighter Minister Jitu Patwari was detained and stopped by the police from entering a resort near Bengaluru where 19 of the 22 MLAs are believed to be holed up.

The 22 MLAs who were issued notices are stated to be supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress and joined the BJP on Wednesday.

Police sources said the Minister was briefly detained along with his supporters as he tried to enter the resort. A video purportedly showing the Minister picking up heated arguments with the police has gone viral.

According to sources, Patwari had come with an apparent intention to convince the rebel MLAs who included six ministers to return to the party fold.

The Congress, however, alleged two Ministers from MP were arrested by police in Bengaluru.

Talking to reporters at the State Congress office in Bhopal, party MP Vivek Tankha said the two Ministers, Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh, had gone to Bengaluru along with the father of party MLA Manoj Choudhary, who he claimed, had been held “captive” by the BJP at the resort.

On Thursday, Scindia arrived at the party’s MP headquarters to a grand welcome by saffron party leaders, including former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, and amid bursting of crackers.

The 49-year-old former Union Minister arrived at the jam-packed BJP office amid bursting of crackers and loud beating of drums. BJP workers repeatedly raised the slogan ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’.

Both the Congress Ministers were also assaulted by policemen in Bengaluru, alleged Tankha, who is also a senior Supreme Court lawyer.

As the fate of the Congress Government hung in balance, the BJP said it will seek a floor test in the Assembly on March 16 to test the majority of the ruling party.

The Congress, however, said it will face the floor test only after the Speaker decides on the resignations of the 22 MLAs.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh wondered why the rebel MLAs were not meeting the Speaker to submit their resignations.

BJP’s chief whip in the Assembly Narottam Mishra said since the Government has been reduced to a minority the opposition party is going to request the Governor and the Speaker for a floor test on March 16 when the State Budget session begins.

“This Government has lost majority,” said senior BJP leader and Chouhan.

When asked about the BJP’s demand, Digvijaya said the Chief Minister is ready for a floor test.

“As Nath has already said we are ready for the floor test. But, there should be a decision on the resignation of MLAs before the floor test,” Digvijaya said, while blaming the BJP for the constitutional crisis in the State.

“The resignations will be accepted when the MLAs meet the Speaker one-on-one and verify their signatures without any pressure. Then the resignations will be accepted and the floor test can be conducted,” he said.

Digvijaya said the rebel MLAs should now go to the Speaker and clear the air.

“Nineteen Congress MLAs are in their (BJP’s) captivity. The family members (of MLAs) are unable to talk to them. Their phones were taken away,” Digvijaya alleged, adding it is also strange that the resignations of the Congress MLAs were submitted to the Speaker by BJP leader Bhupendra Singh.

The BJP claimed this is an “internal matter” of the Congress, but at the same time leaders of the saffron party submitted the resignations of the ruling party (Congress) MLAs to the Speaker, Digvijaya pointed out.

On Tuesday, 22 Congress MLAs resigned in a coordinated revolt soon after Scindia quit the party. Three of them are still in MP, sources said.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228- member Assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114.

It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP. If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 206.

The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats, while the BJP has 107 with the magic number for a majority being 104.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mp-speaker-summons-22-rebels--nath-messenger-detained-in-k---taka.html
104,13-3-20,Few protesters demonstrate at new protest site,"The old protest site near Parade Ground has been vacated by all the protesters while only one protesting group continued its hunger strike in the new protest site near Adhoiwala on Thursday.

On Wednesday evening, some of the protestors were detained by the police from the old protest site for not shifting their protest to the new site as the permission approved to protest there was revoked by the city magistrate.

Reportedly, when the protesters refused shifting to the new site near Adhoiwala till late on Wednesday evening, the police detained a few protesters.

According to one of the protesting members of Uttarakhand Unemployed Organisation (UUO) Suresh Singh, the police detained some protesting members from the old protest site and around 2 AM, they were dropped at the new protest site in Adhoiwala. Though the work under the Smart City Project has begun at the old protest site near Parade Ground, no protesting groups continued their protest in new site except UUO on Thursday. Various groups like Gairsain Rajdhani Nirman Abhiyan (GRNA) and State Anganwadi Workers Association have termed the shifting of protest site as a blot to the democracy.Meanwhile, the district administration is working in cooperation with Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) to provide the basic facilities like drinking water and toilet facility to protesters at the new protest site.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/few-protesters-demonstrate-at-new-protest-site.html
105,13-3-20,Locals of Doon welcome shifting of protest site,"Many people of Dehradun are happy with the shifting of the protest site to Adhoiwala. According to them, the shifting of the protest site far from Parade Ground is a wise decision by the administration as the absence of protesters will prevent the unnecessary traffic jam and disturbance in the core area of the city. “I think it is a big relief that there would be no more protest or rallies in the city every day. I travel from Ajabpur to Rajpur every day and on the days when there is some rally or a protest march; it takes me at least 40 minutes extra to reach my office.

The frequency of protests and rallies has increased in Dehradun in the last two years which causes considerable inconvenience to the common people,” said Shailesh Kandari, a store manager in Rajpur. According to a bank employee Prerna Seth, “I think protest in Dehradun is like a trend that many organisations are following these days here to force the state government to approve their demand which causes problems for the public.

It’s good that the location for the new protest site is far from the city center which will not cause frequent disruption in the city area. Disturbing the whole city for their demands is not fighting for the rights but a selfish act from their side.”

The city magistrate Anuradha Pal has also stated that frequent demonstrations and rallies on the main roads, especially those which are done without any permission from the administration, create an imbalance in the operation system of the city. It causes considerable trouble for the people as well as the police. Therefore, the shifting of the old protest site due to Smart City Project will serve the greater good to the public too, said Pal.

However, some are opposing the decision to shift the protest site away from the city centre. The Shiv Sena state president Gaurav Kumar said that the manner in which the protesters were detained late at night is questionable.

He said that shifting of the protest site away from the city centre is an assault on the democratic right of citizens to protest peacefully.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/locals-of-doon-welcome-shifting-of-protest-site.html

Similarly the employees of general and OBC castes should be promoted retrogressively. The association has set November 15, 1997 as the date in this respect.

The general secretary of the association, Virendra Singh Gusain said that the state government should remove the ban imposed on promotions with immediate effect and should start the promotions in accordance with the order of Supreme Court (SC). He said that the Government should either bring an ordinance or a bill for the purpose. In another demand, the association of general and OBC employees has said that the cabinet subcommittee headed by Madan Kaushik on the issue of roster in reservation should be dissolved.Meanwhile the call given by the association to disrupt essential service failed to have any effect on Thursday. The health, power and drinking water services in the state remained unaffected from the strike. The Uttarakhand nursing services association has threatened to observe complete strike from March 16.

She added that some nurses would return to work when any patient affected by Coronavirus is reported. The association of diploma pharmacists and the ministerial workers of excise department have also plunged into the strike. In view of the ongoing board examinations, the teacher associations are remaining away from the strike. On the demand of implementing the order of Supreme Court (SC), the general and OBC employees are on strike from March 2. The SC on 7 while hearing a Special Leave Petition (SLP) of Uttarakhand government on February 7 had said that the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and reservation is not a fundamental right.

Singh who had been claiming that the State Government would prove majority in the House on Thursday claimed that MLAs’ resignations would not be accepted until they meet the speaker in person and hand over their resignations. The BJP has taken these MLAs hostage and not allowing anyone to meet or contact, the Congress veteran said.

Meanwhile, Digvijay’s nomination did not go down well with his partyman Suresh Pachauri who is said to be upset and reached New Delhi on Thursday to meet senior party leaders. Sources claimed that his loyalists MLAs could also cross vote over overlooking of their leaders.

One of his supporters, MLA Sanjay Shukla from Indore had returned from Jaipur citing personal reasons. The Congress party did not make official announcement of Digvijay Singh’s nomination.

Besides, Phool Singh Bariaya, the former BSP state chief, who had joined Congress party in 2019 has also bought the nomination form for RS polls on Thursday.

110,13-3-20,BJP nominates Prof Solanki as its 2nd candidate for RS polls,"While Congress party’s nominee Digvijay Singh filed his nomination for Rajya Sabha polls, the BJP on Thursday nominated its second candidate for Rajya Sabha polls, Prof Sumer Singh Solanki, a tribal intellectual.

The BJP had on Wednesday nominated senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia as its first candidate in Rajya Sabha elections.

The BJP on Thursday opted for Prof Sumer Singh Solanki, an RSS man, who is active in tribal belt of Madhya Pradesh for years besides working as Assistant Professor at a Government college in Barwani, one of the tribal dominated districts of the region. Prof Solanki is also nephew of former BJP MP Makhan Singh Solanki.

The locals in Malwa-Nimar region, a tribal land, are of the view that Prof Solanki’s elevation in the party is a well-planned tactic from the BJP who was concerned with the emergence of Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti, a tribal outfit with deep connect with the local population.

JAYS had collaborated with Congress party during assembly polls in 2018 which presumably handed the grand old party tactical gains in the tribal home land.

Prof Solanki by his own admission had been active for years in tribal-dominated districts including Dhar, Jhabua, Alirajpur, Barwani, Khargone and others against ‘the campaign being run by non-nationalists’ forces’.

Prof Solanki was penetrating tribal areas in coordination with RSS affiliate organisations including Vidya Bharti, Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad and others.

Meanwhile, the Congress party presently in all sorts of trouble is yet indecisive over the choice of third candidate for RS polls.

Since 22 of its MLAs have submitted resignation from the State assembly, the Congress party has little idea about the strategy to win the third seat. Amid the uncertainty, assembly speaker NP Prajapati has issued notices to 19 MLAs who had submitted resignations through BJP leaders couple of days ago.

The speaker wants these MLAs to be present in front of him personally.

However, bolstered by the rebellion of Jyotiraditya Scindia camp, the BJP has turned on the offensive seeking a floor test on March 16, the inaugural day of the assembly session.

Leaders including Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Bhupendra Singh and Narottam Mishra on Thursday demanded that this Government has slipped into minority and should prove majority on the floor of assembly on March 16.

113,13-3-20,‘Nithalle Ki Diary’ staged at Ravindra Bhavan,"The theatre buffs of the city were served with the delightful collage of Harishankar Parsai’s stories on the first day of 35th National Theatre Festival.

Here on Thursday, the play ‘Nithalle Ki Diary’ was staged at Ravindra Bhavan. The artists with an overwhelming performance left the audience enthralled.

Directed by Arun Pandey, the play was performed by the artists of Vivechna Theatre Group, Jabalpur. According to the director, it is a beautiful collage of Parsai’s stories out of which character Nithala and Nattu were born.

Nithalle Ki Diary is an adaptation from series of short stories by one of India’s finest satirist.

Haria is a caricature of a village boy, indecisive to any profession and hence choosing to be a village idler. The plot is a portrayal of various chapters from his diary. Each chapter is sarcasm on the myriad aspects of our inefficient public administration system. The drama highlights the deteriorating ethics, corruption, and the superstition prevalent in the present society. It represents the way the narrow understanding of religion makes people less unaware of the world as it is.

The play was a classic example of using a bare stage as a set in itself and making it a property for actors. The design of the play was brilliant. The play starts with a high energy and involves the audience with the songs and subsequent comic sequences.

The play uses the classical ‘nautanki’ style of Indian theatre and does justice to it. The acting was far above the bar set by other actors with the character Ram Sewak taking away all the love of the audience by imitating multiple mythological characters in his act.

The best part of the play was the fact that it starts on a light note, raises all the valid political questions and takes the drama to an extremely serious and sensible end.

117,13-3-20,"Cong slams Govt over virus spread, state of economy","The Congress on Thursday accused the Government of “completely failing” in tackling coronavirus and destroying the economy. The party also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being “negligent” towards the health of the people.

Congress said the Indian economy was suffering from “coronavirus” and demanded a detailed statement in Parliament from Prime Minister on the economic decline of the country.

The party alleged the steps taken by the Government in dealing with coronavirus were “inadequate”. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the PM is not speaking a word on economy while Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman does not understand economy.

In a blistering attack on the Government over the economy and the coronavirus fear, Rahul accused Modi of “sleeping at the wheel” and “absolutely clueless” on how to tackle what he called an oncoming “tsunami”.

“PM Modi and his ideology have destroyed the economy. (Finance Minister) Nirmala Sitharaman is saying nothing. I can understand that she understands nothing so she can't say anything. But PM must explain to the nation,” said Rahul.

On the coronavirus pandemic, Rahul said: “There is absolutely no preparation. The Government doesn't realise that the coronavirus is spreading in this country.”

“The prime minister is being casual, actually negligent towards the health of the people of India,” he charged. The government has completely failed in tackling coronavirus, in preventing it, in identifying people (affected by the virus), in quarantining them, and in taking important steps,” Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged.

“This Government runs on knee-jerk reactions, whether it comes to taking economic steps to revive or stabilising the economy and to prevent economic corona from affecting the investors' lifetime savings, or preventing coronavirus from spreading in this country,” said the Congress.

“I dont think a pandemic like coronavirus can be dealt with in this casual fashion. It is really sad the Union health minister is himself a doctor. The Prime Minister is also a doctor of entire political science,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-slams-govt-over-virus-spread--state-of-economy.html

125,13-3-20,JPSC has lost people’s trust: Soren,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today dropped a bombshell in the Assembly saying that the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) is riddled with ‘corruption charges’ and marred with trust deficit. Chief Minister replying to the query made by Poreyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav during calling attention questioned on setting up guidelines at JPSC, Soren said that the State Public Service Commission has lost trust of people.

Soren said, “The reputation and authenticity of State Public Service Commission has been tarnished to such an extent that every morning I pray to God that no one from my family clears JPSC examination as people will doubt that the candidate has cleared the examination on my recommendation.” Soren said that things at JPSC have worsened due to Government’s intervention. He said, “Both the JPSC and State Government have failed to discharge their duties.”

The Chief Minister assured that Government is contemplating on framing guidelines for JPSC and State Staff Selection Commission (SSSC). The Chief Minister’s candid confession on JPSC’s functioning assumes importance as controversies and JPSC have become synonymous.

Recently, on the instructions of State Government the advertisements issued for the seventh, eighth and ninth Civil Services Examination of Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) were cancelled. The Government had decided to put a halt to the exams due to lack of provision for reservation in the preliminary examination. It has also been said that a high-level committee will be formed to deal with the controversies in the examinations so far.

Since the creation of separate State in 2000, the Jharkhand Public Service Commission has conducted only five civil service examinations. The process for carrying out examination of sixth JPSC is going on. CBI probe is going on the first and second JPSC examination.

Moreover, separate probe is being carried out in more than dozen different examinations being conducted by JPSC.

It may be mentioned here that in the Sixth Civil Services Examination, the benefit of reservation was not given in the preliminary examination, which was strongly opposed. Due to the disputed examination, the result had to be released three times.

After this, the State government fixed the minimum marks for passing the preliminary examination and declared 34 thousand candidates successful. Many of these candidates appeared in the main examination. However, the revised result was again issued on the order of the High Court, in which only 6,103 candidates were considered eligible for the main examination. The interviews for the sixth JPSC examination are going on amid protest by various student outfits.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jpsc-has-lost-people---s-trust--soren.html

128,13-3-20,"70,000 youths recruited in Haryana through HPSC: CM","Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said about 70,000 youth have been recruited in the State through Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) in the last five years by adopting a transparent recruitment policy.

Besides, recruitment of 18,218 candidates of Group D have been made in one go in a transparent manner without any recommendations which have further enhanced the faith of people in the State Government.

Speaking in the inaugural session of 22nd National Conference of State Public Service Commissions here, Khattar said that the State Government has also scrapped interview process in Class III and IV category posts.

The Chief Minister said the present State Government has recognized the talent of the candidates which the previous government neglected during their tenure. Apart from this, we have also eliminated the game of ‘Parchi and Kharchi’ in the selection process thus paving the way for meritorious candidates to join Government service.

Khattar said that most of the recruitment made during the previous regimes are facing litigation but contrary to this, as a result of transparent recruitment policy adopted by the present State Government, candidates are being selected in the Government jobs in fair and transparent manner without any irregularities. For this, he also congratulated the HPSC and SSC for adopting such a flawless system.

The Chief Minister exhorted the recruitment agencies to take all out efforts for further bringing transparency in the selection process as this way only they could discharge their responsibility towards building a strong nation. He said that the present State Government has been continuously working towards building a transparent system of recruitment in the State. It is for the first time when the State Government has eliminated the interview process . Apart from this, we are also going to implement another reform under which, the names of only those HCS or Class I officers would be sent to UPSC for selection as IAS officers who would clear the written examination to be conducted by the HPSC.

He said it is the result of the atmosphere being created by the Government in the State that the percentage of candidates passing prestigious examinations like National Eligibility cum Entrance Test ( NEET), JEE and other engineering examinations are continuously increasing. He said that though population wise Haryana is comparatively a small State, yet on an average 40 candidates are clearing IAS exam every year.

Khattar said online system of examination should be introduced as this would not only enable the candidates to take examination nearer to their homes thus save their travelling time but also help in enhancing transparency. Describing cheating as a challenge, he asked the agencies to find new and effective ways to deal with this problem.

He said the present State Government is giving good salary package and facilities to the officers of Class I and II including the Doctors so as to bring brilliant people into the government system which otherwise usually go to the private sector due to want of good salaries. Similarly, during the selection process, local language in which the candidate communicates should be given priority so that he could effectively deal with the people.

The Chief Minister said it is a matter of pride that Haryana is hosting this two-day National Conference of State Public Service Commissions for the second time after a gap of six years. He hoped that the deliberations held here would go a long way in further improving the functioning of the recruitment agencies which would result in increasing people’s faith in the governance.

In his address, Chairman UPSC, Arvind Saxena said that the State Public Service Commissions have the mandate for making competition based selections, provide a secure and stable Civil Service which is necessary for transparent and impartial Governance. He said that in two recent instances, that is the lateral entry scheme for Joint Secretaries level officers of the Government of India and empanelment of Director General of Police for States and Union Territories, the Union Government and the Supreme Court of India respectively reposed faith in UPSC for carrying out fair and transparent selections purely on merit basis.

He said that between 2007-08 and 2018-19, UPSC have developed IT tools to reduce the processing time for direct recruitment cases from 397 days to 194 days. Apart from this, some innovative steps have also been taken to streamline the process for screening applications.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/70-000-youths-recruited-in-haryana-through-hpsc--cm.html

131,13-3-20,"No document required for NPR, says Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha","Allaying apprehensions on laws like CAA, NPR and NRC across the country that led to protests, including violence in the national Capital, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday asserted that “no document is required for the National Population Register (NPR)” and that the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) is not against taking citizenships from any community but it’s about granting citizenship.”

During a reply to the short duration discussion on Delhi violence, Shah said that no document will be required during NPR and suggested that an Opposition delegation led by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad may visit him and sort out all the confusions pertaining to CAA, NPR and NRC. “I am always ready for a discussion,” Shah said.

“I will discuss all these at priority and urged the opposition members to stop spreading false information on these subjects as so many have already lost lives which is regrettable,” Shah said in the Rajya Sabha amidst several interruptions from the Opposition benches and simultaneously treasury benches demanding from the Vice Chairman Satyanarayan Jatiya that the Home Minister may be allowed to complete his speech.

On a query from Congress member Kapil Sibal about mandatory documents, Shah said: “If one doesn’t want to give certain information, no questions will be asked regarding that. There will be no doubtful citizen marking”.

Shah said that under the NPR, it is being said that documents will be asked for, “but let me tell all, no documents will be asked for under the NPR”. “Earlier also under the NPR no document was asked for and so will be the case this time as well,” said the Home Minister prompting Ghulam Nabi Azad to reiterate the Centre’s stand and make it clear.

“Those who don’t have information to produce, for that we have clarified through a press release. Whatever information people want to give, they are free to submit,” Amit Shah said.

“I clearly once again say, under the NPR, no document will be asked for. You don’t have to provide any information you don’t possess. Lastly, nobody will be marked ‘doubtful’. Nobody needs to be scared of the process of the NPR in this country,” Amit Shah said when Sibal questioned about the ‘D’ (Doubtful) category.

The Home Minister also referred to the hate speeches in the country after the citizenship bill was made an Act. “The minorities, especially Muslims, were fed with fear that the CAA will revoke their citizenship,” Shah said without naming the Congress and its leaders’ speech. The first seeds of hate speech were sown on December 14, 2019 at a rally in Ram Lila maidan when a Congress leader gave the call for a do or die situation. “December 16th the Shaheen Bagh started,” said the home minister.

The Home Minister asserted that those responsible for the recent riots in Delhi will be brought to book irrespective of their caste, religion and political affiliations. He said that 1922 faces have been identified using facial identification software.

On the transfer of Justice S Muralidhar a day after his orders on Delhi violence, Shah said that the order is issued by the government on the recommendation of the Supreme Court collegiums and it is not related to the Delhi violence case. “What sort of mindset is that an individual judge can only do justice and others can’t? Shah asked the members of Rajya Sabha.

Earlier in the day, the Opposition panned the government as well as the police over the riots and warned that the spread of the “communal virus” would eventually pose to a threat to democracy.

Taking part in a short-duration debate in Rajya Sabha some Opposition members said the “communal virus” being unleashed by the BJP was “no less harmful” than the coronavirus.

If the “virus” is spread among the youth, democracy will be destroyed, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, initiating the discussion. The Opposition also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged when riots were raging in the nation capital he and Shah were busy “entertaining” the visiting US President Donald Trump.

They also questioned the Home Minister on “inaction” against leaders who gave public speeches to instigate riots in northeast Delhi. Condemning the “delay” in action to curb the riots and alleging intelligence “failure”, several Opposition members demanded a probe by a Supreme Court judge.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-document-required-for-npr--says-amit-shah-in-rajya-sabha.html
132,13-3-20,BJP plans to field former Didi aide as Mayoral face,"Bengal BJP is planning to project former State Minister and Trinamool Congress discard Sovan Chatterjee as its Mayoral candidate in the coming Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections.

A senior State BJP leader said “Sovan da is a seasoned campaigner and can be an asset for the BJP if he chooses to lead the party from the front in the KMC elections… already our all-India president JP Naddaji has been informed about the State party’s views and he is not opposed to the idea of roping him in.”

Chatterjee once a blue-eyed boy of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee quit the party after it apparently backed his wife Ratna in her legal matrimonial battle with Chatterjee.

Subsequently Chatterjee a former Mayor of Kolkata joined the BJP along with his close woman aide Baisakhi Banerjee. However, he distanced himself from his new outfit within months of his joining it following differences with BJP’s observer for Bengal Kailash Vijabargiya.

At present Chatterjee finds himself parked on a “no man’s land” maintaining equidistance from both the outfits though the BJP sources say that he is still a primary member of the party regardless of the distance he is maintaining.

The BJP renewed its effort to project Chatterjee as its Mayoral candidate after the TMC entrusted his estranged wife Ratna Chatterjee with the pre-poll organsational functions from Behala East Assembly constituency from where Sovan Chatterjee is still a sitting MLA.

Though neither Sovan nor Baisakhi would mince words on their future course of action sources close to them they have not as yet made up their minds on whether to take up the responsibility that the BJP is willing to entrust on him.

“There is no formal communication from any side… No decision has yet been taken. Let an opportune moment come then only a decision will be taken,” Banerjee said while Sovan maintained a studied silence. When contacted senior State BJP leader Pratap Banerjee said his party was indeed willing to field Chatterjee as its face in the KMC elections. “Sovan da is a big leader and as far as I know he is stilla BJP member. In that case the only question is whether he will take active part in the elections.

If he does so then the party willdefinitely consider him as its leader in the KMC elections because ofhis experience of running the Corporation during when he was theMayor.”

The leader said a final decision would be taken only after theelections are formally announced by the State Election Commission.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-plans-to-field-former-didi-aide-as-mayoral-face.html

“ Scindia will neither get respect in BJP, nor will he feel satisfied there,” Rahul asserted a day after he revealed his emotions for the Scindia scion saying that he was the person who could visit his house anytime.

Speaking on Scindia’s shock move to the BJP after being in the Congress for years, Rahul recalled his long association with the Gwalior strongman and said there is a difference between what is in his heart and what he is saying. While some senior leaders like Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot have been scathing in their criticism of Scindia, Rahul’s response to his quitting the Congress has been tempered.

“I know the ideology of Jyotiraditya Scindia ji, he was with me in college. I would keep talking to him, I know him well. Jyotiraditya Scindia feared for his political future and therefore kept his ideology in his pocket and went with the RSS. But the reality is that neither will he get respect there, nor will the truth and emotion in his heart be satisfied. He will come to realise it,” Rahul talking to media outside the Parliament.

138,13-3-20,Those revealing identity of patients to face strict action,"Authorities in Pune have warned of penal action against those who reveal the identity of patients testing positive for coronavirus on social media platforms.

Taking cognisance of a complaint from a relative of a Pune-based patient, who tested positive for COVID-19, divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said police have been asked to monitor social media posts and take appropriate action in such matters.

“The police have been asked to monitorsocial media platforms through their cyber cell to make sure that no rumours are spread and the identity of patients should not be revealed,” Mhaisekar said. If the identity of a patient is revealed, the person and his family could face social hardships, he noted.

“So, there is a need to be more socially concerned about these issues. We have been making appeals since day one, but despite that, some people are spreading wrong and misleading information on social media, and we have received one such complaint,” he said.

Mhaisekar said the Pune Police's cyber cell is keeping a close watch on rumour-mongers and those revealing the identity of coronavirus patients.

He assured that appropriate penal action will be taken against such people. A relative of one of the COVID-19 patients on Wednesday wrote to the divisional commissioner, alleging that informationabout the infected person was revealed on social media and this has led his family to face hardships.

“The family is facing a social boycott-like situation”, he said.The complainant sought action against those who revealed the identity of the patient on social media.

139,13-3-20,Rajini wants people to set ground for his political entry,"Tamil film’s super star Rajinikanth, who was expected to make an important declaration on Thursday regarding the launch of his proposed political party made it known that he was not in a hurry and also he would never be the Chief Minister of the State.

“Had I wanted, I would have become the Chief Minister in 1996 at the age of 45. Why should I aspire for a post which I had declined 24 years ago?” he asked while speaking to journalists at Chennai on Thursday. The reigning star of South Indian films asked the people of the State to create an environment whereby his idea of governance and Government could be implemented. “If only the people accept the kind of politics which I want, we will be able to make any change. Otherwise it will be like cooking Chakkarai Pongal (a sweet Tamil delicacy) in the same pot where Meen Kuzhambu (fish curry) had been cooked,” said Rajinikanth.

Explaining the rationale behind his decision not to accept the post of Chief Minister, Rajinikanth said preferred Tamil Nadu to be the role model for other States in the country.

“The Chief Minister should be one who is fully devoted to the matters affecting the State and he/she should not be burdened with other tasks. It was in Tamil Nadu we brought a regional party (DMK) to power defeating the Congress for the first time in the country’s history. My idea of a chief minister’s job is different from that of a conventional political boss. My idea of politics is that the party president and Chief Minister should be different persons.,” explained Rajinikanth.

He also disclosed that more than 50 per cent of the posts in his party as well as the cabinet would be reserved for people below the age of 50 and who has professional qualifications. “We will rope in retired bureaucrats and professionals for advisory jobs. Ours will not be a political party of professional politicians,” he said.

The actor set preconditions for his entry into the unknown terrain of politics. “As on today, Tamil Nadu is dominated by two Jambavans, two entities with all resources available in the world. The AIADMK and the DMK. While the DMK has been out of power for the last ten years, it is bestowed with men and infrastructure. The AIADMK is in charge of public treasury and is in a position to manipulate the way people think,” he said.

According to Rajinikanth, there are 50,000 office bearers working all over Tamil Nadu in both the DMK as well as the AIADMK. “This is the root cause of corruption and I want that system to go. Politics should not be for making money but it should be for public welfare,” he said.

He asked the people of Tamil Nadu to set the agenda and prepare the ground for the revolutionary change envisaged by him. “Then we will think about the politics and governance,” he said.

Maalan Narayanan, Tamil Nadu’s leading author and political commentator who has been tracking the course of Rajinikanth’s political journey, described the actor’s Thursday announcement as a tacit withdrawal from the battle field. “It is like one step forward and two steps backward.

Rajinikanth’s concept of politics is the same that was preached by Mahatma Gandhi but I doubt whether it would materialise in the near future. There is lot of difference between practical politics and pragmatics. I feel chances are that he may end up like his advisor Tamilaruvi Manian, who too harps on value based politics,” Maalan told The Pioneer.

Kolahala Srenivaas, political observer, was blunt in his observation that Rajinikanth would not take any hasty decision. “He has set the ground for his withdrawal from politics. I don’t think people in Tamil Nadu would be able to provide him what he has asked for in return for his entry into politics; revolution, upsurge and wave.

The election is hardly one year away and you would not be able to do anything in this short span of time,” said Srenivaas, who like Maalan was analysing threadbare all moves by the actor.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajini-wants-people-to-set-ground-for-his-political-entry.html
140,13-3-20,Opp warns Govt against Railway privatization,"The Opposition on Thursday cautioned the Government against any move to privatise the Railways and called for bringing back the practice of a separate Budget for the public transporter so that it could get adequate attention. Debating on the demands for Grants in Lok Sabha on Railways, the members appreciated the modernisation and cleanliness of railway stations while raising doubts of entry of private players in main sectors of railways.

MK Raghavan (Congress) said the BJP Government has shown consistent apathy towards railways in the last five years and the dismal performance is visible in the high operating ratio, which is the worst in last 10 years. “Railways is a services sector. BJP is unaware of reasons for establishment of Railways. Railways is not an engine to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, it is for poor man’s service,” he said.

“This Budget is a call for privatisation and eventual selling off of railways which is the lifeline of Indian people,” he said. Opposition members, including Supriya Sule of the NCP and Arvind Sawant of the Shiv Sena, acknowledged that railway stations have become cleaner.

SS Palanimanickam (DMK) accused the BJP government of moving towards privatisation of railways. “Air India is on verge of privatisation, land and sea transports have already been privatised. I suggest just give up the idea of privatisation of railways,” he said.

Palanimanickam said there should be separate Budget which will encourage the Rail Ministry to discuss demands of various railway zones. “Earlier there was separate budget for all zones. The Rail Minister used to hold meeting with MPs to know demands of zones, but now no such meetings take place,” he said. The Government had merged Railway Budget with General Budget from 2017-18 onwards, ending a 92-year-old practice of a separate Budget for the country’s largest transporter.

Tapir Gao (BJP) said the Indian Railways has developed so many facilities that its services are now comparable to those offered by airlines. “Even 60 years after Independence, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram did not have rail connectivity. It is only under Modi Government that railway extended connectivity to every corner of the country,” he said.

Before the House took up discussion of the Demand for Grants of Railways, Speaker Om Birla said the House has to discuss Demands for Grants of six ministries and sought to know from members if they are okay if Lok Sabha proceedings are held on Saturday and Sunday.

As Opposition members and some members from treasury benches were seen not supporting the idea, the Speaker suggested that the House will sit late on Thursday and Friday to discuss them.

In her speech, Sule sought to know what is the status of model stations, a proposal that former railway minister Suresh Prabhu had floated, and demanded clarification from the government about details of privatisation.

Saugata Roy of the TMC hit out at any move to privatise railways and also attacked Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for the move to merge all railway services.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-warns-govt-against-railway-privatization.html

148,13-3-20,"Travel, hospitality industry headed for worst crisis","India’s travel and hospitality industry is headed for its worst crisis with an at least Rs 8,500-crore hit in revenues due to suspension of most visas over fears of spread of coronavirus that would result in lower footfalls and drop in business for tour operators, hotels and aviation industry.

Hotels and tour operators have seen a spurt in cancellations particularly after the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. Tourists cancelled travel, hitting hotels, airlines and tax collections after the government suspended most visas in a bid to halt the spread of coronavirus.

At least 40 per cent of rooms across big chains of hotels are going empty while banquet bookings have been cancelled, industry officials and associations said.

Tour operators estimate January-March quarter earnings could fall by more than 60 per cent.

India, which annually earns Rs 2,200 crore from foreign tourists arrivals, attracts nearly one million overseas visitors a month, a number which could see a drastic fall next month due to travel restrictions.

Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), and Assocham saw job losses in the sectors as companies try to tide over the situation by cutting non-essential workforces and stopping recruitment. They wanted the Government to review the decision to suspend visas for a month and allow inbound travel through limited gateway cities.

“The ban on travel to India for a period of one month will have a cascading economic impact and will lead to job losses in the entire hotel, aviation and travel sector. We estimate that it will lead to direct loss of not less than Rs 8,500 crore,” IATO Secretary Rajesh Mudgill told PTI.

Assocham Tourism and Hospitality Council Chairman Subhash Goyal said since the outbreak of coronavirus, the aviation and tourism industries in India have been adversely affected.

“However, we were able to manage our expenses and keep the staff because some amount of essential travel was going on. The suspension of visas last night has come as an immediate blow to the entire tourism, aviation and hospitality industry,” he said.

Warning of the consequences of the step, Goyal said, “If no visas are valid, within next ten days this travel and tourism industry will come to a virtual stop. It would mean that everyone will cut down costs and terminate non-essential staff and stop recruiting additional staff.”

Expressing similar views, Mudgill said, “In view of the staggering loss that the entire industry stares at, we request the Government to consider a review of the situation after 10 days and also consider giving relief in taxation to the sector as it will help in mitigating the losses suffered.”

Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) Vice President Gurbaxish Singh Kohli said,”Since November, when coronavirus made news, hotel room cancellations began and crossed the 80 per cent mark. New bookings are almost completely on hold, including the NRI segment which accounts for 60 per cent of the tourism revenues mostly in the months from April to September.”

Yatra.Com Co-Founder and COO, Corporate Travel & Head Industry Relations, Sabina Chopra said the latest suspension of visas from all countries to India is expected to have a substantial impact on the foreign tourist arrival in the country which was already witnessing a drop due to the prevailing situation.

“We have received close to 35 per cent cancellation queries from travellers planning their trip to foreign destinations,” she said, adding airfares to affected destinations have dropped by 40 per cent.

Chopra added, “There has been about 18 per cent drop in hotel rates and we are receiving cancellation requests from various travellers who are wary of taking up trips domestically as well.” According CII, this is one of the worst crises ever to hit the Indian tourism industry impacting all its geographical segments — inbound, outbound and domestic, almost all tourism verticals — leisure, adventure, heritage, MICE, cruise, corporate and niche segments.

CII Tourism Committee said to save on variable costs and minimise fixed costs many small and mid-sized hotels, resorts and car rental companies are shutting down operations and asking staff to go on leave without pay.

Moreover, the working capital of many corporates in the tourism sector is seriously hit by almost 60 per cent and for micro, small and medium tourism enterprises by almost 80 per cent, it added.

“Most of the Indian tourism travel and hospitality companies are facing demands for full refunds and they are doing so out of their cash reserves even for which they have paid advance tax and GST,” the CII assessment report added.

The report further said cancellations are “reaching a peak of almost 80 per cent now in March in many Indian locations. The value at risk from this segment will be in multiples of tens of thousands of crores.” With India cancelling all visas, the chamber said the impact “will be worse”.

ANAROCK Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said, “The cancellation of visas for foreigners as well as the strong advice issued to Indians to refrain from unnecessary travel will have a marked effect. This is the most unsettling healthcare crisis in recent times and hotel bookings will go south.”

On Indians being advised to refrain from unnecessary travel, the CII report said, “The December holiday season of 2019 took an estimated hit of almost 40-50 per cent, the holiday season of April to July 2020 is likely to take a humongous hit which could be as high as 80-100 per cent, unless there is positive news of the progression of virus decreasing.

VFS Global Regional Group COO — South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Americas Vinay Malhotra said,”While it is too early to comment on the impact of coronavirus on visa application trends, so far, our visa application processes in India continue on schedule as per the mandates of our client Governments.”

MakeMyTrip Group CEO Rajesh Magow said, “The decision by the Government will have an impact on inbound and outbound international travel.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/travel--hospitality-industry-headed-for-worst-crisis-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/travel--hospitality-industry-headed-for-worst-crisis.html

Stock exchanges have halted trading for 45 minutes.

Manic selling across the globe rendered stocks at multi-year lows.

Continuing its downward spiral, domestic BSE Sensex sank 3,213 points in early trade, plummeting 10.86 per cent to 29,564.58, which triggered the lower circuit limit.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty cracked 966.10 points, or 10.07 per cent, to 8,624.05.

In the previous session, the 30-share BSE barometer settled 2,919.26 points or 8.18 per cent lower at 32,778.14, and the broader Nifty slumped 868.25 points or 8.30 per cent to close at 9,590.15.

On a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 3,475.29 crore on Thursday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

All Sensex components were in the red. HCL Tech was the top loser, tanking up to 15 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Kotak Bank, TCS, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank and NTPC.

According to traders, volatility heightened in global markets as benchmarks world over went into panic mode, insinuating a freakish selloff.

Wall Street lost 10 per cent in its worst session since 1987, while London also had its worst day since that year.

Frankfurt had its blackest day since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell, while Paris suffered its worst one-day loss on record.

Besides selloff in global equities, choppiness in international oil prices and depreciating rupee added to investor concerns, they added.

The rupee depreciated 13 paise to 74.41 per US dollar (intra-day).

Brent crude oil futures dropped 0.90 per cent to USD 32.92 per barrel.

Further, incessant foreign fund outflow also spooked market participants, traders said.

Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai dropped over 3.32 per cent, Hong Kong 5.61 per cent, Seoul 7.58 per cent and Tokyo cracked up to 7.97 per cent.

150,13-3-20,Govt extends deadline to bid for Air India till Apr 30,"The government on Friday extended the deadline for submitting bids for buying 100 per cent stake in Air India till April 30.

The deadline was originally set at March 17.

The government had allowed access to the “virtual data room” of Air India to interested bidders late in February and allowed them further time till March 6 to pose queries.

Home Minister Amit Shah-led ministerial panel on Air India decided on extending the deadline for submission of expression of interest (EoI) by interested bidders till April 30.

While extending the date, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in a notification said “the changes are in view of the requests received from the IBs (interested bidders) and the prevailing situation arising out of COVID-19.”

In January, the government restarted the divestment process of Air India and invited bids for selling 100 per cent of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India's 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

The government had on January 27 issued the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) inviting EoI for sale of 100 per cent stake in Air India.

On February 21, it issued the first set of clarification answering queries regarding the 'confidentiality undertaking'.

Interested bidders for Air India should have a net worth of Rs 3,500 crore.

After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government this time has decided to offload its entire stake. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76 per cent stake in the airline.

Of the total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-extends-deadline-to-bid-for-air-india-till-apr-30-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-extends-deadline-to-bid-for-air-india-till-apr-30.html

As coronavirus-led recession fears triggered panic selling globally, indices plunged over 10 per cent in the opening session, hitting their lower circuit levels.

Stock exchanges halted trading for 45 minutes within 15 minutes of market opening. Normal trading resumed at around 1030 hours.

The last circuit freeze happened in January 2008.

Recovering over 5,380 points from its intra-day low of 29,388.97, the BSE Sensex ended 1,325.34 points or 4.04 per cent higher at 34,103.48.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty settled 365.05 points, or 3.81 per cent, up at 9,955.20. It hit an intra-day low of 8,555.15.

Most Sensex components ended with gains. SBI was the top gainer, rallying over 13 per cent, followed by Tata Steel, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel and ICICI Bank.

On the other hand, Nestle India, Asian Paints, HUL, Hero MotoCorp and HCL Tech ended in the red.

Fears of a global recession spiked, triggering a manic selloff in world stocks, analysts said, adding that the market is concerned about the adverse economic impact of government lock-downs across the world to contain Covid-19.

Bottom-fishing at hammered valuations helped market recover from the day's lows, they added.

In rest of Asia, Shanghai slipped 1.23 per cent, Hong Kong 1.14 per cent, Seoul 3.43 per cent and Tokyo 6.08 per cent.

Bourses in Europe opened up to 4 per cent higher.

The rupee too witnessed a sharp recovery, appreciating 47 paise to 73.81 per US dollar (intra-day).

155,13-3-20,RBI may slash rates by at least 65 bps by June,"Given the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant bloodbath in global markets, including in the country, and plunging asset prices, the RBI will begin to look beyond inflation and start easing rates to the tune of 65 basis points (bps) by June, and the first rate cut could come even before the April review, according to British lender Barclays.

The domestic markets recorded its worst fall in history on Thursday plunging as much 8.2 per cent, while the rupee plunged 56 paise to a 17-month-low of 74.24 to a dollar.

After nosediving over 3,204.30 points on across-the-board selling, the Sensex closed 2,919.26 points or 8.18 per cent lower to 32,778.14, and the Nifty gave up the 9,600-level, slumping 868.25 points or 8.30 per cent to close at 9,590.15.

The rout followed the markets bloodbath across the world after the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. “Growth risks have risen dramatically, while CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation remains outside its target band (at 6.58 per cent in February down from 7.59 per cent in January and 2.57 per cent in February 2019).

“But, given the evolving macroeconomic situation and deteriorating global backdrop, we believe risks of an inter-meeting cut of 25-40 bps have increased materially. Even if RBI doesn’t make an inter-meeting move, we see them cutting by at least 65 bps by June, with risks biased towards more easing than this,” Barclays said in a note on Thursday.

On the timing and the quantum of rates cuts, the report says, “As a pre-emptive step, the RBI could consider at least 65 bps cuts over the next three months, which would peg real rates close to 0, as CPI inflation appears set to decline close to 4.5 per cent by June if crude stays close to current levels.” But, analysts at Barclays are quick to underline that “rate cuts will have little impact on near-term growth without accompanying steps to keep liquidity conditions ample” which it could ensure through increased long-term repo operations (LTROs) or even outright open market operations.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-may-slash-rates-by-at-least-65-bps-by-june.html

The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew by 2 per cent in January against 1.6 per cent a year back, displaying moderate green shoots, official data released on Thursday showed. According to the data from the National Statistical Office (NSO), the manufacturing sector output grew by 1.5 per cent as compared with a rise of 1.3 per cent in the corresponding month a year ago.

However, going forward, the February factory output may be impacted as several industries such as automobiles, technology, pharma and fashion have some exposure to imports of raw and intermediate materials from China.

Retail inflation eased to 6.58 per cent in February, from 7.59 per cent in the previous month, but remained above the Reserve Bank of India’s target band of 4 per cent, plus or minus 2 per cent.

Manufacturing, which is the largest component of IIP having 77.6 per cent weight, continues to be down. It grew at 1.5 per cent in January 2020 and just 0.3 per cent for the first 10 months of current fiscal.

As per use-based classification, out of six sectors four — namely capital goods, infrastructure/construction goods, consumer durables and consumer non-durables — recorded negative growth in January 2020. CPI inflation in February reversed six months of increasing trend mainly due to base effect and sequential decline in food price inflation as well as a dip in transport and communication inflation.

Core inflation, a measure of demand conditions in the economy, also reversed after increasing for three months and came in at 4.08 per cent in February. Between Q1 FY19 and Q3 FY20, core inflation declined to 3.6 per cent from 6.2 per cent and GDP growth declined to 4.7 per cent from 7.1 per cent.

159,13-3-20,"SBI to invest Rs 7,250 cr for Yes Bank rescue","The largest lender State Bank of India on Thursday announced a Rs 7,250-crore fund infusion into the crippled Yes Bank under which it will pick up to 49 per cent equity in the fourth largest private sector lender.

The fund infusion is part of the Reserve Bank-mandated rescue plan.

SBI said its shareholding in Yes Bank will remain within 49 per cent of the paid up capital of the private lender and following the fund infusion, it will pick up 725 crore shares.

“The executive committee of the central board at its meeting held on March 11 accorded approval for purchase of 725 crore shares of Yes Bank at a price of Rs 10 a share, subject to regulatory approvals,” SBI said in an exchange filing on Thursday.

The bank, however, did not mention the exact quantum of stake it will be buying in Yes Bank. Under the reconstruction scheme, SBI will have to buy 49 per cent of Yes Bank and cannot reduce its holding below 26 per cent before for the next three years.

The SBI investment of Rs 7,250 crore is much higher than Rs 2,450 crore it had planned initially for 49 per cent stake in the private sector lender that began operations in 2004.

Last week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had told reporters that the bank would invest Rs 2,450 crore to buy 245 crore shares of Yes Bank. He had also spoken about roping in other investors and SBI investment would not exceed Rs 10,000 crore.

On March 5, the RBI imposed a moratorium on Yes Bank, restricting withdrawals to Rs 50,000 per depositor till April 3. The RBI also superseded the board and placed it under an administrator, Prashant Kumar who is a former deputy managing director and CFO of SBI.

Since the RBI action, the central agencies ED and CBI have arrested Yes Bank’s co-founder and former CEO Rana Kapoor for alleged money laundering and corruption, while his wife Bindu and three daughters are also being quizzed by these agencies for their role in siphoning of public funds.

One of the biggest charges against Kapoor is that he illegally benefitted to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore by lending to certain troubled companies like DHFL, Anil Ambani group and Essel group — all the loans worth around Rs 20,000 crore that have turned into bad debt.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sbi-to-invest-rs-7-250-cr-for-yes-bank-rescue.html

""...The Bank has issued a equity commitment letter to invest Rs 500 crore (the 'equity commitment') in Yes Bank Limited for subscription of 50 crore equity shares of Yes Bank at a price of Rs 10 per equity share,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The commitment is pursuant to the scheme of reconstruction of Yes Bank proposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, it added.

As per the RBI-approved reconstruction plan for Yes Bank, the country's largest lender SBI will pick up 49 per cent stake in the cash-strapped private sector bank by infusing Rs 7,250 crore.

SBI will have to maintain at least 26 per cent shareholding for three years.

ICICI Bank and Axis Bank too said they will invest Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 600 crore, respectively, while largest mortgage lender HDFC Ltd will infuse Rs 1,000 crore.

All the investment plans outlined by these lenders on Friday will be for cash consideration.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the reconstruction scheme keeps at its core the protection of depositors' interest, providing stability to Yes Bank and keeping a stable financial environment and banking system.

162,13-3-20,"From handshakes to kissing babies, virus upends poll campaigning in US","Podiums get sanitised before the candidate steps up to speak. Fist or elbow bumps take the place of handshakes, and kissing babies is out of the question.

Rallies are cancelled, leaving candidates speaking to a handful of journalists and staffers instead of cheering crowds of thousands.

This is campaigning in the age of the coronavirus, when fears of the new pandemic’s rapid spread are upending Joe Biden’s and Bernie Sanders’ campaigns.

The urgency of the issue comes at a pivotal time in the Democratic presidential primary, as Biden is beginning to pull ahead as a front-runner for the nomination and as Sanders is scrambling to catch up.

“If coronavirus has the lasting impact that we all fear it will, it will also dramatically reshape the way a presidential campaign unfolds,” said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

“Politics is fundamentally about leaders interacting with the people who they represent, and if a pandemic forecloses that ability, it changes everything — how you campaign, how you knock doors, how you do events and how you do the retail part of politics.” Tuesday marked the first moment the issue affected the campaigns in a substantive way.

169,13-3-20,"Sanders isn’t dropping out, but where does he go from here?","Bernie Sanders is vowing to press ahead with his presidential campaign at least long enough to debate Joe Biden this weekend, even while acknowledging his deficit in the Democratic race may be insurmountable.

The Vermont senator on Wednesday offered no further details on what his campaign may look like before or after he and Biden — the last two major candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination — spar Sunday night on stage in Arizona.

The only thing on Sanders’ public schedule was taping an appearance on Wednesday’s “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”

And that will continue to raise questions — as unlikely as it may seem less than two weeks after losing his once-commanding front-runner status — about how long Sanders will persist against increasingly daunting odds, especially as the pressure within his own party increases exponentially.

Sanders addressed reporters in Burlington after offering no public statements Tuesday night, when he suffered a devastating defeat in Michigan and losses in Missouri, Idaho and Mississippi.

Sanders noted that he won North Dakota and that the continuing count in Washington state remained close — but admitted he was trailing badly in the race to secure enough delegates to clinch the nomination before the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee.

“While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,” Sanders said, meaning Democrats think Biden has a better chance of beating President Donald Trump in the fall.

“That is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.” He was quick to add that he thinks he’s the stronger choice, and that he could show that during Sunday’s debate. Sanders promised to press Biden for answers about millions of Americans who don’t have health insurance, a criminal justice system he said unfairly targets and punishes minorities and raising the federal minimum wage.

After that, though, Democrats’ desperate desire to defeat Trump could affect his calculus. Should Sanders get out soon, he could save Democrats months of a messy and expensive primary fight. But an early departure would also deprive the party’s most passionate supporters, including many young people, of the one man who embodies the dramatic change they crave.

Sanders also noted that he was winning a greater percentage of young voters while Biden continues to run up the score with older ones.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/sanders-isn---t-dropping-out--but-where-does-he-go-from-here-.html
170,13-3-20,COVID-19 is ‘controllable pandemic’: WHO,"The new coronavirus outbreak “is a controllable pandemic” if countries step up measures to tackle it, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Thursday.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged on Wednesday that the global outbreak of the new coronavirus could now be considered a pandemic — a disease actively spreading globally.

But he told diplomats in Geneva that describing the outbreak as a pandemic should not mean that countries give up the fight to stop it spreading further.

“This is a controllable pandemic,” he said, according to a statement of his remarks.

“We are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it. The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous,” he stressed.

More than 4,500 people have died, according to an AFP tally, while the WHO said some 125,000 cases had been reported from 118 countries and territories.

“To save lives we must reduce transmission,” Tedros insisted.

“That means finding and isolating as many cases as possible and quarantining their closest contacts,” he said, urging states to test every suspected case of COVID-19 in a bid to slow transmission.

“Even if you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and protect health facilities, old age homes and other vital areas — but only if you test all suspected cases.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/covid-19-is----controllable-pandemic-----who.html

It was the deadliest such attack in years on an Iraqi military base hosting foreign troops.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the United States has blamed Iran-backed factions from the Hashed al-Shaabi for similar violence in recent months.

176,13-3-20,ABCs of whole grains,"Today, when people are cutting back on meat, whole grains can make up the deficit with texture, flavour and protein

We all know by now that whole grains are good for us and that we should be eating more of them. Anyone who has dipped a toe (or spoon) into the world of farro, brown rice and quinoa also knows how satisfying and versatile the arena of whole grains can be. But what are whole grains exactly, and which ones should you stock in your pantry? The Whole Grains Council, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, defines whole grains as those that contain all the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the grain seed. When grain is processed (for example, by cracking, crushing, rolling or cooking it), some of those healthy qualities can be stripped away.

Nutritionists have long touted the health benefits of whole grains. Especially today, when many people are cutting back on meat, whole grains can provide texture, flavour and often protein.

Some of the whole grains you might experiment with are amaranth, barley, corn (including popcorn!), oats, farro, sorghum, millet, spelt, bulgur, wheatberries, cracked wheat, quinoa, rye, teff, and brown and wild rice. Besides eating the whole grains whole, consuming things made with whole grain flours is another way to get at the good stuff.

Read labels carefully: Some products might say “made with whole grains” or “made with whole grain flours” but the amount of whole grains in them might be very small. “Multigrain” is another possibly misleading term — multiple grains doesn’t mean that all or even any of them are whole grains. Look for labeling that says “made with 100 per cent whole grains”.

Whole grains can star in a casserole or grain salad, be served up as a side dish, and bolster all kinds of recipes from meatloaves to fritters. The grains are often cooked before they’re used in a recipe, usually in water or broth. They can also be used in baking, both savory and sweet. Whole grains soak up sauces beautifully, and can be made ahead and frozen.

A handful of whole grains to explore:

Brown Rice: Switching to more brown rice instead of white is one of the simplest ways to get more whole grains happening at the table. Brown rice is rice with the inedible outer hull removed but with the germ and outer layer intact. It is more nutritious than white rice, and has a denser, chewier, nuttier grain. It takes longer to cook than white rice, about 45 minutes, and the ratio of water to rice is about 2.5:1.

Quinoa (pronounced keen-wah) has been a star of the whole grain world for quite some time now. Although it might seem trendy and modern, however, it was a staple in the diet of the ancient Incas. Quinoa is actually a seed but is treated and cooked like a whole grain. It takes beautifully to all kinds of seasonings and uses. When cooked, it has a light and fluffy texture, and a lightly nutty flavor. It’s got a high protein count (8 grams in a half cup of cooked quinoa), a nice dose of fiber and is gluten-free.

Millet (actually, a member of the grass family) can be cooked as a cereal, made into flour, served as a side dish, made into pilafs or stuffings, you name it. It can even be popped like corn. It’s rich in protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals, easy to digest, and has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Use millet in soups, salads and stews.

Teff, a mainstay of traditional Ethiopian cooking, is becoming popular worldwide. The grains are tiny, about the size of poppy seeds but they are packed with fiber, iron, calcium and protein. You can use teff in many ways, cooked like oatmeal or polenta or dry cooked in a pan and sprinkled on salads.

Farro is often called spelt in the US, where we are just discovering its charms, but the Italians have been creating farro masterpieces for centuries. The grain originated in western Asia. It is similar to barley, but denser and chewier. Farro is low in gluten, but not gluten-free. There is more than one way to cook it, even on the stovetop. Some people prefer cooking it like rice, with just the right amount of liquid to be fully absorbed. Others cook farro in a lot of water, like pasta, and then drain it.

Bulgur Wheat: A staple in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean regions, bulgur wheat is whole wheat grain that has been cracked and partially precooked. It’s terrific in side dishes, soup, pilafs, casseroles and salads (grain salads and green salads alike). It can be added to meat dishes like kibbeh and meatloaf to boost nutrition and bulk them up. Many people have encountered bulgur as the backbone of Middle Eastern Tabbouleh salad. It is high in fiber, low in fat, with a nice amount of protein and a lovely nutty flavor.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/abcs-of-whole-grains-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/abcs-of-whole-grains.html

178,13-3-20,Fans out as Indian sports go behind closed doors,"The money-spinning IPL mulled a closed-door edition in a desperate bid to avoid cancellation as the deadly COVID-19 sent Indian sports into quarantine after a government directive asked for fans to be kept away from all action to prevent the pandemic from spreading.

“...Ensure that no public gathering takes place in any sporting event. In the event the sporting event cannot be avoided, the same could be done without allowing gathering of people, including spectators,” read an order from the Sports Ministry which caused quite an upheaval through the day.

The directive ensured that the remaining two ODIs between India and South Africa in Lucknow and Kolkata, the Indian Super League football tournament final in Goa, and the last day of the Ranji Trophy summit clash in Rajkot will be played in front of empty stadiums, an unprecedented turn of events in Indian sports.

On the IPL, the BCCI maintained a stoic silence but the Sports Ministry dropped enough hints that the glitzy T20 tournament could be held in empty stadiums too due to the health crisis even as foreign players were ruled out till April 15 following government-imposed travel restrictions. The event is due to start on March 29 in Mumbai.

The Ministry of External Affairs has also advised the BCCI to “not do it at this time but if the organisers want to go ahead, it is their decision”.

In another major development, the All India Football Federation said that the remaining 28 matches of the I-League, including the marquee Kolkata derby between champions Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, are likely to be played in empty stadiums.

This came a day after organisers of badminton’s India Open, starting March 24, decided they won’t allow spectators this year.

Besides, the national tennis federation and the Paralympic Committee of India decided to put on hold all national and state-level championships till April 15, keeping in mind government directions.

The Athletics Federation of India, on the other hand, withdrew invitations to foreign competitors for the Federation Cup but said that the event itself will go ahead in Patiala from April 10-13.

The IPL’s fate would be up for discussion at the event’s Governing Council meeting on Saturday and the BCCI has decided to adopt a wait and watch policy till then. Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya said that events can continue but without the presence of crowds.

“We have asked all the NSFs, including the BCCI, to follow the Health Ministry’s latest advisory, which says public gatherings should be avoided in all events, including sporting activities,” Julaniya said.

“The sporting events can go on but the advisory needs to be followed,” he added.

The government on Wednesday suspended all visas, barring a few categories like diplomatic and employment, in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across India rose to more than 70.

The outbreak, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday, has led to more than 4,000 deaths and left over 100,000 infected globally.

In India, Karnataka and Delhi have declared COVID-19 epidemics. The two states are home to IPL teams Royal Challengers Bangalore (led by Virat Kohli) and Delhi Capitals.

The shooting World Cup and the Indian Open golf tournament are so far the biggest events to have been postponed in the Indian sporting calendar.

Meanwhile, the Indian boxing team, returning from the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Jordan, will be asked to stay “home-quarantined” even though all the members have got the necessary health clearances.

A total of 13 boxers and almost an equal number of coaching staff arrive back on Thursday after clinching an unprecedented nine Olympic slots in the qualifiers which concluded on Wednesday in Amman.

“They will be asked to quarantine themselves at their homes or hostel rooms for a few days. They have, however, been given the necessary health clearances by the Jordanian Olympic association,” Boxing Federation of India’s Executive Director R K Sacheti said.

The coronavirus outbreak has also led to speculation over the fate of the Tokyo Olympics this year. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), however, has insisted that the Games will be held as scheduled in July-August.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/fans-out-as-indian-sports-go-behind-closed-doors.html
179,13-3-20,"Okay with closed-door league, want foreign stars: IPL franchises","(): The government has made it clear to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that any sporting event that has to be held amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak will have to be behind closed doors and the franchises are okay with the idea of the IPL being held with empty stands. But they wish for their foreign players to be made available from the start of the season.

Speaking to IANS, an official of one of the franchises said that with the government making its stance clear and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the coronavirus outbreak a “pandemic”, there is no other option than to play the match behind closed doors.

“See, the gate money is no issue as these things are insured. As for the fans, it is disappointing, but we don’t really have much of an option as we have to abide by the diktat of the central government and even WHO has declared the outbreak a “pandemic”.

“This makes it clear that if we have to have an IPL this year, it has to be behind closed doors. So now, would we rather want an IPL where fans can watch the games on television or we don’t want an IPL in 2020? So, we are okay with that, but the BCCI must sit down and speak to the central government to make an exception and allow the foreign players to come in before April 15 as the IPL loses its sheen otherwise,” the official said.

While there have been rumours that the league could be started in the second week of April, another official said that was a strict no-no as that would mean missing the foreign stars going into the business end.

“The international commitments that the players have cannot be toyed with and the host broadcasters have already made it clear that they are not too keen on double headers. So, keeping the interest of all parties in place, the best option is to have an IPL behind closed doors. The franchises will have to bear the loss that comes with merchandise sales, but that is a nominal amount as compared to the losses that will be incurred if the IPL doesn’t happen in 2020,” the official said.

An official of another franchise made it clear that the BCCI must ensure that they sit down with the concerned governmental departments and ensure that at least the foreign players are handed permission as they are already touring around the world.

“See, the Proteas are already in the country, so as per the directive, they can easily stay back. Also, if you see, the Englishmen are already in Sri Lanka and the Kiwis are playing the Aussies in Australia, so they are anyway on the road. We just need the BCCI to sit down with the governmental departments and get us the clearance so that we can have the IPL with foreign players. The whole tournament will lose its charm if the foreign players are not there. It is the biggest cricket carnival in the world for a reason,” the official said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/okay-with-closed-door-league--want-foreign-stars--ipl-franchises.html
180,13-3-20,Rain washes out 1st India-SA ODI,"The first ODI between India and South Africa was on Thursday abandoned without a ball being bowled due to incessant rain here.

It was the second match in less than six months to be abandoned at the picturesque Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) Stadium because of inclement weather.

Incidentally, that match was also an India-South Africa clash in September last year.

The first ODI of the three-match series was always in doubt after the weatherman forecast widespread rains and thundershowers over the region on Thursday and Friday because of fresh western disturbance over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir.

Fans and organisers had offered prayers at the Indrunag Temple in the hills overlooking the stadium in an attempt to appease the rain gods.

Heavy rain had also lashed the hill town just after the two teams’ practice sessions on Wednesday, forcing the organisers to cover the entire playing area.

If that was not enough, it rained the entire night on the eve of the match.

It was overcast for major part of the day and heavens opened up just before the start. It rained on and off after that, forcing the toss to be delayed and bringing ground staff into action.

The rain was not that heavy but was enough for water to accumulate, forcing organisers to press three super-soppers into action.

But despite working tirelessly, the ground staff failed to clear the ground, forcing the on-field umpires to call off the match.

The cut-off time for a 20-over game was 6.30pm (IST) but the on-field umpires made their final inspection and decided to abandon the match much before that.

The matches are scheduled to be held in March 15 (Lucknow) and March 18 (Kolkata).

The sports ministry has issued an advisory that in case it’s unavoidable to postpone a sporting event, then it is preferable that it be conducted without a large public gathering.

“After holding discussions with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) and Ministry Of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), the BCCI on Thursday announced that the remaining two One-day Internationals of the three-match series of South Africa tour of India, 2020, will be played without any public gathering, including spectators,” a BCCI media release stated.

“The BCCI has been working closely with the Government of India along with Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the wake of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak,” it added.

“The BCCI is making every effort for compliance with the regulatory bodies of the Government of India and ensure the safety of our athletes and valued fans.”

The BCCI will continue to take guidance from the Government of India and state regulatory bodies.

The Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) had confirmed in the evening itself that Lucknow ODI will be held behind closed doors while the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has also put ticket sales on hold with immediate effect, an indicator of things to come.

UPCA secretary Yudhveer Singh confirmed the development to the reporters in Lucknow on Thursday.

“After receiving the government advisory, we had a discussion with BCCI officials and then decided that spectators will be barred from entering the stadium during second ODI between India and South Africa on March 15,” Yudhveer said",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-fans-allowed-for-lucknow--kolkata-odis.html
182,13-3-20,Anushtup keeps Bengal in hunt,"Bengal’s ‘Man Friday’ Anustup Majumdar stood between Saurashtra and Ranji Trophy with a defiant unbeaten 58 as the summit clash entered a tantalising final day with the visitors needing 72 runs more.

Bengal ended the fourth day at 354 for six as Majumdar added 91 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket stand with Arnab Nandi (28 batting, 82 balls), who showed a lot of courage despite getting hit on the finger by Jaydev Unadkat delivery.

Majumdar, who had bailed Bengal out of a precarious position in the quarter as well as semi-final, was the saviour again and got much needed support from Nandi as the duo batted out the entire evening session to keep the match evenly poised going into day five.

The home team was guilty of poor fielding and allowing easy runs to Bengal in the final session where 90 runs were scored.

Harvik Desai at first slip dropped a regulation catch of Majumdar, who was on 10 at that time, and it proved to be a costly miss.

On an absorbing day four, Bengal won the morning and evening session while Saurashtra stayed in the game by taking three wickets in the afternoon.

By day three, it had become clear that final will be decided by the first innings lead and both teams were locked in a fierce battle on day four.

Resuming the day at 134 for 3, Sudip Chatterrjee (81 off 241) and Wriddhiman Saha (64 off 184) kept Bengal’s fight going with a 101-run partnership, consuming 49 overs in the process. They frustrated Saurashtra in the wicket-less morning session, scoring 89 runs in 29 overs. Saurashtra found a much-needed breakthrough in the eighth over after lunch when against the run of play, Chatterjee was caught at short leg off Jadeja.

That allowed Saurashtra to build pressure on the opposition and soon after, Saha’s stay in the middle finally ended after played on to his stumps off medium pacer Prerak Mankad. It was a thick edge which just kissed the off-stump to dislodge the bails.

Towards the end of the afternoon session, left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya crashed through Shahbaz Ahmed’s stumps to make it 263 for six. It was just the kind of session Saurashstra wanted as they conceded only 46 runs in 28 overs and more importantly took three wickets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/anushtup-keeps-bengal-in-hunt.html

The US already bans products made through slavery, but with rights groups saying as many as one million Uighurs and other minorities are held in camps in Xinjiang, lawmakers said forced labor was interwoven into the region’s economy.

“These practices in Xinjiang are one of the world’s largest human tragedies. It remains unimaginable, frankly, that this is happening in 2020,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican sponsor of the bipartisan measure, told reporters on Wednesday.

Rajapaksa, who was elected to office in November last year, had said he cannot work freely because his powers had been reduced. He also faced restrictions as the opposition commanded a majority in the 225-member House.

185,13-3-20,Colours that last,"Fashion designer Nida Mahmood plays with the ajrak printing from Gujarat and a 160 year-old analogue photography technique in her latest sustainable fashion line. By Sakshi Sharma

Our design stories begin with a piece of cloth and we, the designers, romance it,” says Nida Mahmood. For her, fabrics are the most integral part of her design process as they have evolved to be accepted and recognised as an art form. So it is that she resolves her creative challenges through fabrics. It’s the reason that she has launched a sustainable line through a sub-brand called Madam Marigold. It revolves around Indian traditions with a contemporary touch that aims to revive age-old art forms and techniques that do not exhaust natural resources and are long-lasting. It comprises tunics, pants, saris, jackets, overlays and dresses.

The marigold flower has acted as Nida’s muse as it stands for “everything that is Indian,” be it a wedding or a ritual or a new shop. “It epitomises India in several beautiful ways and celebrates its true essence,” says she.

The collection brings Indian simplicity back in the limelight by reviving age-old craftsmanship. In her maiden collection, she has explored the ajrak printing from Gujarat and also worked on a 160 year-old analogue photography technique to expose designs on the garments and prints on textiles and paper. Ajrak, a block-printed cloth with deep, crimson red and indigo blue background, bears symmetrical patterns with interspersed unprinted sparkling-white motifs. The term is derived from Azrak in Arabic which implies ‘blue’ as it is one of the principal colours in it. The colour is the major reason why the designer chose the technique. It’s her “favourite” and she believes that there couldn’t have been a better way to add her personal touch to the collection. She says, “Ajrak printing has always fascinated me, especially the indigo colour that it uses widely. It’s an art form that needs labour of love. As a designer, my work has always been about celebrating India and it’s beautiful culture. Ajrak, hailing from as old as the Indus valley civilisation, allows me to do so. I also feel that this craft has now been declining due to the advent of more modern and quicker methods of printing. Brighter chemical dyes are replacing the natural, muted colours and this slow and careful process of printing this traditional textile is getting lost.”

In Ajrak, the process of dyeing and printing the fabric is repeated again and again with different kind of dyes to achieve the perfect design. How challenging is it to deal with such a slow and time-consuming process and yet balance it with the deadlines? “Yes, it is an extremely tedious technique and requires a lot of attention and care. We coat the fabric with a photosensitive material so that the design and the colours are exposed. The entire process can even take around two weeks to finally come to end. But once it takes shape, every design differs from each other in various aspects. That is the beauty of it,” says Nida.

Eco-sensitivity forms the core of her collection as the techniques used for dyeing, printing and other surface ornamentation are sustainable. Even the process of Ajrak printing is long-lasting as it uses colours from natural elements like turmeric, pomegranate, onion peels, tea leaves, beetroot, hibiscus, marigold, natural indigo and many others. “It is very important to consider the impact of the fashion industry on the land that we are living. This is an eco-friendly brand. We focus on circularity in fashion which promotes minimum waste and an optimum use of all resources. We make sure to constantly minimise the negative impact of any resources on environment,” says she.

While the designer is known for introducing new trends in fashion, what has been her creative process? “I believe in following my heart as a creative person and the only rule is to not have rules. When one doesn’t box oneself in the rules set by society or any industry, one is able to create work that is fresh and has an independent and fresh perspective,” says she.

As the fashion trends keep evolving with every season, a designer needs to constantly update his/her designs. What keeps Nida going? She says, “The love for what I do keeps the light glowing. This is my bread and butter and as an entrepreneur it is imperative for me to work towards achieving mid-term and long terms business goals. Though we nee to be on the toes all the time but there is no pressure. I guess one just slides into the role that I need to play as it is such a transient industry.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/colours-that-last-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/colours-that-last.html

Actor Vaani Kapoor, who is now gearing up for her next Shamshera, says she had a blessed 2019 with War becoming one of the biggest blockbusters in the history of Hindi cinema.

“I had a blessed 2019 with War becoming one of the biggest blockbusters in the history of Hindi cinema. I was fortunate enough to be a part of this film that created so many box office records and entertained the whole of India,” Vaani said.

“Even though I had a small but very meaningful role in the scheme of things. I’m glad people really appreciated how I played my character and I’m thankful for all the wishes and compliments,” she added.

Life has been wonderful, I have learned so much over the period. My parents always made sure that I remain grounded and it’s their upbringing which has helped me reach here. While we were growing up, our parents were very clear between necessity and luxury. Luxury was something which Sunny (Kaushal) and I had to earn ourselves.

Way before Irrfan, Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone cracked Hollywood, veteran stars Zeenat Aman and Dev Anand had starred in an English film titled The Evil Within.

Released in 1970, The Evil Within, an Indo-Filipino drama production, was directed by Lamberto V Avellana, whose best-known films include Anak Dalita and the romance Badjao.

The film also includes several other familiar Indian faces, including names like Prem Nath, Iftekhar, MB Shetty and Jagdish Raaj.

Emily Blunt wanted to be a pop star

Actor Emily Blunt says veteran star Judi Dench talked her out of becoming a pop star.

During her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Blunt revealed that she wanted to be a pop star.

I could have been Britney (Spears),” she joked, noting that her dreams were short-lived because of one minor detail. “I realised I wasn’t good at dancing and I didn’t want to be Britney…I don’t know,” she added.

The A Quiet Place Part II star admitted that she had recorded some songs and even tried dance lessons. “I don’t want to tell you too much because I feel like someone is going to find these songs.

187,13-3-20,The smaller the better,"Here’s how crossover SUVs are making up the fastest-growing class in the automotive industry

Extra-small crossover SUVs make up the fastest-growing class in the automotive industry over the past five years, according to Edmunds data. The segment surpassed the one million mark in number of vehicles sold for the first time in 2019.

Consumers are increasingly attracted to these models because they’re less expensive than popular small crossover SUVs such as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4 but still offer drivers more cargo storage space and a higher seating height than a typical sedan.

Buying an extra-small crossover SUV is not without drawbacks. They typically cost a few thousand dollars more than similarly sized sedans and get lower fuel economy on average. They also sometimes lack features found on bigger crossover SUVs, such as all-wheel drive or power rear liftgates. Still, if you’re going the SUV route, these smaller models can be an appealing choice.

These are five worthy picks for an extra-small crossover SUV, as selected by the experts at Edmunds. All prices below include the destination charge.

2020 HYUNDAI KONA

Starting manufacturer’s suggested retail price: $21,420

EPA-estimated fuel economy: 37-30 mpg combined

The best extra-small crossover SUVs take the sharper driving characteristics of a sedan and add utility. Hyundai Kona is a prime example of this formula done right. Fitted with its optional turbocharged engine, the Kona is surprisingly quick to accelerate. It’s also nimble when going around turns.

Every Kona comes with features that aren’t always standard for this class, such as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The Kona doesn’t have as much rear legroom or cargo room as some of its rivals, but on the whole it’s a great choice.

2020 BUICK ENCORE

Starting MSRP: $24,195

EPA-estimated fuel economy: 26-31 mpg combined

The Buick Encore is a slightly altered version of the Chevrolet Trax. The two vehicles share their engine and most of their underpinnings. The Encore has several key features that set it apart, though, and only commands a small price premium. That upscale yet affordable feel is enough to earn a recommendation from our experts.

The biggest difference is the enhanced interior. The Encore uses higher-quality cabin materials and more sound-deadening techniques to block out wind and road noise. You’ll have to accept sluggish acceleration and limited cargo space, but otherwise the Encore is a smart small SUV choice.

2020 HONDA HR-V

Starting MSRP: $21,940

EPA-estimated fuel economy: 28-30 mpg combined

If you’re finding that other extra-small crossover SUVs don’t provide enough room for passengers and cargo, the Honda HR-V could be the way to go. Its back seat is roomier than the norm, and we’ve found that adults can be fairly comfortable when seated there. It also has special folding seats that allow you to carry long or oddly shaped items that wouldn’t fit in one of its rival crossovers.

Downsides include a somewhat loud and underpowered engine and a touchscreen infotainment system that can be overly distracting to use while driving. But overall the HR-V is priced right, and it’s practical and strong in all the areas a pint-sized crossover should be.

2020 SUBARU CROSSTREK

Starting MSRP: $23,155

EPA-estimated fuel economy: 25-30 mpg combined

Most extra-small crossover SUVs aren’t designed for recreational use. One notable exception is the Subaru Crosstrek. It has standard all-wheel drive to provide extra traction on loose surfaces as well as higher-than-average ground clearance to clear ruts and rocks when out on a trail. The Crosstrek also comes standard with raised roof rails that make it easy to install racks to haul your favorite gear.

The Crosstrek is still a solid pick even if you’re not planning on off-road adventure. It has a smooth ride quality, a roomy back seat and easy-to-use controls. Nearly all Crosstreks sold also come standard with advanced driver safety aids such as forward collision mitigation. Slow acceleration is the main drawback to going with this Subaru.

2020 AUDI Q3

Starting MSRP: $35,695

EPA-estimated fuel economy: 22 mpg combined

Luxury brands are also playing the extra-small SUV game. Audi’s entry is the Q3. It’s Audi’s least expensive vehicle, yet it has many of the traits the brand is known for, such as a high-quality interior, a smooth ride and features such as advanced driver safety features that can help mitigate accidents and reduce driver distraction.

The Q3 isn’t the sportiest model in its class, and its fuel economy is below par. But on the whole, this little Audi shows you don’t need to spend stacks of cash to get a stylish and practical luxury crossover SUV.

Edmunds says: A new breed of crossover SUVs is here. Extra-small crossovers provide close to the same utility as small crossovers but cost less and get better fuel economy.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-smaller-the-better-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-smaller-the-better.html
188,13-3-20,Pandemic hits city’s box-office,"Irrfan Khan won’t be arriving at the big screens in the city with Angrezi Medium, neither will Akshay Kumar’s latest biggie Sooryavanshi (which has been postponed). Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar featuring Parineeti Chopra and Arjun Kapoor will be affected, too. The impact of restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the Capital will be felt at the box office as Delhi cinemas will be shut till March 31.

With the Delhi government officially announcing all cinema halls, schools, colleges in Delhi to be shut till March 31 due to the outbreak of coronavirus, the film trade in the city is bound to feel the impact. After the postponement of Sooryavanshi, massive shuffle of release dates is expected.

“It is going to put a full stop to the forthcoming releases. Delhi is a huge market. If you look at the business of two releases — Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan and Thappad, they were fantastic in Delhi and NCR. Even otherwise, Delhi-NCR is a huge market. The losses will be worth crores. Why would you even want to release when you know that the film will not be released in Delhi? Delhi is a big territory. Producers will now pay attention and think about changing release dates,” trade analyst Taran Adarsh said.

The new announcement will ruin box office takings of Irrfan’s Angrezi Medium (scheduled for March 13) and Parineeti Chopra-Arjun Kapoor’s Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar (March 20). “The producers will strongly think to delay the release. I think they will have to defer releases,” trade expert Girish Johar said.

According to Johar, shutting down of theatres in Delhi will have a “huge impact to potential revenue.” He said, “Delhi is a very important market. It is one of the topmost cities among revenue earners for Bollywood films across the country. In some cases, it is the number one city among all regions and sometimes Mumbai is the number one city. Delhi is one of the topmost crucial markets. If it shuts down theatres, it will have a huge impact on Bollywood’s potential revenue,” Johar said. “We also need to keep in mind that overseas, too, we are losing a major chunk right now, with the US under a lockdown, parts of Europe and Australia also under lockdown. All these are big potential markets. Now, Delhi cinemas will also be closed. It will be a big loss,” he added.

The fate of the Ranveer Singh-starrer 83 (April 10) is also undecided. Other big films slated in the first quarter include the Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Varun Dhawan-Sara Ali Khan’s Coolie No.1, Salman Khan’s action drama Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai, Akshay Kumar’s Laxmmi Bomb, Bunty Aur Babli 2 and Kangana Ranaut’s Thalaivi.

Haathi Mere Saathi, Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, Ludo and Chehre are also lined up in the first half. According to Joginder Tuteja, trade analyst, “Baaghi 3 came at a time when the news about virus arriving in India had just broken. The makers didn’t have the time to react and had to release it over the weekend gone by. Though the virus has impacted the film, we need to credit the massy content due to which it has still done well in its first week and is on course to be a hit.”

Talking about the impact, Raj Kumar Mehrotra, general manager at Delite Cinema, said: “Around 10 to 12 films are doing good business in Delhi-NCR right now. Shutting down the halls will affect business of all these films. By a rough estimate, if halls are asked to shut down till the end of the month, it could even pile up a cumulative loss of around Rs 100 crore in this territory.”

Sanjay Suri, who was set to bring the Oscar-nominated drama Les Miserables to India on March 13, hopes the situation improves soon. “We shall wait for the situation to improve and see if a phase-wise release is possible or not when shutdown is lifted. Safety is most important,” Sanjay said in a statement.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pandemic-hits-city---s-box-office-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/pandemic-hits-city---s-box-office.html
189,13-3-20,No disappointment zone,"Noida Social at DLF Mall of India not only makes you relive Bollywood’s golden era but is also a box-office hit when it comes to food, says Chahak Mittal

There wasn’t much available for people to ‘waste’ their time on during the pre-internet era. Of course, unlike today, there were certainly no web channels to watch films on at one’s own convenience. But there was something special about standing in queues of single-screen theatres to buy the ‘first day, first show,’ tickets which adhered to strict timings. Films, with their dream-like sequences in idyllic locations, were an escape from monotony of everyday life. The Hindi film industry has influenced us in more ways than we can ever realise. And Noida Social at DLF Mall of India gives us a perfect peek into nostalgia.

As one enters the external premises of the cafe inside the busy mall, tired after a day of endless shopping, one notices that the table tops have faces of iconic characters from Bollywood like Mogambo and Mr India. There are posters of classics and blockbusters from the 70s, 80s and 90s on a round pillar. Moving towards the internal premises, one comes across a poster of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, which informs us that it was one of the longest running Hindi films in the history of Indian cinema. A window towards its left is designed like a ‘Box-Office’ panel. The huge hall inside the cafe reminds one of the vintage 80s cinema hall with old seat preferences — the stall, balcony, dress circle and box. It has the touch of a typical Broadway theatre with its red carpet flooring. There are train-like window compartments towards the left, each with a red velvet curtain on its side. I am certainly teleported to an era I haven’t been a part of or have only seen being romanticised in Bollywood films itself. Well, what an irony!

I realise I have admired my surroundings way too much to have ordered even a single dish, the reason why I had come here in the first place. I order Eggs Kejriwal mac n cheese, the first item that grabs my attention in the newspaper-like menu. Meanwhile, I notice yet another addition which further enhances the cafe’s cinema theme — background music. English artistes from the 70s to 90s like Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, Celine Dion, Elvis Presley and more feature on their playlist and their videos play on the screen at the centre. Coming back to food, the Eggs Kejriwal seem like the perfect-looking first dish. I wish it’s the same on the taste front. The spicy mac and cheese, topped with fried egg appears like a lasagna in a bowl. Baked with cheese, I catch the macaroni pasta as I dig my fork into the thick layer. The dish has been cooked to perfection. The egg and cheese on top and the pasta underneath are just the right blend.

Next up is Chaat ke gubaarey. The dish is on my table and I am wondering if I have got the wrong order. It doesn’t look like the way I had imagined it to be nor the manner in which the waiter had described it. The plate full of papdis looks exactly like a typical chaat. The only unusual thing being a white egg-like oval ball on each one of them. I wonder why there are eggs in a papdi chaat. After eating one, I realise that what I have been thinking to be an egg is actually a ball of hung curd. Well, full marks to the presentation as well as the taste as the curd melts inside my mouth like cream. It does not for a moment make you feel that you need to add anything more.

Hummus aur tum, reminiscent of a typical Bollywood film name, makes its way to my table. I initially thought that the dish was a typical hummus pita one. However, this too is a surprise. Two round pita breads are topped with hummus, braised tomatoes, feta cheese, arugula and pomegranates. I polish off the pair of breads with delight and realise that this is one dish that I wanted to eat till eternity. It is certainly the best hummus pita dish I have had.

Till now, I haven’t been disappointed by any item. It is the turn for some drinks. A Cosmo explosion cocktail lands on the table. The drink is a blend of cranberry juice, triple sec, malta orange zest and vodka, which is poured over a candy floss lying inside the glass after it is brought to the table. The floss melts soon enough and the cocktail is ready. I would describe this drink as slightly tart, a little sassy and completely delicious. There have been times when I don’t feel like having a cocktail because it’s not properly mixed with alcohol. Sometimes the juice content is low and at other times, the alcohol is not properly mixed. This one makes me relish a cocktail’s actual taste due to its right balance.

The next is Benarasi Patiala. Social describes it as its most “dangerous combination” of freshly squeezed sugarcane juice with homemade sweet and sour condiments, fresh mint, ginger, organic salt and vodka. It can be drunk as a mocktail too. But I am already so impressed with the place’s cocktail-making skills that I don’t flinch while ordering another one. And this one isn’t disappointing too.

I walk out with a content heart. The place not only makes you relive Bollywood’s golden era but proves to be a box-office hit when it comes to food. Well, you’ll certainly enjoy this show!",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-disappointment-zone-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/no-disappointment-zone.html
190,13-3-20,Pandya felt mental pressure during rehabilitation period,"Flamboyant India all-rounder Hardik Pandya has revealed that he felt a lot of “mental pressure” when his efforts to recover fast from his back injury did not fructify.

The 26-year-old had undergone a successful surgery in October last year to treat an acute lower-back injury, which kept him out of action for six months.

“I missed this atmosphere in these past six months, playing for India and the feeling that you get wearing the team’s colours. That had become mental challenge and there were a lot of setbacks,” Pandya said during his appearance on Chahal TV ahead of the series-opener.

“I was trying to get back to full fitness quickly but that did not work out and there was a lot of mental pressure at that time. But everything went fine, the rehabilitation went well and a lot of people helped me,” he added.

Last month, he was ruled out of the Test series against New Zealand after failing to regain full match fitness but was included

He finally made comeback to competitive cricket by featuring in the Reliance 1 team in the DY Patil T20 Cup, an invitational tournament.

He scored two centuries, the second of which was an unbeaten 55-ball 158 in which he smashed 20 sixes. Pandya said it was an “important innings” for him.

“I had not played a single game for six and a half months. I wanted to make an international comeback so it was very important for my confidence. No matter how much you practice the match situation is always different.”

“So I just kept on playing, my confidence kept improving and the sixes were coming of well. I though if they are coming off well, why should I stop and I keep going. But I never thought that I will hit 20 sixes in an innings,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pandya-felt-mental-pressure-during-rehabilitation-period.html

A day after the sports ministry ordered that fans be locked out of sporting events in a desperate bid to halt the deadly coronavirus spread, an under-pressure BCCI finally relented and on Friday postponed the start of its most glitzy event from March 29 to April 15.

Hours later, the Board also decided to call off India's remaining two ODIs against South Africa in Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18) citing the pandemic, which has led to over 5,000 deaths globally. The BCCI later issued a statement to say that the series will be rescheduled at later dates.

India has recorded more than 80 positive cases, including one death.

Other sports were also in closure mode to ensure compliance with government guidelines.

The remainder of the national football league was officially declared out of bounds for fans, the chess federation and the golf body suspended all action for the next one month, while the fate of badminton's India Open hung in balance after host Delhi's government banned all sporting activity for a month.

The India Open is scheduled to start March 24.

The IPL, which has been the subject of most intense speculation ever since sporting events began taking a hit because of the virus, will have a meeting of its Governing Council in Mumbai on Saturday where the officialdom will thrash out the league's format in view of the changed schedule.

A decision to have it in empty stadiums is also likely to be ratified at the meet.

""The BCCI is concerned and sensitive about all its stakeholders, and public health in general, and it is taking all necessary steps to ensure that, all people related to IPL including fans have a safe cricketing experience,"" read a statement from Board Secretary Jay Shah.

There is a possibility that the tournament will feature more double-headers than previously planned and at least five optional venues are being kept ready after state governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka along with Delhi refused permission for the games.

Some of the alternate venues that will be kept ready include Lucknow, Rajkot, Indore, Raipur, Visakhapatnam for these franchises.

In case of a closed-door event and restricted public appearances by players, the franchises are bound to lose out on a lot of sponsorship money as well as the gate collections.

Star Sports, which has paid a whopping Rs 16,347 crore for five years (nearly Rs 5500 crore per year) for broadcast rights, might re-negotiate the deal with the BCCI in case of a curtailed IPL.

Elsewhere, all the remaining 28 matches of the I-League, including Sunday's marquee Kolkata derby between champions Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, were made off-limits for fans by the All India Football Federation.

The decision was taken after the AIFF and I-League officials had a Skype meeting with club representatives.

In another development, top shuttlers from across the world hit out at the Badminton World Federation (BWF) for taking the novel coronavirus outbreak ""too lightly"" and putting them at ""risk"" by going ahead with its international tournaments.

International stars, including London Olympics bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal, former World No.1 Kidambi Srikanth and ex-top 10 players such as Hans-Kristian Vittinghus, Paruapalli Kashyap and Jan O Jorgensen expressed their concerns and asked the BWF to suspend all its upcoming tournaments.

""I honestly don't get it! We should not be travelling the world playing badminton,"" Denmark's Vittinghus, a former World No.8, said in a post on his social media accounts.

Internationally, England's ongoing tour of Sri Lanka was abandoned, while the Australian women's limited overs tour of South Africa, starting on March 22, was called off.

Australian fast bowler Kane Richardson created a flutter by undergoing tests for COVID-19 but was cleared.

The right-arm pacer, who returned with the Australian team from South Africa earlier this week, had informed the medical staff of a sore throat on Thursday and was then sent for precautionary testing.

Across the border in Pakistan, nine foreign cricketers, including the English trio of Jason Roy, Alex Hales and James Vince, decided to leave the Pakistan Super League and return home owing to the pandemic.

England players Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Tymal Mills, Liam Dawson, Liam Livingstone, Lewis Gregory, James Vince, West Indian Carlos Braithwaite, South African Rilee Roussouw and James Foster (Coach) will be returning home from the PSL.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-stumps-ipl--bcci-pushes-start-date--postponements-galore-in-other-sports-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/covid-19-stumps-ipl--bcci-pushes-start-date--postponements-galore-in-other-sports.html
193,13-3-20,"India reports first coronavirus death as positive cases rise to 74; Delhi shuts schools, theatres","India reported its first death due to coronavirus on Thursday as the number of positive cases soared to 74, with authorities taking emergency measures to contain its spread like shutting down schools, colleges and cinema halls in the national capital and some other places.

The Union health ministry confirmed that a 76-year-old man from Kalaburagi in Karnataka, who died on Tuesday, was infected with coronavirus.

Samples of the man, who had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, ""has been confirmed for #COVID19"", Karnataka Health Minister B Sriramulu said.

""The necessary contact tracing, isolation & other measures as per protocol are being carried out,"" he tweeted.

Fourteen fresh cases have been reported from several states, including nine from Maharashtra, the Union health ministry said on Thursday.

As the Centre and the states ramped up their efforts to tackle novel coronavirus, which has claimed at least 4,600 lives globally and affected nearly 125,293, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the countrymen not to panic and asserted that the government was fully vigilant.

Apart from directing the Union ministers not to travel abroad in the upcoming days, Modi also urged people to avoid non-essential travel, saying,""we can break the chain of spread and ensure safety of all by avoiding large gatherings.""

A day after it suspended all visas, except a few categories such as diplomatic and employment, till April 15, the government also announced that three planes will be sent in the next three days to bring back Indians stranded in Iran, one of the worst coronavirus-hit country.

Asking people not to panic, the Union health ministry said no community transmission of the virus has been observed and there has only been cases of local transmission so far.

With the novel coronavirus being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation, Raman R Gangakhedkar, the head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I, a division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said even though the virus is difficult to isolate, scientists at the National Institute of Virology in Pune have been successful in finding about 11 isolates, but developing a vaccine will take at least one-and-a-half to two years.

The total number of 74 patients in India includes 16 Italians and one Canadian. The figure is inclusive of three patients from Kerala who were discharged last month following recovery.

Giving a state-wise breakup, the ministry said Delhi reported six positive cases and Uttar Pradesh 10. Karnataka has four cases, Maharashtra 11 and Ladakh three.

Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab have reported one case each. Kerala has recorded 17 cases, including three patients who were discharged last month.

Lav Aggarwal, the Joint Secretary in the ministry, said 1,500 people who came in contact with these 74 infected people were under rigorous observation while over 30,000 people across the country were under community surveillance.

Meanwhile, the Delhi government declared coronavirus an epidemic and said all those schools and colleges where exams are over should be shut down as also cinema halls till March 31.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting attended by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, LG Anil Baijal and top government officials.

Disinfecting all public places, including government and private offices and shopping malls has been made compulsory, Kejriwal said.

Uttarakhand and Manipur governments also announced closure of schools till March 31.

On its part, defence ministry has set up seven more quarantine facilities, especially for Indian citizens being brought to back from the coronavirus-hit countries, an official said. The facilities have been set up at Jaisalmer, Suratgadh, Jhansi, Jodhpur, Deolali, Kolkata and Chennai.

The Army is already operating a quarantine facility in Manesar while the one in Hindon, near Ghaziabad, is being operated by the air force.

Asserting that the focus is on preventive approach, and adequate testing facilities have been made available, Aggarwal said India presently has around 1 lakh testing kits and more testing kits have been ordered.

About evacuation measures undertaken so far, Aggarwal said till now, India has evacuated 948 people from the coronavirus-affected countries.

Of these, 900 were Indians and 48 belonged to different nationalities including from the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, the USA, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru, he said.

Aggarwal said the government has made 52 laboratories functional for testing samples while 57 labs have been designated for helping in sample collection to enhance diagnosis and detection capacity of the disease.

The health officials also said that India's efforts to deal with coronavirus are in consonance with WHO and the focus is on preventive approach.

The government has stepped up vigil and following a strong contact tracing system to ensure anyone who has come in touch with the infected are not missed out, they said, adding till now, 11,14,025 people have been screened at 30 designated airports in India.

Asked whether high temperature kills the coronavirus, officials said there was no study or evidence till now to suggest that.

As the contagious disease with flu-like symptoms spread across the globe, the cabinet secretary on Wednesday said states and Union Territories should invoke provisions of section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, so that all advisories issued by the Union health ministry and state governments are enforceable.

Meanwhile, the External Affairs Ministry has advised against holding this year's IPL edition in wake of the coronavirus scare, but left it to the organisers to take a final call on it.

This was stated by MEA Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi who has been appointed as the nodal officer to coordinate efforts to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

India has suspended all visas, except for a few categories such as diplomatic and employment, till April 15 in a bid to contain the spread of respiratory virus, according to a revised travel advisory. Visa-free travel facility granted to Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) card holders is also kept in abeyance till April 15, according to the advisory issued on Wednesday.

It said, any foreign national who intends to travel to India for compelling reason may contact the nearest Indian Mission and that all incoming travellers, including Indian nationals, arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after February 15 will be quarantined for a minimum 14 days.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-reports-first-coronavirus-death-as-positive-cases-rise-to-74--delhi-shuts-schools--theatres-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-reports-first-coronavirus-death-as-positive-cases-rise-to-74--delhi-shuts-schools--theatres.html

198,13-3-20,India still best travelling team in Test: Lara,"West Indies legend Brian Lara feels that India are still the best travelling team in Test cricket despite their recent 2-0 defeat in New Zealand. India had lost the first Test by 10 wickets and the second by seven with their batting lineup looking all at sea in all four innings.

Lara considers what happened in New Zealand an “aberration.”

“I think India have been travelling very well in the last ten or so years. What happened in New Zealand, I think it's more of an aberration, I think coming off so much one-day and T20 cricket, it might have been tough for them in the Test arena outside of India. But I think India is still maybe the best travelling team in the world,” Lara told ESPNCricinfo.

Lara said that West Indies and India would be two teams that Australia will be worried about the most at the T20 World Cup later in the year. “In terms of a team, obviously I want to see the West Indies go all the way and win,” said Lara.

“India, with the fact that they produce so much international cricketers through their league (Indian Premier League) has enhanced every single player who plays for India. I mean KL Rahul is my favourite player in the world, I love watching him and I think India is going to be a force to reckon with.

“Australia at home… it’s not going to be an easy World Cup for anyone. Australia is going to be worried about India and the West Indies, West Indies are going to be worried about everybody because of their inconsistency sometimes. So it’s going to be a great World Cup to look at.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-still-best-travelling-team-in-test--lara.html

200,13-3-20,Lakshya out of All England,"Rising Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen was knocked out of the All England Championships after losing in straight games to Victor Axelsen here on Thursday.

Lakshay went down to the world number seven Dane 17-21, 18-21 in a hard fought second round battle which lasted 45 minutes.

The 18-year old Indian, who won five titles last season, had defeated Hong Kong’s Cheuk Yiu Lee 17-21, 21-8 21-17 in the opening round.

On Wednesday night, star Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal’s chances of qualifying for the Olympics took a hit after she made a first-round exit, following a loss to Japanese nemesis Akane Yamaguchi.

201,13-3-20,Ney-marvellous,"Paris Saint-Germain players celebrated with supporters gathered outside the ground after Neymar set them on their way to a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors on Wednesday, taking them through to the Champions League quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate.

PSG needed to overturn a 2-1 defeat in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Germany, but Neymar’s 28th-minute header put them ahead on the night in the second leg amid a surreal atmosphere, as banned supporters congregated outside the Parc des Princes instead.

Juan Bernat then deflected in a Pablo Sarabia assist to make it 2-0 and PSG — for whom Kylian Mbappe was only fit enough to appear as a substitute — go through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2016. Dortmund finished the night with 10 men after Emre Can was sent off.

This game was played behind closed doors after the French government banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to the coronavirus outbreak, but many still came together outside.

Those supporters brandished flares as the team bus arrived before the game and sang and set off fireworks throughout the match.

PSG players rushed to a concourse at the back of the stadium to celebrate with them at the end of the game after breaking a run of three straight exits in the first knockout round of the competition.

“We played like a team. It was a pleasure to be their coach tonight,” PSG coach Thomas Tuchel told broadcaster RMC Sport.

“The atmosphere was great coming here in the bus, with all the ultras singing. We were all singing together and it was a special atmosphere.

“It needed a huge effort from us, playing without spectators made it all the more difficult.”

Neymar was caught on camera in tears after the match, having shaken off desperate disappointment in the competition in the last two years, with injury preventing him from playing in the second leg against Real Madrid at this stage in 2018 and in both legs against Manchester United last season.

Dortmund were disappointing, though, with Erling Braut Haaland never looking like repeating his first-leg heroics when he netted twice.

Their defender Mats Hummels admitted his team struggled with the atmosphere, saying: “It was really bizarre, but for both teams. The start of the game was really strange, like a friendly.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ney-marvellous.html

203,13-3-20,LIVERPOOL OUT,"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone defended his side’s approach after dumping Liverpool out of the Champions League with a 3-2 victory after extra time at Anfield to progress to the quarter-finals, winning 4-2 on aggregate.

The holders looked to have ended Atletico’s dogged resistance when Roberto Firmino put them ahead in the last-16 tie after Georginio Wijnaldum’s first-half header forced the second leg into an extra 30 minutes.

However, Liverpool were made to rue a host of missed chances to kill the tie off in 90 minutes as Llorente twice curled home from outside the box before Alvaro Morata twisted the knife by breaking away to score in added time of extra time.

Defeat ends Jurgen Klopp’s proud record of never losing a two-legged European tie as Liverpool manager and he took a swipe of Atletico’s defensive tactics.

“The way they play, I don’t get it,” said Klopp. “They could play proper football but they stand deep and have counter-attacks.”

It remains to be seen if and when Atletico will play in the last eight due to the chaos caused across the continent by the new coronavirus.

But Simeone basked in another famous European night for the side he has twice led to the final in his eight years in charge.

“We play to win, with the arms that we have,” said Simeone. “Respecting our identity, the characteristics of our players and exploiting the defects of our rivals.”

Oblak ‘best in world’

A packed Anfield played its part in trying to roar Liverpool onto another Champions League conquest as, unlike in numerous countries across Europe, no restrictions have so far been put on supporters attending games in the United Kingdom.

But it was the nearly 3,000 travelling fans in attendance, that celebrated a stoic rearguard display from their side.

The European champions did not manage a single shot on target in a 1-0 defeat in Madrid three weeks ago, but Jan Oblak was quickly put to work.

But Oblak was helpless as Liverpool levelled the tie just before half-time through Wijnaldum’s powerful downward header.

The goal did not change Atletico’s approach as they played a risky game and relied on Oblak to keep them in the game.

The Slovenian saved from Mohamed Salah, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Firmino, while Andy Robertson hit the bar as Liverpool missed a number of chances that ultimately came back to cost them.

“I have no doubt Oblak is the best goalkeeper in the world,” added Simeone.

Despite Liverpool being on the brink of a first Premier League title in 30 years, their number nine Firmino had not scored at home all season until four minutes into extra-time.

The Brazilian’s header from Wijnaldum’s cross came back off the post and perfectly back into his path to slot home with Oblak grounded.

“Everybody who saw the game tonight knows it could have been different,” said Klopp. “I loved our first 90 minutes, but we scored the second goal too late.”

However, no sooner had Liverpool gone in front for the first time in the tie than Atletico hit back with a sucker-punch.

The visitors had barely tested stand-in Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian, but the loss of Alisson Becker to a hip injury eventually proved Liverpool’s downfall.

Adrian fired a simple clearance straight to Joao Felix, who fed Llorente and he found the bottom corner.

“The pass was not helpful. Adrian is a super player, I love the boy, but in this moment, it is the wrong decision,” added Klopp.

Llorente had joined Atletico from bitter rivals Real Madrid in a controversial move in June.

But the man whose father and great uncle, Francisco Gento, also played for Real, made himself a Rojiblanco hero with a second that secured Atletico’s place in the last eight with another precise low finish in added time at the end of the first half of extra time.

Another former Real player Morata then broke away and finished calmly to inflict Liverpool’s first Champions League home defeat since 2014.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/liverpool-out-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool-out.html
204,13-3-20,NBA says virus hiatus will likely last,"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday night that the league's hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic will likely last at least a month, or roughly what would have been the remainder of an uninterrupted regular season.

“What we determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 days,"" Silver said on TNT's ""Inside The NBA"" while making his first public comments since the league suspended play Wednesday night after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, or COVID-19. A second Jazz player, Donovan Mitchell, said Thursday that he has also tested positive.

Later, in an open letter to NBA fans, Silver said “we intend to resume the season, if and when it becomes safe for all concerned.""

Silver did not say if the league intends for the regular season to resume or if the NBA, should it return to action, would immediately go into postseason play. It's also unclear if play will be able to resume with fans in the stands, something the league's owners were willing to go without prior to Gobert's diagnosis and the escalation of the situation. The 30-day minimum hiatus would mean no games until at least April 10.

Silver said the league and the players association will have to continue determining “what makes sense here without compromising anyone's safety and I think it's frankly too early to tell,"" Silver said.

The regular season was to go until April 15, with the playoffs scheduled to start on April 18 and the NBA Finals to begin June 4.

The NBA's 30-day plan was decided on the same day that Major League Soccer announced a 30-day shutdown in response to the virus, that Major League Baseball said opening day would be delayed at least two weeks and the NHL began what it called a “pause"" in its season.

“This literally changes hour-by-hour in terms of what we know,"" Silver said. Silver was also asked on TNT if the season may be over. “Of course it's possible,"" Silver said.

“I just don't know more at this point.""

Meanwhile, NBA great and longtime commentator Charles Barkley was not on the “Inside The NBA” broadcast Thursday night and revealed that he is self-quarantining for 48 hours because he has not felt well since a recent trip to New York.

Barkley said he has been tested for COVID-19 and has not yet received the results. “This thing is so scary,” Barkley said.

For now, NBA players have been told to remain in their home market through at least Monday — some teams such as the Toronto Raptors that are self-quarantining would, in theory, need to remain place for longer — and speak to a team physician or team athletic trainer once daily. Group workouts and practices are not being permitted yet.

In most cases the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus; in mild cases it can take about two weeks, in more severe cases it can take 3-6 weeks.

“This remains part of a complicated and rapidly evolving situation that reminds us that we are all part of a broader society with a responsibility to look out for one another,” Silver wrote. “That is what the NBA will continue to do, and we are grateful for your understanding and for being the best fans in sports.”

There are 259 games left unplayed on this season's schedule. If the regular season is not resumed, that would be the second-largest number of games missed in league history.

The 2011-12 season was shortened by a total of 240 games because of a lockout that wound up trimming 16 games from each team's schedule. The 1998-99 season lost 464 games because of another lockout where teams wound up playing a 50-game schedule.

Shutting down could cost the league hundreds of millions in revenue such as tickets sold, concessions and purchases of souvenirs and merchandise — adding to the financial concerns of a year where the league lost as much as $400 million, by its own estimate, after a rift last fall that started with a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.

It also could cost players as well.

What is called a “Force Majeure Event” — the legal term for unforeseeable circumstances, such as an epidemic or pandemic — could come into play. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, players could lose 1.08% of their annual salary for each game missed.

That means Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, the league's highest-paid player this season, could lose about $435,000 for each game that ultimately is not played. A player who had a two-way contract converted to a regular NBA deal for this season would stand to lose about $9,700 per game.

Also Thursday, the NBA 2K League announced that its scheduled March 24 start would be delayed and that its teams would “compete in preseason tournaments remotely” to prepare for the season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nba-says-virus-hiatus-will-likely-last--at-least--a-month-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nba-says-virus-hiatus-will-likely-last--at-least--a-month.html

According to an order issued by the Union Territory's home secretary Shaleen Kabra, the PSA ordered by the district magistrate of Srinagar on September 15 and subsequently extended for three months on December 13, stands revoked.

Abdullah was under preventive detention since August 5 last year, the day the Centre abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. He was the first chief minister against whom the PSA was invoked.

The stringent Act was slapped against him on September 15, hours before the Supreme Court was to hear a petition by MDMK leader Vaiko who claimed that Abdullah had been illegally detained.

211,13-3-20,Nirbhaya convict Vinay Sharma moves HC claiming procedural lapse in mercy plea rejection,"One of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, on Friday approached the Delhi High Court claiming that there were procedural lapses and ""constitutional irregularities"" in the rejection of his mercy plea by President Ram Nath Kovind.

The petition on Sharma's behalf was moved by his lawyer A P Singh who said the matter has been filed in the high court registry.

The plea claims that the recommendation sent to the President to reject the mercy plea did not contain the signature of Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain.

Vinay's mercy plea was rejected by the President on February 1.

According to the petition, when the issue was raised before the Supreme Court, the Centre had contended that Jain's signature was obtained on Whatsapp.

It further claims that when the mercy plea was moved the model code of conduct (MCC) was in force and Jain was only a MLA candidate at that point of time as polls had been announced and therefore, he could not have exercised the power of Home Minister.

""To reject the mercy petition, the powers used are illegal, unconstitutional, a miscarriage of justice and also miscarriage of constitutional values of Election Commission of India,"" the petition has alleged.

The plea seeks an ""order of direction in the nature of a certiorari in connection with the Constitutional irregularities that occurred during the MCC in National Capital Territory of Delhi by the respondents/concerned responsible persons. Please (take) appropriate legal cognisance on the petitioner's petition as soon as possible, because the motto of our Constitution is access to justice for all"".

A Delhi court on March 5 issued death warrants for execution of the four convicts -- Vinay (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan Kumar Gupta (26) -- on March 20.

Nirbhaya is the name given to the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who was raped and brutally assaulted in a moving bus in Delhi by six people in December 2012.

She had boarded the nearly vacant bus in Munirka in South Delhi along with her male friend on her way back home on December 16 that year. After raping and brutalising the woman and beating her friend, the assailants had thrown them out of the bus.

After receiving initial treatment in New Delhi for a few days, she was shifted to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, where she succumbed to injuries on December 29, 2012.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-convict-vinay-sharma-moves-hc-claiming-procedural-lapse-in-mercy-plea-rejection-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-convict-vinay-sharma-moves-hc-claiming-procedural-lapse-in-mercy-plea-rejection.html

213,13-3-20,Unnao rape case: Delhi court sentences expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar to 10 years in prison,"A Delhi court on Friday sentenced expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar to 10 years' imprisonment in the custodial death case of Unnao rape victim's father.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma directed both Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his brother Atul Singh Sengar to pay Rs 10 lakh each as compensation to the victim's family.

The victim's father had died in judicial custody on April 9, 2018.

The court had on March 4 convicted Kuldeep Singh Sengar for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the death of the Unnao rape victim's father.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was convicted by the court along with seven others in the case, had denied any involvement in the death of victim's father and had asserted that he has done no wrong.

On December 20 last year, Kuldeep Singh Sengar was sentenced to jail for ""remainder of his natural biological life"" in a separate case for raping the woman in 2017 when she was a minor.

Along with Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the then in-charge of Makhi Police Station Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then sub-inspector K P Singh, the court had held -- Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh, Shashi Pratap Singh, Suman Singh and Atul (Sengar's brother) -- guilty of committing offence under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The other sections read with it are 166 (public servant disobeying law to cause injury to a person), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document to cause injury), 193 (false evidence), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record to save person from punishment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC.

The court, however, had acquitted other accused -- constable Amir Khan, Shailendra Singh, Ram Sharan Singh and Sharadveer Singh -- giving them the benefit of doubt.

The CBI had examined 55 witnesses in support of the case and the defence had examined nine witnesses.

The court had recorded the statements of the rape victim's uncle, mother, sister and one of her father's colleague who had claimed to be an eyewitness to the incident.

According to the CBI, on April 3, 2018, there was an altercation between the rape victim's father and one Shashi Pratap Singh.

The charge sheet filed on July 13, 2018, said the victim's father and his co-worker were returning to their village, Makhi, when they asked Singh for a lift.

When Singh denied, an altercation ensued among them, the CBI had alleged.

Singh called his associates, following which Kuldeep Singh Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar reached the spot along with others and beat up the woman's father and his co-worker, the CBI claimed.

The woman's father was subsequently taken to the police station by them where an FIR was lodged against him and he was arrested.

The charge sheet said that all this while, Kuldeep Singh Sengar was in touch with the district police superintendent and Bhadauria.

Later, he also spoke to the doctor who examined the rape victim's father.

The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1 last year.

In July, 2019 a truck had rammed into the car the rape victim was travelling in with some family members and her lawyer. Two of her aunts died in the incident.

She was airlifted from a hospital in Lucknow and brought to AIIMS in Delhi.

They said India has evacuated 1,031 people, including from Maldives, US, Madagascar and China.

The Centre has also decided to allow international traffic only through 19 border checkposts out of 37 and continue the suspension of Indo-Bangladesh cross border passenger trains and buses till April 15, or earlier, if so decided.

Officials disclosed that 42,000 people across the country are under community surveillance.

Taking stock of the situation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a video conference of SAARC leaders to chalk out a joint strategy and set an example for the world.

""Our planet is battling the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. At various levels, governments and people are trying their best to combat it,"" Modi said on Twitter.

South Asia, which is home to a significant number of the global population, should leave no stone unturned to ensure that the people are healthy, he said.

Amid speculation over the ongoing Budget Session being shortened, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told PTI, ""There is no question of curtailing the session.""

While states such as Karnataka, Odisha, Delhi and Bihar went into virtual shutdown mode, the under-pressure BCCI suspended the start of this year's IPL cricket tournament from March 29 to April 15.

""The Board of Control for Cricket in India has decided to suspend IPL 2020 till 15th April 2020, as a precautionary measure against the ongoing Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) situation,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.

The statement made it clear that it's a ""suspension"" and ""not postponement"", which means there is no clarity on whether the event will start on April 15.

Even if it starts on April 15, it is expected to happen behind closed doors without the fans.

The decision came hours after the Delhi government, which on Thursday announced that schools, colleges and cinema halls would be closed till March 31, sad it was also stopping all sports gatherings, including IPL 2020.

Sisodia said district magistrates have been asked to ensure that all directives pertaining to coronavirus are implemented.

A day after the country's first coronavirus death was reported from Kalaburagi in the state, the Karnataka government announced a

Lock-down of malls, cinema theatres, pubs and night clubs for a week.

Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa also issued instructions to stop all kinds of exhibitions, summer camps, conferences, marriage events and birthday parties.

""We will close all universities for a week in the entire state,"" he told reporters.

Tech giant Google confirmed that an employee of its Bengaluru office, who had returned from Greece, was diagnosed with COVID-19.

In Kalaburagi town, 46 people who were in direct contact with the 76-year old man who died on Tuesday night were placed under quarantine, district officials said, adding that 31 were categorised as ""high risk"" and 13 as ""low risk"".

Four family members of the man have displayed flu symptoms and their swab samples have been sent for testing.

In Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government announced that educational institutions would be closed till March 31 but provided an exception for holding exams.

He said the government has earmarked Rs 200 crore to combat the coronavirus threat and declared COVID-19 a ""disaster"".

Non-essential official gatherings such as seminars, workshops and conferences are to be cancelled, Patnaik said. Social gatherings and assemblies like religious functions, marriage receptions and parties will be regulated by local authorities.

Cinema halls, swimming pools and gyms in the state will be closed as well.

Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia suspended classes in Delhi. Other universities such as Jindal University in Sonepat in Haryana announced the university would be open but there would be no classes till March 29.

As concern mounted, people scrambled to change their travel plans. At an Air India office in Delhi, for instance, there were crowds of people waiting to change their tickets.

Aviation watchdog DGCA has asked international airlines to consider waiving ticket cancellation and reschedule charges or look at providing any other incentives.

States which had not reported any case were also on alert.

Schools, colleges, coaching institutes, zoos and parks in Bihar will be shut till March 31 over the coronavirus threat, an official said.

Vishwajit Rane, health minister in the tourism hub of Goa, said the government will issue a circular asking hotels and industries to take preventive measures in the wake of the coronavirus scare.

In all this, there was some good news.

All 112 people admitted to an ITBP quarantine facility in Delhi for over a fortnight tested negative for the coronavirus. All of them were evacuated last month from Wuhan in China.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-reports-second-coronavirus-death--several-states-in-shutdown-mode-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-reports-second-coronavirus-death--several-states-in-shutdown-mode.html
222,13-3-20,Corona bleeds investors dry,"The Indian stock markets plunged into bear territory, suffering their biggest ever one-day plunge on Thursday as the coronavirus pandemic left a trail of red across global financial markets.

The carnage on Dalal Street eroded investor wealth worth Rs 11,27,160.65 crore, taking the total market capitalisation (m-cap) to Rs 1,25,86,398.07 crore on the BSE.

Stock markets tumbled across the globe and oil prices slumped on Thursday after President Donald Trump banned all travel from mainland Europe to the US for a month to fight the coronavirus pandemic, ramping up fears of worldwide recession.

After nosediving over 3,204.30 points on across-the-board selling, the 30-share BSE Sensex closed 2,919.26 points or 8.18 per cent lower at 32,778.14. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty gave up the 9,600 level, slumping 868.25 points or 8.30 per cent to close at 9,590.15.

This was the biggest drop for the benchmarks in absolute terms, eclipsing their previous record one-day fall on Monday (March 9). The markets have now entered bear territory — that is more than 20 per cent down from a recent high. The Sensex and Nifty, which had hit their lifetime closing highs on January 14 this year, closed at more than 2-1/2-year lows on Thursday.

The rupee sank by 60 paise to close at a fresh 17-month low of 74.28 against the US currency on Thursday due to heavy dollar demand as investors rushed to prune riskier bets amid coronavirus pandemic fanning recession fears.

Global markets reeled after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic, and expressed deep concern over the “alarming levels of inaction”.

US President Donald Trump suspended all travel from Europe, excluding the UK, to the US for the next 30 days. Countries across the world are imposing travel restrictions, fuelling fears of a global recession, analysts said.

All Sensex components ended in the red. SBI was the top loser, crashing 13.23 per cent, followed by ONGC, Axis Bank, ITC, TCS and Titan.

“Global stocks including India plunged into a bear market and oil slumped on Thursday, threatening more disruption to the world economy. Recession risk is rising and the markets do not seem to be pricing that in fully,” said Deepak Jasani, Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

“January was the third month in a row that the three-month measure of UK GDP showed zero growth, the weakest such run since the middle of 2009. In Q1 CY20, on an annualised basis, global growth could be deeply negative — more like (minus) 1 per cent,” he said.

All sectoral indices ended in the red, with BSE oil and gas cracking 9.82 per cent, followed by realty, metal, bankex, finance, energy and IT. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices followed the benchmarks, losing up to 8.72 per cent. A massive plunge in international oil prices and depreciating rupee added to the volatility, traders said.

The rupee depreciated 49 paise to 74.17 per US dollar (intra-day). Brent crude oil futures dropped 5.50 per cent to USD 33.82 per barrel. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai dropped 1.52 per cent, Hong Kong 3.66 per cent, Seoul 3.87 per cent and Tokyo cracked 4.41 per cent.

Markets in Europe crashed up to 6 per cent in early trade. In overnight trade, the Dow fell into a bear market and futures pointed Thursday to another rout in New York and Europe.

223,13-3-20,Virus claims 1st life in India,"A 76-year-old man who died two days ago in Karnataka while being treated for suspected coronavirus has become India’s first COVID-19 fatality with his samples taken earlier confirming the infection, the Karnataka Government said on Thursday. The deceased had gone to Saudi Arabia in January end and came back on February 29.

Officials said the patient had severe co-morbidities such as history of hypertension, diabetes and asthma and appendicitis.

Coronavirus has continued to spread its tentacles in the country taking into its grip 74 persons with 14 fresh cases, including 10 from Maharashtra and one each from Delhi, Ladakh, and Uttar Pradesh besides one foreign national.

Meanwhile, urging people not to panic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday advised them to avoid non-essential travel and large gatherings to ensure safety.

In a series of tweets, Modi also said that no Minister of the Central Government will travel abroad in the upcoming days. “Say no to panic, say yes to precautions. No Minister of the Central Government will travel abroad in the upcoming days. I urge our countrymen to also avoid non-essential travel,” Modi said adding that we can break the chain of spread and ensure safety of all by avoiding large gatherings.

Taking a cue, the Rashtrapati Bhavan closed all public tour visits from Friday as a precautionary measure against the spread of deadly pathogens.

While Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked MPs to educate people about the disease in their respective constituencies, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the virus is difficult to isolate but the scientists have been successful in isolating it. However, developing a vaccine will take at least one-and-a-half to two years.

The Ministry of Defence, on its part, announced it has set up seven more quarantine facilities for COVID-19 patients, especially for Indian citizens being brought back from coronavirus-hit countries.

The facilities have been set up at Jaisalmer, Suratgadh, Jhansi, Jodhpur, Deolali, Kolkata and Chennai. “We are expecting more civilians to be brought back to India. We are ready with our facilities,” Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said.

The Army is operating a quarantine facility in Manesar while the one in Hindon, near Ghaziabad, is being operated by the Air Force.

Talking to reporters here, Luv Aggarwal, Joint Secretary (Health), said that there was no need to panic in the wake of increasing number of coronavirus cases in the country and the focus is on preventive approach and there are adequate facilities available for testing. “We have around 1 lakh testing kits and additional kits have been ordered,” the Joint Secretary said.

As the number of coronavirus cases in the country rise, the Health Ministry has prepared a draft set of guidelines stating do’s and don’ts to be followed by those quarantined at home. The guidelines also include tips for the use of masks.

The 17 affected foreign nationals include 16 Italians and a Canadian patient. According to the WHO, globally there currently more than 1,24,000 cases of coronavirus across 118 countries. More than 4,600 people have lost their lives due the virus.

Also, people have been advised to stay away from public gatherings.

In a high-level meeting with Health Minister Satyendra Jain and health officials, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reviewed the preparedness to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Soon after the meeting, Kejriwal said, “All schools and colleges shall also remain closed till March 31, except for the ones where the exams have been going on. We have sufficient beds in case people are to be quarantined. We are arranging Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Boards flats which have remained unoccupied for long, and rooms in under-construction hospitals of the Delhi Government. More than 500 beds are ready to be installed in the Delhi Government hospitals.”

As the Government declared COVID-19 as an epidemic, all the public spaces, Government, and private office premises, malls, and shops, have been notified to disinfect their premises. The Delhi CM said, “Whatever we are doing is to contain the outbreak of the corona. I hope that all the people will support us. We are noticing how rapid the outbreak has been, but in India, we have successfully been able to contain the outbreak with the support of the public. We shall remain alert to stop this disease from spreading.”

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also issued an order, saying, “All educational institutions — schools, colleges, ITIs, polytechnics, universities and private coaching and tuition centres — will remain closed till March 31, except for holding examinations.”

He said the Delhi Government schools will resort to “zero paper attendance” from April 1. “The process of digitising exam result tabulation and attendance records is underway. Tablets will soon be provided to all remaining Government school teachers,” he said.

After the meeting, Baijal tweeted, “Reviewed preparedness to contain the COVID - 19 in Delhi with Hon’ble CM @ArvindKejriwal, Health Minister @SatyendarJain, CS, Delhi & other officers. Decision taken to close schools, colleges, cinema halls, etc. For sometime to minimise the possibility of spread.”

In another tweet, the L-G advised Delhiites to avoid unnecessary travel to crowded areas in the city.

“My advice to all to avoid unnecessary travel to crowded areas. Let’s take all possible preventive measures as far as possible,” he tweeted.

Jain also wrote a letter to Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan requesting to strengthen the number of testing laboratories in Delhi. “We have taken several measures in this regard, but we also need to assess future preparations. I have written a letter to Vardhan to increase and strengthen the testing facilities.”

“We have also requested to open testing laboratories in four Delhi Government hospitals and other private hospitals, along with Lady Hardinge Hospital, where the testing laboratory was to become operational. Private hospitals should also be permitted to conduct tests because it is important for every hospital to have a testing lab. We need more testing laboratories to conduct quick tests and to also contain the panic around the whole situation,” Jain said.

The number of coronavirus patients in the country has risen to 74 with 14 fresh cases, including a foreign national. The national Capital has so far recorded six cases of coronavirus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-poised-to-fight----epidemic----2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-poised-to-fight----epidemic---.html
225,13-3-20,"Stay put wherever you are, says MEA","Against the backdrop of coronavirus becoming pandemic, the External Affairs Ministry on Thursday advised Indians to stay put wherever they are and travel only under compelling reasons.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told the Lok Sabha that coronavirus outbreak was a matter of “great concern” and the Government’s initial focus is to bring back Indian pilgrims stranded in Iran. The Minister said there are over 6,000 Indian nationals in various provinces of Iran.

The first batch of 108 samples was received in India on March 7. These were tested and 58 Indian pilgrims (25 men, 31 women and 2 children), who tested negative, were brought back by a IAF flight on 10 March.

“We have also received samples of 529 more Indians on this flight which are being tested in the National Institute of Virology, Pune. So far, 299 of them have tested negative.

New cases keep declining and the overall epidemic situation remains at a low level in China, said Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the National Health Commission, at a Press conference here.

The agency suspects that the discounted transaction for the 1.2 acre-bungalow on Amrita Shergill Marg was a gratification to Kapoor through the company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd in return for non-realisation of over Rs 1,900 crore in loans from Yes Bank to Gautam Thapar-promoted Avantha Realty and group companies, they said.

Kapoor's wife Bindu is one of the two directors of Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd.

The CBI booked Thapar, Rana Kapoor and his wife Bindu in the fresh case for alleged criminal conspiracy and cheating under the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, officials said.

The agency carried out searches at the residence and office of Kapoor and his wife Bindu in Mumbai, and the company Bliss Abode, offices of Avantha Realty and Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited in Delhi and NCR, they said.

It is alleged that Kapoor bought the bungalow at Rs 378 crore, paying through Bliss Abode, they said, adding the property was immediately mortgaged to Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited for a loan of Rs 685 crore -- which was Rs 307 less than the market price.

The transaction shows that Bliss Abode paid much less than the market value to Avantha group for alleged relaxation in other existing loans to the group companies and for advancing new and additional loans.

The agency has alleged the property was under mortgage with ICICI Bank, which was released in favour of Yes Bank through a loan of Rs 400 crore given to Avantha Realty, they said.

The bank had sanctioned this loan in 2016 as lease rental, discounting for 10 years against a farce lease rental agreement entered between Avantha Realty and its another group company BILT Graphics Paper Pvt Ltd, they said.

The agreement between Avantha Realty and BILT was farcical as the rental value was increased from Rs one crore annually to Rs 65 crore without any basis, officials said.

No rent was however received from BILT to Avantha Realty, they said.

In June 2017, Rana Kapoor persuaded Avantha Realty to sell this property to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd against the favour extended to other previous advances of Avantha group of companies and extending another Rs 1165 crore loans to the group companies even when existing loans were under stress, they said.

237,13-3-20,Disneyland in California to close over virus,"Disneyland in California will close its doors beginning Saturday due to new coronavirus, the resort said, joining a slew of concerts, festivals and other entertainment events scrapped across the US.

The giant Disney attraction in Anaheim is the world's second-most visited theme park, drawing tens of thousands of visitors each day. It will remain shut at least until the end of March.

""After carefully reviewing the guidelines of the Governor of California's executive order and in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with the closure of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure,"" a statement said on Thursday.

California officials late Wednesday had called for large gatherings to be canceled across the state to slow the spread of the pandemic.

No cases of the virus had been reported at Disneyland. Disney will monitor the situation, and on-site hotels will remain open until Monday to give guests time to leave.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said Disney had ""made the right call in the interest of public health and agreed to shut down their California parks."" ""Expect more announcements like this shortly,"" he added.

The move follows a string of high-profile postponements and cancellations in California including the Coachella desert music festival, the Beverly Hills Film Festival, and the WonderCon pop culture gathering.

Across the country, events including the CinemaCon movie theater summit in Las Vegas, SXSW media festival in Texas and the Tribeca Film Festival in New York have been scrapped or postponed.

New York's Broadway theater district on Thursday suspended performances for a month under a similar a ban on large public gatherings. American rock giants Pearl Jam postponed the first leg of their North American tour, while pop diva Mariah Carey delayed a planned gig in Hawaii over the virus.

Disney-themed parks in Asia have also closed due to the COVID-19 illness, although its Shanghai resort partially reopened this month after closing in late January.

The 100-acre (40-hectare) Disneyland in California drew nearly 19 million visitors in 2018.

238,13-3-20,Catholic churches across Rome shut due to virus,"All Catholic churches across Rome have been closed to stem the spread of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1,000 people across Italy.

The churches will reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on April 3, Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, the papal vicar for Rome, said in a statement.

Catholic faithful have been exempted from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass.

The Vatican had spent days resisting having to take the drastic measure of shuttering places of worship in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.

It closed its museums and even the Saint Peter's Basilica -- parts of its soaring dome designed by Michelangelo -- to tourists as the death toll continued to mount.

All masses, weddings and funerals across the country have also been called off.

But some church buildings in the country will stay open as long as the faithful follow government regulations and remain a metre (three feet) apart while inside.

It was not immediately clear when Rome's churches were last forced to close en masse.

The Nazis and Italian Fascists kept Pope Pius XII confined to the Vatican during World War II.

Some Rome churches kept their doors open during the war.

The closures come with the pope himself suffering from a cold and communicating with the faithful by livestream as a safety precaution.

Pope Francis complained of feeling ""caged"" while reading his traditional Sunday Angelus Prayer into a camera from a Vatican library instead of his usual window overlooking crowds on Saint Peter's Square.

The 83-year-old was also forced to miss his weekly Wednesday appearance on the square that he often uses to hug and shake hands with the faithful from across the world.

The new regulations cover the Italian capital and not the Vatican City statelet located entirely within Rome.

The Holy See has recorded one COVID-19 infection and is awaiting the results of another person who attended one of its functions at the start of the month.

The cardinal's statement said access to ""churches of the Diocese of Rome open to the public -- and more generally to religious buildings of any kind open to the public -- is forbidden to all the faithful"".

The statement added that monasteries would remain open to ""communities that habitually use them as residents"".

""This provision is for the common good,"" De Donatis wrote.

The Italian government on Wednesday announced a comprehensive crackdown that closed all stores except for pharmacies and groceries.

De Donatis said he was finally moved to close Rome's churches by ""the even more binding restrictions placed on the ordinary movement of people"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/catholic-churches-across-rome-shut-due-to-virus-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/catholic-churches-across-rome-shut-due-to-virus.html
239,13-3-20,Canada PM's wife positive for new coronavirus,"Justin Trudeau's wife has tested positive for novel coronavirus, his office has said, while assuring the public that the Canadian prime minister is fine.

Canada's leader and his 44-year-old wife announced on Thursday that they were self-isolating while she was tested for coronavirus after a public event.

""Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau was tested for COVID-19 today. The test came back positive,"" the Prime Minister's office said in a statement late Thursday, adding she would remain in isolation and her symptoms were mild.

""The Prime Minister is in good health with no symptoms,"" the statement said, noting he would also be in isolation for two weeks and -- on the advice of his doctors -- will not be tested for the virus.

It follows several provinces in Canada -- which so far has reported nearly 150 cases in six states, and one death -- unveiling stricter measures to combat the spread of the virus while sporting events and entertainment galas were cancelled.

The PM would continue his duties, his office said, and would address the country on Saturday.

Trudeau, 48, held several meetings over the phone on Thursday, including with the special cabinet committee on COVID-19, his office said, and also spoke with the leaders of Italy, the US and Britain.

On Friday he will talk with indigenous leaders, as well as provincial and territorial premiers to coordinate Canada's response to the virus, and ""limit the economic impact on the country"".

After experiencing some mild symptoms following her return from the UK, according to an earlier statement, Gregoire-Trudeau immediately sought medical advice and testing.

""Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,"" she said in a message via the PM's Office.

""Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.""

Since the novel coronavirus first emerged in late December 2019, more than 130,000 cases have been recorded in 116 countries and territories, killing at least 4,900 people, according to an AFP tally.

Most of Canada's cases have been traced to China, Iran, Italy or Egypt, but seven people who recently returned from the US also tested positive, public health authorities said.

In Parliament, Health Minister Patty Hajdu urged Canadians to ""reconsider going to areas where there are a large number of people, which might include places like churches, community centres, concerts and various sporting events."" Quebec's Premier Francois Legault unveiled the strongest emergency measures yet in Canada, asking all travelers returning from overseas trips or anyone exhibiting flu-like symptoms to self-isolate for two weeks.

A ban on indoor gatherings of more than 250 people was also announced, with Montreal's Saint Patrick's Day parade -- held since 1824 -- postponed.

Alberta and British Columbia announced bans on large gatherings too.

Quebec, which has 13 confirmed cases of the virus, is also considering placing the entire island of Montreal -- a population of nearly 2 million -- under quarantine.

In neighbouring Ontario, public health officials announced the public schools would be shut until April 5.

The Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television cancelled this year's Canadian Screen Awards -- scheduled to air on March 29 -- and the country's Juno music awards, planned for Sunday, were also scrapped.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/canada-pm-s-wife-positive-for-new-coronavirus-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/canada-pm-s-wife-positive-for-new-coronavirus.html
240,13-3-20,North Korea's Kim guides another round of artillery drills,"North Korean state media on Friday said leader Kim Jong Un has supervised another round of artillery exercises, the latest in a series of exercises believed aimed at boosting its fighting capability.

The Korean Central News Agency said Kim guided an artillery firing competition between army units on Thursday. It said the competition was meant to evaluate the readiness of artillery forces and improve the form, program and method of artillery drills.

Kim praised artillery troops for their ""militant enthusiasm and attitude"" and ordered authorities to hold similar artillery firing competitions on a regular basis, according to KCNA.

The latest drills were the fourth since late February.

US-led diplomatic efforts aimed at getting the North to give up its nuclear weapons have been stalled for months.

241,13-3-20,Pentagon: US strikes Iran-backed group that hit Iraq base,"The US launched airstrikes Thursday in Iraq, targeting the Iranian-backed Shia militia members believed responsible for the rocket attack that killed and wounded American and British troops at a base north of Baghdad, the Pentagon said.

US officials said multiple strikes by US fighter jets hit five locations and mainly targeted Kataib Hezbollah weapons facilities inside Iraq. A Defense Department statement said the strikes targeted five weapons storage facilities ""to significantly degrade their ability to conduct future attacks.""

The strikes marked a rapid escalation in tensions with Tehran and its proxy groups in Iraq, just two months after Iran carried out a massive ballistic missile attack against American troops at a base in Iraq.

They came just hours after top US defense leaders threatened retaliation for the Wednesday rocket attack, making clear that they knew who did it and that the attackers would be held accountable.

""The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said. ""As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.”

The Pentagon statement said the facilities hit in the precision strikes were used to store weapons used to target the U.S. And coalition forces. It called the counterattack “defensive, proportional and in direct response to the threat” posed by the Iranian-backed Shia militia groups.

US officials said the locations of the strikes were largely around the Baghdad region. One US official said there were two strikes at Jurf al-Sakher, one in Karbala, one at Al-Musayib, and one at Arab Nawar Ahmad. The official said the US expected casualties would be lower than 50, and said the main effort was to hit the weapons.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because some details about the operations had not yet been made public.

An official with the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units told The Associated Press that two Iraqi federal police personnel were killed in Jurf al-Sakher. An Iraqi military statement said the aerial ""aggression"" occurred at 1:15 am in the areas of Jurf al-Sakher, Al-Musayib, Najaf and Alexandria on the headquarters of the Popular Mobilization Units, emergency regiments and commandos of the 9th division of the Iraqi army.

Esper told reporters at the Pentagon earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump had given him the authority to take whatever action he deemed necessary.

""We're going to take this one step at a time, but we've got to hold the perpetrators accountable,” Esper said. “You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.”

At the White House, Trump had also hinted that a US counterpunch could be coming, telling reporters, ""We'll see what the response is.” And Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters the US knows ”with a high degree of certainty"" who launched the attack.

On Capitol Hill earlier in the day, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East, told senators the deaths of US and coalition troops created a “red line” for the US, but said he didn't think Iran has “a good understanding of where our red line is.”

Asked if any counterattack could include a strike inside Iran, Esper said, “We are focused on the group that we believe perpetrated this in Iraq.” Two US troops and one British service member were killed and 14 other personnel were wounded when 18 rockets hit the base Wednesday.

The US military said the 107 mm Katyusha rockets were fired from a truck launcher that was found by Iraqi security forces near the base after the attack.

US officials have not publicly said what group they believe launched the rocket attack, but Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shia militia group, was the likely perpetrator. And the US strikes, which came in the middle of the night in Iraq, targeted that group.

Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a US contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.

That in turn led to protests at the US Embassy in Baghdad. They were followed January 3 by a US airstrike that killed Iran's most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member.

In response to the Soleimani killing, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on January 8, at al-Asad air base in Iraq, that resulted in traumatic brain injuries to more than 100 American troops.

McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday morning that the killing of Soleimani and the increase in US troops and assets in the region has made clear to Iran that the US will defend its interests there. He said the US has re-established a level of deterrence for state-on-state attacks by Iran.

However, he said: “What has not been changed is their continuing desire to operate through their proxies indirectly again us. That is a far more difficult area to deter.” On Thursday, Esper and Milley said they spoke with their British counterparts about the attack, but declined to provide details.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pentagon--us-strikes-iran-backed-group-that-hit-iraq-base-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pentagon--us-strikes-iran-backed-group-that-hit-iraq-base.html

243,13-3-20,"Phones, fabric, fertiliser to get costlier as GST may be raised","Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on mobile phones, fertilisers, man-made fabrics and garments are likely to be hiked to 18 per cent in the next GST Council meeting on March 14.

Experts said the rate hike would improve working capital position of the manufactures as it would correct the inverted duty structure but may lead to increase in price of the finished goods.

Currently, under the GST, certain manufactured goods attract a tax rate of 5 per cent or 12 per cent while their inputs, input services and capital goods attract GST at the higher rate of 18 per cent or 28 per cent.

The manufacturers have to claim a refund of accumulated input tax credit (ITC) where the tax rate on input is higher than the finished goods.

According to sources, the refund claimed on account of inverted rate structure is about Rs 20,000 crore per year and there is a need to correct this anomaly.

Significant items in inverted rate structure are fertilisers, mobiles, footwears, man-made yarns and fabrics, renewable energy devices, and tractors. A number of other smaller items like utensils also attract inverted duty structure.

“The GST Council will take up in phases the correction of inverted duty on items as per the recommendation of the officers’ committee. On Saturday, 4 items — mobiles, fertiliser, footwear and man-made fibre, fabric and garments — would come up for correction,” the official said.

Currently, cellphones attract a GST rate of 12 per cent, while its inputs are taxed at 18 per cent. “There is hardly any justification for retaining mobile at the slab rate of 12 per cent, while many items like TV, torches, geyser, iron, heaters, mixer, juicers, etc, attract GST at a higher rate,” the official added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/phones--fabric--fertiliser-to-get-costlier-as-gst-may-be-raised.html
244,13-3-20,"MP Speaker summons 22 rebels, Nath messenger detained in K’taka","Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker NP Prajapati on Thursday asked the 22 rebel Congress MLAs to appear before him by Friday and clarify whether their resignations that pushed the 15-month-old Kamal Nath Government to the brink of collapse was voluntary or under pressure.

The development took place on a day when Nath’s firefighter Minister Jitu Patwari was detained and stopped by the police from entering a resort near Bengaluru where 19 of the 22 MLAs are believed to be holed up.

The 22 MLAs who were issued notices are stated to be supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress and joined the BJP on Wednesday.

Police sources said the Minister was briefly detained along with his supporters as he tried to enter the resort. A video purportedly showing the Minister picking up heated arguments with the police has gone viral.

According to sources, Patwari had come with an apparent intention to convince the rebel MLAs who included six ministers to return to the party fold.

The Congress, however, alleged two Ministers from MP were arrested by police in Bengaluru.

Talking to reporters at the State Congress office in Bhopal, party MP Vivek Tankha said the two Ministers, Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh, had gone to Bengaluru along with the father of party MLA Manoj Choudhary, who he claimed, had been held “captive” by the BJP at the resort.

On Thursday, Scindia arrived at the party’s MP headquarters to a grand welcome by saffron party leaders, including former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, and amid bursting of crackers.

The 49-year-old former Union Minister arrived at the jam-packed BJP office amid bursting of crackers and loud beating of drums. BJP workers repeatedly raised the slogan ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’.

Both the Congress Ministers were also assaulted by policemen in Bengaluru, alleged Tankha, who is also a senior Supreme Court lawyer.

As the fate of the Congress Government hung in balance, the BJP said it will seek a floor test in the Assembly on March 16 to test the majority of the ruling party.

The Congress, however, said it will face the floor test only after the Speaker decides on the resignations of the 22 MLAs.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh wondered why the rebel MLAs were not meeting the Speaker to submit their resignations.

BJP’s chief whip in the Assembly Narottam Mishra said since the Government has been reduced to a minority the opposition party is going to request the Governor and the Speaker for a floor test on March 16 when the State Budget session begins.

“This Government has lost majority,” said senior BJP leader and Chouhan.

When asked about the BJP’s demand, Digvijaya said the Chief Minister is ready for a floor test.

“As Nath has already said we are ready for the floor test. But, there should be a decision on the resignation of MLAs before the floor test,” Digvijaya said, while blaming the BJP for the constitutional crisis in the State.

“The resignations will be accepted when the MLAs meet the Speaker one-on-one and verify their signatures without any pressure. Then the resignations will be accepted and the floor test can be conducted,” he said.

Digvijaya said the rebel MLAs should now go to the Speaker and clear the air.

“Nineteen Congress MLAs are in their (BJP’s) captivity. The family members (of MLAs) are unable to talk to them. Their phones were taken away,” Digvijaya alleged, adding it is also strange that the resignations of the Congress MLAs were submitted to the Speaker by BJP leader Bhupendra Singh.

The BJP claimed this is an “internal matter” of the Congress, but at the same time leaders of the saffron party submitted the resignations of the ruling party (Congress) MLAs to the Speaker, Digvijaya pointed out.

On Tuesday, 22 Congress MLAs resigned in a coordinated revolt soon after Scindia quit the party. Three of them are still in MP, sources said.

The Congress has a wafer thin majority in the 228- member Assembly. Before the rebellion, its tally was 114.

It also has the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one from the SP, but some may now switch sides to the BJP.

If the resignations of the 22 MLAs are accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 206.

The Congress, on its own, will then be left with 92 seats, while the BJP has 107 with the magic number for a majority being 104.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mp-speaker-summons-22-rebels--nath-messenger-detained-in-k---taka-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mp-speaker-summons-22-rebels--nath-messenger-detained-in-k---taka.html

""It has been brought to my notice by hundreds of complaints across India that government departments and insurance companies are creating false panic in the coronavirus by taking out advisories, which is not confirmed with the health department, saying that nobody should go near live animals,"" Maneka Gandhi said inside Parliament premises.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said: ""The health department of this country has clearly said that animals do not have coronavirus and they cannot transmit coronavirus.""

The MP further appealed that Ministry of Electronics, insurance companies and Ministry of Railways not to bring out fake ads, saying that ""do not go near live animals"".

""This is going to create another form of crisis in India,"" she said.

Several people stopped consuming chicken and eggs following rumours that they will be infected with COVID-19.

She said that the issue will be raised in Parliament on Friday.

The Union Health Ministry on Thursday confirmed 74 COVID-19 cases so far in India. The virus has infected over 80,000 people in China -- the epicentre of the disease -- and cases have been reported in over 100 other countries.

248,13-3-20,'A Quiet Place II' worldwide release delayed due to coronavirus scare,"Paramount Pictures has delayed the release of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt's horror thriller ""A Quiet Place Part II"" indefinitely amid coronavirus outbreak.

The film, a sequel to 2018's horror hit directed by Krasinski, was slated to bow out worldwide on March 18, with a UK premiere scheduled for March 19 and a North American release set for March 20.

""After much consideration, and in light of the ongoing and developing situation concerning coronavirus and restrictions on global travel and public gatherings, Paramount Pictures will be moving the worldwide release of ‘A Quiet Place Part II,'""the studio said in a statement posted on Instagram.

""We believe in and support the theatrical experience, and we look forward to bringing this film to audiences this year once we have a better understanding of the impact of this pandemic on the global theatrical marketplace.""

Paramout has not set a new release date for the movie yet.

Krasinski, who has penned and directed the sequel, also released a statement on his Instagram.

""One of the things I'm most proud of is that people have said our movie is one you have to see all together. Well due to the ever-changing circumstances of what's going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that. As insanely excited as we are for all of you to see this movie .. I'm gonna wait to release the film till we CAN all see it together! So here's to our group movie date! See you soon,"" he wrote.

""A Quiet Place II"" also features Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe, while Krasinski has a cameo appearance.

The film is the latest addition to the list of movies that have been delayed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Sony Pictures recently pushed the global release of ""Peter Rabbit 2"" to August, while the new James Bond movie ""No Time to Die"", which was set to arrive in cinemas in April, has been postponed to November.

Many events around the world have been cancelled or postponed amid the outbreak, including film festivals and music concerts.

249,13-3-20,"China reports 7 more deaths, 8 new cases as coronavirus continues to decline","China on Friday reported seven more fatalities due to the novel coronavirus infection, taking the death toll to 3,176, while the new confirmed cases were just eight, as the disease continued to abate across the country, including in its epicentre Wuhan.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports of the seven deaths from the Chinese mainland on Thursday. While six people died in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, one died in Shandong province.

The eight new confirmed cases were also from the Chinese mainland, it said.

Meanwhile, 33 new suspected cases were reported in the country, taking the total number to 147, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

As of Thursday, 1,318 people were discharged from hospital after recovery, while the number of severe cases dropped to 4,020.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,813 by the end of Thursday. This included 3,176 who died of the disease, 13,526 patients still being treated and 64,111 people discharged after recovery, the report said.

Three new ""imported COVID-19 cases"" (people arriving from abroad) -- two in Shanghai and one in Beijing -- were reported on Thursday, taking the total number of such cases to 88, the NHC said.

As of Thursday, there were total 131 confirmed cases, including three deaths, in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 49, including one death, in Taiwan.

Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the NHC, on Thursday said the peak of the novel coronavirus in the country is over, but its success in controlling the deadly disease has become complicated due to the global surge in the COVID-19 cases.

In China, there is a drop in new cases and the overall epidemic situation remains at a low level, Mi told media here.

Mi's remarks came a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a ""pandemic"".

It was over three months of an arduous struggle for China to bring the viral infection under control. Though Wuhan confirmed the surfacing of a new virus in December last, the government started taking action only from January 23 when it locked down the Hubei province and its capital Wuhan with over 50 million people.

By that time, over five million residents of the city had left for holidays to different parts of China and the world to celebrate the Chinese New Year.

The highly contagious virus quickly spread, with daily cases peaking at over 15,000 on February 12.

China mobilised the whole country's resources to contain the virus. Cities were locked down, experts and supplies sent to the epicentre, and millions of people across the country stayed at home for weeks to enforce social distancing.

By this week, normalcy has been steadily returning to China with many provinces and regions lowering their emergency responses, while many businesses resuming their operations.

By Thursday, 87 per cent of the country's entry and exit authorities resumed services, Xinhua reported.

However, China's good news is complicated by rapidly developing situations around the world and the growing number of imported cases, it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-reports-7-more-deaths--8-new-cases-as-coronavirus-continues-to-decline-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-reports-7-more-deaths--8-new-cases-as-coronavirus-continues-to-decline.html

251,13-3-20,COVID 19 effect: Bollywood box office takes a hard hit,"Upcoming films have been indefinitely postponed owing to cinema halls being shut down in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, but the films that were already running are bearing the brunt.

The Tiger Shroff-starrer ""Baaghi 3"" and this week's release ""Angrezi Medium"", which brings back Irrfan, are the hardest hit.

""Baaghi 3"", which released in India on March 6, was doing brisk business till many states declared an emergency, directing halls to shut down. The film recorded the biggest opening of 2020 so far, raking in Rs 17.50 crore on day one.

However, ""Baaghi 3"" is currently witnessing a slump at the box office after cinema halls were shut down in Delhi, Maharshtra, Jammu, Bihar, Orissa, Karnataka and Kerala, at the time of going to press.

While the film is expected to cross the Rs 100-crore mark, the trade had expected it to scale at least Rs 130 crore. Till Thursday, the film has managed Rs 90.67 crore, according to trade analyst Taran Adarsh's tweet.

As per several trade projections, big ticket films like ""Baaghi 3"" and Rohit Shetty's postopned ""Sooryavanshi"" stand to see a 15-20 per cent impact on their collections under these circumstances.

The scene looks more bleak for a smaller film like ""Angrezi Medium"", which opened on Friday. The film is expected to see a higher impact, in the region of 25-30 percent.

Trade expert Joginder Tuteja said: ""Though 'Baaghi 3' has done well, one can't expect the same from upcoming biggies that release at a wide scale since the coronavirus situation would be looked at far more closely at least in the near future, till the menace settles down.""

257,13-3-20,Virus sparks wild stock market swings as closures spread A,"Global stock markets went on a rollercoaster ride Friday over the surging coronavirus crisis that is upending events across the planet and affecting people from all walks of life, including sports stars, celebrities and world leaders.

The death toll from COVID-19 jumped over 5,000 on Friday as the number of cases around the world topped 134,000, according to an AFP tally.

Europe is bearing the brunt of increasing infections, but Iran clocked more deaths on Friday and cases were reported in Kenya and Ethiopia, the first in east Africa.

Across the globe, governments are imposing draconian measures never before seen in peacetime -- sealing off borders, closing schools and cancelling public gatherings.

The virus has also torn up the sporting and cultural calendar, with top-flight events from Broadway to English Premier League football scrapped.

Financial markets are reeling on fears that the pandemic will catapult the world into a deep recession, with central banks taking emergency measures to try to contain the economic fallout.

Asian stocks tumbled in volatile business following the worst day on Wall Street since the crash of 1987 as traders scrambled to sell, wiping trillions off market valuations.

But European stocks and oil prices recovered on what analysts said were hopes of a US stimulus package.

The virus, which first emerged in China in December, has spread relentlessly around the world even as cases in Asia have levelled out in recent days.

South Korea -- once grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China -- saw newly recovered patients exceed fresh infections for the first time, as it reported the lowest number of new cases for three weeks.

China earlier this week claimed ""the peak"" of the pandemic had passed its shores, but infections and deaths have jumped dramatically in Italy, Spain and Iran.

COVID-19 is sparing no-one. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was in self-imposed quarantine after his wife tested positive, the day after Hollywood star Tom Hanks said he and his wife were infected.

Australia's home minister Peter Dutton announced he had tested positive, while as leaders in Brazil and the Philippines await test results.

France -- the world's most visited country -- has ordered schools and universities closed until further notice and announced it was banning gatherings of more 100 people, following similar moves in many other countries.

President Emmanuel Macron said it was ""the worst health crisis in France in a century"".

The measures came after Italy -- second worst hit in the world -- imposed the continent's toughest response to the outbreak, shutting all shops except for pharmacies and groceries in the hope of stemming contagion and easing the burden on overstretched hospitals.

With nations imposing travel bans and closing borders, global tourism has ground to a halt, throwing the aviation industry into chaos and leaving travellers stranded.

In European airports, confused passengers scrambled to redraw their plans after US President Donald Trump this week banned all travellers from mainland Europe for 30 days.

""We just got off our plane and we're going to go straight back -- we can't believe it,"" said 29-year-old Tiara Streng, queueing with three friends at London's Heathrow Airport for a return flight to Colorado.

The Czech Republic became the latest European country to order the closure of its borders, sealing it off from a number of countries including virus hotspots.

Such measures were criticised by EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who said travel bans were not seen by the WHO as being effective.

Fellow EU state Hungary has also imposed border restrictions -- with outspoken nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban blaming foreigners for the spread of COVID-19.

""Our experience is that primarily foreigners brought in the disease, and that it is spreading among foreigners,"" he said in a radio interview.

The virus has cut a swathe through sporting events around the planet.

The English Premier League became the latest high-profile casualty, suspending all fixtures until April 4, while the season-opening Australian Grand Prix was cancelled just hours before the action was due to start.

The start of India's Premier League -- the world's most lucrative cricket competition -- has also been postponed, while the NBA basketball league in the United States was this week shut down for 30 days.

The virus has placed a major question mark over the ""Greatest Show on Earth"", the Tokyo Olympics, with Trump saying ""maybe they postpone it for a year"", sparking furious denials from officials in the Japanese capital.

He later praised Tokyo's Olympic preparations and their ""magnificent"" venue on Twitter, adding there were ""lots of options"". With authorities warning large gatherings should be avoided during the outbreak that the WHO has officially classified as a pandemic -- entertainment venues like Disneyland have been closed and the curtain this week also came down on Broadway.

Ted Levitt, a 63-year-old pensioner came to New York from Maryland with his daughter to watch ""Hamilton"" and thought the measures were overblown as he learned on Thursday the show was cancelled.

""I think it's not as bad as they say but I guess you've got to stop it somehow. I think everybody's getting a little bit crazy,"" he told AFP.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-sparks-wild-stock-market-swings-as-closures-spread-a-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/virus-sparks-wild-stock-market-swings-as-closures-spread-a.html
258,13-3-20,RML to be first Govt hospital in country with rooftop helipad,"The Centre-owned Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RML), formerly Willingdon Hospital which was established by the British for their staff, is all set to become the first Central Government-run medical facility in the country to have a helipad on its rooftop.

Being adjacent to Parliament and offices of various Ministries and situated in the Lutyen’s Zone, the one of the premier hospitals in the country caters to many VIPs, besides general public.

The Expert Appraisal Committee under the Union Environment Ministry last month in a meeting recommended a term of reference (ToR) for the Rs 463 crore project which envisages construction of a high-rise new super speciality-cum-paid ward block with 509 beds and a helipad at the terrace floor.

The 11-floor high-rise block will have general beds (392 numbers), ICU beds (51 numbers), private beds (66 numbers), Cath Lab (3 numbers), operation theaters (17 numbers), OPD Rooms (96 numbers), PG Seats (60 numbers) and 20 departments of various streams. The expansion will result into around 2000 beds at the hospital which has a college named as Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences.

A senior official from the RML Hospital said that with helipad on top, critical patients as well organs for transplantation can be lifted or brought at the hospital saving time and ultimately life.

He asserted that emergencies can happen anytime without warning and it is important that facilities are accessible to save the lives. Currently some private hospitals including Medanta and Apollo have airlifting facilities at a hefty flying cost.

She says as an artiste, she has always backed ""disruptive content"" throughout her career.

Anushka's maiden production ""NH10"" has completed 5 years of its release and the actress has talked about her journey as a producer and what it took to be the first A-list actress of her time to take the plunge.

""The decision to produce 'NH10' was very instinctive for me. It appealed to my core of doing something different and entertaining audiences. I wanted to give them something that they had not seen before and I was sure we could push the entertainment envelope with this cinema,"" Anushka said.

She said that as a producer her aim is to give the country brilliant content and that she is always on the lookout for the best scripts.

""As an artiste, I have always backed disruptive content throughout my career and when a film like 'NH10' came to me, I knew it was my calling to disrupt content for audiences as a producer.""

Anushka says she tried to make the stereotyped non-mainstream cinema, mainstream cinema.

""I was 25; I had no knowledge of producing films and I didn't know what I was getting into; but my brother Karnesh and I knew that we had to do it because we wanted to give audiences cinema that Bollywood was not making. I tried to make the stereotyped non-mainstream cinema, mainstream cinema; and when I see the content that is being produced in India today, I feel validated about my decision,"" she said.

She said that she was advised to give up on her dream of producing films by many in the industry.

""I was told by practically everyone that I shouldn't be getting into production and that an actress should focus on cementing her place in the big league than have distractions like this. I had always been a secure actor and these comments didn't bother me. In fact, these comments only made my resolve stronger that I had to take down many ceilings; and that we owe it to audiences to give them creative choices to choose from,"" she said.

Now, the ""PK"" actress says she is ""thrilled"" to see the content that the women of the industry have been developing.

""I'm proud of what Clean Slate Films has achieved so far. I'm proud of the kind of content Karnesh and I have produced and we have an exciting line up that we can't wait to share to the world! Today, I'm thrilled to see the content that is being produced by many actresses. I think we all collectively need to creatively contribute and collaborate to change the landscape of cinema in India. We are definitely on the right path,"" She said.

YRF will release #JayeshbhaiJordaar on 2nd October and @excelmovies will release #Toofaan on 18th September 2020,"" a post read on the official Twitter page of YRF.

Later in the evening, actor Vicky Kaushal took to social media and shared that his upcoming film ""Sardar Udham Singh"" has been pushed to January 15,2021. The film is based on the story of Udham Singh, who assassinated Michael O' Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in pre-Independence India, to avenge the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar in 1919. Singh was subsequently tried and convicted of murder and hanged in July 1940.

""On March 13th 1940, #SardarUdham singlehandedly assassinated Michael O' Dwyer in London to honour the lives lost at the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. His story deserves justice onscreen. Keeping that in mind, we will now see you in cinemas on 15th January 2021,"" Vicky wrote.

The decisions comes a day after the Delhi government officially announced the shutdown of all cinema halls in the Capital until March 31 due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Bihar, Orissa, Karnataka, Kerala and Jammu are other centres where cinemas have been shut down, at the time of going to print.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-effect--ranveer--vicky--farhan-s-films-get-new-release-dates-2020-03-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/covid-19-effect--ranveer--vicky--farhan-s-films-get-new-release-dates.html
