0,28-1-20,Powerless discoms,"The house must be set in order, else this will have catastrophic consequences for power producers, banks, States and Modi's plans to supply electricity to every household

Even as there are incessant promises from the ruling establishment of electrifying all villages in the country and making power available to each and every household for maximum duration in a day, the most crucial wheel required for making this happen has got stuck. And the irony is that the political brass is only paying lip service to the urgent need for extricating it. The reference here is to the power distribution companies (discoms) — mostly owned and controlled by State Governments which procure electricity from the independent power producers (IPPs), Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) like the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and so on, besides their own undertakings such as Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam (RVUN) and sell to consumers. There are some discoms in the private sector as well but they, too, can’t ignore the diktats of the state.

Ever since the dawn of the present century, the discoms have been incurring losses primarily due to three factors. First, being their sole owner and controller, the ruling establishment runs discoms as an extension of the state machinery, ordering them to sell electricity to a certain category of consumers viz. poor households and farmers either at a fraction of the cost of purchase and distribution or even free. On the units sold to this class, the discoms incur heavy under-recovery. At the same time, they are told to sell to industries and businesses at a price much above the cost to enable them to offset under-recovery on sale to preferred customers. But, even after offset, losses remain.

Second, in the course of transmission and distribution of electricity, there are so called “technical and commercial” (T&C) losses. Most of it is plain theft which is facilitated by faulty transformers, meters and other equipment. There being no revenue from stolen power, this further exacerbates the losses.

Third, under the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by discoms, States allow inflated tariff to generators taking recourse to “gold plating” (euphemism for claiming higher investment than actual), excessive overheads and over-invoicing of fuel bills and so on.

The above three factors make a deadly combination leading to shortfall in the realisation from sale, vis-à-vis the cost of supplying electricity which gets manifest in their loss. Funded by borrowings, this leads to accumulation of debt to unsustainable level. To ensure that they are able to sustain operations and the spillover effect on the rest of the economy is arrested/avoided, the Government had come out with three bail-out packages since 2000 — the latest being in 2015.

In 2015, under a financial restructuring package (FRP) orchestrated by the Union Government, over 75 per cent of the outstanding debt, about Rs 400,000 crore of discoms were taken over by State Governments whereas for the balance 25 per cent, they were allowed to issue bonds — backed by sovereign guarantee — to raise funds at concessional interest rate. The FRP was intended to enable discoms to wipe the slate clean, reduce losses and eventually eliminate them.

During 2016-17 and 2017-18, they did show significant reduction with losses declining from Rs 52,000 crore during 2015-16 to Rs 32,000 crore during 2016-17 and Rs 17,000 crore during 2017-18. During 2018-19, this trend was reversed with losses increasing to Rs 28,000 crore. The trend continues during the current year. A collateral damage has been by way of increase in pending payment to power generators. Thus, the amount due for more than 60 days increased from about Rs 23,000 crore as of March 2018 to Rs 71,000 crore as of November 2019. All dues including those pending for less than 60 days — as on this date — were even higher at about Rs 81,000 crore.

This has a debilitating effect on the ability of generators to service loans taken from banks and financial institutions (FIs). A good chunk of those loans have already become non-performing assets (NPAs). Moreover, given their precarious finances, discoms are forced to reduce off-take which affects capacity utilisation. It leads to an anomalous situation whereby despite ample capacity, electricity generation declines affecting supplies.

There is an urgent need to set the house of discoms in order, or else this will have catastrophic consequences for all stakeholders, viz. power producers, banks/FIs, finances of States and jeopardise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s grandiose plans to supply electricity to every household. So, what is the Government doing to set things right?

From August 1, 2019, it made mandatory for discoms to open letters of credit (LOC) for getting supply from generators (gencos). Under the LOC arrangement, the bank guarantees that a buyer’s payment to a seller will be received on time and for the correct amount; in the event that the buyer is unable to pay, the bank will be required to cover the full or remaining amount which in turn, it will recover from the buyer using all available legal means.

Relying on the above, in September, 2019, the Union Power Minister, RK Singh even exuded confidence that this would prevent creation of fresh dues. But this has not happened as may be seen from arrears continuing to be on an upward trajectory from about Rs 49,000 crore in February, 2019 to over Rs 71,000 crore as of November 2019. Clearly, the mechanism has not worked even as generators are forced to maintain supplies despite not receiving payment.

Singh was also optimistic that by incorporating a provision for penalty (or surcharge) for delayed payment at commercial rate of interest of 18 per cent in the New Tariff Policy (NTP), it should be possible to eliminate all pending dues. This may work while dealing with private entities (in fact, in those cases, the problem may not even arise in the first place) but not when it comes to dealing with state entities. So, it is unlikely that the legacy dues would be cleared.

Under the NTP (this is yet to be approved by the Union Cabinet), the Government has also proposed capping of tariff hike to 15 per cent of the under-recovered power supply cost. Further, they won’t be eligible for grant or loan if they don’t make efforts to reduce losses. These, too, are unlikely to work in improving their financial position and ability to clear the arrears and make timely payments in future.

Let us not forget that at present, even after increasing tariff — mostly directed at industries and businesses (a big chunk of households and farmers are never touched) — discoms incur loss. If a hike is restricted to just 15 per cent then their loss would be even bigger. Far from any help in reducing, such a stipulation will only end up increasing loss as they lose the flexibility to hike tariff. Similarly, the pressure by way of denying grant or loan won’t be of much help.

The Government is also contemplating a Special Loans Plan (SLP) under which banks will be asked to give loans to discoms to enable them to clear their dues to gencos. This will have serious implications for the banks. Considering that discoms won’t be able to pay back (given their precarious finances and no effort being made to address the fundamental factors behind their losses), these loans will be NPAs from day one. For banks struggling to come out of the crisis they got into (courtesy, legacy NPAs), this will compound their woes.

True, payment by discoms to gencos (enabled by SLP) will enable the latter service loans they had taken from banks thereby preventing those loans from becoming NPAs. However, for banks, this is no consolation as one set of NPAs would have been substituted by another. Besides, the gencos will continue to remain vulnerable to payment default as long as the discoms remain financially unviable. The SLP may solve today’s problem but after some time, dues will pile up requiring Centre’s intervention yet again.

Let it be understood in no ambiguous terms that whether it is the FRP (granted thrice over earlier) or SLP under consideration now, these are merely “band aids.” These don’t offer sustainable solution even as the problem keeps on festering beneath.

A sustainable solution can emerge only by tackling the fundamental causes which contribute to losses of discoms. The Centre and States should put their heads together to do away with sops to farmers and households, eliminate theft and rein in inflated tariff under PPAs.

1,28-1-20,Leaders must get their act together,"China seems to be a prime source of viruses. The doctors will do their duty as always but it would be nice if Chinese politicians act fast

In an emergency, the good thing about dictatorship is that it can respond very fast. The bad thing is that it won’t respond at all until the dictator-in-chief says that it should. All little dictators, who flourish in this sort of system, won’t risk their positions by passing bad news up the line until the risk of being blamed for delay outweighs the risk of being blamed for the emergency in the first place. You can see how this works if you consider China’s response to the emergence of nCov-2019 (novel coronavirus 2019), a new viral threat potentially as serious as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus of 2003. Some things it has done well but others it did very badly and the odds that the virus will spread globally are now probably even or worse.

The local health authorities in Wuhan, the 11-million-strong city in central China where the virus first appeared, spotted it on December 31, 2019, when only a few dozen cases had come to their attention. That’s as fast as you could ask for. And they promptly shut down the seafood and wild game market where the victims caught the disease. Score: Nine out of 10.

China’s national health authorities also acted fast. On January 9, they announced that they had a brand new coronavirus on their hands and just one day later they released its full genetic sequence online so that medical researchers worldwide could start working on it. Elapsed time: Just 11 days. Known deaths at that point: One. Score: 10 out of 10.

But these are medical professionals doing their duty according to internationally-agreed protocols. We don’t know what they recommended to China’s political authorities at that point but they must have called for widespread testing and probably also for travel restrictions to control the spread of the virus. But nobody dared to rock the boat: Nothing was done.

A pause here to recall how countries control the spread of a new infectious disease for which there is no vaccine nor any effective cure. Isolate the victims as soon as they are identified and give them medical support: Some will die but most will usually survive. And if you do that soon enough and thoroughly enough, the global pandemic never gets going.

There are often complicating factors. The spread will be far faster if the virus can pass from one person to another in the air. It will be much harder to isolate the people carrying the virus if they become infectious before they develop visible symptoms. But the methods available to slow or stop the spread are still the same: Identify the carriers and isolate them.

Now, back to what happened in China. The medical people did their job; the political people did not. It was two more weeks before the city of Wuhan was cut off from the rest of the country and the world. I live in London, 15 hours’ flying time away and during those two weeks 2,000 people arrived from Wuhan at London’s airports.

Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, was coming up fast but nothing was done although half the population goes home for a visit at this time every year. Wuhan and a dozen other Hubei cities are now in lockdown but it’s too late: Wuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, admits that five million people have already left the city for the New Year celebrations. Score: Two out of 10.

We now have two pieces of bad news that would have made it even more urgent to seal Wuhan off had we known them at the time. The new virus does propagate through the air and people carrying it do become infectious before they display any symptoms.

Zhou didn’t dare advocate isolating the city and neither did anybody else, until the Great Panjandrum Himself had spoken. President Xi Jinping finally spoke on January 25, saying that China faces a “grave situation” and now the system is racing to do what it should have been done two weeks ago.

Too bad but this pandemic (if that is what it becomes) will probably be on the same scale as the SARS virus and that is not really horrific: Deaths in the high hundreds or a few thousands worldwide. The mortality rate among those who catch it appears to be about two per cent, compared to one per cent for ordinary seasonal influenza. And ordinary flu kills about 400,000 (mostly elderly) people every year.

But one of these days something like the 1918 virus that caused the Spanish influenza will emerge again. That killed around 50 million people worldwide, out of a global population only a quarter of what it is now. Since Chinese food markets now seem to be a prime source of dangerous new flu-related viruses, the Chinese Government has a particular responsibility to contain them early. The Chinese doctors will do their duty, as always, but it would be nice if China had its political act a bit more together before then.

2,28-1-20,India is not there yet,"The NITI Aayog’s index of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals reveals that Kerala is on top of the chart in the country while in the north, Himachal Pradesh is a leading performer and Haryana and Punjab are laggards

On December 30, 2019, the NITI Aayog released the second edition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index, 2019, which is more robust than the first edition, SDG India Index: Baseline Report 2018, on account of a wider coverage of goals, targets and indicators and has greater alignment with the National Indicator Framework (NIF). A composite score was computed in the range of zero to 100 for each State and Union Territory (UT). If a State/UT gets a score of 100, it signifies that it has achieved the 2030 national SDG targets. The higher the score, the closer the State/UT gets towards achieving the objectives.

For North India, the report revealed contrasting performances by States, with Himachal Pradesh (HP) fortifying its position as the lead performer and securing the second rank with a composite SDG index of 69. Punjab was placed 12th with a score of 62 and Haryana ranked much lower at 18th place with a score of 57, which was even lower than the country’s average of 60. Overall, Kerala achieved the first rank with a tab of 70, while Bihar was the worst performing State with a tally of 50.

The SDGs consist of a set of 17 broad-based global goals adopted by 193 countries at the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit at UN Headquarters in New York in September 2015. The objectives were intended to be achieved by 2030 as a part of the resolution, “Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” These SDGs for 2030 evolved from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015. India is committed to achieve the 17 SDGs, the 169 associated targets and 232 SDG indicators, which comprehensively cover the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development.

The present analysis of the three North Indian States covers only 15 SDGs since the SDG 14 (life below water) is excluded as it applies only to nine coastal States and the SDG 17 (Partnership for the goals) is only qualitatively analysed in the report.

Out of the 15 SDG indices, HP is the best performer among these three States on 11 SDG indices while Punjab is the best performer on three goals viz. SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and Haryana is the best performer on only one of the goals viz. SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure).

However, appreciably, at an all-India level, Haryana is among the top three States in respect of SDG 9. However, Punjab has not found mention among the top three States at the all-India level on any of the 17 indices used for evaluating States and UTs on parameters of development. Significantly, on the other hand, at the all-India level, goal-wise HP has been the top State in three SDGs viz. Goal 4 (quality education), Goal 5 (gender equality) and Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities).

Besides applauding the achievements of the States, the report also highlights several challenges before them, which need to be comprehensively addressed by Governments. Some of the critical issues highlighted reveal that at the all-India level, Haryana ranks second-highest in urban income inequality. Punjab and Haryana have less than 10 per cent of their geographical area under forest and tree cover. Both Haryana and Punjab have surpassed the maximum limit of annual groundwater withdrawal, which is 70 per cent, so that the ground water is replenished at a normal rate. These States have to improve this ratio.

Unfortunately, in terms of sexual crimes against the girl child as well as total crimes against children, HP is the worst. Moreover, it does badly in terms of SDG 2 (zero hunger), which reflects poorly on the performance of the State Government on ending starvation, thus requiring a more focussed approach on nutrition.

Among the positive aspects, Punjab has the highest agricultural productivity at 4,169.67 kg/Ha and is nearing the targetted productivity of 5,033.34 kg/ Ha. Similarly, Punjab with Gross Value Added (GA) in agriculture at Rs 2.4 lash, has the second-highest GA after Goad at Rs 3.7 lash, which is already above the target of Rs 1.3 lash.

Cellular density is over 100 per cent in both HP and Punjab and with a HIV incidence per 1,000 uninfected population at 0.01, HP is closest to achieving the UN target of zero HIV-incidence. In terms of the average annual drop-out rate at the secondary level, HP is the best performing State with a 7.03 per cent rate as compared to 19.89 per cent in India. it leads the States in the Female Labor Force Participation Rate at 39.70 per cent as compared to the all-India rate of 17.7 per cent.

In terms of the share of renewable power as a proportion of the total electricity generated, HP leads the country with 94 per cent of the total electricity generated in the State coming from renewable sources. The above analysis emphasises that the SDG India Index Report 2019 would spur the States towards necessary course-correction wherever required and encourage them to ensure timely achievement of the goals.

At the global level, it is widely agreed that India will play a leading role in determining the relative success or failure of the SDGs, as it is the second-most populous country, accounting for one-sixth of the world’s population. In this context, it is worthwhile to quote Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, “The coming years will be a vital period to save the planet and to achieve sustainable, inclusive human development.”

3,28-1-20,A Constitutional mandate,"Those individuals/leaders, who stand opposed to the CAA, must show respect to the Constitution, which empowers Parliament to make laws regarding citizenship

Continued opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed by Parliament last month, and to the preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) by several State Governments, who stand opposed to the ruling dispensation, and their threatening postures towards the Union Government do not augur well either for the Republic or our Constitutional well-being.

The CAA, which has now become the law of the land, has amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 to provide succour to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who because of religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, crossed over to India before December 31, 2014, and are living here without any legal status. These nations are Islamic States, meaning Islam is the State religion over there.

Thus, automatically, unlike in India, adherents of all religions other than Islam are second or third-class citizens. Therefore, all non-Muslims are Constitutionally inferior and this has conditioned the majority to ill-treat the religious minorities in these nations. Ever since Partition, the Hindus and other minorities have been subjected to all forms of harassment and cruelty in these nations, forcing them to either convert to Islam or flee.

As a result, the population of Hindus in undivided Pakistan, which was around 24 per cent in the mid-1940s, has crashed to just 1.70 per cent. Similarly, in Bangladesh, which was earlier East Pakistan, the Hindu population has crashed from 30 per cent to about seven per cent. This should also answer the question as to why Muslims have been left out of the list of persecuted minorities under the CAA. First, they are not “minorities” and second, it is laughable to say that Muslims are “persecuted” by an Islamic State. The CAA seeks to offer some help to these subjugated minorities and to only those who entered India before the cut off date. In other words, this is not an open-ended scheme to allow for future migrants from these nations. Nor does it have anything to do with the citizens of India, whether Hindu or Muslim.

Given this reality, the attempt made by the Communists, the Congress and other parties opposed to the BJP, to spread the word that the CAA is against the Muslim citizens of India is blatantly false. This Act seeks to provide succour to persecuted religious minorities in Islamic States and it is also in line with the Bharatiya dharma and Constitutional dharma as well, to reach out to them. Those opposing this are abetting the non-secular, non-democratic behaviour of the citizens of Islamic nations across India’s border and will thereby lose the moral right to talk about these values in the country. The Communists and the Congress are also spreading canards about the NPR, the compilation of which is critical for policy formulation. Both parties were roundly rejected in the last parliamentary election in May 2019. In fact, although the Communists hog 30 to 40 per cent of the airtime on television debates, public support for such parties has fallen dramatically. In the 2004 Lok Sabha election, the two main Communist parties had a combined vote share of 7.07 per cent. In 2014, this was down to 4.07 per cent and in 2019, it crashed to 2.36 per cent.

So, it appears that the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is their last bastion and with the support of the Congress, the two parties seek to avenge the electoral humiliation they suffered by whipping up passions against the Government that received overwhelming public support.

Meanwhile, in a resolution, the Kerala Assembly has said that the CAA passed by Parliament has created apprehensions in various sections of society. This was followed by the Punjab Assembly, which in its resolution stated that the CAA had caused widespread anguish and social unrest in the country. It further said that “the ideology behind the CAA is inherently discriminatory and is as far away as it can be from being a humanitarian measure.” The Rajasthan Assembly is the latest one to demand repeal of the CAA. These resolutions are not unconstitutional but unprecedented and are certain to pose a threat to the federal structure.

Even more worrying is that the Punjab Assembly’s resolution refers to “apprehensions” that the NPR is a prelude to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and that it is “designed to deprive a section of people from citizenship of India.” It goes on to say that because of these apprehensions, the Union Government should amend the forms and documentation associated with the NPR.

However, Assemblies in Kerala, Punjab or Rajasthan never shed tears for persecuted religious minorities in theocratic States such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Further, all lectures on secularism are to be directed towards the secular, democratic citizens of India and the Government elected by them.

Three other developments in recent weeks are extremely worrying. One, several Chief Ministers have declared that they will not implement the CAA in their States. Two, the disgraceful decision to bring kids to protest sites and to get them to raise foul, abusive slogans against a duly elected Prime Minister. And three, telling the Muslims not to respond to queries from enumerators who are tasked to prepare the NPR.

Every Chief Minister and politician in the country, who has declared that CAA will not be implemented in his/her State, must immediately withdraw their statement because it will amount to challenging the supremacy of the Constitution. Parliament is empowered to make laws regarding citizenship, naturalisation of aliens under item 17 in the Union List and no State or individual has the right to say that the law made by it will not be implemented. If Chief Ministers persist with this line, it will lead to a Constitutional breakdown and the consequences will be terrible because the overwhelming majority in this country swears by the Constitution and will not allow a few malcontents in politics to disturb its rhythm and balance.

Second, the decision by protesters to bring infants to protest sites and to get them to hurl abuses at the Prime Minister is another act of brinkmanship which no reasonable person will support. Last, asking the Muslims to boycott the NPR is equally risky because any attempt to stymie the working of a duly elected Government at the federal level will have its own implications.

Those, who are encouraging such tendencies, are treading a dangerous path. It is indeed unfortunate that one has to make such a gloomy prognosis about what lies ahead around the time when the nation just celebrated its 71st Republic Day. Everybody has to be alert to ensure that the Constitution and the democratic way of life remain undisturbed.

4,28-1-20,Selling the jewel,"The Govt has invited expressions of interest for Air India again. Will it succeed this time in selling off the airline?

What’s next for Air India? Even with Ministers in the Government trying to talk up the sale — Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said he would have bought the airline if he weren’t a Minister — the fact is that this sell-off is difficult. This time it will not be — thanks to the quality or the lack of it — the asset on sale alone. In a revised push, the Government has made it clear that it plans to sell its entire stake in the carrier. But the sell-off process by the Modi Government during both its terms has been sporadic and questionable. Take its failure to sell off Can Fin Homes, the housing finance arm of Canara Bank. Without any reason to put it on sale, it has been more damaging to the investor community than any of the protests at Shaheen Bagh or resolutions by the European Parliament. Foreign investors are genuinely worried whether India is open to doing business at all. The Government’s negativity has been on display, including that of Goyal’s recent statement against Amazon’s billion-dollar investment/bailout to its Indian operations. Air India is no ordinary public sector unit (PSU); it is the national airline after all. Talk of its disinvestment have flamed passionate arguments on both sides. On the one hand, some feel that it remains a vital national asset and that the Government must plough in more taxpayers’ funds to keep it aloft. On the other, there are those who feel that it is a five-tonne deadweight attached to India’s leg and must be divested immediately or better still, shut shop. Air India may be tottering at the edge of the precipice but it still has strengths that can be advantageous in the long run. Whoever rescues it stands to gain for it has some of the prized international slots in profitable routes, a decent fleet and has a well-developed domestic and international footprint. It has some leftover glow from being a superbrand at one time and has skilled and experienced staff, particularly on operations and engineering sides, who are also being sought by most private operators.

With the disinvestment process in a limbo and the Government failing to even make what one could best describe as “easy sells”, the question about selling Air India should be put on hold. Simply because selling the national carrier is extremely complex and involves a layered process with terms and conditions. At the same time, despite Jet Airways’ collapse actually providing a slight fillip to the rest of the industry, the Indian aviation industry has been hurt due to a multitude of reasons, many not of its own making. IndiGo, India’s largest airline, is suffering due to engine issues. SpiceJet, owned by Government-linked entrepreneur Ajay Singh, is faced with a cash crunch, which is not being helped by several of its Boeing 737 Max aircraft grounded. So, the question about who has the money as well as the expertise to buy Air India is open, one that does not have easy answers. The same issues that arose when Jet Airways was going down in flames have re-emerged now. It would be easier and cheaper to establish a new airline than sink hundreds of millions of dollars into Air India unless one really values the slots. At the same time, during the weekend, it emerged that Dubai-based Emirates carried over 50 million Indians to Dubai and beyond, a classic case of how Indian passengers have fuelled the growth of global airlines. There is no doubt that India offers rich pickings for global airlines and could one day become a key driver of the aviation economy. We are poised to be the third largest player in this sector by 2025.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/selling-the-jewel-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/selling-the-jewel.html
5,28-1-20,A censure too far,"India has rightly ignored the EU resolutions on CAA, argued the law is an internal matter but we must dispel doubts

It is perhaps a little hypocritical of the European Union (EU) to go so far as to pass resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) when it has traversed a spectrum of genocidal politics and refugees born of racial hatred itself. That’s patronising. India is capable enough to conduct its own democratic scrutiny. Yes, all is not right with the new law that makes religion a criterion for naturalisation. And the civil society dissent against it has indeed become a pan-Indian movement to act as a counter-pressure to the Government. Both the law, which was duly passed by Parliament, and the mass protests thereafter, are within democratic convention. Though the Government clampdown on discourse is reprehensible, the recent protests have shown how masses of people can effectively turn the tide while being leaderless and without political endorsement. To that extent, the pro and anti-CAA battle will be settled within the spirit and territoriality defined by the Constitution and may actually set us on the self-corrective course of democratic renewal. We certainly won’t need any third-party intervention to make that call, India’s citizens are enough to do it. Domestic matters, no matter how contentious, will have to be solved domestically. Fellow democracies indeed need to respect that.

Also, such resolutions mean nothing unless they are a precursor to some sort of practical curbs in EU’s engagement with India (some EU members have suggested that as well) but that’s an extreme option, considering there are nations with worst rights violations. Unless of course, this is being done to negotiate a stronger position when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Brussels for an Indo-EU summit. Having said that, the international narrative does shape global perceptions and attitudes in engaging with India. And the resolutions embody unanimity of opinion from the extreme Right to extreme Left groups, coming from 625 of 752 EU members. Sifting through them, certain key issues do come up on which the Government has to ready its explainers and demonstrate that it is receptive as a vibrant democracy and not combative like an authoritarian regime. It has to engage with counterpoints than scare them away. The key concerns are clearly about the marginalisation of a community implicit in the CAA, its link with the profiling nature of census in the National Population Register (NPR)-National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the clampdowns on dissent, including those in Kashmir following its changed status as a Union Territory. The resolution, which falls under the category of “resolutions on topical subjects,” says that India has “created the legal grounds to strip millions of Muslims of the fundamental right of equal access to citizenship” and has linked the rights situation in Kashmir. The US, too, despite the guided tour of the Valley, has been critical of the detention of mainstream political leaders, who have so far worked within India’s democratic template and even been allies of New Delhi, without formal charges. The viral images of an emaciated, bearded and unkempt National Conference leader Omar Abdullah have only intensified the sense of victimhood at the hands of an oppressive regime. Till date, the Government’s lobbying and efforts to push its own point of view have not been too convincing. It has not made any reconciliatory moves either except by countering criticism with an obstinate aggression that is sharpening polarities. We must realise that intransigence is not always an asset even as we attempt to reset the template of diplomacy from passive to aggressive.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-censure-too-far-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-censure-too-far.html

10,28-1-20,UT proposes to regulate auction of heritage items,"With renowned foreign auction houses continue to put under hammer the heritage furniture belonging to Chandigarh, the UT Administration may soon come up with its own website displaying city’s heritage items in a bid to regulate its auction.

A website is proposed to be launched to give details of Chandigarh’s heritage furniture and other items for reference of all.

While the foreign auction houses continue to earn millions through the auction of Chandigarh’s heritage items, the Administration has so far acted as a mute spectator and merely paid lip-service.

A New York based auction house has reportedly put up Chandigarh’s heritage furniture, worth several lakhs on auction only this month.

Notably, members of Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell have several times expressed apprehensions over the theft of city’s heritage items from various places here and easy flow of these items especially furniture to foreign markets.

Launching a separate website to display Chandigarh’s heritage items forms a part of an auction plan prepared by the Administration for the protection of city’s heritage. Display of heritage items on the website is aimed at apprizing others that it is Chandigarh’s property.To stop the foreign based auction houses to sell city’s heritage, the plan also proposed to request auction houses for records of procurement or purchase of furniture from Chandigarh, details of such export from India, international and Indian persons and agencies involved.

An advisory through Union Ministry of Culture and External Affairs to concerned country alerting them about the theft and sale of heritage furniture and replicas thereof should be issued in case of such auctions, the plan stated.

About the cases of theft of heritage, the plan stated that Police Department should investigate thoroughly existing leads to suppliers and agents to identify warehouses in India and abroad and channels of smuggling and supply of heritage items from Chandigarh to foreign auction houses.

There is a need to tally records provided by auction houses with cargo or shipping records to establish authenticity, the plan proposed.Apart from this, all items which are to be sold as junk or as original item including old furniture, paper drawings, concrete light fixtures, old pictures or paintings in Chandigarh, should be intimated to the Member Secretary so that if any heritage item is there, that can be withdrawn, the plan further added.

While a detailed plan has been chalked out by Administration for regulating auction of heritage items, it is yet to initiate process to put it into action for protection and restoration of city’s heritage.

When contacted, a city based advocate Ajay Jagga, who is a member of Chandigarh Heritage Items Protection Cell said that effective measures need to be adopted to stop the theft of heritage items and its flow to foreign auction houses from Chandigarh.“There have been thefts of heritage furniture from PGIMER and PU in the past. It is quite obvious that people from these institutes itself are involved in such thefts.

Foreign auction houses continue to earn millions by selling Chandigarh’s heritage furniture but here, people are yet to understand the value of the heritage items. The local authorities continue to fail to stop such auctions,” he added.

According to the inventory prepared by the UT Administration in the year 2012, Chandigarh has ‘12793’ heritage items designed by city’s creator French Architect Le Corbusier or his team associated with the founding and planning of the city in 1950s and 60s. There are 190 different categories of the heritage items including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs, tables, among others.

A physical verification of identified heritage items is planned to be carried out by experts to ascertain its “genuineness” and also, to remove replicas from the heritage inventory.

The Administration has also planned to set up a museum in Government Printing Press, Sector 18 here to keep and showcase heritage items of Chandigarh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-proposes-to-regulate-auction-of-heritage-items.html

“We have to keep the Ganga river clean and ever-flowing at any cost. If you actually consider Ganga as your mother, then do your duty and brace yourself for making the river clean,” Yogi said during a function held on Monday.

One leg of the Ganga Yatra was launched from Bijnor, where the Ganga river enters Uttar Pradesh.

The chief minister was accompanied by his Uttarakhand counterpart Trivendra Singh Rawat and Union minister Sanjeev Balyan.

The second leg of the Ganga Yatra was flagged off by Governor Anandiben Patel from Ballia, where the holy river leaves the state and enters Bihar. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi was also present on the occasion.

Yogi said that Kanpur was the most sensitive point for the river Ganga. “After crossing Kanpur, the holy river transforms into a drain which hurts both our faith and economy. I took a pledge and made Ganga ever-flowing and clean even in Kanpur,” he said.

The chief minister said that if the river Ganga could be made clean in Kanpur, then all other rivers of the country would become ever-flowing and clean.

“If the Delhi government takes a resolve then Yamuna river can also become ever-flowing and clean,” he said.

Yogi said that the Gangetic plains ranked among the most fertile lands in the world.

“Farmers here are hard-working and because of them, India has achieved new height in agriculture production,” he said.

The chief minister said that there were apprehensions on how Ganga could be made clean and ever-flowing, how the onerous task could be done and what was the state government doing and to answer these questions, he had come to inaugurate the Ganga Yatra.

“The state government is taking every possible step in this direction. You should also make this programme successful by increasing public participation. Prevent dirty drains from falling into Ganga in the cities and villages. If we work with commitment by setting goals, then Ganga will become an example in the country and the world,” he said.

18,28-1-20,CAA brought to divide society: Yashwant,"Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as unconstitutional , former Union minister and a strong critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party government, Yashwant Sinha, on Monday said the law was brought to divide society on religious lines.

“The only motive of this law is to divide society on communal lines and trigger hatred against each other in the country,” he said while demanding immediate withdrawal of this “black law”.

Addressing a press conference along with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha at SP state headquarters here, Sinha said the statement of Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the CAA would not be withdrawn at any cost was itself anti-democratic.

“Shah’s statement that the CAA would not be withdrawn even after protests, indicated that the government is working against the citizens. The government already had the power to give citizenship then what was the reason for bringing this new law, no one can understand,” Sinha said, claiming that by bringing such an “anti-constitutional” law, the government was trying to divert the attention of the people from economic slowdown and unemployment.

He said when the rules of the new CAA had not been framed yet, how would it be implemented. “The law says that the minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, if harassed on the basis of religion, can apply for the Indian citizenship. But how these people will prove that they are harassed and the law does not say anything about it,” Sinha said.

He said the present BJP government at the Centre was taking unethical and illegal decisions just to benefit a handful of industrialists.

“While Air India would be given to some industrialists, on the other hand, Rs 1,45,000 crore has been taken from the RBI for these industrial houses,” he alleged.

“The economic condition of the country is grim and the agriculture sector is most hit leading to suicides by farmers,” he added.

Sinha is in Lucknow along with his Gandhi Shanti Yatra, which has come to Uttar Pradesh after covering Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and other states. The yatra will end at Rajghat on January 30. It commenced on January 9 this year from Gateway of India in Mumbai, where Mahatma Gandhi landed after coming to the country from South Africa.

Sinha also targeted some governors in the non-BJP state. “These governors are acting like BJP cadre and are adopting unconstitutional ways to create hurdle for the democratically elected governments,” he said.

Meanwhile, SP president Akhilesh Yadav said that the BJP government was not talking of demonetisation as it had failed on it.

“We are opposing the CAA, the NRC and the NPR and will not accept them at any cost,” he reiterated, saying that the government had failed in demonetisation and it would again meet the same fate on CAA and NRC also.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa-brought-to-divide-society--yashwant.html

Women have been protesting in different parts of UP, including the historic Clock Tower of Old Lucknow, demanding scrapping of CAA and NRC.

In a tweet, the BSP chief said, “Wrong cases filed against women and others protesting against CAA/NRC by the BJP-led UP government should be immediately withdrawn, and those who lost their lives during this time should also be extended proper help, this is the demand of BSP.”

Around 100 women protesters have been booked for violating prohibitory orders at the Clock Tower in the state capital.

20,28-1-20,"SAD-BJP tie-up intact in Punjab, says Sukhbir","In the backdrop of Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP alliance breaking in Delhi for the Assembly polls, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said the alliance with BJP was in place in Punjab.

Talking to reporters in Amritsar, Badal said such reports are just in the media and he has been hearing such reports for the last 20 years.

Hitting out at the Congress-led State Government for not sticking to its election promise of giving free smartphones on January 26, he said, ""I want to tell you that they (Cong-led govt) will not give anything (to people).

They are just giving dates. People of Punjab will send them packing after two years"".

Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla had said on Sunday in Patiala that he was expecting that the free smartphones would be given to the youth before March 31.

Badal alleged that drug and sand mining mafias were “proliferating” under the alleged “patronage” of Congress ministers in Punjab.

“The DGP has no control over Punjab Police while lower rank officers— DSP and SHOs were working at the behest of Congress leaders. I can give you details of many cases in which Congress leader got drug suppliers released,” alleged Badal.

Lashing out at the State Government, Shiromani Akali Dal chief said the Congress led Government was hiding its “failures” under the excuse of empty coffers.“We ran Government under the leadership of (Parkash Singh) Badal sahib and never gave a statement of empty coffers,” said Badal, adding the State saw ""unprecedented"" development under their regime. “But Captain sahib is not accessible,” he said slamming Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.

On the issue of CAA, Badal said his party was in favour of the amended Citizenship Act which was why it voted in favour of it.

But at the same time his party wanted the Muslim community be included in the CAA.

“The SAD follows principles of Guru Sahib who always preached ''Sarbat Da Bhala'' (welfare of all) and no discrimination. India is a united country and it belongs to people of all religions,” he said.

The SAD had earlier announced in Delhi that it would not contest the Delhi polls next month after it was asked by ally Bharatiya Janata Party to change its stand on the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

On Punjab CM opposing the CAA, Badal asked Amarinder Singh whether he did not want thousands of persecuted Sikhs, Hindus, Jains and others in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan get relief under the amended Citizenship Act.

Badal accused Singh of following “orders” of the Gandhi family to “save his chair”.

Badal also slammed rebel Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and other splinter groups like SAD (Taksali), accusing them of trying to weaken the SAD.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-bjp-tie-up-intact-in-punjab--says-sukhbir.html

27,28-1-20,FTII students sweep IFFB film fest awards,"Entries by students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), India’s well-known institution of its kind, have swept the top three awards at the just-concluded 11th Indian Film Festival of Bhubaneswar (IFFB).

The IFFB had shortlisted 15 entries from top-ranked film institutions of the nation for its competitive section in the students’ film category.

“Wet Blue Tarpaulin”, a bilingual film in Hindi-Marathi made in 2019 by Anunay Barbhuiya, claimed the first prize while “Bhumigat” (Underground Tales) made by Pradyatan Bera in Hindi made in 2017 bagged the second prize. Special Jury mention went to the trilingual film “Door Shaam Tak” (Far In Night) made in Hindi, Tamil and English by Syed Maisam Ali Shah in 2018.

“Wet Blue Tarpaulin” poignantly portrays the story of a migrant from Assam working in a Marathi restaurant in Pune who has to make a forged document to continue working in the city while struggling to contact his wife back in Assam, informed Anunay, who made the film.

“Through faces and bodies of real life labourers in ‘Bhumigat’, emerges an epistolary account of a daily wage owner who suddenly finds himself out of work one day. As rampant industrialisation surges, a new class is born - a crowd of nomadic migrant workers whose lives are a series of transitions in search of work. Using folk tale and memory as tools of narration the film invites us to witness a rapidly changing world through their eyes. Delving upon universal themes of identity, memory, love, faith, loss of home and the eternal search for home - the film is a social commentary on the timeless master slave dialectic in the new, globalised world order,” elaborated Pradyatan, the filmmaker.

“Door Shaam Tak” revolves round the story of a train journey spanning over an entire day of an adolescent boy with his football teammates and

coach, stated Shah, who has made the movie.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ftii-students-sweep-iffb-film-fest-awards.html

57,28-1-20,Villagers kill wanted Maoist in Malkangiri,"In a new turn of events, a Maoist was stoned to death and another was injured by locals at Janturai village under the Papermetla police limits in Malkangiri district in the intervening night of January 25-26.

A group of about 25 armed Maoists had come to the village and warned the villagers not to celebrate Republic Day and also to oppose road construction works in the area.

The Red rebels also opened blank fire to terrorise the villagers.

In their courageous retaliation, the villagers pelted stones at the Maoists leaving one of them dead on the spot.

The deceased ultra was identified as Ganga Madhi alias Adma, a native of Kalimela. He was carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head. The injured Maoist Jipro Hatrika alias Jitra, a native of Narayanpatna in Koraput district, was ACM of the ultras’ Guma Area Committee and was carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head.

On the other hand, the Maoists being enraged with the death of a colleague and the opposition from the locals, set fire to 10 houses in Janturai village before fleeing from the spot. Security personnel launched a combing operation in the area to nab the ultras.

Notably, while people in the cutoff areas of Malkangiri district are now increasingly realising that the Maoists are the stumbling block for their development, they are trying to oppose them.

Common people, who were supporting the Maoists out of fear, are now happy that the Government has expedited a development process in the district’s Swabhiman Anchal. This has enraged the Maoists, who are targeting innocent civilians.

Officials feel that a twin strategy of filling up security vacuum and expediting development process will not only empower the civilians but also eliminate fear of Maoists among the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/villagers-kill-wanted-maoist-in-malkangiri.html

67,28-1-20,Muslim women protest against NRC and CAA in Dehradun,"In what is being seen as an attempt to replicate the Shaheen Bagh protest in Dehradun, some members of the Muslim community protested near Hindi Bhawan against National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) here on Monday.

The protestors were mostly women who came with their children to express their disagreement to NRC and CAA. The protesters alleged that with such “black laws” the government is attempting to divide the people. The councillor of Bhagat Singh Colony ward, Mohammad Iliyas Ansari was also present to support the protestors against NRC and CAA.

According to Ansari, “The situation was not great in the country as it it. The government brought in such laws that divide the people of the nation.

Earlier the people used to celebrate each festival together but the government has already created such a situation in the country that religious differences are coming to the fore. How am I going to produce the documents from 40 or 50 years back to prove my citizenship?” He further added that Muslim women are strong and will oppose all the unfair laws of this government. He also mentions that the protest might go for a few more days.

It is pertinent to mention here that after the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi gained space in the national and international media, attempts have been made to replicate it in other parts of the nation.

According to Rekha Negi, “We have been issued notices multiple times but no Anganwadi worker has been fired from her job. It is just a way to scare naive girls and women to make them return to their job. We cannot be fired like that by the department.”

“These rumours are spread to weaken our protest and influence Anganwadi workers to quit fighting for their rights and return to their jobs with the same petty allowance. This is too low for the department. On Sunday night, there were people who were harassing us but no police personnel were there. Have we become so insignificant for the authorities that they no longer feel the need to protect the women of their city?” asked Anganwadi worker Meena Rawat. According to Sarojini Anthwal, one of the Anganwadi workers, “Well we have actually no hope from the officials of Women Empowerment and Child Development of Uttarakhand whose minister does not know about the work and working hours of an Anganwadi worker. If she thinks we work for just three hours then declare it as our official working hours so that we would be able to work elsewhere.”

On being asked about terminating the services of Anganwadi workers, the District Programme Officer (DPO) Akhilesh Mishra said, “To terminate anyone’s service, a standard procedure is followed by the department.

However ultimately we’ll have to consider the possibility of terminating the service of Anganwadi workers because it is the violation of Supreme Court orders according to which it is mandatory for the children under Anganwadi workers to get the nutritional food for 300 days. For now, we are just sending them the notice so that the return to their jobs.” He added that all the important work done by Anganwadi workers like vaccination of children, and providing nutritional food to kids is getting affected by the protest. It is pertinent to mention here that two more Anganwadi workers; Pushpa Adhikari and Shakuntala have been taken to the Coronation Hospital by police and Anganwadi protestors from Kotdwar, Suman Lakheda and Kusum Negi have joined fast unto death.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-anganwadi-worker-terminated-by-department--rekha-negi.html

80,28-1-20,Mayor defers imposition of license fee for traders,"The Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ deferred imposition of the license fee proposed for traders of the city after they protested in Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD).

On Monday, the members of the business fraternity staged a protest in MCD outside the office of the mayor. According to them, the license fee is a means of exploiting small businessmen who are already going through a loss in the market. “I have a clothing store in Paltan bazaar but for the past three years, my business is going down due to the huge online market presence.

It has made our lives miserable and if we’ll have to pay the license fee to MCD then what will we do? We already pay other taxes imposed by the government. We hope the mayor will understand our difficulties as he has been a businessman too before being the mayor of the city,” said Ankush Jain, a trader from Paltan Bazaar.

According to Ranbir Singh Chaudhary, president of Doon Real Estate Association, “Our business is already going through financial crisis and license fee by MCD will make it worse. Our work has also provided employment to many unemployed and those with limited education but each and every individual is going through a crisis, therefore, we decided to request mayor to take the proposal of license fee back.”

While speaking to the protestors the mayor said that it has already been made clear that no decision will be taken without considering the interests of traders and others. He said that the protest staged by them was not really required. Everyone is welcome to submit objections and MCD will surely consider it. He also added that the proposal was not personally taken up by him but was first passed in the board meeting, and besides license fee proposal is also in progress in other cities of the state too, said the mayor.However, the protestors said that they want confirmation and not assurance from the mayor, therefore on the insistence, the mayor decided to defer the imposition of the license fee proposal in the presence of BJP State general secretary Anil Goyal.

With this announcement, most of the traders were happy but some of them expressed concern stating that the MCD might change its decision in the future. According to Shriram Gupta, a trader from Rajpur, “I don’t think that this is any kind of confirmation that traders will not have to pay the license fee in the near future. It feels like this is just a temporary arrangement but let’s see and hope for the good.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mayor-defers-imposition-of-license-fee-for-traders.html

111,28-1-20,Break 2015 record of 67 seats: Kejriwal to voters,"With a few days left for Delhi Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal held back-to-back roadshows in Outer Delhi’s Narela and Bawana area and urged his supporters to press the button for their party symbol broom on the EVM machine so hard that the party breaks its 2015 record of winning 67 Assembly seats.

Kejriwal took out a roadshow in north Delhi’s Narela, Bawana and Gandhi Nagar areas with hundreds of supporters on Monday. Holding placards in support of various schemes of the Government, including free healthcare, and electricity, party supporters danced to the tune of ‘Lage Raho Kejriwal’ (the party’s anthem).

Addressing party workers, Kejriwal said he tried to be like an elder son of every family in Delhi. “I have tried to take all these responsibilities on my shoulder by being an elder son and an elder brother of every household in Delhi in the last five years. I paid electricity and water bills for your family, arranged quality education for the children, took care of the health of your family and arranged for medicines. I also facilitated pilgrimage for the elders of the family,” he said.

In the next five years, the AAP Government will clean the Yamuna River; provide 24-hour water to every household in Delhi, he said, adding that

He appealed the supporters of BJP, Congress and other parties to vote for AAP in the upcoming assembly elections for the development of Delhi.

112,28-1-20,"Shoot traitors of country, Anurag raises slogan at rally","Lashing out heavily on the supporters of anti-CAA protesters, Minister of State (Finance), Anurag Thakur, said “Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko (shoot the traitors of our country).”

Thakur, who participated in poll campaigning in Rithala Assembly constituency with other BJP leaders, clapped and urged the crowd to chant the slogan with him.

As the Delhi Aseembly polls scheduled to be held on February 8, the Central leadership of the BJP has sharpened its attack on the Congress and AAP over the anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh.

Stakes are very high because the BJP has been out of the power in Delhi for more than two decades. For this, it is working hard to wrest power from ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi.

In a press conference at Delhi BJP state office, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Parsad targeted AAP for not taking required action against the protests in Shaheen Bagh. “Lakhs of people are distressed because they can not go to office, shops are shut and their children are not able to go to school due to the road being blocked by the protesters,” Prasad said.

Shaheen Bagh is not just a locality but an “idea”, he said, adding that “under the cover of the tricolour, those seeking to dismember the country are being given shelter at Shaheen Bagh and innocent children are being tricked into threatening violence against the minister.”

The CAA does not deprive anyone of his/her citizenship and each Muslim citizen of this country will continue to live with full respect, he said.

Accusing the opposition of misleading the people by creating confusion over the CAA, he said all democratic norms were fulfilled in enacting the amended citizenship law.

He further accused the Congress of bringing Jinnah to Indian politics saying the love that the party’s leaders have for Pakistan is surprising.

“I want to say it clearly to the Congress that no further partition of the country will be allowed and if anyone thinks otherwise, strong action will be taken,” he said.

Prasad also asked Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal to clear his stand on Jinnah, saying the BJP takes pride in people like A P J Abdul Kalam, Maulana Azad, Abdul Hamid, Ashfaqullah, and cricketer Zaheer Khan from the minority community. “But see the drama by the Congress if Adnan Sami is given citizenship; they have objection to it. He is a good singer, he came here and became a citizen, we showed respect to him,”he said.

However, both Gandhi and Kejriwal have no qualms in visiting JNU where slogans like “Bharat tere tukde honge” were raised because of “vote bank” politics, Prasad said.

“Their (AAP and Congress) problem is that those (persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh) people coming here are not their vote banks so their dignity does not matter to them,” he said.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda on Monday flayed the AAP and the Congress, alleging they are more bothered about being with Shaheen Bagh, where an anti-CAA protest has been taking place for over a month now, than with the country.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shoot-traitors-of-country--anurag-raises-slogan-at-rally.html

Gehlot who had led a series of protests in the past few years for the rights of sanitation workers, said that the BJP is the real culprit behind the “worsening” condition of sanitation workers in Delhi.

Welcoming Gehlot to the party, Kejriwal said, “Sanjay Gehlot Ji has always been at the forefront in protests staged by sanitation workers to fight for the rights of sanitation workers,”

Kejriwal said “Gehlot stood against the AAP many times but later he realised that the sanitation workers were suffering because of the inadequate funding by the central government and not because of Delhi Government. It was then he decided to join AAP and work towards the welfare of the people.”

“Every party in the last five years has asked for votes from the sanitation workers in the name of their development, but AAP is the only party that will work for the rights of the sanitation workers,” he added.

Gehlot said he will participate in door-to-door campaign of the party to achieve party target ‘Ab Ki Baar, Sattar Paar’.

“The Chief Minister has assured us to regularise employment of the sanitation workers employed before the year 2017 and to work hard towards the integration of the municipal Corporations of Delhi,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/safai-karamcharis-union-prez-sanjay-gehlot-joins-aap.html

115,28-1-20,No scope for outside interference: V-P,"Against the backdrop of the European parliament set to debate and vote on a motion against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asserted there is no scope for outside interference in India’s internal matters. He also expressed concern over the trend of foreign bodies interfering in matters that are ‘completely within the purview of the Indian parliament and Government’.

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also questioned the objectivity of European Union Parliament members who have backed resolutions against the CAA, asking if they ever raised their voices over ‘victimisation’ of minority Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan.

“The Government of India has already explained that it (the CAA)is our internal matter. We believe in engagement. Lots of Left Parties there have sought this resolution and our External Affairs Minister will engage with them and explain our position,” Prasad told a press conference at the Delhi BJP office.

Asked about the upcoming EU Parliament’s debate, Prasad asked a counter question, “Have my esteemed friends of EU Parliament sought to raise a voice over victimisation of Hindu girls or a Sikh Granthi’s daughter in Pakistan? It is high time they also need to be objective.” Naidu’s remarks at a book launch event here came a day after reports indicated that a total of six resolutions have been tabled by groups within the European Union (EU), including the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group.

Though there was no official statement from the Ministry of External Affairs on the issue, Government sources on Sunday had said the EU Parliament should not take any action questioning the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures, government sources. This came ahead of a debate on the clutch of resolutions against the CAA by the powerful bloc of 28 nations. The resolutions will be debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament in Brussels. Voting will take place the next day.

Expressing concern over this, Naidu said there is no scope for outside interference in India’s internal matters. Making these observations, he also lamented the trend of foreign bodies interfering in matters that are “completely within the purview of the Indian Parliament and the Indian Government.”

He said such efforts were totally uncalled for and unwarranted and expressed hope that they would refrain from making such statements in future.

Addressing the gathering after releasing the book ‘TRG-An Enigma’ in New Delhi today, Naidu said as a mature republic and democratic polity, India capable of addressing the concerns of its citizens and needs no advice or guidance in such matters from others.

Asserting that our polity and democracy provided enough space for expressing differences and dissent whenever warranted, the Vice President said whenever basic and fundamental rights of citizens came under threat, citizens rose in unison and defended them, as was seen against emergency. “As a result, we have emerged as the most vibrant democracy in the world”, he added.

His remarks come after resolutions moved in the European Parliament stated that the CAA marked a “dangerous shift” in the way citizenship would be determined and would create the “largest statelessness crisis in the world”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-scope-for-outside-interference--v-p.html

The names of Wadhawans had figured in connection with the sale of three properties of Iqbal Mirchi to a front company Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd allegedly linked to them.

The ED had earlier in the day called Kapil Wadhawan for questioning. Once he arrived at the ED office, he was arrested in connection with an ongoing investigations launched against late Mirchi under the Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd.

It may be recalled that the name of Dheeraj Wadhawan, younger brother of Kapil Wadhawan, had come up during interrogation of the arrested accused Ranjeet Singh Bindra and Humayun Merchant.

Bindra had allegedly brokered a deal of three properties at Worli in sout-central Mumbai to Iqbal Mirchi. The properties were sold to a company named Sunblink Real Estate belonging to Sunny Bhatija who is Dheeraj’s brother-in-law.

The allegation against Wadhwans is that DHFL had allegedly extended loans to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi who died in the UK in August 2013. Wadhawan had reportedly gave a loan worth over Rs 2,000 crore on the three properties sold to Sunblink Real Estate.

The ED had begun investigation into Mirchi’s assets in the city on the basis of eight cases of narcotics smuggling and extortion registered against him since 1985.

The investigations have revealed that in 1986, Mirchi had purchased three properties from Mohammad Yusuf Trust (MYT) for Rs 6.5 lakh through his company M/s Rockside Enterprises. These properties — Sea View, Marium Lodge and Rabia Mansion — were bought using the proceeds of crime.

Since Mirchi subsequently left the country and was declared a proclaimed offender, the properties were confiscated by the Mumbai police under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA).

In the court battle that followed, MYT alleged that the properties still belonged to them and not Mirchi. The court then handed over the properties to the trust in

2005.

Subsequently in 2010, Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd had bought the three properties from the then Dubai-based Mirchi him and later developed them. Mirchi allegedly signed agreements in 2010 in which he received 90 million dirham for the development rights to these properties. All these are allegedly proceeds of crime.

Earlier, the ED had arrested Haroun Yusuf and Humayun Merchant, two alleged aides of Mirchi, Ranjeet Bindra and Rinku Deshpande. While Bindra is a broker, it was Deshpande who paid the commission to the former (Bindra).

The ED is investigating the loan of Rs 2,000 crore extended that DHFL had allegedly extended as loan to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd. The investigating agency suspects that the proceeds of the properties were laundered and used for terror financing.

The ED had questioned Dheeraj Wadhawan ailais Baba Dewan of Dheeraj Reality Non Executive Director of the DHFL in November last year. A day before Dheeraj was questioned, Kapil Wadhawan had also visited the ED’s Mumbai office and submitted the documents relating to the three deals.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ed-arrests-dhfl-md-wadhawan.html

A website —’welcomekejriwal.in’ — was also launched under the campaign to reach to the masses of Delhi.

Through this website, the AAP will tell the people about the works and achievements done by the Kejriwal Government in various fields including education, health and transport. The topics will be listed on the website, which can be accessed through a single click, said the AAP members.

“Delhi is a city of two crore people and approximately 50 lakh families. I wanted to visit every household and meet all the family members personally through door-to-door campaigning. But it was not physically possible to visit each of the 50 lakh households in Delhi. So, a website has been created through which I can personally contact people through the phone. A number has been issued for the purpose, which is 76909-44444. You need to give a missed call on the issued number and open a link received after the missed call, “said Kejriwal.

“After the completion of a particular component, you can also share your feedback with me. We will try to include your suggestions, as well as I will personally make sure to work on your complaints if any after the elections,” he added.

The website has several options listed, including education, health, electricity, water, infrastructure, and women’s security and unauthorised colonies in Delhi.

Taking umbrage at Shergill’s statement that his recognition was due to his sycophancy, an irate Sami said on Twitter, “Hey kid, did you get your brain from a ‘Clearance Sale’ or from a second hand novelty store?

Addressing a rally, the senior BJP leader also asserted that no power can now stop Kashmiri Pandits from returning to Kashmir as he strongly defended the Modi Government's decision to reorganise Jammu & Kashmir and scrap its special status under Article 370.

He also sent out a strong message to Pakistan, saying India will not touch anyone but if someone bothers it, then it is not going to let them live in peace.

Making a strong defence of the amended Citizenship Act, he said it is not a law to hurt the sentiments of any religion but to give relief to victims of religious persecution in non-secular countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has given the slogan of 'sabka sath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas' will never discriminate on the basis of religion, he said, adding that no harm will come to the citizenship of Indian Muslims.

The Opposition raises the question that if Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians can be given citizenship, then why not Muslims of these three countries, he said.

""Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not secular States. These are theocratic States.

""Islam is the religion of these three states. India's religion is not Hindu. India is a secular country. That is why those who follow Islam can not be persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,"" he said.

128,28-1-20,"SC to hear plea for additional Rs 7,844 cr fund to compensate victims","A 5-judge Bench of the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Tuesday the Centre’s plea seeking Rs 7,844 crore as additional fund from successor firms of US-based Union Carbide Corporation, now owned by Dow Chemicals, for giving compensation to victims of 1984 Bhopal Gas tragedy.

The Bench, comprising Justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M R Shah and S Ravindra Bhat, will hear the curative petition filed by the Centre for enhanced compensation for the victims.

The Centre is seeking a direction to Union Carbide and other firms for Rs 7,844 crore additional amount over and above the earlier settlement amount of $ 470 million for paying compensation to the gas tragedy victims.

Over 3,000 people had died in the tragedy due to release of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas.

The Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) gave a compensation of $470 million (Rs 715 crore) after the toxic gas leak from the Union Carbide factory on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984 killed over 3,000 people and affected 1.02 lakh more.

The survivors of the 1984 tragedy have been fighting for long for adequate compensation and proper medical treatment for ailments caused by the toxic leak.

The Centre had filed the curative petition in the apex court in December 2010 for enhanced compensation. On June 7, 2010, a Bhopal court had convicted seven executives of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) to two years’ imprisonment in connection with the incident.

Then UCC chairman, Warren Anderson was the prime accused in the case but did not appear for the trial. On February 1, 1992, the Bhopal CJM court had declared him an absconder.

Presently, over a dozen of protests are going on against the CAA in various parts of the Capital.

In a letter to the EC, Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan said, “The present security scenario and law & order is quite critical than was expected to be during electioneering process of the forthcoming Delhi Assembly 2020 as large number of protests and at times even violent in various parts of the national Capital are going for more than a month now over CAA.

“Further, being capital city and also election is to happen shortly, this may continue for longer time. It is requested that 30 companies of CAPF may be provided through direct induction immediately instead of in situ as it would not be feasible to withdraw these 30 companies from important essential duties like maintaining law & order , security for VBIPs, vital installations, banks in Delhi as it may adversely affect the security and law and order scenario.”

The CAA has triggered a nationwide debate on whether the law violates the country’s secular nature by excluding a particular religious group from its ambit, as has the iron-fisted approach adopted by police in some areas, including Delhi, to quell protests.

The law favours non-Muslim refugees from the Muslim-majority countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Sources in Delhi police said that heavy police deployment has been made Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Nagar, Karawal Nagar, Brijpuri, Bhajanpura, Seelampur, Jafrabad, Welcome, Mustafabad, Okhla and several parts which have seen repeated protests against the Citizenship Act.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah has accused Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress of pursuing vote bank politics and alleged that they had “instigated riots in the capital” during the protest against the Citizenship Amendmend Act (CAA).

135,28-1-20,Final hearing of convicts appeal against death penalty from Feb 25,"The Bombay High Court will now hold a final hearing from February 25 on the appeals challenging the death sentence handed out to all the three accused in the much-discussed case involving the ghastly rape and murder of a minor Maratha girl in Kopardi village of Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district in November 2017.

This follows the order passed by Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court Pradeep Nandrajog transferring the appeals challenging the punishment meted out to the accused by the trial court in the Kopardi rape and murder case from the Aurangbad bench of the high court to the principal seat in Mumbai.

Acting on a writ petition filed by the petitioners seeking transfer of the case from Aurangabad bench to the principal High court in Mumbai, the chief justice transferred the Bombay High Court and scheduled the hearing of the “appeals challenging the trial court’s judgement and sentence confirmation in the case” from February 25.

The petitioner had among other things cited that “due to the political limelight the case has got and the past history of threats to the accused and consequently to the lawyers, the Petitioners have not been able to arrange a counsel of their choice to argue their case in the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court”.

In a writ petition challenging the trial court’s order handing out death sentence to her client Santosh Gorakh Bhaval, one of the three persons convicted and sentenced to death in the case, Advocate Vijayalaxmi B Khopade stated that the sessions court had committed a “gross error’ by hastily delivering the judgment and that the trial court had awarded capital punishment to the applicant considering that the case fell under the ambit of “rarest of rare” principle.

Advocate Vijayalaxmi also stated that the trial court’s order entailed “gross miscarriage of justice and a miscarriage of justice which may arise from the conviction of an innocent and that the trial had substituted, in patent error, cogent evidence with strong suspicion and based its reasoning on assumptions while delivering the judgment.

It may be recalled that on November 29, 2017, a fast-track set up under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act had handed out death sentence to all the three convicts in the case. District Sessions Judge (Mrs) Suvarna Keole had awarded capital punishment to all the three convicts in the case — Jitendra alias Pappu Babulal Shinde (26), Santosh Gorkha Bhawal (30) and Nitin Gopinath Bhailume (28).

A 15-year-old victim girl, who belonged to the dominant Maratha community, was brutally raped between 7.35 pm and 8.15 pm July 13, 2016 and later throttled to death. The victim girl was on her way to bring spice from her grandfather house at that time.

All the three accused in the case are Dalits. The incident, it may be recalled, had sparked widespread protests in the state, with various political parties and Maratha organisations rooting for capital punishment to the accused.

The 11-month-long trial in Ahmednagar minor girl rape and murder case had generated considerable interest among the people across the state.

The fast-track court had on November 9 2016 framed charges against three accused --- Jitendra Shinde, Santosh Bhawal and Nitin Bhailume --under various sections of POSCO Act and IPC for allegedly perpetrating a sexual assault on the victim girl and strangulating her.

The Prosecution’s case was that the prime accused Jitendra Shinde allegedly raped and murdered the girl, while two other accused Bhawal and Bhailume had “conspired” with Shinde in the heinous crime.

During the trial which began on December 20, 2016, the Prosecution examined 31 witnesses, while defence lawyer defence lawyer Vijayalaxmi Khopade – representing one of the three accused Bhawal in the case – examined one witness.

There were no eyewitnesses in the case and that the entire case was based on “circumstantial evidence”, omissions and commissions made by the accused and forensic evidence”.

Nikam, it may be recalled, had -- during his final arguments in the case --adduced 24 pieces of circumstantial evidence built up the chain of events leading to the rape of the “homicidal death” of the victim girl who was studying in the ninth standard.

According to Nikam, the medical evidence helped the Prosecution nail the prime accused in the case.

“The dental imprints found on both the breasts of the victim girl matched with that of the accused number one (Jitendra Shinde).

The blood group of the victim girl was “A”, while blood group of Shinde is Rs O’. The blood (group A) found on Shinde’s shirt matched that of the victim girl,” Nikam had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/final-hearing-of-convicts-appeal-against-death-penalty-from-feb-25.html

138,28-1-20,BJP slams Cong’s double standard on Adnan,"The BJP on Monday came out hard against the Congress for questioning the award of Padma Shri to acclaimed singer and pianist Adnan Sami.

Charging Congress with lapping up a ‘set of Muslims’ who always speak against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indian Constitution, the BJP lashed out at the Opposition party for criticizing the Government for awarding ‘Padma’ honour to the Sami and said he was “highly deserving”.

Addressing a Press conference here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said though Congress objection was based on Sami’s father having served in Pakistani air force, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance had in the past backed and feted the singer-musician who was invited to play Piano by the Congress Government on the occasion of 500 years of Taj Mahal, he said.

Patra took a dig at Congress saying if father’s past is to cloud the present of anybody than Congress President Sonia Gandhi would be the first victim as the BJP spokesperson claimed her father was in the service of fascists Italian dictator Mussolini and Germany’s Hitler and sought to know why she was given Indian citizenship.

He said former Home Minister P Chidambaram was as recently as in 2013 supporting that Sami be given Indian citizenship. BJP leader pointed out that Sami, for long, has been living in London and not in Pakistan. Everything has changed now since BJP has honoured the musician , he said.

Patra said Sami’s father was treated in India and even his book was released by an Indian publication as he could not do so in Pakistan, he said.

Patra asserted that Sami is “highly deserving” and was given the Padma honour on merit.

He also referred to Sami’s mother Naureen Khan’s background as a resident of Jammu to target the Congress, asking if the party does not respect Muslim women from the region.

BJP ally and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also backed the Government’s decision to confer Padma Shri award on Sami, saying he has enhanced India’s stature with his talent. Hitting out at the criticism of the decision, the Lok Janshakti Party leader said, “After completing all the formalities, he was granted Indian citizenship in 2016. He has elevated India’s reputation and honour through his talent. I congratulate him on being honoured with Padma Shri.”

“Those who are opposing the award to the famous singer are not aware of Indian Citizenship Law. Indian citizenship has no relation with religion. Anyone who fulfils the requisite conditions of the citizenship act can become Indian Citizen,” Paswan said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-slams-cong---s-double-standard-on-adnan.html

“It is offering platform to ‘tukde tukde gang’ elements under the garb of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This protest is not just a protest against CAA it is a protest against Modi,” Prasad said in a Press conference.

“Lakhs of people are distressed because they can not go to office, shops are shut and their children are not able to go to school due to road block by Shaheen Bagh protesters,”

142,28-1-20,UK court orders sale of Force India yacht linked to Mallya,"A British court on Monday ordered that a luxury yacht owned by Force India Limited be sold and its proceeds be used to pay back Qatar National Bank to enforce its mortgage on the vessel.

During court proceedings, brought by the bank in the Admiralty Division of the High Court in England, it had been claimed that liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya’s son Siddharth Mallya was the ultimate beneficial owner of the yacht.

However, the bank said that without grappling with that issue, their claim was focused on recovering outstanding loan payments estimated at around Euro 6 million.

“Security for the loan… included a personal guarantee from Dr Mallya, an individual closely connected with the borrower,” notes the judgment handed down by Justice Nigel Teare in London on Monday.

“The sum claimed in this action in rem is Euro 5 million plus interest and the costs of ‘collection’ which the claimant is entitled to recover,” it adds.

The judgment also takes note of the fact that the Defendant, listed as “the owner of the yacht Force India”, chose not to appear at a scheduled trial earlier this month after its solicitors “came off the record” in November last.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/uk-court-orders-sale-of-force-india-yacht-linked-to-mallya.html

The Minister of State for Civil Aviation said the successful bidder would continue to use Air India brand.

The government on Monday announced sale of 100 per cent stake in debt-laden Air India as it issued the preliminary bid document for the strategic disinvestment and has set March 17, as the deadline for submitting expression of interest. As part of the strategic disinvestment, Air India would also sell 100 per cent stake in low-cost airline Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in joint venture AISATS, as per bid document issued on Monday.

Management control of the airline would also be transferred to the successful bidder.

The Minister of State for Civil Aviation further said the lessons have been learnt from 2018 with regard to Air India stake sale. In 2018, the government proposed to offload 76 per cent equity share capital of the national carrier as well as transfer the management control to private players.

146,28-1-20,Budget may bring in new policy to revive power discoms,"The upcoming Union Budget may bring about a new policy to reduce the losses of power distribution company and revive them.

Union Power Minister RK. Singh on Monday said that the Power Ministry has discussed and proposed the new scheme with the Finance Ministry and was hopeful that it would find place in the Budget 2020-21.

The new scheme would include elements of the current UDAY scheme and would provide assistance for reduction of discoms’ losses, he told reporters on the sidelines of an event here.

Allocations under the new scheme will make allocations based on efficiency.

The minister said that the government aims to reduce the losses of discoms to 15 per cent from 18.79 per cent loss in the financial year 2018-19.

According to official sources, the scheme may come up as a revised version of UDAY — UDAY 2.0 — which would provide another lease of life to ailing power discoms by extending financial support in the form of loans and grants.

This would support discoms to cover their payment to the generators and lenders while also investing in upgrading power infrastructure.

The accumulated losses of all discoms have again shot up to over Rs 80,000 crore, as of now, out of which close to Rs 60,000 crore is overdue.

The new financial support scheme will come with stringent conditions of regular power tariff revision by discoms and bringing down AT&C (aggregate, technical and commercial) losses to a level of 15 per cent within a year.

Non-adherance to conditions will stop loans and grants facility to state-run discoms.

The scheme for revival of stressed power discoms was launched in November 2015. The Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana’s (UDAY) prime objectives were financial turnaround and operational improvement of the discoms along with the reduction of cost of generation of power development of renewable energy energy efficiency and conservation.

Singh observed that the proposed new scheme would be replace the current multiple programmes into a single focussed initiative.

The centre is contemplating to combine the features of UDAY scheme, Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) under an umbrella programme.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/budget-may-bring-in-new-policy-to-revive-power-discoms.html
147,28-1-20,Govt to sell 100% stake in AI,"Moving forward with Air India stake sale process for the second time in less than two years, the government on Monday issued the preliminary bid document for 100 per cent stake in the debt-laden airline along with fixing the debt amount for prospective bidders and easing the bidding norms.

As part of the ambitious strategic disinvestment, Air India would sell its cent per cent stake in profit-making budget carrier Air India Express as well as 50 per cent shareholding in equal joint venture Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS). All the three entities would be sold together and management control of the national carrier would be transferred to the new investor.

In a significant move, the successful bidder would have to take only a debt of Rs 23,286.5 crore while the liabilities would be decided depending on current assets at the time of closing of the transaction, according to the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) issued on Monday.

The rest of the amount of the total Rs 60,074 crore debt as on March 31, 2019, would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle.

Staff dues of about Rs 1,383.70 crore on account of Justice Dharmadhikari Commission’s recommendation on past arrears would be paid by the Government.

The new investor would continue to use the ‘Air India’ brand. The deadline for submitting the bids is March 17.

The Government has relaxed the bidding norms wherein networth for potential bidders fixed at Rs 3,500 crore and minimum stake for an individual consortium partner lowered to 10 per cent. The networth criteria was Rs 5,000 crore in the 2018 bid document.

Another key change is that an entity can put in a bid on the “strength of its parent”, which means that an entity floated by a big corporate could participate in the disinvestment process, the person in the know of the PIM details said.

Further, a domestic carrier with zero or negative networth can own up to 51 per cent stake provided the networth requirement is fulfilled by the consortium partner.

Briefing reporters, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said the reason for privatisation of Air India is that the government has resources which are scarce.

According to the civil aviation ministry, there are a total of 17,984 employees at Air India and Air India Express. These include 9,617 permanent employees. The count also takes into account those on deputation at the airline.

Excluding those on deputation, the total count would a little over 16,000, the per son said.

There was no immediate comments from Air India unions on the bid document.

The minister made it clear that all land and building assets, including painting, arts and artefacts would not be part of the transaction.

However, certain land and buildings at Delhi, Mumbai airports and corporate offices which are core assets for running the airline will be given to the new investor on a right to use basis for a limited period, he noted.

“Contingent liabilities related to statutory dues and government dues will be indeminified by the government. Contingent liabilities due for retired employees will be clarified at the RFP (Request for Proposal) stage... Corporate guarantees given by Air India on behalf of Alliance Air will not be passed on the new investor,” Puri said.

This is at least the third time that the government is attempting disinvestment of Air India, which has been in the red since merger with Air India Express in 2007. The first attempt for stake sale, when Air India and Indian Airlines were separate entities, was done in 2001-2002 period when the NDA government was in power.

Permanent staff would be offered around three per cent or 98 crore shares of the airline under the Employee Stock Option Programme (ESOP).

EY is the transaction adviser for Air India disinvestment process.

In 2018, the government proposed to offload 76 per cent stake as well as transfer the management control but there were no bidders.

DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said that in terms of structuring, the disinvestment plan is on “very sound principles”.

“We will have net current liabilities to be nil, which means that only that much liabilities as much as current assets will be passed on,” he said.

A total amount of Rs 36,760 crore would be transferred to AIAHL as well as excess liabilities that are not matched by the current assets.

“About Rs 56,334 crore of liabilities and debt are coming to AIAHL along with Rs 17,000 crore of assets,” he said, adding that net liabilities for AIAHL would be around Rs 40,000 crore.

Queries regarding the PIM and SPA can be submitted till February 11 while the last date for submission of EoI is March 17. The qualified bidders would be intimated on March 31.

Puri said bridging finance required would be available to Air India during the process time.

Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said the airline does not have “excess staff” and the retiring employees’ medical benefits issue is being sorted out.

On BJP’s Subramanian Swamy and Yashwant Sinha being critical about Air India stake sale, Puri said the “views of the two gentlemen, I am afraid, does not reflect views of the government”.

“This deal is wholly anti national and I will forced to go to court. We cannot sell our family silver,” Swamy tweeted on Monday.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-to-sell-100--stake-in-ai-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-to-sell-100--stake-in-ai.html
148,28-1-20,Cong moves NHRC over police ‘atrocities’ on protesters in UP,"A delegation of Congress leaders, led by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, met senior officials of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and sought action against alleged police atrocities on anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress alleged victims have been made accused in case-related FIRs and no police officer has been named in any of the cases.

In its 31-page memorandum to the NHRC that include videos uploaded by witnesses, ground reports and other “unbiased” media reports show police firing and mercilessly beating of the protesters and photographs as “evidence”, the Congress has alleged that the BJP Government in the state “treats its own citizens like criminals” and demanded a thorough probe into the deaths that took place in the State during violent protests against the CAA.

After the meeting, Rahul Gandhi alleged the UP Government has “gone to war against its own people” and urged the NHRC to act decisively to protect the “Constitutional rights of our citizens”.

“A delegation of Congress leaders presented the NHRC with evidence of the atrocities against the citizens of UP by the State Govt., which has gone to war against its own people. The NHRC must act decisively to protect the idea of India & the Constitutional rights of our citizens,” Rahul said in a tweet.

According to the memorandum, given the role of a reckless State Government that views the law and constitution as mere inconveniences, treats its own citizens like criminals and wears its hostility towards ordinary citizens as a badge of pride, the duty of institutions such as the NHRC to act as checks and balances and to embody and protect the values enshrined in the Constitution of India becomes paramount.

It further said the NHRC has a “glorious history” of addressing injustices when all other institutions have fallen short. “We hope and expect that this instance will not be an exception to that legacy.” After the meeting, Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi stated that there has been gross human rights violations. We have submitted videos and photos to the NHRC in UP.

Singhvi said the Congress has given detailed facts including on “deaths of 23” people and also details on how they were killed “as some were shot in the chest”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cong-moves-nhrc-over-police----atrocities----on-protesters-in-up.html

150,28-1-20,"In relief to consumers, onion yield to rise 7% this yr","Despite floods in 15 States and erratic rainfall, India will witness a record production of onion, tomato, potato and other vegetables and fruits this year which may bring relief to consumers from high prices seen in the last few months. Onion production is expected to increase by seven per cent to 24.45 million

tonnes in the current 2019-20 crop year.

Besides onion, production of potato — another important kitchen staple — is estimated to rise to 51.94 million tonne this year from 50.19 million tonne last year, while tomato production is also pegged slightly higher at 19.32 million tonne as against 19 million tonne last year.

Releasing its first forecast, the Agriculture Ministry projected that vegetables production, is projected to be higher by 2.64 per cent than the year before, thanks to increase in output of onions, potatoes and tomatoes.

The overall production of vegetables is estimated to be higher at 188 million tonne in 2019-20 crop year from 183 million tonne in the previous year while the total fruits production is pegged lower at 95.74 million tonnes in 2019-20 crop year as against 97.9 million tonnes in the

previous year.

According to the ministry’s projection, onion crops has been grown in 12.93 lakh hectare in the 2019-20 crop year (July-June), slightly higher than 12.20 lakh hectare achieved during the previous year. Consequently, production of onion — the key kitchen staple — is estimated to increase to 24.45 million tonne this year from 22.81 million tonnes in the 2018-19 crop year. Onion is grown during both kharif (summer) and rabi (winter) season. The prices of onion has increased this year due to shortfall of 22 per cent in kharif onion crop due to late monsoon rains and later excess rainfall, which led to supply constraint and sharp rise in prices.

The Government was forced to import onion in a bid to contain prices, which have cooled down now to Rs 60/kg from the peak of Rs 160/kg in last few months. The Ministry has projected marginal drop in production of beans, parwal, pumpkin and tapioca this year.

In 2019-20, fruits production is expected to be lower by 2.27 per cent in 2019-20 over 2018-19. It is mainly due to loss in production of grapes, banana, mango, citrus, papaya and pomegranate. Among major fruits, production of apple is expected to be higher at 2.73 million tonne this year compared with the final output of 2.31 million tonne last year.

Production of mango is estimated to decline slightly to 21.28 million tonne this year from 21.37 million tonnes last year, while that of banana output may slip to 29.64 million tonnes from 30.46 million tonne and grapes output is expected to decline to 2.15 million tonne from 3 million tonne in the said period.

As per the projection, Pomegranate production is also estimated to fall to 2.32 million tonne this year from 2.91 million tonne last year. Spices production is estimated to drop to 9.37 million tonne from 9.42 million tonne, while that of flowers output to 2.87 million tonne from 2.91 million tonne in the said period.

Honey production is pegged at 1,20,000 tonne same at the last year’s level, while production of plantation crops like coconut, cashewnut is projected to increase marginally to 16.4 million tonne from 16.3 million tonne.

However, total production of horticulture crops is estimated at 313.35 million tonne in 2019-20, up from actual output of 310.74 million tonne in 2018-19.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/in-relief-to-consumers--onion-yield-to-rise-7--this-yr.html

153,28-1-20,Perumbavoor's Kunhol honoured with Padma Shri,"Padma Shri got MK Kunhol. That’s how people in Perumbavoor reacted to the news that 82 year old Kunhol, born as the son of Kurumban and Vallothi, a Harijan couple, has been honoured with Padma Shri, by the President of India. Padma Shri is reaching the town for the first time. (Though a film actor who was born in Perumbavoor went on to win a Padma Shri award through his performances in Tamil movies and that too in Tamil Nadu, an average Perumbavoorean is experiencing the thrill of this award for the first time).

The award for Kunhol is different in many ways. It is an award which has come in search of a person who had to undergo all bitter experiences because he was born as Harijan. He was denied education in school, college and medical college by the powers that be (both the Congress and the Communists who swear by their love for the downtrodden). Sitll, Kunhol fought against all odds, got education from the Ramakrishna Mission in Kalady where he was a disciple of Swamy Agamananda who has undertaken the task of teaching Sanskrit and Vedas to the depressed and oppressed classes and that too in 1950s and 1960s.

Kunhol was a perfect student who went on memorising the Vedas and Upanishads much to the surprise of Swamy Agamanandaji.

The monk understood that Kunhol’s life should not be wasted within the precincts of the Ashram learning Vedas. He wanted the Harijaan boy to get modern education and this he was enrolled as a student in the nearby college from where he graduated in science with distinction.

Though he got admission to MBBS course in Kozhikode Medical College, purely based on merit, the student leaders born in high society had reservations in a Pulaya youth emerging as a medical doctor and they hand in glove with the teaching fraternity ensured that Kunhol was thrown out from the “elite” college.

What Kerala lost in the melee was not only a potential brilliant medical doctor but the possibility of more Harijan youths entering the mainstream professions way back in 1950s itself.

Kunhol’s life is full of struggles, sufferings and agitations against injustice. He may be the only person who takes proud of the fact that he belongs to the Harijan community. There was a former minister in Kerala who filed a complaint against the late Chief Minister E K Nayanar for calling him Harijan!

“Yes, I simply love the term Harijan. There is no other word which is more beautiful than this term and I love to be addressed as Harijan,” Kunhol told The Pioneer. If you want to meet Kunhol, come to Perumbavoor and ask anybody.. they will direct you to his house.

But chances are that most of the time he would be in the forefront of agitations against injustice perpetrated against humanity. It is easy to identify this small man moving along the by lanes of Perumbavoor in his traditional attire of torn saffron veshti and cotton shirt. He does not have time for soliloquies or pep talks.

154,28-1-20,"ED arrests DHFL CMD in money laundering case, alleges links with Iqbal","The Enforcement Directorate has arrested the CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), Kapil Wadhawan, in connection with its money laundering probe against deceased gangster Iqbal Mirchi and others, officials said on Monday.

They said Wadhawan, 46, has been arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe and was ""untrustworthy"" in his dealings and statements made to the agency.

Wadhawan was arrested after questioning during the day at the agency office at Ballard Estate here.

He was on Monday produced before the designated PMLA court which remanded him in the ED custody till January 29.

The court accepted the agency's arguments that Wadhawan's remand was necessary as he was aware of the transactions and payments made towards purchase of the three properties in Worli in central Mumbai allegedly owned by Iqbal Mirchi.

""Kapil Wadhawan, being chairman and managing director of Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), had visited London along with a city-based real estate broker to meet Iqbal Mirchi in 2010. He has been instrumental in siphoning off huge amounts of money as part of the illegal deal between Mirchi and the Wadhawans,"" the ED said in its remand note.

""Kapil Wadhawan played a very crucial role in the nefarious transactions by way of money laundering. He diverted huge funds from DHFL to shell companies which was then transferred to Wadhawans-owned Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd,"" the agency said. The case relates to Mirchi's Mumbai properties, which have been called as proceeds of crime by the ED.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ed-arrests-dhfl-cmd-in-money-laundering-case--alleges-links-with-iqbal.html
155,28-1-20,Extraordinary growth potential in US-India defence trade: Boeing official,"India offers growth and productivity opportunities for the global aerospace industry and there is extraordinary potential for the defence trade and partnerships to grow between India and the US, a top Boeing official has said.

Dennis D Swanson, Vice President, global marketing Boeing Defense, Space and Security said the bilateral defence cooperation had evolved considerably in the last few years, driven by the growing convergence of American and Indian defence interests.

He said at the international geo-strategic level, this convergence was occurring primarily because of the shifting balance of power in Asia.

""There is extraordinary growth potential in US-India defence trade and on the defence-industrial partnerships front. We welcome that as an industry body,"" Swanson told PTI.

Swanson - who is co-leading a high-powered delegation of US India Business Council to the 17th Defense Executive Mission to DefExpo 2020 along with David Sutton, director for the Indo-Pacific, Lockheed Martin International - said the opportunity was also as clear as the growth trajectory that has taken US-Indian defence trade from a mere USD 200 million in 2000 to over USD 18 billion in 2019.

""In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership holds promise for greater US-Indian military and industrial cooperation. We welcome his commitment to 'Make in India', and offer our strong support through joint partnerships and investments to make it a success,"" he said.

Swanson said that as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India offers growth and productivity opportunities for the aerospace industry.

He said all the US companies that are part of this USIBC mission to India recognised that aerospace was a global industry and that they must continue to tap into the talent, innovation and technology in the US, India, and around the world to deliver high performance and affordability their customers expect.

""The investments made by US companies in India in defence partnerships or investing in the manufacturing, skill development and engineering footprint in India is critical to our industry's long-term ability to sustain and grow jobs here in India and the US,"" he said.

""We are encouraged by the growing defence relationship that has expanded under all US administrations and continues to grow under the Trump administration,"" he added.

Swanson said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo along with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had reaffirmed the US recognition of India as a ""Major Defense Partner"" and a commitment to offer India defence technologies on par with America's closest partners and allies.

In 2017, the Trump administration modified the Export Administration Regulations to facilitate defence trade with India and provided an unprecedented offer of Missile Technology Control Regime Category I Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to the Indian Navy, he said.

In 2018, further progress was made through the granting of India as a ""Strategic Trade Authorization 1"" country and by the joint signing of the Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), which was over a decade in the making, he added.

More recently, the Industrial Security Agreement (ISA) was signed during the 2+2 Dialogue which facilitates close technology transfer with the Indian private industry. The ISA, along with other foundational agreements such Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), and joint exercises between the two militaries, furthers bilateral industrial and military cooperation and elevates India's emergence as a stronger strategic partner, the top official said.

Swanson said over the last 10 years, there had been great positive energy and strong participation across the two governments.

""An expanded partnership between the United States and India allows us to create greater prosperity for both our nations and stand as mutually reinforcing engines of growth and innovation,"" he said.

""We've seen the ease of doing business improve significantly under Prime Minister Modi's government and we welcome that. You see a lot of US aerospace and defence companies investing in India and partnering with industry as a result,"" he said.

India's aerospace and defence market has tremendous growth potential and strong fundamentals to be globally competitive and develop into a leading hub and net exporter for design, manufacturing, engineering, technology development and services, he said.

According to Swanson, Indian companies – both in the public and private sectors – are adopting global standards when it relates to quality, efficiency and cost competitive benchmarks required for the aerospace and defence industry.

""They are also making the investments required for this industry and partnering with the right partners to build scale and capacity and develop talent to export defence products and services globally. As a result, they are becoming an integral part of the global aerospace supply chain,"" he said.

The maritime security in the context of the military-to-military relationship had significant potential now and in the future. It offers the surest foothold to advance the broader security agenda and realise the value of being Major Defense Partner in the near-term, he added.

The Malabar military exercises and the revival of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) are a natural fit for collaboration, he noted.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/extraordinary-growth-potential-in-us-india-defence-trade--boeing-official-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/extraordinary-growth-potential-in-us-india-defence-trade--boeing-official.html
156,28-1-20,A song for diversity,"The attendees at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, besides paying a tribute to lost heroes, including basketball player Kobe Bryant and late rapper Nipsey Hussle, called out for more inclusiveness. Then 18-year-old Billie Eilish swept with five wins, capping off an incredible breakthrough year. Here are the top moments from the gala

Drama over fairness and inclusion at the Grammy Awards carried over to music’s big night as newcomers and mainstays in the industry supported Sean “Diddy” Combs and his powerful speech putting the Recording Academy on a clock to fix the nomination process when it comes to rap and R&B in major categories. “I think if they smart, they listen to Diddy,” soulful singer Lucky Daye said on the red carpet.

British rapper Labrinth added, “Hopefully there’s a conversation to really think about what’s happened.” Days ago, the academy’s just-ousted CEO Deborah Dugan claimed that the awards are rigged and filled with conflicts of interest. At the Clive Davis gala, Combs — who was honoured — spoke for 50 fiery minutes, saying in part: “So I say this with love to the Grammys because you really need to know this, every year y’all be killing us man. Man, I’m talking about the pain. I’m speaking for all these artistes here, the producers, the executives. The amount of time it takes to make these records, to pour your heart into it and you just want an even playing field.”

Combs urged in his speech that substantive change should come within 365 days. Legend Smokey Robinson had words of support for Combs, his friend but he said he wasn’t surprised about the Grammy criticism. “Diddy could actually be a politician. I thought this speech was powerful. It touched on a lot of things people were afraid to say,” he said.

Of Dugan calling out manipulation of the nomination process, he said, “It’s not like it’s news. We’ve known it all along. It’s just coming to the forefront. All that is hidden will come to light.”

Tyler, The Creator said backstage after his Igor won best rap album that he’s “half and half” on the controversy over whether Grammy voting is fair. “On one side, I’m very grateful that what I made could just be acknowledged in a world like this,” he said. “But also, it sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in a ‘rap’ or ‘urban’ category. I don’t like that ‘urban’ word. It’s just a politically correct way to say the N-word. When I hear that, I’m just like why can’t we just be in pop?” His other half feels like the “rap nomination was a backhanded compliment.”

Bluesman Keb’ Mo’, who has served in academy positions over the years, said his experiences on the inside have been “nothing but integrity.” He added, “Nothing’s perfect but my experience is the Grammys trying to maintain integrity and the artistic process.” Others said Combs’ words and support will hopefully go a long way.

“I believe that, you know, sometimes there’s always a tweaking that can be done. I think sometimes you may have to just revisit the process,” said gospel artist Tasha Cobbs Leonard. “I have hope that’s what’s happening now in every category.”

The Grammys have been criticised over the years when Beyoncé, Kanye West, Eminem, Mariah Carey and other top stars have lost in major categories, including album of the year and best new artist. The rap and R&B stars often fall short of their pop, rock and country counterparts.

Boys Noize, along with Skrillex and and Ty Dolla $ign, also supported the cause on the red carpet. “Everybody should be here. More black, more female,” Boys Noize said. Ty Dolla $ign added: “The people will rise for sure.”

Billie Eilish has won album of the year and record of the year to cap a dominant night of five victories at the Grammy Awards. The 18-year-old Eilish won album of the year for When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and record of the year for Bad Guy. Her album beat a group of nominees that included Lana Del Rey, Lizzo and Ariana Grande. “Can I just say that I think Ariana deserved this?” Eilish said as she accepted the award. Her other Grammys include best new artist, and song of the year for Bad Guy. She told the music stars in the crowd that “I grew up watching all of you.”

John Legend, Meek Mill, DJ Khaled and a host of musicians paid tribute to Nipsey Hussle at the awards, filling the vast stage with a soaring performance of his music. The tribute kicked off with Mill performing a new song called Letter to Nipsey, which mentioned a letter President Barack Obama wrote in Hussle’s honour. “When we lost you, it really put some pain on me,” Mill rapped. “Real hitters never die.”

Then DJ Khaled and Legend sang their collaboration with Hussle, DJ Khaled’s track Higher, which later won the Grammy for best rap/sung performance. Legend sang while playing the piano as a choir sang along with them. Other performers including Kirk Franklin, Roddy Ricch and YG, each took turns doing solos.

Hussle was killed outside of his South Los Angeles clothing store in March 2019. Sunday’s performance featured musicians, background dancers and Legend wearing traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean clothing in honour of Hussle’s African roots. The tributes to Hussle were made even more poignant by the loss earlier in the day by another icon — basketball superstar Kobe Bryant.

He played for 20 years for the city’s NBA team. Bryant’s death in a helicopter crash earlier in the day was acknowledged in the opening minutes of the Grammys broadcast. Before her performance, Lizzo said, “This is for Kobe.” She went on to perform Truth Hurts and Cuz I Love You.

Host Alicia Keys said she was feeling “crazy sad” about Bryant. She was joined on stage with Boyz II Men, who collectively sang It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday. “The whole wide world lost a hero,” the singer said in front of the audience. “We are standing her literally heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built.” The NBA legend, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others were killed in the crash on a steep hillside in dense morning fog in Southern California. He was 41 and had retired from the Lakers in 2016.

Some shed tears for Bryant on the red carpet. Others were almost speechless ahead of the 62nd annual awards show. Music artists including Billy Ray Cyrus, Rick Ross and Kirk Franklin paid tribute to Bryant, the 18-time NBA All-Star and five-time champion. Debbie Allen, who is married to former Laker Norm Nixon, was seen crying. DJ Khaled said the news about Bryant’s death was “devastating.”

Actor Priyanka Chopra also paid tribute to the late basketball star Bryant in a special way. She took a moment to style her decorated nails with the number “24” written on her index finger. “RIP Mamba,” Priyanka shared on her Instagram page with a purple heart emoji, alongside an image of her tribute. While attending the Grammys, she walked arm-in-arm with her husband and singer Nick Jonas, wearing a custom Ralph & Russo design, which featured a plunging neckline and also included diamond-adorned pieces, fringe sleeves and intricate embroidery.

Outside Staples Centre, fans wearing Bryant’s No 8 and No 24 jerseys flocked to the arena to show their respect for the Laker legend. A few hundred people gathered at LA Live in front of a mega screen with a smiling Bryant that read, “In Loving Memory of KOBE BRYANT 1978-2020”.

With tears running down her cheeks, Demi Lovato stood on the Grammys’ stage in a white ballgown and belted her new single Anyone, written just four days before her near fatal overdose in July 2018. It was the 27-year-old’s first time at the Grammy Awards in two years and her first big performance since that fateful day.

At age 61, Tanya Tucker has won the first two Grammy Awards of her career, 48 years after her first hit at age 13. Tucker won best country album for While I’m Livin’, her first album of original material in 17 years. She also won best country song for Bring My Flowers Now, which is also nominated for overall song of the year. Tucker has been nominated for Grammys 14 times. He is still very young compared to the winner of the other major country Grammy, 86-year-old Willie Nelson, who took home best country solo performance for Ride Me Back Home. It was Nelson’s ninth Grammy.

Hildur Guðnadóttir took home a Grammy for music she first thought no one would care to hear. The female composer won best score soundtrack for the HBO miniseries Chernobyl during the pre-telecast ceremony. The soundtrack already won her an Emmy late last year. And in January she became the first woman in 19 years to win best original score for Joker at the Golden Globes. “I think it fit really well with the images of the film, and I was happy with how the music worked with the narrative and characters in this series,” she said backstage of the Chernobyl soundtrack. “But I never thought anyone would ever listen to the soundtrack record, honestly. I’ve very surprised to be here today.”

Michelle Obama is a Grammy winner. The former first lady won her first Grammy Award for best spoken word album for the audio book of her 2019 memoir Becoming. Obama was not on hand to accept the award. Her husband, former president Barack Obama, has two Grammys in the same category, one for his 2005 audio book Dreams of My Father and another for his 2007 audio book The Audacity of Hope. The spoken word album category includes poetry, storytelling and audio books.

Beyoncé’s Homecoming has won the Grammy Award for best music film. The Netflix film weaves together Beyoncé’s 2018 performances at the Coachella music festival, which included numerous nods to historically black colleges and universities.

158,28-1-20,"Sacred Games, Mirzapur among most-searched web content","Astudy on most searched OTT content reveals that Sacred Games, Mirzapur, Made In Heaven, Criminal Justice and Lust Stories have been appreciated globally.

According to a study by SEMrush, the most searched for web series online was Sacred Games followed by Mirzapur, Made In Heaven, Criminal Justice and Lust Stories. Each was searched on an average of 5.01, 3.51, 1.93, 1.77, and 1.37 lakh times respectively during the period mentioned. The global research tracked the most-searched web content between January and December 2019.

The study shows there is a huge audience that wants to see on-screen, life-like characters facing real-world challenges. Fernando Angulo, head of communications at the Boston-based SEMrush, said, “Indian cinema has come a long way. Our study shows that the Indian audience is very sophisticated and have access to content that is at par with what Hollywood produces. What makes web series even better than Hollywood fare is that Indian audience find it relatable. It also has the character depth and narrative equal to the best anywhere”.

While crime-based series have a huge following, web-series centred on romance and cricket are popular as well. The study found, of the 10 most searched web series, Inside Edge, which delves into the highs and lows of a fictional T20 cricket franchise, was searched an average 84,000 times.

Selection Day, another cricket-based series, was the 10th most explored web-series. Angulo added, “Our study is beneficial to brands that want to reach a sophisticated, cosmopolitan, enlightened audience that believes in societal change. We provide brands with the opportunity to associate themselves with stars and stories that are thriving online. Brands can include narratives of popular web series into their advertising. For instance, a brand that wants to reach young, professional, independent, and affluent women has a mirror into such women’s wants.

159,28-1-20,The unseen world,"India Art Fair presents artworks by sculptor Girjesh Kumar Singh and a show titled 30x30 by Gallerie Ganesha. While the former reflects the trauma of our contemporary society, the latter showcases never seen before works by masters

The sculpted terracotta heads by Baroda-based artist Girjesh Kumar Singh compel you to gaze and mull over the medium, message and mood at a time when there is a debate on humanism and identity. His Laga Chunri Mein Daag at Rukshaan Art Booth, which will be displayed at India Art Fair, is, therefore, a community of lively and connected spirits.

Art centre director Rukshaan, who often brings artists with alternative voices from Baroda, says, “His sculptures are made from broken bricks of destroyed homes as they reflect the trauma we are living with in our contemporary societies.” He has collected these broken bricks from his home town in Uttar Pradesh and other Indian cities. It highlights his interest in destroyed building sites and their legacy.

Girjesh’s tensile terracotta faces line the walls and grab your attention instantly, simply because they are invested with his life’s experiences. The artist combines destruction with something human and historical and brings forth the difficult truths which are too often suppressed or ignored.

His portraits of charismatic men and women depict humanity in more ways than one. “I try to showcase all kinds of faces. They’re not of any specific community but maybe native Americans, Europeans, minorities and sages with their hair bunched up. The expressions on each face are distinct, definite and powerful, some joyful, some serene, others stern. Others smirk at you, some have a cynical look and some even frown. But each one is worth watching. Girjesh has deep observational skills and is able to translate emotions onto the terracotta profiles. Perhaps it is their inner state, worries and tribulations that are being unveiled.

The strong cement-brick bond he works with holds multiple metaphors — of construction and demolition in our own lives. With every road we take, our old memories stay with us. The cement that binds the bricks remains even after a building is razed to the ground. Themes of identity and migration define his work. “You migrate from one place to another but never leave a place fully —the emotions become a part of your identity,” says Girjesh.

He is interested in the history of his materials as he wants to know the actual past events, architectural structures and the human narratives that established them.

By reintroducing a human element to these objects, the artist reminds us that the meaning of buildings, their homeliness and utility can only exist through our interpretations. Furthermore, by asking us to consider the lives of the people who might once have inhabited them, he also poses inevitably emotional questions about current human situations: “Where people might be and what has become of their lives?”

India Art Fair will also present the 30th anniversary of Gallerie Ganesha through its show titled 30x30, curated by gallery director Shobha Bhatia. There will be a collection of 30 artworks by celebrated Indian artists. Says Shobha, “We have represented these 30 artists over the years but their works have never been seen before. Paresh Maity’s large canvas on Gandhiji’s Dandi march, Sakti Burman’s dreamlike work, Alok Uniyal’s introspective portrayal of a girl, Avijit Dutta’s take on nature’s bounty, Devdatta Padekar’s poignant painting on human relationships — these new works are some of the major highlights amongst others. Although modern art movement in India is comparatively recent, we have always had a rich heritage and tradition in art. Paintings from the Indian miniature series, dating back to the 16th century or the even older tribal and folk art, have inspired many artist in recent times. In spite of the colonial influence, almost subjugation, of Indian art, the Bengal School kept alive the Indian legend. While Indian artists welcomed the European technique and style, the soul of Indian art remained connected to their traditional heritage. The exhibition attempts to highlight the fact that the essence of all things Indian, including art, is in the traditional and its aesthetics, by virtue of its deep rooted ancient heritage which is spiritually linked too.”

Some of the sections of Indian art that will be exhibited are folk and tribal, Bengal school artists, modernists and contemporary masters. Artists include Jangarh Singh Shyam, Japani Shyam, Neelkant Choudhary, Umashankar Shah, K.S.Kulkarni, Satish Gujral, Sakti Burman, A.Ramachandran, Maite Delteil, Shyamal Datta Ray, Ganesh Pyne, Paresh Maity, Jayasri Burman, Avijit Dutta, Devdatta Padekar, Maya Burman, Vinita Karim, Asit Haldar, Kshitendranath Majumdar, Mukul Dey, Haren Das, Dhirendranath Brahma, Suhas Roy, Laxma Goud, Sisir Sahana, Nayanaa Kanodia, Badri Narayan, Alok Uniyal and Neeraj Goswami.

160,28-1-20,The poetry of earth,"Through his solo exhibition, Growing Wild, artist Rajesh Ram depicts the loss of nature as he feels urbanisation has taken over

The life-size bronze sculptures and oil paintings by artist Rajesh Ram at the Palette Art Gallery might grab your attention instantly. His solo exhibition, Growing Wild, explores and confronts the interactions between nature and human culture.

Says the artist, “Nature and human culture have inspired me in their own ways. My works were related to Panchatantra and my wife has been into urban farming. This gave me the opportunity to connect closely with nature. I also have a family background of farmers. So this is automatically reflected in my works.”

Humans have often defined themselves in relation to each other. Through his work, Rajesh draws his boyhood memories of village life, intertwined with the moral teachings. He also explores the binaries of human and animal, rural and urban contexts. “I draw a lot from my experiences in Jharkhand, which has traditionally lived close to nature. Over time, nature has lost its beauty and urbanisation has taken over. The concrete building have replaced the beauty of trees and mountains and plants are nowadays merely a showpiece,” says Ramesh.

At the heart of Ramesh’s work is the man who is hopeful. Talking about the title of the exhibition, Rakesh says, “Nature has been my inspiration for this exhibition. Growth and development are part of life. It is the character of nature to grow in its own way. The title is inspired by this.”

The medium used in his work is bronze, which has continued to co-exist with nature since long and proven to have had a long-lasting effect on the same. His work addresses the contradictions of growth and of favouring one species over the rest. The work also speaks of the loss of nature, the contested space of individual and the cost of human progress. The three accompanying paintings appear to demonstrate man-animal harmony where the laws of the jungle prescribe the rules of society. They also suggest a desire for balance within and between ecosystems.

161,28-1-20,"‘Darkness is transparent, you can see through’","Artist Shambhavi says you can reacquaint yourself with your country through its cultural traditions

We talk about soil and clay. She says that working with them heals — emotionally and physically. There is talk of childhood memories. She says all the dust had vanished and her memory is now crystal clear. She recounts the watermill back in her village in Bihar. A composition of water, sound, light, the splash on the iron sheets, the entire musicality of it. “In the evening, when you looked down the well, there were innumerable fireflies hanging there. How does one describe that?,” smiles Shambhavi.

It’s a hectic day for the painter, printmaker and installation artist whose non-figurative work has always dwelled upon the condition of the farming community. As she takes a break from guiding her staff for the forthcoming solo exhibition Burukuwa Dwan, the artist, whose work Cosmic Seeds Light was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York, says, “You’ll see the mud-and-hay textured walls of their houses, the grey mist that rises from the field on winter mornings explores various facets of interplay between man, nature and art.”

In fact, Bhoomi, another solo show by her will be running simultaneously at Gallery Espace, which will have her iron sculptures and installations. Interestingly, the conversation with Shambhavi is not linear, her striking work at 2018 Kochi Biennale Maati Ma, featuring four of her works — Lullaby, Water Garland, Rippers Melody and Brail takes the conversation forward and what the viewers will experience in her forthcoming exhibitions as she exhibits in the capital after a gap of six years.

The artist, whose poetic work forever carries social undertones says, “Burukuwa is the last star. The moment villagers see it, they know it’s 4 am and time to start the day. It is a magical hour. When you’re half asleep, the kind of sound that comes with their activities of getting ready for the day is reminiscent of musicians on the stage getting ready for a performance. The sound, the light, the last musings of the night, and the farmer’s first glance at the fields early morning — these are the connections I have grown up with as I would frequently go to my grandparents’ place in the village. But these are also the relationships people are increasingly refusing to see — that’s where my work Braille comes in.”

In many ways, when Shambhavi takes the farmers’ tools from their world and makes sculptures out of them, she is in fact pleading for them. This Patna College of Arts and Crafts pass-out adds, “But remember, my education is mostly from experience rather than reading.” For someone who now lives in Delhi’s urban landscape, there is no dichotomy. “I am clear that I don’t see here. I want to say something here, about them. And maybe my art can make a bridge.”

Talking about her association with Takshila Foundation’s programme in Bihar’s countryside, the artist says, “We run long-term residencies for international and national artists and students at Siwan, so that they actually get to connect to rural landscape at all levels and understand the multiple dimensions of living that life.”

Back in the late 80s when she was a scholar at Lalit Kala Akademi Regional Centre in Lucknow and painted huge canvasses, most people called them abstracts. “Believe me, at that time, I didn’t even know the “A” of abstract. I painted the riverbank and my village engulfed in darkness — when there was no electricity. The drawings were realistic but they were covered with dark and everyone read it as abstract art. Yes, I painted very clear dark because darkness is transparent, you can see through.”

Travelling abroad extensively for residencies and shows and the consequent edistance’ from home allowed her to so things here more clearly. “When you travel you read your homeland much better, perceptions change. When I am in Bihar, I am not Bihari, when I am out, I am. The moment I leave India, I am more Indian. Out there, you’re questioned about India and not regions. When such questions are posed, you embrace the whole country. And I cherish the fact that I got such experiences from a very young age — a time when I was not very politically or intellectually charged. You know, I made it a point to travel to most countries without reading about them. When I came back, then read. It has always been the other way round for me. This way, it becomes a fresh experience with the land — travelling to the unknown.”

Insisting that art and music makes one understand a country much more effectively, she adds, “It was a huge experience to see people going to the museum as if it was a temple — something completely absent here. That gives you a kick to keep working. In India, we may have a very small art world but the world we live in is amazing. Connection with creativity is so well presented there which inspires you. Here we are still distant.”

As the conversation veers towards the need for an overhaul in art school curriculums, she asserts, “It is in such a run down state. We haven’t come out of the British system yet. It’s shocking to see that they don’t even understand the difference between art and decoration. Not just art schools, the entire school curriculum needs to be looked at. We all study maths in school and realise that everyone doesn’t become a mathematician. But at least when a mathematician is sitting with me, I understand who is he. Then why is it that when an artist is around, we tend to think that what he does is some kind of an extra-curricular’ activity?”

The countryside may have always inspired Shambhavi, but she also sees how it has metamorphosed over the years. “Now when I go, I can experience the emptiness there. The warmth has faded, of course my grandparent’s generation is no longer there, cousins have scattered. There is a strong isolation, a feeling of being left out. The pressure and crisis of currency is now very visible.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---darkness-is-transparent--you-can-see-through----2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---darkness-is-transparent--you-can-see-through---.html

163,28-1-20,Chinese Premier visits Coronavirus-hit Wuhan,"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the coronavirus hit Wuhan city on Monday, the first such trip by a top leader as the death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases.

Li arrived in Wuhan to inspect the epidemic control and prevention work, state-run China Daily reported.

He heads the high-powered group of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) officials empowered to deal with the rapidly spreading virus on war footing.

Ahead of his visit, Chinese health authorities announced the death toll due to coronavirus has sharply increased to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases.

The confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus officially described as 2019-nCoV included 461 patients who are in critical condition. Sunday saw 769 new confirmed cases, 3,806 new suspected cases and 24 deaths, all in Hubei province of which Wuhan is the provincial capital, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.

The NHC on Sunday said the new coronavirus is contagious even in its incubation period, which lasts up to 14 days, and that the virus’ ability to spread is getting stronger.

By the end of Sunday, the pneumonia situation resulted in 80 deaths. As many as 51 people have recovered while there were currently 5,794 suspected cases, it said A total of 32,799 close contacts have been traced, the commission said, adding that among them 583 were discharged from medical observation on Sunday, with 30,453 others remaining under medical observation.

Mongolia has not recorded any cases of the pneumonia-like virus.

Vice Prime Minister Enkhtuvshin Ulziisaikhan said the decision was made because cases have been confirmed in China’s neighbouring region of Inner Mongolia.

165,28-1-20,Dems demand Bolton testify at Trump’s impeachment trial,"The stakes over witness testimony at President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial are rising now that a draft of a book from former national security adviser John Bolton appears to undercut a key defence argument.

Bolton writes in the forthcoming book that Trump told him that he wanted to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with politically charged investigations, including into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump’s legal team has repeatedly insisted that the Republican president never tied the suspension of military assistance to the country to investigations that he wanted into Biden and his son.

The account immediately gave Democrats new fuel in their pursuit of sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses, a question expected to be taken up later this week by the Republican-led Senate. The trial resumes Monday afternoon with arguments from Trump’s defence team.

Bolton’s account was first reported by The New York Times and was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity to discuss the book, “The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir”, ahead of its release March 17.

When the Times report went online Sunday night, the seven House Democratic managers immediately called on all senators to insist that Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other relevant documents. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, issued the same call.

Trump denied the claims in a series of tweets early Monday. “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,” Trump said in a tweet. “In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”

Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call and statements by Ukraine President Vlodymyr Zelinskiy that there was no pressure for such investigations to get the aid.

He also falsely claimed Monday morning that the Democrat-controlled House “never even asked John Bolton to testify”. In fact, Democrats did ask Bolton to testify, but he didn’t show up for his deposition. They later declined to subpoena Bolton, as they had others, because he threatened to sue, which could lead to a prolonged court battle..

Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on September 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president’s order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.

“Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President — that starts with Mr Bolton,” the impeachment managers said in a statement.

First, though, Trump’s legal team will begin laying out its case in depth, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/dems-demand-bolton-testify-at-trump---s-impeachment-trial.html

“The most honest thing we could do now would be early elections... To ask people whether they trust me and they want me to continue to work,” added Sarec, who became Prime Minister in September 2018 following a previous snap election.

Sarec, 42, is Slovenia’s youngest-ever Prime Minister. He was previously best known as a comedian and political satirist before he launched himself as an anti-establishment politician.

In the face of “repeated violations by the United States and Europe, Iran does not have the right to use Article 36 (of the deal) despite several written notifications to European officials,” Zarif said, without elaborating how Iran had been denied that right.

“We do not accept such racism,” he added.

Britain, France and Germany announced on January 14 that they had triggered the dispute mechanism provided under Article 36 of the nuclear agreement, but have said they remained committed to the deal.

In an exchange on Twitter, he told The Associated Press that he saw two bodies and the front of the aircraft was badly burned. He added that aircraft’s body and tail was hardly damaged. His information could not be independently verified.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said a US airforce plane crashed in the Ghazni province. He claimed the crash killed “lots” of US service members.

Ghazniwal said the crash site was about 10 kilometers from a US military base.

US Army Maj. Beth Riordan, a spokeswoman for US Central Command, declined to comment when told about the Taliban claim.

170,28-1-20,Boost your immunity,"Dr B T Chidananda Murthy is a Chief Medical Officer at Jindal Naturecure Institute, bengaluru

Winter and illness go hand in glove. While the flu and the sniffle is just a minor hassle for most, it is not the case for people with a weak constitution. If you have a compromised immune system, suffer from seizure disorders, or any other debilitating sickness, then we are sure you know that even a small cold can turn into a medical emergency, requiring you to make a trip to the hospital. Keeping yourself cocooned in a hypoallergenic bubble is also not an option. Doing that may keep the illness away but it is not going to magically improve your immunity. What preventive measures can you take to keep yourself safe from undetermined illnesses without disrupting your daily routines? Let’s take a look

Take care of your gut: The health of your digestive system is directly proportional to the robustness of your immune system. Make sure you incorporate a good probiotic supplement in your daily diet. If that is not possible, include probiotic foods like sauerkraut, kefir milk, kombucha, and yogurt. It will help maintain the balance of good bacteria in your gut, keeping your immune system healthy.

Avoid immunosuppressant foods: Caffeine, alcohol, white sugar and fatty foods suppress your immune system. Consuming a lot of fat-rich food items can also clog up your lymphatic system, making it more difficult for your body to fight infection. Wean yourself of such food items slowly to increase your body’s natural defenses.

Do plenty of exercises: Exercise helps boost the immune system by improving your circulation and reducing stress. The better the blood circulation, the more freely antibodies can move around in your bloodstream, making it easier for body to fight off illnesses. Exercise also reduces the level of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, increasing your lymphocyte count and improving immune function.

Observe sleep hygiene: Sleep is essential to keep the immune system in good shape, and yet it is something we tend to overlook often. You must aim to get at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night to help your body repair itself from the damage caused by daily stressors, toxin exposure, and exercise.

Drink plenty of juices: Fresh juices contain a lot of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that help keep the immune system healthy in the winter. Adding ingredients like spinach, broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts, beetroot, berries and apples will bolster your immune system and keep it functioning at peak capacity.

Keep your skin from drying out: The dehydration and cold winter breeze can render your skin dry and flaky. The best elixir for dry skin is coconut oil. Apply it externally to keep your skin moist and fresh. Not only does it prevent your skin from flaking up, but it also strengthens the underlying connective tissue. Incorporating organic ghee in your daily diet also helps dealing with winter dryness apart from keeping your body warm.

Detoxify your body: No matter what the season, your body can always do with a little detoxification. Squeeze out a slice of lemon into a glass of lukewarm water, add a pinch of parsley and drink it before breakfast. It is effective at eliminating toxins from the system. Cabbage juice, rosemary tea, and ginger-tulsi tea are also equally good.

Diet and Nutrition: Plays a vital role in improving the immune response. Consume more citrus fruits, garlic, ginger, honey, cloves, kale, spinach, broccoli, yogurt and many others.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/docyard---boost-your-immunity-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/docyard---boost-your-immunity.html
171,28-1-20,Concussion substitute introduced in IPL,"The title clash of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be held in Mumbai on May 24 and the night matches will have usual 8pm start as the Governing Council decided against changing the timings, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly announced on Monday.

“There will be no change in the timing of IPL night games. It will start from 8 pm like earlier years,” Ganguly told reporters after the IPL Governing Council meeting.

“We will have only five double headers (4pm and 8 pm) this time. We have decided to reduce the number of double headers,” Ganguly said adding that the “final will be held in Mumbai.”

In a first, concussion substitute and ‘third umpire no ball’ will also be introduced in the upcoming edition of the popular T20 league, the former India captain informed.

“The concussion substitute and the no ball rule are new additions for the season,” he said.

In a noble gesture, the BCCI will have an ‘All Stars Game’ between all top international players before start of the IPL on March 29 for a charitable cause.

“It will be an IPL All Stars Game three days before start of IPL. The venue is not Ahmedabad as it is still not match ready.

172,28-1-20,India start favourites vs Aus,"Indian wrist spinner Ravi Bishnoi’s repertoire of skills will meet a match in Australian Tanveer Sangha’s variations in a face-off between two talented tweakers during the quarter-final of the ICC U-19 World Cup here today.

The white ball cricket in recent times has seen wrist spinners emerge as an important cog and junior cricket is no different where Bishnoi, easily the tournament’s most impactful bowler, would like to give his team the advantage over the Australian side.

With 10 wickets from three games, Bishnoi has proved why Kings XI Punjab has invested Rs 2 crore on him during the auction.

Statistically, even Sangha has been at his best with 10 wickets with 5 for 14 against minnows Nigeria. But there’s been a four-wicket haul against the West Indies and a wicket to show against England for the player of Indian origin.

Today, both the wrist spinners will be key to their team’s chances and Australia will look to improve their dismal record against India at the junior level.

In the last five U-19 encounters since 2013 (different teams have played though), India have won four with one game being abandoned due to rain.

As a team, India are way ahead both in terms of quality as well as temperament with the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal (two half-centuries), his opening partner Divyansh Saxena and skipper Priyam Garg showing glimpses of their talent.

In the bowling department, lanky UP boy Kartik Tyagi, who breaches the 140 kmph barrier quite regularly, and left-arm seamer Akash Singh, moving the white ball back into the right-handers, are a heady combination.

And there is left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar, who came back brilliantly against the Junior Black Caps despite being attacked early on. He got three crucial breakthroughs but a finger fracture in his right hand could be an impediment while fielding.

While Jaiswal, Garg, NT Tilak Verma and Saxena make India’s batting look strong, Australia skipper Mckenzie Harvey (nephew of former Australian all-rounder Ian Harvey) is a tough customer with the bat as he showed with an innings of 65 against England in their final group game.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-start-favourites-vs-aus.html
173,28-1-20,Sean puts Zim on front,"A fine second Test century by Sean Williams enabled Zimbabwe to dominate the opening day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Harare on Monday, as they reached 352 for six at the close.

The Zimbabwe captain, who won the toss and chose to bat first, made 107 from 137 balls, an innings which swung between the swashbuckling, with 10 fours and three sixes, and the pragmatic.

He was well backed up by Brendan Taylor who made a run-a-ball 62 and Sikandar Raza who hit two sixes and four fours in his 72.

Looking to bounce back from last week's 10-wicket defeat in the first Test, Zimbabwe pressed on in the evening with Regis Chakabva on 31 and debutant Tinotenda Mutombodzi on 10.

The win clinched a 3-1 series victory for England.

Set to make a world record 466 to win, South Africa reached 181 for two before Stokes bowled home captain Faf du Plessis for 35.

In the next over man-of-the-match Wood dismissed Rassie van der Dussen for 98. He went on to claim four for 54 to finish with match figures of nine for 100.

Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma shone briefly but South Africa were bowled out for 274.

Van der Dussen and Du Plessis batted for all but 13 minutes of an extended two-and-a-half hour afternoon session to give South Africa some hope, making the England bowlers toil on a hot afternoon.

But Stokes bowled a ball which hit a crack and kept low, deflecting off the toe of Du Plessis’ bat into the stumps.

Van der Dussen looked set for a maiden Test century but in the next over he fell to Wood two short of the landmark.

It was the second wicket for Stokes — both which came at crucial times shortly before an interval. His first victim was opening batsman Dean Elgar, who was caught and bowled playing an awkward pull shot in the penultimate over before lunch. Stokes finished with two for 47.

De Kock and Bavuma batted brightly in a fifth wicket stand of 48 before Broad bowled a vicious bouncer which Bavuma gloved to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.

Broad had Dwaine Pretorius caught at fine leg in his next over and the rest followed.

Vernon Philander, playing in his last Test, struck a couple of beefy blows before falling to Wood who supplied the coup de grace, another lifting ball flicking Anrich Nortje’s glove on its way through to Buttler down the legside.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/england-thump-sa-for-series-win.html
175,28-1-20,Loss of a legend,"Nine people were killed in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of NBA star Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Los Angeles officials confirmed on Sunday.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said eight passengers and the pilot of the aircraft died in the accident.

“There were no survivors... There were nine people on board the aircraft, the pilot plus eight individuals,” Villanueva said.

The helicopter crashed in foggy weather in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas. Authorities said firefighters received a call at 9:47 am about the crash, which caused a brush fire on a hillside.

The Los Angeles Police Department air support division grounded its helicopters until the fog lifted in the afternoon due to the weather conditions.

“The weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,” said police spokesman Josh Rubenstein.

Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said firefighters had to hike to the site with medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the blaze.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed that Bryant’s daughter Gianna was among the victims.

“LA is grieving with the Bryant family over the loss of Gianna, who perished with her father and friends in today’s tragedy,” Garcetti wrote on Twitter.

Gianna was one of Bryant’s four children with his wife Vanessa.

The retired NBA star, 41, and Gianna were flying to a game his daughter was expected to play in when their helicopter crashed, according to US reports.

Local media said the other victims included another player and a parent.

Orange Coast College confirmed that its baseball coach, John Altobelli, 56, was also on board the helicopter.

Fabiano Caruana capped a brilliant performance with another fine victory coming at the expense of Vladislav Artemiev of Russia and won the tournament with a huge two points margin over world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway, who finished second.

Caruana ended the event with a whopping ten points out of a possible 13, a feat that was achieved by Garry Kasparov in 1999 and Magnus Carlsen in 2013.

Carlsen often finishes in second place when he doesn't win, but trailing the winner by two points is something the Norwegian is not used to.

Wesley SO of United States finished third scoring seven and a half points in all, a half point ahead of Daniil Dubov of Russia and surprise packet Jorden Van Foreest of Holland.

Anand, raised expectations of an improved finish by beating Alireza Firouza in the 11th round but following two back-to-back draws thereafter, the Indian ace finished on a 50 percent score.

Anand finished joints sixth alongside Anish Giri of Holland, Jeffery Xiong of United States, Duda, Artemiev and Firouzja.

In the challengers' section, things worked out well for the Indian duo of Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Nihal Sarin as they both won their games for a good finish. Sarin defeated Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan in what was a clinical display while Ganguly crashed through the defences of Anton Smirnov of Australia.

David Anton Guijarro of Spain won the Challengers on 8.5 points to qualify for the Masters section next year. Uzbek teenaged Grandmaster Nodirbek Abdusattarov finished second on tiebreak ahead of Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine and Erwin L'Ami of Holland.

177,28-1-20,We have identified the core of players for T20 World Cup: Rathour,"Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers ""incredible"" and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

""Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I don't see many changes happening,"" said Rathour.

With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of a youngsters including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar and Shivam Dube.

The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

""This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different format, different grounds and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (here in NZ)) was outstanding actually,” he said.

India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the team's cause.

""The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

""Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see,"" he said.

Rathour feels Iyer's mindset makes him a better player.

""Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mind set is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mind set I think helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has,"" he said.

When asked about the ability of current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, “Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but it's not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.""

Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said: ""Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with times. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I don't think it is that big a difference.

""It is more of a mind set thing and about game plan. As a coach, I don't think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.""

The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt. Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there won't be many alterations to the team's strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

""You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I don't think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, doesn't make any difference.

""On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly,” he said.

Since his appointment as batting coach of the senior team, a part of Rathour's brief has been to bring up the younger batsmen in the side. In that aspect, he expressed satisfaction in terms of how the younger generation is coming through via A-tours.

""A-tour helps a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatized to the conditions. I think that's a great idea and that's working really well for our team.

""The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you can't do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

""Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You don't see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc,"" he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-have-identified-the-core-of-players-for-t20-world-cup--rathour-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-have-identified-the-core-of-players-for-t20-world-cup--rathour.html
178,28-1-20,Real on top with win,"Real Madrid moved top of La Liga for the first time since October on Sunday after grinding out a 1-0 win away at Real Valladolid to make Barcelona pay for their surprise defeat to Valencia.

It is 16 weeks since Madrid last finished a round top of the pile and it looked like a scrappy contest at the Jose Zorilla would end goalless until Nacho Hernandez headed in the winner with 12 minutes remaining.

Victory means Zinedine Zidane’s side pull three points ahead of Barca, whose 2-0 loss away at the Mestalla on Saturday under new coach Quique Setien could prove a turning point in a nip-and-tuck title race.

“Nothing changes, we are happy with the win,” said Zidane. “There are 16 games left and we will have to fight until the end if we want something. Nothing changes.”

Madrid now have the luxury of hosting their struggling city rivals Atletico Madrid, who are 10 points back after a goalless home draw with Leganes, with a cushion next weekend, not to mention on the back of a 19-game unbeaten run.

“We are top of the table again after being there a long time ago,” said captain Sergio Ramos. “We have to keep going.”

“Defensively what we are doing we are doing very well, it is our strength,” said Zidane.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/real-on-top-with-win.html
179,28-1-20,"All senior players, Klopp to miss FA Cup replay","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp confirmed he will not take charge of the Reds’ FA Cup replay against Shrewsbury, nor will any senior players from the European champions take part.

Klopp made 11 changes as the League One side, 59 places below Liverpool in the English football pyramid, came from 2-0 down to secure a replay at Anfield on Sunday.

However, the German did still include a handful of experienced players such as Adrian, Joel Matip, Dejan Lovren, Fabinho and Divock Origi.

Even they are set to miss the replay as it falls a few days into Liverpool’s two-week winter break from Premier League action.

Klopp said he has already promised that week off to first-team players and that under-23s coach Neil Critchley will take charge of team.

Liverpool went out of the League Cup in December when a team fielding five debutants and an average age of 19 was beaten 5-0 by Aston Villa.

Critchley was also in charge for that game with Klopp and the first team away in Qatar for the Club World Cup.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/all-senior-players--klopp-to-miss-fa-cup-replay.html
180,28-1-20,Past haunts the present,"Piotr Zielinski and Lorenzo Insigne scored in the second half as struggling Napoli shocked champions Juventus 2-1 to spoil coach Maurizio Sarri’s return to the Stadio San Paolo on Sunday.

Sarri had not been back to Naples since being sacked in May 2018 after three successful campaigns, and before moving to Chelsea.

This season he has taken over eight-time reigning champions Juve, a move seen as a betrayal by his former team, the two-time Serie A runners-up.

Juve missed the chance to open up a six-point lead on Inter Milan at the top of the table, after Antonio Conte’s side were held for their third consecutive draw.

Inter are three points behind Juve with Lazio a further two points adrift in third after city rivals Roma ended Simone Inzaghi’s side’s 11-match winning streak.

“It is pleasant and exciting to go back,” said Sarri despite the whistles and insulting banners of his former fans, reserving his criticism for his “under-par, mentally bland” team.

“We lost a match against an opponent who had done the minimum to win,” he added.

“We were passive throughout the game, always halfway between pressure and waiting, we made mistakes.”

In Naples, Zielinski broke the deadlock after 63 minutes finishing off a rebound after Insigne was denied by Juve goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.

Insigne volleyed in a second after 86 minutes to an explosion of joy among the crowd.

Cristiano Ronaldo pulled a goal back as the game headed into injury time for his 13th goal in nine consecutive games in all competitions.

The visitors pushed for the equaliser but Alex Meret smothered Gonzalo Higuain’s goal-bound effort, as Juve crashed to just their second defeat of the season.

181,28-1-20,PSG go 10 points clear,"Neymar dedicated his second goal in Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-0 win at Lille to basketball legend Kobe Bryant, whose death in a helicopter crash earlier on Sunday shocked the world, as his double shot the French champions 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1.

The world’s most expensive player slotted home the 52nd-minute penalty and went over to television cameras by the side of the Stade Pierre Mauroy pitch to make the number 24 with his fingers in honour of Bryant’s shirt number.

“It’s deeply saddening for the world of sport and for all of us,” said Neymar to Canal+ after the win, which put PSG 10 points clear at the top of the league.

“Not just for basketball fans, but for everything he did for sport.”

He had already put his side ahead with a fine strike in the first half before putting the game out of reach and increasing the gap between them and second-placed Marseille.

His 12th league goal of the season tipped the balance in the Parisians’ favour after a positive start for the home side, who were unbeaten at home ahead of the match.

“We deserved to win, I think we played well,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel.

“We controlled the match and counter-attacks and this is not easy to do against a good team like Lille.”

182,28-1-20,Nadal settles Kyrgios score,"Rafael Nadal won a grudge match with Nick Kyrgios to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals and keep the heat on Roger Federer’s record for Grand Slam titles on Monday.

The world number one, labelled “super salty” by Kyrgios after he criticised the Australian’s behaviour last year, fought off a furious challenge to go through 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (7/4).

As the tennis world mourned the death of Kobe Bryant, Kyrgios arrived at Rod Laver Arena wearing an LA Lakers shirt, and 15-year-old Coco Gauff had tributes to the basketball great scrawled on her trainers during the doubles.

Nadal and Kyrgios had been feuding after some bad-tempered matches but the Spaniard said he was impressed by what he’d seen from the often-temperamental Australian at this tournament.

Kyrgios fought back to challenge Nadal in a high-octane clash played in good spirit, with a polite handshake afterwards — a far cry from some of their previous exchanges.

“When he is playing like today with this positive attitude he gives a lot of positive things to our sport,” said the Spaniard.

“He’s one of the highest talents we have on our tour and I like the Nick Kyrgios during the whole of this tournament.”

The 19-time Grand Slam winner will next play Austria’s Dominic Thiem — his victim in the last two French Open finals — as the clay king targets Federer’s all-time record of 20 Major titles.

Elsewhere, powerful Swiss Stan Wawrinka beat fifth seed Daniil Medvedev 6-2, 2-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 to set up a quarter-final with Germany’s Alexander Zverev, who overcame close friend Andrey Rublev 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

And Simona Halep rose to number two in the world with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Elise Mertens, taking a big step forward in a rapidly clearing women’s draw.

The Wimbledon champion from Romania, who avoided an exodus of top seeds in the previous round, will next play Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit, a 6-7 (4/7), 7-5, 7-5 winner against Iga Swiatek of Poland.

“She’s strong. I’m here just to face any challenge I have. So I’m not thinking negative,” Halep said of Kontaveit. “I just want to go there and to give my best.”

Angelique Kerber, the 2016 champion, was the latest big name to fall as she went down to Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.

Pavlyuchenkova’s quarter-final will be against Garbine Muguruza, the two-time Grand Slam champion who is resurgent since reuniting with coach Conchita Martinez, beating Kiki Bertens 6-3, 6-3.

“It’s like couples, we all want Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together, right?” joked Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion.

Earlier, Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe were among the big names to criticise Court, the 24-time Major-winner whose 1970 sweep of the Grand Slam titles was marked with a short ceremony at Rod Laver Arena.

Navratilova said the devout Christian’s deeply conservative views were “actually hurting people”, while fellow American legend McEnroe called Court a “crazy aunt”.

In today’s quarter-finals, six-time champion Roger Federer will play America’s Tennys Sandgren and title-holder Novak Djokovic, going for his eighth title, is against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic.

The 22-year-old Sarfaraz, who had hit an unbeaten triple-hundred in the last game against Uttar Pradesh, took a listless HP attack to cleaners, hitting 32 fours and four sixes during his unbeaten 226-run knock.

Electing to bowl the picturesque HPCA stadium, the home pacers exploited the windy conditions, grabbing three quick wickets to leave Mumbai reeling at 16 for three.

Sarfaraz started the rescue act first by conjuring up a 55-run stand with ‘crisis man’ Siddhesh Lad (20), to steady Mumbai’s ship.

And then he found an able alley in Aditya Tare (62), with whom he added 143-runs for the fifth wicket.

Mumbai lost its fifth wicket on 214 and Sarfaraz with Shubham Ranjane (44 not out) then put an unbroken 158-run stand, before umpires drew stumps early owing to bad light after 75 overs.

It was Sarfaraz show once again as he will strive to reach his second successive triple hundred, a rare feat in any form of cricket.

Majumdar leads bengal

Kolkata: Anustup Majumdar hit a unbeaten 94 under pressure to help Bengal reach 286 for five in Group A match against Delhi at Eden Gardens.

Majumdar, who looked in formidable form, had some anxious moments as he survived a run-out chance to remain unbeaten, alongside Shahbaz Ahmed (39 not out) at the end of day one.

The home team turned the game around in the second session as Majumdar found a fine ally in wicketkeeper-batsman Shreevats Goswami (59).

Scoring above four runs per over, the duo stitched a 117-run fifth wicket stand to give Bengal the edge.

Earlier put in to bat, Bengal’s top three batsmen, including last match’s triple centurion, Manoj Tiwary (7), got out inside lunch.

Vinay grabs six

Chandigarh: Puducherry found themselves on the mat at 37 for 4 after their veteran pacer R Vinay Kumar grabbed six wickets to bowl Chandigarh out for a paltry 134 in their top of the table Plate clash.

Vinay Kumar triggered a Chandigarh middle-order collapse with twin blows in his successive overs en route to 6/32 as the hosts were dismissed after lunch inside 38 overs after they were sent in to bat.

In reply, the Plate leaders Puducherry were reeling at 37 for four, trailing by 97 runs at close on first day with Chandigarh new ball bowler Shresth Nirmohi returning with figures of 3/17.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sarfaraz---s-double-ton-rescues-mumbai.html

In a video shot inside the team bus while it was on its way to Hamilton for the third T20 International against New Zealand, Chahal is seen talking to several members of the squad including Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul.

Towards the end of the video, he moved to the rear of the bus and pointed to an empty seat which, he said, was the former captain's preferred spot before he went on a sabbatical last year.

""Yeh woh seat hai jahan ek legend baithate the. Mahi bhai. Abhi bhi yaha koi nahi baithata. Hum unhe bohot miss karte hai (This is the seat that used to be occupied a legend. MS Dhoni. No one sits here now. We miss him a lot),"" Chahal said in the video posted on 'bcci.Tv'.

The-38-year-old Dhoni has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand on July 9. Earlier this month, Dhoni was dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on his future.

However, on the same day Dhoni returned to training, batting fluently in the Jharkhand team nets.

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant divided the convicts in two groups and said one group would move out of Gujarat and stay at Indore in Madhya Pradesh.

The other group of convicts will have to relocate themselves to Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, the bench said.

The convicts, who were handed down life sentence in the Sardarpura riots case, have appealed against the Gujarat High Court order convicting them.

The court said that all the convicts will have to undertake community services for six hours a week besides reporting to the local police station on a weekly basis as bail conditions.

The Supreme Court has directed the District Legal Services Authorities at Indore and Jabalpur to ensure that the convicts observe bail conditions diligently.

It has also directed DLSA to help the convicts in finding suitable employment for earning their livelihood.

A 3-judge bench headed by Justice R Banumathi asked senior advocate Anjana Prakash, appearing for Mukesh Kumar Singh, as to how they can claim that all the facts in the case were not placed before the President when he dealt with the mercy plea.

""How can you say that these facts were not placed before his excellency the President? How can you say that there was non-application of mind by the President,"" the bench, also comprising justices Ashok Bhsuhan and A S Bopanna, asked the lawyer.

When the convict's counsel said that all facts were not placed before the President, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that all the records, exhibits and the judgment in the case were placed before the President.

Singh alleged procedural lapses in dismissal of his mercy plea by the President.

He said that certain supervening circumstances, including solitary confinement and procedural lapses have been ignored while considering his mercy plea.

His counsel contended that the executive is not sitting on power of appeal but rather exercising constitutional duty, which is neither a matter of mercy nor grace.

Prakash referred to judgements on death sentence and the power of the president to grant mercy.

He also told the court that the President's rejection of the mercy plea was on extraneous consideration as also mala fide, arbitrary and without materials.

The arguments on the plea would continue at 2 pm.

The bench is hearing Singh's plea against the dismissal of his mercy petition by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 17.

He has sought an urgent hearing on his plea against the dismissal of the mercy plea.

Addressing a youth rally here, the former Congress president blamed the BJP-led government at the Centre of creating an image for the country that deterred investors.

He claimed that one crore people lost their jobs in the past year while the Modi government had promised the creation of two crore new ones.

He urged the youth not to let their voice be suppressed and ask questions on employment and on the country's future.

The Jaipur public meeting was billed “Yuva Aakrosh Rally”, focusing on “youth anger” over unemployment.

Gandhi said that India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan. But the image is now tarnished, he claimed.

“Narendra Modi has destroyed India's image and reputation in the world. Today, India is known as the rape capital but Narendra Modi does not talk about this,” he said at the rally at Jaipur's Ramniwas Garden.

He said when the youth raise questions over unemployment and ask Modi why he “destroyed” India's image, “you are answered with bullets and are suppressed”.

He said India's biggest asset and strength are the youth, who are capable of competing with China but the government is wasting this asset.

The victory was his 102nd at Melbourne Park, surpassing his tally at Wimbledon to make the Australian Open his most successful Slam in terms of matches won.

In two decades of playing the Australian Open, he had never lost to a player ranked as low as Sandgren's 100 since 54th-ranked Arnaud Clement beat him way back in 2000.

But the unheralded American was always going to be a danger to the 20-time Grand Slam winner, having already beaten eighth seed Matteo Berrettini and 12th seed Fabio Fognini.

And he gave the Swiss star a massive scare.

Federer rattled

Both players fought off break points against their opening service games as they sized each other up.

But it was only a matter of time before Federer broke and it came in the sixth game as he began figuring out Sandgren's game, forcing errors as he took the set.

But Sandgren wasn't ready to surrender, breaking Federer for a 2-0 lead in the second when the world number three sent an overhead long.

The composed American broke again with Federer's touch abandoning him, sending down 15 unforced errors.

Playing in the mid-afternoon sun, he continued to struggle in the third, broken in his opening service game with the crowd stunned into silence.

Federer was rattled. He worked three break points when 2-0 down and when Sandgren saved two of them, the Swiss was warned for an audible obscenity, reported by the line judge after he dropped an f-bomb.

The normally unflappable star confronted the umpire and then lost three more points, again having words with the official before calling for a physio and taking a near nine-minute medical timeout.

Federer returned to hold serve but his movement was hampered and he never threatened, losing the set with another 15 unforced errors.

He grimly hung on in the fourth set, saving three match points at 5-4 and it went to a tiebreaker where more drama was in store as a ballkid collided with Sandgren at the changeover.

Federer incredibly saved another four match points before winning the tiebreak 10-8, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

His confidence sky-high, he rolled through the deciding set for a famous victory to reach the Melbourne semis for a 15th time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/federer-stages-great-escape-to-reach-australian-open-semis-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/federer-stages-great-escape-to-reach-australian-open-semis.html

202,28-1-20,Coronavirus bleeds markets,"Sensex plunges 458 points, world stocks skid as virus scare pervades

The deadly caronavirus struck the global equity market in a vicious way on Monday as China reported more cases of infection that is respecting no geographical boundaries. Driven by fear and uncertainty about the impact of the virus outbreak on global economy, exchanges across the world saw sharp selloff and oil prices co lapsed.

In India, equity benchmark Sensex on Monday clocked its second biggest fall in four months, dragged mainly by financial and metal counters as investors fear grew over the fast-spreading virus outbreak in China.

At close, the BSE gauge Sensex was 458.07 points, or 1.10 per cent, down at 41,155.12. Intra-day, the index cracked nearly 500 points. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty ended 129.25 points, or 1.06 per cent, down at 12,119.

On the Sensex chart, Tata Steel was the top loser, dropping 4.31 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI, PowerGrid and HDFC.

The Dow tumbled by nearly 500 points on opening. The S&P 500 (SPX) was down 1.6 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) was down 2.1 per cent.

European exchanges also traded more than 2 per cent lower on Monday, continuing their selloff from the previous week. In Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.9 per cent to 5,907.40, while Germany’s DAX skidded 1.7 per cent to 13,342.32.

Many Asian markets, including China’s, were closed for Lunar New Year holidays, while Australia was closed for Australia Day. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index caved in by 2 per cent to 23,343.51

Investors across the world are worried that if the second-largest economy in the world fails to recover in time from the viral outbreak, then its economy could take a big hit, which will also drag down the world economy.

While fear of economic slowdown spooked the oil prices that have corrected by more than 15 per cent during the last ten days, safe-haven assets rallied higher on Monday. The price of gold climbed 0.8 per cent to $1,583.60 per ounce.

Brent crude futures traded around 3 per cent lower on Monday at $58.88 a barrel, their lowest level since October. US crude futures were down roughly 3 per cent.

News agency PTI quoted S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities, as saying, “Coronavirus outbreak in China took a toll on Indian equities as well today as financials and metals bore the brunt of the selling. Except for select pharmaceutical stocks which held fort and gained

the broader markets traded weak.”

Meanwhile, India on Monday decided to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals from Wuhan city in the pathogen-hit Chinese province of Hubei.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, which carried out a detailed review of the situation arising out of outbreak of Coronavirus in China where 80 people have died and over 2,000 infected with the disease.

Officials said the External Affairs Ministry will request to Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indians from Wuhan.

In view of a confirmed case of coronavirus in Nepal, the Centre has asked the five States bordering the neighbouring nation (Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim) to be alert and keep hospitals ready to meet any emergency. After airports and border areas, it has now initiated entry screening at the international ports having traffic from China.

In India, a few suspected cases have been reported altogether from Patna, Mumbai and Rajasthan, but none yet confirmed. In Patna, a woman who returned from China last week was admitted to a Patna hospital on Monday with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus.

Samples of 12 passengers have been referred to National Institute of Virology, Pune. No positive case has been reported so far, the Union Health Ministry said.

Over 100 people have been kept under observation in Kerala and Maharashtra following screening for a possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. One person each from Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Pathanamthitta and Malappuram and three from Ernakulam are in isolation wards of various health centres in the State.

The Union Health Ministry on Monday said health teams have been deployed in areas along the border with Nepal at Panitanki in West Bengal and Jhulaghat and Jauljibi in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh.

The hospitals in the national capital, AIIMS and RML Hospital, have set up isolation wards and kept beds ready to provide treatment to any suspected case of the novel coronavirus infection if the need arises.

Experts from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) visited Dr RML Hospital here on Monday to inspect the isolation ward and review the hospital’s preparedness for management and control of the nCoV2019 infection.

As on 26th January, 29,707 passengers from 137 flights have been screened for novel coronovirus infection symptoms and no case has so far been detected in India.

A 24x7 NCDC call centre (+91-11-23978046) has been made operational to monitor the list of contacts furnished by the Ministry of External Affairs; provide details of district and state surveillance officers to those who seek them; and in case of any clinical query, direct the concerned to the relevant Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer.

203,28-1-20,PFI funded anti-CAA violent protests: ED,"Sibal denies CAA links, claims PFI money transferred to his banks a/cs is Hadiya case fees

An Enforcement Directorate (ED) probe has revealed that the controversial outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) was “financially” backing the recent violent anti-CAA protests in Uttar Pradesh. However, the PFI denied the claim.

According to news agency PTI, the ED , which is probing the PFI under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) since 2018, has found that at least Rs 1.04 crore were deposited in bank accounts in western Uttar Pradesh after the Act was passed by Parliament in December last year. The sources said a total amount of Rs 120 crore, credited to bank accounts linked to the PFI, are under the ED’s scanner.

Incidentally, there was no Press release issued by the Ed to confirm the report. The PFI rubbished the charges and said the ED has not even contacted them regarding the same.

The PFI was formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF) and was suspected to have shifted its headquarters to Shaheen Bagh in the national Capital over a decade ago.

Amid news reports suggesting that the PFI had paid lawyers such as Kapil Sibal, Dushyant Dave and Indira Jaising as part of its efforts to fund anti-CAA protests, the PFI as well as Sibal rejected the charge.

Sibal said the payments he received from the PFI had nothing to do with anti-CAA protests, and were made for his legal services offered in the Hadiya case. The Congress leader said the ED has released a statement analysing the bank accounts of the PFI in which “my name has been mentioned as a recipient of Rs 77 lakh”.

“The first bill was raised on August 4, 2017. Last bill on March 8, 2018. All payments were received before March 2018,” Sibal said.

Fellow lawyer Indira Jaising, on the other hand, “completely and vehemently” denied receiving “any money” from the PFI “at any point of time”. Jaising also denied receiving any money from anybody in connection with the anti-CAA protests.

On money transfers made to some prominent lawyers, the PFI said, “The truth is that transfers were made in 2017 as lawyer fees for these advocates for the Hadiya case... Attributing a fees transfer that happened in 2017 as a funding for 2019 CAA protest is totally absurd and exposes the intention to defame the Popular Front.”

“The PFI has stated it multiple times that we fully comply with the law of the land and the allegation of Rs 120 crore transferred from the Popular Front’s accounts just before the CAA protests is totally baseless,” the PFI said in a statement.

The dubious deposits were either made in cash or through the immediate payment service (IMPS) and a number of such instances were seen in Uttar Pradesh, where the maximum number of violent anti-CAA protests were reported to have taken place, sources said, adding the withdrawal of money from the bank accounts linked to PFI and its related entities had a “direct correlation” with the violent demonstrations against the CAA.

It is suspected that these funds were allegedly used by the PFI affiliates to fuel the anti-CAA protests in various parts of Uttar Pradesh and other locations, the sources said.

Claiming the allegations levelled against it were unfounded, the PFI said, “We are confident that the fate of this series of allegations will also be like the ones before, which could never be proved.”

There were instances of about 80-90 money withdrawals from one bank account in a day during the stated period. The ED had also shared these findings with the Union Home Ministry’s internal security division after the latter sought a report on funding of protests.

Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh police had sought a ban on the PFI after its alleged complicity was suspected in the Statewide violent protests against CAA. Nearly 20 people had died during these protests.

The ED probe had further revealed that the funds deposited in banks were also routed from foreign shores and sent to the accounts of certain investment firms.

A National Investigation Agency FIR and chargesheet against the PFI formed the basis for the ED to file the PMLA case against the organisation.

The PFI statement further said, “PFI strongly condemns the news reports that are published in various news channels regarding Popular Front’s financial link to instigate the CAA protest. Firstly, the news channels have attributed the report to Enforcement Directorate through some ‘unnamed sources’ but the ED has not contacted our organisation or issued nay such official statement regarding the allegations.”

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “Law enforcement agencies are doing their job, I need not make any comment. But if there is suspicious nature of transaction on a particular day then obviously it raises serious apprehensions and protests that are organised don’t look voluntary.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pfi-funded-anti-caa-violent-protests--ed-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pfi-funded-anti-caa-violent-protests--ed.html
204,28-1-20,"AIMPLB moves SC against pleas to criminalise nikah halala, polygamy","The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking impleadment in petitions challenging constitutional validity of polygamy and “nikah halala” practised among Muslims.

The application has been filed to oppose a batch of petitions on which the SC had in 2018 issued notices to the Centre and other stakeholders while referring the matter to a 5-judge Constitution bench.

While polygamy allows a Muslim man to have four wives, “nikah halala” stipulates that a Muslim woman, who wants to remarry her husband after divorce, has to first marry another man, “consummate” the marriage and get divorce from him.

The two issues had arisen when the SC was dealing with the practice of triple talaq.

205,28-1-20,Historic Bodo accord inked for peace in Assam,"In a major step to usher in “permanent peace” in the region, the Centre and Assam Government on Monday signed a tripartite peace accord with the dreaded insurgent group National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) and other militant outfits.

The accord signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah promised political and economic benefits while not acceding to the demand for separate State or Union Territory. The members of the armed outfits will surrender on January 30, Mahatma Gandhi’s martyrdom day, as per the accord.

Soon after the agreement was signed at the Union Home Ministry in the afternoon, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it would usher in a new dawn of peace, harmony and togetherness.

“Today is a very special day for India. The accord with Bodo groups, which has been inked today will lead to transformative results for the Bodo people. Bodo Accord inked today stands out for many reasons. It successfully brings together the leading stakeholders under one framework. Those who were previously associated with armed resistance groups will now be entering the mainstream and contributing to our nation’s progress,” Modi said in a series of tweets.

The Home Minister described the agreement as “historic” and said it would bring permanent peace and solution to the decades-old problems of the Bodo people. “This agreement will facilitate all round development of the Bodo areas, their language and culture will be protected without compromising the territorial integrity of Assam,” he told reporters after the accord was signed.

Shah said due to the violence perpetrated by the Bodo militants, over 4,000 people lost their lives in the past few decades.

The All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), which has been spearheading a movement for a Bodoland State since 1972, and the United Bodo People’s Organisation, were signatories to the Comprehensive Bodo Settlement Agreement. The agreement was signed by top leaders of the four NDFB factions, the ABSU and the UBPO, Joint Secretary in the Home Ministry Satyendra Garg, and Assam Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal also signed the pact as one of the witnesses. Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was present on the occasion.

The NDFB was responsible for a series of violent acts in the past few decades, including the massacre of nearly 70 Adivasis in December 2014.

Shah said no stone would be left unturned for the development of Assam and the Northeastern region. “A final and comprehensive solution to their demands has been made, while retaining the territorial integrity of Assam,” he said.

After the agreement, NDFB factions will leave the path of violence, surrender their weapons and disband their armed organisations within a month of signing the deal,” he said.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said after the accord different communities in the State will be able to live with harmony and it will lay the foundation of a bright future, fulfilling aspirations of the people.

Sarma said as per the accord, 1,550 militants belonging to the NDFB lay down their arms on January 30, an economic programme of Rs 1,500 crore will be implemented in the next three years with equal contribution of Rs 750 crore each from the central and state governments.

Around 1,550 cadres of NDFB(P), NDFB(RD) and NDFB(S) will be rehabilitated by the central and state governments.

Sarma said the existing structure of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) will be strengthened with more powers and its seats will be expanded from 40 to 60, he said. A commission will be set up for inclusion of Bodo-dominated villages in the BTC and exclusion of those where Bodos are not in majority.

This was the third Bodo accord to be signed in 27 years. The first accord was signed with the All Bodo Students’ Union in 1993, leading to the creation of a Bodoland Autonomous Council with limited political powers.

In 2003, the second accord was signed with the militant group Bodo Liberation Tigers, leading to formation of a Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) with four districts of Assam -- Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baska and Udalguri -- called Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD).

As per Monday’s accord, the name of BTAD will be changed to Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) and it will have more executive, administrative, legislative and financial powers. The BTC currently has control over 30 subjects such as education, forests, horticulture but no jurisdiction over the police, revenue and general administration departments, which are controlled by the Assam government.

The BTC was formed under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution. The Assam Government will soon notify Bodo language as in Devanagari script as an associate official language of the State.

The State Government will give Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of those who lost their lives during the agitation for a separate state, criminal cases with non-heinous charges against NDFB members will be withdrawn while heinous cases will be reviewed case-to-case basis as per the existing rules, according to the pact.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/historic-bodo-accord-inked-for-peace-in-assam-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/historic-bodo-accord-inked-for-peace-in-assam.html
206,28-1-20,Bengal 4th State to pass resolution against CAA,"The West Bengal Assembly on Monday became the fourth State after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan to pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, even as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called upon all the Opposition parties to sink their differences and put up a united fight against the BJP-led Union Government.

Addressing the House, Mamata said, “We will never allow CAA, NPR, and NRC in Bengal, and resist the draconian CAA peacefully.”

She expressed her anguish over how the Centre was trying to befool the people by offering to provide citizenship through the amended Act.

“Though in the face of it CAA is designed to provide citizenship… for that to happen you have to become a foreigner for five years. This is a vicious game that will push people towards death. I appeal you not to fall in trap,” she said.

Mamata wondered whether the BJP wallas were “brand ambassadors of Pakistan,” talking more of the hostile neighbour than their own country.

She said, “The label of doubtful citizens, detention centers... is unacceptable. The way things are, it was better not to have been born. Today, people are scared that they may have to leave this country. They are queuing up for all kinds of cards.”

Calling upon the opposition parties to sink their narrow differences and put up a united resistance against the “divisive policies of the BJP,” Mamata said, “though I am for Tagore’s ‘ekla chalo’ policy and ready to walk alone, I appeal to all the parties that this is not the time to fight among them… It is the time to sink differences and unite against the bigger danger… you will gave more occasions to fight against me but this is the time all of us should unite to put up a joint fight.”

Banerjee’s campaign against CAA and NRC has been punctuated by her disagreements with the Left and Congress as the two parties have repeatedly expressed their doubts over the sincerity of her anti-BJP-anti-CAA stance.

Despite the Left and the Congress backed the Monday’s motion grudgingly they accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of toning down the language of the draft. “We voted for the resolution though and did not press for the amendment …” Left Legislature Party leader Sujan Chakrabarty said adding the language of the draft was unusually soft.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bengal-4th-state-to-pass-resolution--against-caa.html
207,28-1-20,3 Indian-Americans among 8 people sentenced in call center fraud scheme in US,"Three Indian-Americans are among eight people sentenced by a US court for their roles in a sophisticated India-based call center fraud scheme that defrauded thousands of Americans, resulting in over USD 3.7 million in losses.

Those sentenced on Monday were Mohamed Kazim Momin, 33, (Georgia); Rodrigo Leon-Castillo, 46, (Texas); Mohmed Sozab Momin, 23, (Georgia); Drue Kyle Riggins, 24, (Georgia); Nicholas Alexander Deane, 26, (Georgia), Palak Kumar Patel, 30, (Georgia), Jantz Parrish Miller, 25, (Georgia) and Devin Bradford Pope, 25, (Georgia).

Their sentences ranged from six months to four years and nine months in prison.

US Attorney Byung J ""BJay"" Pak said that according to the charges and other information presented in the court, these defendants were involved in a sophisticated scheme organised by co-conspirators in India, including a network of call centers in Ahmedabad.

Using information obtained from data brokers and other sources, call center operators called potential victims while impersonating officials from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or individuals offering fictitious payday loans, federal prosecutors said.

The call center operators would then threaten potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, or fines if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government.

""IRS and payday loan phone schemes seek to profit by exploiting United States citizens, including the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community,"" said US Attorney Pak.

The US will prosecute companies and individuals in India and in this country who choose to steal from vulnerable victims, he said.

These eight people were charged along with five Indian call centers and seven Indian nationals in a 27-count indictment with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in september 2018. The government is seeking extradition of Indian nationals.

""If the victims agreed to pay, the call centers would immediately turn to a network of US-based co-conspirators to liquidate and launder the extorted funds by purchasing prepaid debit cards or through wire transfers, including through MoneyGram and Western Union, to the attention of fictitious names and US-based defendants and their co-conspirators,"" said the Department of Justice.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/3-indian-americans-among-8-people-sentenced-in-call-center-fraud-scheme-in-us-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/3-indian-americans-among-8-people-sentenced-in-call-center-fraud-scheme-in-us.html

210,28-1-20,PM does not understand economics: Rahul Gandhi,"In a big attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused him of tarnishing the pluralistic image of the nation in the world and said that the Modi does not understand economics as the Congress scion addressed the 'Yuva Aakrosh' rally here at Albert Hall.

Rahul Gandhi also called upon the youth to remain unafraid and said ""Together, we will change Hindustan"".

Gandhi said, ""Around one crore youths in the nation lost their jobs, however, Prime Minister is silent on the issue. Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on the issue of unemployment,"" he said adding, ""the growth rate during UPA tenure stood at 9 per cent which has come down to below 5 per cent despite the fact that parameters to calculate the GDP were changed. If we calculate it as per earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5 per cent.""

Gandhi further said that economy gets a boost when poor and farmers get money as they start purchasing.

""However, Modi doesn't understand this basic fact as he does not understand/study economics, Rahul added.

The former Congress president further said that Hindustan has crores of youths as its biggest resource. Even the world believes that Indian youths can change the world.

Earlier, entire world used to come to invest in India as they trusted Indian youths. However in present days, they do not want to invest in India due to increasing violence.

Once, Obama said that the US can't compete with China, but world knew that only India can compete China, he said.

""All European countries - America, Japan, Australia, and other nations are watching China growing fast, and they know this country needs to be balanced and they know only Indian youths can compete with China.

He further said that India once used to be a peaceful nation, however, now, we read in newspapers that there is violence in country and people of the same nation are fighting each other as the government is spreading violence.

So investors are wary of investing in India, he added.

Attacking Modi in three steps, Rahul said that first, Modi took around Rs 3.50 lakh crore from people's pocket and gave it to 15-20 rich people.

Secondly, the reputation of India in the world, the image of the country known for promoting brotherhood and unity, was tarnished by Narendra Modi. Now, world considers India as a rape capital but PM never speaks on this.

Thirdly, the youths' voices are suppressed when they ask PM why India's image has been tarnished in the world, why unemployment is rising in the country and what you did in last five years for youths?

Challenge prime minister to go to any university and answer students' questions on unemployment and slowdown, Rahul said Modi will surely be unable to answer, but yes, he can show people fake dreams, of giving 2 crore jobs.

""I am here to give you a message,"" he said, adding, ""I want to assure you that you have that strength and vision which can change the fate of the nation. The entire world is looking at you, not only Congress but the world looks at you.""

""I am confident that made in India, made in Jaipur, made in Rajasthan can compete with made in China.

""You should never allow your voice to be suppressed, what you speak is correct, you need not be scared, you continue asking questions on unemployment, your future and country's future.""

Next important thing we all should remember is that we have one flag that represents all Indians, Rahul said.

Those who try to divide india, should realise that Indians can't be divided, this is an insult to this flag and it should be stopped, he said.

""Our culture and history, ideology of Mahatma Gandhi, should be our ideology. When world watches us, it should know that this country can lead the world and show the way of character and morality,"" he said.

Concluding his speech, Rahul said, ""I am here to give this message to you, now it is your responsibility, you need not be scared. We have the most powerful force with us, which is Indian youths. Don't be scared as together we shall change this Hindustan.""",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-does-not-understand-economics--rahul-gandhi-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pm-does-not-understand-economics--rahul-gandhi.html

Senior advocate Anjana Prakash said this to the Supreme Court during the hearing of Singh's plea seeking judicial review of the rejection of his mercy plea by the President.

""I was sexually abused in Tihar jail. I was forced to have sexual intercourse with co-accused 31-year-old Akshay. I was also severely beaten up many times.

213,28-1-20,BJP bringing in 'outsiders' for campaigning in Delhi polls: Kejriwal,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday accused the BJP of insulting the people of the national capital by bringing in ""outsiders"" to campaign for the February 8 assembly polls.

Kejriwal said the Bharatiya Janata Party has brought 200 MPs, 70 ministers and 11 chief ministers from outside to defeat him.

""They are bringing 200 MPs, 70 ministers and 11 chief ministers because people of Delhi did not support them so now they are bringing in outsiders. They are coming to defeat the people of Delhi,"" he said at the Gokapluri constituency while campaigning for AAP candidate Surendra Kumar.

""They are coming to defeat your son Kejriwal. They are coming to insult all of us. They will come and say your schools are in bad condition, your mohalla clinics are in bad shape. Will you keep quiet?"" Kejriwal asked to which the audience responded with a resounding ""no"".

Kejriwal urged people to recount the development works done in Delhi in the past five years in front of the BJP leaders when they visit different areas asking for votes.

""This fight is between the two crore people of Delhi and 200 BJP MPs. When they come, recount all the works done in the last five years and send them back to their states. Do not let them insult Delhi,"" he said.

Addressing his party supporters, Kejriwal said he has worked as an elder son of the family.

""I paid the electricity and water bills like an elder son of your family, I arranged for a good education for the children of the family, I took care of the health of your family and arranged for their medicines, I arranged for pilgrimage for the elders of the family as an elder son,"" he said.

""If they visit your area, welcome them properly, ask them they are from which state and then ask them about Delhi. Please also ask them about the number of hours that their states receive electricity and its price. And then tell them that Delhi receives 24-hour free electricity,"" he added.

Kejriwal also asked people to tell the BJP leaders about mohalla clinics.

""Ask them about the water bills that the people of their states receive. If they quote a price, tell them that Delhi has a free water supply. Ask them whether their states have mohalla Clinics, and show them one if need be. Ask them the results achieved by their school students, and tell them that students of Delhi have received 96 per cent.

214,28-1-20,JD(U) MPs will urge Centre to drop columns seeking parents' Birth place from NPR forms: Nitish,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said his JD(U) will urge the BJP government at the Centre to drop columns pertaining to birth places of parents in the National Population Register form, since it has led to ""apprehensions"" among many who were not aware of the details.

Kumar, who is the JD(U)'s national president and has been running a coalition government in the state with the BJP, said leaders of his party ""in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha"" will make a request to the government to this effect ""even though it is not mandatory to fill up these columns"".

The chief minister was talking to reporters at his official residence here after presiding over a meeting of JD (U) parliamentarians, legislators and office-bearers of the party's Bihar unit, even though disgruntled top leaders like national vice president Prashant Kishor and national general secretary Pavan Varma remained conspicuous by their absence.

Kumar also acknowledged that the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had led to ""unrest"" across the country but hoped the misgivings would be addressed by the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions challenging the contentious legislation.

He, however, voiced disapproval of the inflammatory comments made by Sharjeel Imam, who was arrested in Jehanabad in connection with a sedition case in Delhi, and pointed out ""whoever transgresses law, will face action accordingly. Talks of disintegration of the country are never acceptable"".

""It is the job of the police to help law enforcement agencies elsewhere in their investigation. The local police (in Jehanabad) has therefore been helping the Delhi police. Whoever commits wrong in the eyes of the law will face arrest and tried before a court of law,"" Kumar insisted.

He also stated that unrest over the contentious legislation had been going on for quite some time and there was now a need for ""normalizing the situation"".

In an apparent reference to many state governments coming out with resolutions in respective legislatures against the CAA, Kumar - whose party had voted in favor of the Bill when it was tabled in Parliament - pointed out ""the matter comes under the jurisdiction of the Centre. Only the Supreme Court can take any action to address the issues.""

Iterating his opposition to nationwide NRC, the Bihar CM noted with satisfaction ""the prime minister, too, has clarified that such a move is not in the offing"".

""As regards NPR, it must be kept in mind that the exercise has been conducted previously. Of course, there are misgivings about columns asking people to disclose the places of birth of their parents since most citizens might not be aware of the same.

""Our leaders in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will urge (the government) to drop these columns, if possible,"" he said.

Kumar parried questions about disgruntled leaders like Varma, whom the CM has rebuffed after he went public with a letter sharing details of conversation they allegedly had ""in private"" about the BJP, and Prashant Kishor, who has been rankling the saffron party with his acerbic tweets against CAA-NPR-NRC.

When asked if Kishor's collaboration with Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, where JD(U) is also contesting in alliance with the BJP, would affect the NDA, Kumar came out with a cryptic reply.

""He has links with many people. I have said it earlier, we inducted him into the party at the instance of Amit Shah,"" Kumar said as a parting note at the press meet.

Earlier, JD(U) state president Vashishtha Narayan Singh, a Rajya Sabha member, said that the party ""does not attach any value"" to those defying its policies when asked about their absence though he also clarified ""it is a meeting of state leaders convened by the national president"".

At the press conference, Nitish Kumar also hinted that more such pep talks with grassroots-level workers of the party were likely in near future.

Assembly polls in Bihar are due in less than a year. Kumar is expected to lead the NDA charge and make a bid for his fourth consecutive term as chief minister.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jd-u--mps-will-urge-centre-to-drop-columns-seeking-parents--birth-place-from-npr-forms--nitish-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jd-u--mps-will-urge-centre-to-drop-columns-seeking-parents--birth-place-from-npr-forms--nitish.html
215,28-1-20,Corona Facts,"With over 56 deaths and Wuhan city quarantined, DR KK Aggarwal tells you all there is to know about this deadly virus

Every decade a zoonotic coronavirus crosses species to infect human populations and in this decade, we have a virus, provisionally called 2019-nCoV, first identified in Wuhan, China, in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market.

The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.

The three deadly human respiratory coronaviruses viruses so far

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV]

nMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV])

2019-nCoV: The virus is 75 to 80 per cent identical to the SARS-CoV

Pathogenesis

People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.

It has high mortality. In the current situation the mortality rate is 3 per cent. The severity of illness is concerning: almost a third of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive care; six patients died; five had acute cardiac injury; and four required ventilation.

Its Zoonotic. It is closely related to several bat coronaviruses. Bats are the primary reservoir for the virus. SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets, whereas MERS-CoV is transmitted from camels to humans. In both cases, the ancestral hosts were probably bats.

It is more infectious to humans. Notably, 2019-nCoV grows better in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue-culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. It is likely that 2019-nCoV will behave more like SARS-CoV.

Human to human infection is weak. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways. Consequently, transmission occurs primarily from patients with recognised illness and not from patients with mild, nonspecific signs.

It appears that 2019-nCoV uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]), so transmission is expected only after signs of lower respiratory tract disease develop.

The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7·0 days (4·0–8·0), to shortness of breath was 8·0 days (5·0–13·0), to ARDS was 9·0 days (8·0–14·0), to mechanical ventilation was 10·5 days (7·0–14·0), and to ICU admission was 10·5 days.

Its unlikely to spread by eating sea food in India. It has been traced to snakes in China so unlikely to spread in India by eating sea food. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species — bats — to snakes and then to humans. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.

The writer is President CMAAO, HCFI and past National President IMA

Transmission

Transmission of foodborne diseases on aircraft, including cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis, and staphylococcal food poisoning, have been well documented.

Transmission of smallpox on aircraft was reported in 1965.

An outbreak of influenza occurred in 1979 among passengers on a flight that had a three hours’ ground delay before takeoff. The influenza attack rate among the passengers was very high (72 %), and was attributed to the ventilation system not operating during the ground delay. Epidemiological investigations have also indicated that measles may have been transmitted aboard international flights.

To date, no case of active TB has been identified as a result of exposure while on a commercial aircraft.

However, there is some evidence that transmission of M. tuberculosis may occur during long (i.e. more than eight hours) flights, from an infectious source (a passenger or crew member) to other passengers or crew members.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/corona-facts-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/corona-facts.html
216,28-1-20,"Keto diet works best in small doses, harmful in long run: Study","A ketogenic diet -- which provides 99 per cent of calories from fat and protein, and only one per cent from carbohydrates -- may produce health benefits in the short term, but negative effects after about a week, according to a study conducted in mice.

The study, published in the journal Nature Metabolism, suggests that the keto diet could, over limited time periods, improve human health by lowering diabetes risk and inflammation.

The keto diet has become increasingly popular as celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian, have touted it as a weight-loss regimen, the researchers noted.

The diet tricks the body into burning fat, said lead author Vishwa Deep Dixit from the Yale University in the US.

When the body's glucose level is reduced due to the diet's low carbohydrate content, the body acts as if it is in a starvation state -- although it is not -- and begins burning fats instead of carbohydrates.

This process in turn yields chemicals called ketone bodies as an alternative source of fuel.

When the body burns ketone bodies, tissue-protective gamma delta T-cells expand throughout the body.

This reduces diabetes risk and inflammation, and improves the body's metabolism, said Dixit.

After a week on the keto diet, mice show a reduction in blood sugar levels and inflammation, he said.

However, when the body is in this ""starving-not-starving"" mode, fat storage is also happening simultaneously with fat breakdown, the researchers said.

When mice continue to eat the high-fat, low-carb diet beyond one week, they consume more fat than they can burn, and develop diabetes and obesity, the researchers said.

""They lose the protective gamma delta T-cells in the fat,"" Dixit said.

Long-term clinical studies in humans are still necessary to validate the anecdotal claims of keto's health benefits, the researchers noted.

""Before such a diet can be prescribed, a large clinical trial in controlled conditions is necessary to understand the mechanism behind metabolic and immunological benefits or any potential harm to individuals who are overweight and pre-diabetic,"" Dixit said.

""Obesity and type 2 diabetes are lifestyle diseases. Diet allows people a way to be in control,"" he said.

With the latest findings, researchers now better understand the mechanisms at work in bodies sustained on the keto diet, and why the diet may bring health benefits over limited time periods.

""Our findings highlight the interplay between metabolism and the immune system, and how it coordinates maintenance of healthy tissue function,"" said Emily Goldberg, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/keto-diet-works-best-in-small-doses--harmful-in-long-run--study-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/keto-diet-works-best-in-small-doses--harmful-in-long-run--study.html
217,28-1-20,"China virus death toll jumps to 106; confirmed cases climb to over 4,500","China has reported 24 more deaths from coronavirus epidemic, taking the number of fatalities to 106 as the confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the outbreak stand at 4,515, the health authorities announced on Tuesday.

Barring Tibet, all Chinese provinces have reported the virus cases, posing a major challenge for the health authorities to contain it.

Overseas confirmed cases have been reported in Thailand (7), Japan (3), South Korea (3), the United States (3), Vietnam (2), Singapore (4), Malaysia (3), Nepal (1), France (3), Australia (4) and Sri Lanka (1).

The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China has soared to 106 while nearly 1,300 new cases have been confirmed, authorities said Tuesday.

The provincial authorities in the virus epicentre of Hubei province, of which Wuhan city is the capital, said 24 more people had died from the virus with 1,291 more infections.

By the end of Monday, a total of 4,515 cumulative confirmed cases of the new pneumonia had been reported in Hubei, while 2,567 patients are hospitalised, with 563 in severe conditions and 127 in critical conditions, the Hubei Provincial Health Commission said on Tuesday.

Hospitals across the province received 31,934 fever patients on Monday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

As of now, 4,200 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported from China.

China's top cities of Beijing and Shanghai reported their first deaths on late Monday first from the novel coronavirus.

The health commissions in both Beijing and Shanghai reported.

A 50-year-old male died of respiratory failure in Beijing on Monday. He was diagnosed on January 22, and was in Wuhan City from January 8 to 15.

Shanghai authorities have yet to release details of the deceased patient, state-run CGTN reported.

As of Monday night, Beijing had eight more confirmed cases of the disease, bringing the total number to 80.

Two patients have been discharged from hospitals after treatment, while 63 patients were in stable condition. Shanghai had 66 confirmed cases as of Monday night, aged between seven and 88 years old.

A sense of disquiet prevailed in Beijing as officials announced the capital's first death from the deadly virus, a grim reminder that the epidemic has begun to take toll outside Hubei province.

On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan, the first such trip by a top leader to the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, to boost the morale of millions of beleaguered people and medical staff.

The World Health Organisation on Monday admitted an error in its assessment of the global risk of a deadly virus in China, saying it was ""high"" and not ""moderate"", reports said.

The Geneva-based WHO in its latest situation report said the risk was ""very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.""

The organisation attached to UN admitted that it had stated ""incorrectly"" in its previous reports that the global risk was ""moderate"".

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is currently visiting Beijing to discuss how to contain the outbreak. He was quoted as saying on Thursday that ""this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency"".

Meanwhile, the train and bus services between Beijing and neighbouring Tianjin have been suspended.

China has also extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.

Universities, primary and middle schools and kindergartens across the country will postpone the opening of the spring semester until further notice.

The government is focussing efforts to prevent mass gatherings and mass travel to ensure the virus is not spread fast.

Beijing has also launched temperature detection at 55 subway stations, including stops at railway stations and Beijing airport.

220,28-1-20,Musharraf conviction: Pak court says trial in absentia against golden principles of natural justice,"A Pakistani court has ruled that the concept of trial in absentia is against the golden principles of natural justice as it issued a detailed judgement on self-exiled former dictator Pervez Musharraf's petition challenging his death sentence on charges of high treason.

A special court in Islamabad on December 17 last year handed down the death penalty to the 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him.

His trial was declared as ""unconstitutional"" by the Lahore High Court (LHC) thro­ugh a short order on January 13, leading to the annulment of the death sentence against the ex-Pakistan Army chief.

The detailed judgement, authored by LHC Justice Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, found the process for the establishment of the special court in consultation with the then chief justice of Pakistan and chief justices of five high courts alien to the Constitution, Dawn newspaper reported.

""It is established without any doubt that the very constitution of the special court was squarely illegal/improper and without jurisdiction,"" ruled the bench on Monday.

It said that the concept of trial in absentia is not only inconsistent with the doctrine of Islamic justice enunciated in the Holy Quran and Sunnah but also against the golden principles of natural justice, according to the report.

The full bench of the LHC observed that the interior secretary was competent to file a complaint against the accu­sed of ""high treason"" only on the recommendations of the federal government, whereas the federal government was to operate in the spirit of Article 90(1) of the Constitution which includes the prime minister and the Cabinet, Dawn newspaper reported.

""However, the requisite requirement of the Constitution was totally ignored,"" the LHC said in the verdict.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

In a huge reprieve for Musharraf, the LHC declared that the formation of the special court was ""unconstitutional"" and that the treason case against the former president was not prepared in accordance with the law.

Barrister Salman Safdar, the counsel for Musharraf, had stated that his absence at the hearing of the special court was not intentional and that he was unable to appear before it as he was ill.

On January 18, Pakistan's Supreme Court returned the petition against his conviction and sentencing by a special tribunal with objection that he is not allowed to appeal without surrendering to the law.

Musharraf, who has been living in Dubai since March 2016, left Pakistan for medical treatment and has not returned since, citing security and health reasons.

Dr Muhammad Amjad, Musharraf's close aide and the ex-chairperson of his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party, has said that the former president was rapidly becoming weaker due to an unknown disease, which is why he was unable to return to Pakistan to face the treason case.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/musharraf-conviction--pak-court-says-trial-in-absentia-against-golden-principles-of-natural-justice-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/musharraf-conviction--pak-court-says-trial-in-absentia-against-golden-principles-of-natural-justice.html
221,28-1-20,Kobe helicopter tried to climb to avoid clouds before crash,"The pilot of the helicopter that crashed near Los Angeles, killing former NBA superstar Kobe Bryant and eight others, told air traffic controllers in his last radio message that he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer before plunging more than 1,000 feet (305 meters) into a hillside, an accident investigator said.

Radar indicated the helicopter reached a height of 2,300 feet (701 meters) Sunday morning before descending, and the wreckage was found at 1,085 feet (331 meters), Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board said during a news conference Monday afternoon.

NTSB investigators went to the crash site in Calabasas on Monday to collect evidence.

“The debris field is pretty extensive,” Homendy said.

“A piece of the tail is down the hill,"" she said.

""The fuselage is on the other side of that hill. And then the main rotor is about 100 yards (91 meters) beyond that.”

Some experts suggested that the pilot might have gotten disoriented because of fog but Homendy said investigating teams would look at everything from the pilot's history to the engines.

“We look at man, machine and the environment,” she said. “And weather is just a small portion of that.”

The pilot had asked for and received special clearance to fly in heavy fog just minutes before the crash and was flying at 1,400 feet (427 meters) when he went south and then west, Homendy said.

The pilot then asked for air traffic controllers to provide “flight following” radar assistance but was told the craft was too low for that assistance, Homendy said.

About four minutes later, “the pilot advised they were climbing to avoid a cloud layer,"" she said. “When ATC asked what the pilot planned to do, there was no reply.

Radar data indicates the helicopter climbed to 2,300 feet (701 meters) and then began a left descending turn. Last radar contact was around 9:45 a.M."" Two minutes later, someone on the ground called 911 to report the crash.

Randy Waldman, a helicopter flight instructor who teaches at the nearby Van Nuys airport, said a disoriented pilot might have only moments to avoid a fatal dive.

“If you're flying visually, if you get caught in a situation where you can't see out the windshield, the life expectancy of the pilot and the aircraft is maybe 10, 15 seconds, and it happens all the time, and it's really a shame,” Waldman said.

Some experts raised questions of whether the helicopter should have even been flying. The weather was so foggy that the Los Angeles Police Department and the county sheriff's department had grounded their own choppers.

The Sikorsky S-76 killed the retired athlete along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and everyone else aboard and scattering debris over an area the size of a football field.

Crews recovered three bodies on Sunday and resumed the effort on Monday amid an outpouring of grief and shock around the world over the loss of the basketball great who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA titles during his dazzling 20-year career.

The pilot was identified as Ara Zobayan. He was the chief pilot for Island Express Helicopters, the aircraft's owner, the company said in a statement.

“Ara has been with the company for over 10 years and has over 8,000 flight hours,"" the company said, adding that it was working closely with the NTSB to investigate the crash.

Zobayan was commercially certified as a pilot and certified as a flight instructor, Homendy said.

Several aviation experts said it is not uncommon for helicopter pilots to be given such permission, though some thought it unusual that it would be granted in airspace as busy as that over Los Angeles.

But Kurt Deetz, who flew for Bryant dozens of times in the same chopper that went down, said permission is often granted in the area.

""It happened all the time in the winter months in LA,"" Deetz said. “You get fog.”

The helicopter left Santa Ana in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, shortly after 9 a.M., heading north and then west. Bryant was believed to be headed for his youth sports academy in nearby Thousand Oaks, which was holding a basketball tournament Sunday in which Bryant's daughter, known as Gigi, was competing.

Air traffic controllers noted poor visibility around Burbank to the north and Van Nuys to the northwest. At one point, the controllers instructed the chopper to circle because of other planes in the area before proceeding.

The aircraft crashed about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. When it struck the ground, it was flying at about 184 mph (296 mph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute, according to data from Flightradar24.

Waldman said the same thing happened to John F. Kennedy Jr. When his plane dropped out of the sky near Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1999.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kobe-helicopter-tried-to-climb-to-avoid-clouds-before-crash-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/kobe-helicopter-tried-to-climb-to-avoid-clouds-before-crash.html
222,28-1-20,Accuser says Weinstein sexually assaulted her in children's bedroom,"One of Harvey Weinstein's main accusers told his rape trial that the ex-Hollywood producer forcibly performed oral sex on her in a children's bedroom in his New York home.

Mimi Haleyi -- a former production assistant -- cried as she told the Manhattan court that Weinstein, 67, sexually assaulted her in July 2006 while she was on her period.

She described how Weinstein, who was then three times her weight, initially appeared ""friendly"" before he backed her into a bedroom with children's drawings on the wall.

""He was kissing and fondling me,"" she said on Monday.

""I expressed to him the entire time that I don't want this to happen,"" Haleyi, added, sobbing.

Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and forcibly performed oral sex on her after pulling out her tampon, she said during the fourth day of testimony.

""Physically I was trying to get away (but) I figured it was pointless and I basically checked out,"" Haleyi, an assistant on realty TV show ""Project Runway,"" told the court.

More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault since allegations against him first ignited the #MeToo movement in October 2017.

But he faces charges related to just two women -- Haleyi, and actress Jessica Mann, who says Weinstein raped her in 2013.

Weinstein faces life in prison if convicted of the most serious charges against him, those of predatory sexual assault.

Finnish-born Haleyi said she opted not to report the alleged attack out of fear she would be expelled from the United States for failing to have a valid work visa.

""I thought going to the police wasn't an option for me,"" she said, adding that Weinstein ""had a lot more power and connections"" as well.

During cross-examination, defense attorney Damon Cheronis challenged Haleyi on why she had sent a friendly email to Weinstein around two years after the alleged incident.

The message said, ""Hi Harvey, how are you? Great to see you,"" and was signed ""Lots of Love."" Weinstein claims all of his sexual relationships were consensual.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/accuser-says-weinstein-sexually-assaulted-her-in-children-s-bedroom-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/accuser-says-weinstein-sexually-assaulted-her-in-children-s-bedroom.html
223,28-1-20,let’s have a joint session,"Elderly people need to be cautious in winters with checkups, prevention and exercise to overcome joint pain and fragility, says DR RAVI GAUR

When the temperature drops, adults run a higher risk of health problems and bone injuries. Cold air and damp weather contributes in a major way towards bone and joint flare ups, especially in people who already have a bone disease or are over 50 years old. When the barometric pressure drops, tissues in joints swell-up, pushing them against muscles and nerves in the area and causing pain. In winter, one tends to move less, which aggravates bone and joint problems more. Being a couch potato is bad for the joints.

As people age, after 50 years, calcium leak sets in, resulting in degradation of bone mass, and people are suggested to get their bone density checked bone density measure is reported in T score levels that identify the strength and agility of bones. T score of -1 and above is considered normal, a score between -1 and-2.5 is a sign of osteopenia, a condition in which bone density is below normal, and may lead to osteoporosis. A T score of -2.5 and below indicates osteoporosis. Elderly people also witness increased arthritis pain during winters.

If older people sustain a fracture, it should not be seen as an isolated event. Just mending it does not suffice, preventive measures should be pursued. The fracture can be a result of osteoporosis (Hollow Bone Disease), general erosion of bone mass or overall infirmity of bones. A complete assessment of bone structure is suggested after breakage.

In contemporary times, multiple treatment options are available which have proven to be very effective in controlling and partially reversing bone fragility. A yearly injection (Bisphosphonate) has proven to be effective in preventing aggravation of osteoporosis. There are other medicines — tablets and sprays — in the market that prevent this condition.

Bone mass peaks at the age of 34 and 35, and it is suggested that one should have adequate servings of dairy products and foods that are rich in calcium and Vitamin D, since bone infirmity is a silent epidemic that affects large sections of our population, not just in Delhi and NCR, but across the nation. Exercise is one of the best ways apart from sun-basking to slow or prevent problems with the muscles, joints, and bones. A moderate exercise program can help maintain strength, balance, and flexibility. Exercise helps the bones stay strong. It is important to eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of calcium. Women need to be especially careful to get enough calcium and Vitamin D as they age.

226,28-1-20,TipTop,"If you wish to lose those extra kg fat food options and eat what your great-grandma ate, said a top weight-loss surgeon.

NHS doctor Andrew Jenkinson, who has watched thousands try — and fail — to shed the extra weight, says people should stick to the traditional fare, like a full English breakfast. He advises people to buy food at traditional stores, like greengrocer, butcher and fishmonger, as our ancestors would have done. “Imagine you are taking your great-grandmother around shops. If there’s any food she doesn’t recognise, don't buy it,” Jenkinson said.

In his book, Why We Eat (Too Much), the bariatric surgeon presents what he learnt over decades of practice. He claims to have spoken to over 2,000 obese patients. “What they said about dieting was always the same story,” he says.

While crash diets might appear to work in the first few weeks, he says, they usually backfire because they trick the body into believing it has to cope with a famine - and save energy.

“They all say they lose weight to begin with, but then put it on and end up heavier than when they started,” the surgeon says. Thus the weight-loss regime comes to an end and the dieter is driven to eat more by powerful hunger hormones. He then ends up blaming the lack of will power, when the real culprit is a diet that is destined to fail. In his book, Jenkinson says a far better approach is to ditch the quick-fix solutions for an old-fashioned approach — buying fresh food daily and cooking it yourself.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/tiptop-tiptop.html

228,28-1-20,studycentre,"A study of Northwestern University (NU) found that bacteria living in household dust can spread antibiotic resistance genes, and the researchers believe these genes could potentially spread to pathogens, making infections more difficult to treat.

Bacteria can share many different types of genes as long as the genes have mobile segments of DNA. NU researchers were the first to find that antibiotic resistance genes in dust microbes have mobile capabilities, the Xinhua news agency reported. “We observed living bacteria have transferable antibiotic resistance genes,"" said Erica Hartmann, an assistant professor of environmental engineering in NU’s McCormick School of Engineering.

Although it is rare for pathogens to live in indoor dust, they can hitchhike into homes and mingle with existing bacteria.

“A nonpathogen can use horizontal gene transfer to give antibiotic resistance genes to a pathogen,” Hartmann explained. “Then the pathogen becomes antibiotic resistant.” “Microbes share genes when they get stressed out,"" Hartmann said. ""They aren’t equipped to handle the stress, so they share genetic elements with a microbe that might be better equipped.”

Hartmann recommends dusting with a damp cloth instead of using antimicrobial solutions, which can make bacteria more resistant to antibiotics.

229,28-1-20,Eating an egg a day not bad for your heart,"The controversy about whether eggs are good or bad for heart health may be solved, as researchers have found that eating an egg a day is not linked to the risk of heart diseases.

The study from McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found the answer by analysing data from three large, long-term multinational studies.

""Moderate egg intake, which is about one egg per day in most people, does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or mortality even if people have a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes,"" said study first author Mahshid Dehghan from McMaster University in Canada.

""Also, no association was found between egg intake and blood cholesterol, its components or other risk factors. These results are robust and widely applicable to both healthy individuals and those with vascular disease,"" Dehghan added.

Although eggs are an inexpensive source of essential nutrients, some guidelines have recommended limiting consumption to fewer than three eggs a week due to concerns they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Previous studies on egg consumption and diseases have been contradictory, according to the researchers.

For the findings, the researchers analysed three international studies conducted by the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI). Egg consumption of 146,011 individuals from 21 countries was recorded in the PURE study and in 31,544 patients with vascular disease from the ONTARGET and the TRANSEND studies.

The data from these three studies involved populations from 50 countries spanning six continents at different income levels, so the results are widely applicable, said the researchers.

The results suggest there is no harm from consuming eggs. Given that the majority of individuals in the study consumed one or fewer eggs per day, it would be safe to consume this level, the researchers said.

""This is because most of these studies were relatively small or moderate in size and did not include individuals from a large number of countries,"" said study researcher Salim Yusuf.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eating-an-egg-a-day-not-bad-for-your-heart-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/eating-an-egg-a-day-not-bad-for-your-heart.html

231,28-1-20,India poised for first T20 series win in New Zealand,"A ruthless India are expected to seal their maiden T20 International series win in New Zealand and only a special comeback from the struggling hosts in the third game here on Wednesday can delay what seems inevitable.

India won the twin T20 Internationals in Auckland by margins of six and seven wickets respectively to go 2-0 up in the five-match series.

A third successive win at Seddon Park will give them their first ever T20I series' win on New Zealand soil, a feat they were unable to achieve on two occasions previously. India lost 0-2 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni back in 2008-09, and last year, they went down 1-2.

Overall, this Indian side has seen an uptick in fortunes and are unbeaten in five T20 series since the 2019 ODI World Cup, including the ongoing one against the Black Caps. The only contest they didn't win was against South Africa, when the three-match series ended 1-1 after one of the games was washed out.

However, their current winning form in T20 cricket won't lead to any meaningful change in the ICC rankings. India are currently placed fifth in the T20I rankings, and need to win the remaining three matches – this series 5-0 – to move up to fourth from their current fifth spot.

New Zealand are currently placed sixth. Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa, in that order, sit ahead in the rankings' table.

The greater concern at present is building towards the T20 World Cup to be hosted in Australia later this year. In that regard though, the team management is quietly confident that various pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are starting to fall into place, and at the right time.

This is specifically boosted by the performances of KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer over the recent months, particularly on tour thus far.

As such, there are no changes to be expected in the Indian line-up for the third T20. On Tuesday, there was an optional practice session with skipper Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, the ones missing in action.

The support staff worked closely with those players who haven't yet received a chance to play in the series yet. Ravi Shastri paid close attention to Washington Sundar, while batting coach Vikram Rathour was busy with Rishabh Pant. Both are expected to sit out again on Wednesday.

There is possibility of one change to the Indian line-up. Kuldeep Yadav sat out the first two matches in Auckland, and that could have been a move motivated more by the ground size than anything else.

Chahal provides greater control and his wrist spin moves away from the majority of right-handers in the Black Caps' line-up, thus against the arc of swing.

Yadav is a tad more adventurous in his flight and the angle of his spin into the right-handers could have been easy fodder at Eden Park's short boundaries.

Whether Yadav comes back into contention at the regular-sized Seddon Park remains to be seen. Additionally, there is little chance of Chahal-Yadav playing together, a move India have shied away from since the ODI World Cup.

From New Zealand's perspective, this is the last opportunity for Colin de Grandhomme to make an impression. The all-rounder will be replaced in the squad for the last two T20Is by batsman Tom Bruce.

Grandhomme has played strictly as a batsman so far in this series, and has scores of 0 and 3 in the first two games.

New Zealand are not too worried about their bowling performances in this series, despite India's relative ease in chasing down totals in the first two matches. Their greater worry is contending with the Indian bowling, in particular Jasprit Bumrah who has regained much of his pre-injury rhythm.

In both matches, they were unable to get him away, whether at the start or during the death overs. For their part, India mixed things up well in the second T20, holding Bumrah back until later in the power play.

New Zealand have had a poor run at Eden Park off late, but their record at Seddon Park holds in good stead. They have won seven out of nine T20Is played here, and will be hoping to stop India from taking an unassailable lead in the series.

Teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar.

232,28-1-20,India becoming better and better away from home: Southee,"Senior New Zealand pacer Tim Southee feels India are becoming ""better and better"" away from home and a reflection of that is their performance in the ongoing T20 series.

The Black Caps put on a sub-par total in the second T20I in Auckland, despite a par-performance in the first T20I at the same venue. India chased down both totals with relative ease to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.

""India have played well. They're a great side and they're full of world-class players. The first game is the one that slightly got away on us but we were certainly outplayed in the second game.

""We know it's always tough when you play against India and they're becoming a better and better side away from home as well. We know we need to be on top of our game if we need to beat India,"" Southee said on the ever of the third T20.

Southee also asked his team's batsmen to raise their game.

""Change of venue should help us. We need to win this game but I think it goes back to what we need to do as a group. Focus on how we prepare today and if we play the way that we know this team can play then I'm sure the result will take care of itself.

""The guys would have learnt from the first two games. The first one got away from us. We should have defended that. We can't sort look over our shoulders. We need to look ahead to this game and hopefully keep the series alive going forward.""

The fast bowler said the Black Caps would have to re-assess the toss situation and perhaps put India out of their comfort zone of chasing down totals. He added that the Seddon Park pitch would be true to white-ball cricket as in the past, albeit they will have to raise their bowling game as well.

""Decisions are based around what we think the surface is best to do. We thought it was best to bat first in those first two games. I don't think we did it overly well in the second game. The first game we should have been able to defend that. Whatever you do, you just got to do it well.

""It's usually a good surface when you turn up for white-ball cricket. Another small ground so I'm looking forward to another typical Seddon Park wicket. It comes back to the nature of the surface. If they are reactive to cutters and what not, then you use them more.

""The mentality doesn't change just because the boundary-size is smaller. You're trying to assess the conditions, assess the state of the match as well and try and bowl what's best at the time,"" he said.

When asked if he had any special plans for the in-form Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, Southee said he wasn't targeting any particular Indian batsmen, albeit the younger ones have sprung a surprise on this tour.

""I think you have initial plans for some of the guys who haven't seen a lot of. And he's (Iyer) come in and played with freedom. He's got a great start to the series. He's obviously full of confidence.

""As I say, in this Indian side, there's not one or two guys but the whole side who have quality, not only with the bat but with the ball as well. Those tactics might change as the series goes on as you see more of the players,"" Southee added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-becoming-better-and-better-away-from-home--southee-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-becoming-better-and-better-away-from-home--southee.html

234,28-1-20,Asking for my nod? Kejriwal dares Shah to clear Shaheen Bagh,"HM asks CM to spell out his stand on sit-in

Accusing the BJP of doing “dirty politics” over the Shaheen Bagh protest, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said law and order in the national Capital entirely lies with the Centre and “if they are saying that they need permission from me, I am giving them permission, open the road in one hour”.

Lashing out heavily on Kejriwal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah dared him to visit Shaheen Bagh so that people of Delhi can decide whom they should vote in Assembly election. “The Delhi Police has booked Sharjeel Imam, a JNU student, on sedition charge for his comment of trying to cut the chicken’s neck and break the N-E from the rest of the country. I want to ask Kejriwal whether he is in favour of apprehending Sharjeel Imam or not? Whether you are with the people of Shaheen Bagh or not, please tell the people of Delhi,” Shah said while addressing an election rally in Rithala in North-West Delhi.

Imam was one of the initial organisers of the Shaheen Bagh protest. “You (the AAP leaders) people say you are with Shaheen Bagh. If you have the guts then go and sit with them. And let Delhi decide,” Shah said.

Kejriwal alleged the BJP does not want to open the Shaheen Bagh stretch of the Kalindi Kunj road where the anti-CAA protest are going on for over a month. “I can give you this in writing; The BJP does not want to open the route in Shaheen Bagh. The Shaheen Bagh route will remain closed till February 8 (election day) and it will open February 9,” Kejriwal said.

“People especially children are facing problems due to closed stretch. I appeal leaders of the BJP, including Home Minister Amit Shah, Piyush Goyal, and Ravi Shankar Prasad to visit Shaheen Bagh and talk to them (protesters) and open the road in one hour so that people will not get troubled,” he said.

“Being the Home Minister of this country, maintaining law and order in Delhi is his constitutional responsibility. India is a democracy and he should visit Shaheen Bagh and holds a talk with protesters,” Kejriwal added.

“Everyone has rights to protest in this country but common man should not suffer due to such protest. Law and order in Delhi comes under Centre. Why the BJP instead of solving this issue, doing Press conferences every day,” he said.

Union Minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also alleged that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh are emerging as a textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority.

“It is offering platform to tukde tukde gang elements under the garb of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This protest is not just a protest against CAA it is a protest against Modi,” Prasad said in a Press conference at Pandit Pant Marg.

Lakhs of people are distressed because they cannot go to office, shops are shut and their children are not able to go to school due to road block by protesters, he said.

He claimed that those trying to fragment India are getting cover at Shaheen Bagh protest where the Tricolours are being waived.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/asking-for-my-nod--kejriwal-dares-shah-to-clear-shaheen-bagh-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/asking-for-my-nod--kejriwal-dares-shah-to-clear-shaheen-bagh.html

Speaking in Deadline's Sundance Studio, Miller spoke about how the drama, which sees a couple forced to confront their relationship issues following a traumatic accident, provoked strong reactions in her, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

She said: ""(When I first read the script) I found myself really emotional at the end, and actually, every time I went back and read the script, there were these beats, and I couldn't help but cry.

""I felt like if that was happening in a reading of a piece of material, it was something I had to do.""

Miller's co-star Diego Luna admitted he had an equally strong reaction and praised the movie for talking about love and relationships in a ""very smart way"".

He said: ""I think it's a very smart way to talk about love. I think it's really sad, but I have kids, and I don't see stories of love that I want them to see. Everything is about the immediate thing. This (relationship) is quite interesting because they're willing to look back. I don't think we do that often in life.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-sienna-miller-cried-on-reading-a-film-script-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/when-sienna-miller-cried-on-reading-a-film-script.html
236,28-1-20,"'Snake Eyes' doesn't rely on CGI, says Henry Golding","Actor Henry Golding says his new film ""Snake Eyes', a spin-off of ""G.I. Joe"", brings the old-school physical stunts back into the fold at a time when computer-generated graphics are a rage.

The ""Crazy Rich Asians"" star, who plays the titular ninja in the Paramount movie, said the action has a certain ""authenticity"" to it.

""We have an authenticity to this. Which no one will have ever seen in a 'G.I. Joe' franchise ever. The amount of physical stunts that we do outweigh that of any of the CGI. Generally speaking, it's all physical stunts,"" Golding told MTV News.

The 32-year-old actor said he had a ""few injuries"" while doing the stunts on the film. ""I'm not gonna lie -- I blew out my hip, I tore my quad, my meniscus like tore,"" he added.

Golding said ""Snake Eyes"" will be an origin story and of a period of the character's life in which he is still learning and training.

Snake Eyes is a silent ninja commando who dresses in all black, never reveals his face and doesn't speak. He stands out among the military anti-terrorist group and quickly establishes himself as the group's most popular member.

238,28-1-20,"Avast antivirus sold users' data to Google, Microsoft: Report","In a sensational revelation, an investigation on Monday claimed that the popular Avast antivirus -- installed on nearly 435 millions Windows, Mac and mobile devices globally -- harvested users' data via browser plugins and then sold it to third parties, including Microsoft and Google.

The joint investigation by Motherboard and PCMag that relied on leaked user data and other company documents found that ""the sale of this data is both highly sensitive and is, in many cases, supposed to remain confidential between the company selling the data and the clients purchasing it"".

The leaked documents accessed for the investigation were from a subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast, called Jumpshot.

The Avast antivirus programme was installed on a person's computer which collected the data, and Jumpshot repackaged it into various different products which were sold to big companies.

""Potential clients include Google, Yelp, Microsoft, McKinsey, Pepsi, Sephora, Home Depot, Conde Nast, Intuit, and many others,"" the report claimed.

In a statement, Avast said it has stopped providing browsing data collected by the extensions to Jumpshot.

Some clients even paid millions of dollars for products that include a so-called ""All Clicks Feed"", which can track user behaviour, clicks, and movement across websites in detail.

In copies of contracts with Jumpshot clients, one marketing firm paid over $2 million for data access last year.

Avast offers a selection of free and paid-for antivirus and security tools, in both free and in paid-for formats.

According to the investigation, Avast also recorded ""porn site visits that are anonymized, offered the date and time the user visited the sites, as well as search terms and viewed videos in some instances"".

Multiple Avast users told Motherboard they were not aware that Avast sold browsing data, raising questions about how informed that consent is.

The investigation also that Avast is still harvesting the data, but via the anti-virus software itself, rather than the browser plugins.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/avast-antivirus-sold-users--data-to-google--microsoft--report-2020-01-28.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/avast-antivirus-sold-users--data-to-google--microsoft--report.html
