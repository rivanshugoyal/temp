2,12-1-20,Keonjhar to have 100 Smart Villages,"The Ideal Development Agency (IDA) has launched a Mission Smart Village initiative in Keonjhar district to nurture 100 habitats as Smart Village in next three years.

“We eventually envisage converting 500 villages as Smart Villages in the district by 2030 with convergence of schemes and programmes,” IDA secretary Sebati Singh told media.

“Every village should have a mechanism of people’s participation and the present structure led by Government lacks passion and leadership. Grambandhu will be trained to nurture village champions in each village, those who will be change agents of that village on a unique self reliance enterprise module. Gram bandhu will be the catalyst in the smart initiative and they will

ignite the change agents’ module for improving Gross Happiness Index not GDP alone,” said Singh.

A pilot phase with 20 villages was surveyed by Grambandhus and a two -day barefoot training has been completed in Mukuna village recently. The IDA will promote a startup company in name of Keonjhar Grambandhu Private limited to proffesionalise many activities essential for the mission, she added.

There are seven thematic focuses in the smart village initiative like food, security, productive enterprise, soil -water- climate, health, education, empowering village institutions and quality of life.

3,12-1-20,"‘When I play on stage, I do a conversation with my audience’","“When I play on stage, I do a conversation with my audience,” says the renowned sitarist Ustad Hidayat Husain Khan.

Son of a legendary sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan, Ustad Hidayat Husain Khan grew up with music and hence holds a different level of passion for Indian Classical music. He was in Bhopal on Saturday to perform in the 4th edition of Hriday Drishyam. During his candid and exclusive rendezvous with The Pioneer, Hidayat talked about how music became his first love.

“I think the music is in my genes. Since childhood music has been around me.” Elaborating further, he said, “I believe that I am in a conversation with my audience whenever I play on stage. Honestly, it's more like a soulful interaction with people who are listening to my music.”

On asking about why he only chose ‘sitar’ as an instrument to play, Hidayat said contentedly, “My mother used to play sitar, my elder brother is also into Indian classical music. Hence, my father wanted me to sing and I got my vocal training. As I grew older, I got into serious lessons of sitar and hence I hold a different kind of love for it.” Hidayat not only play sitar, but he sings too when performs.

His first solo concert was held when he was 9 years old in Lucknow. Hidayat is a dedicated, charismatic and fun loving musician. Hidayat believes in versatility of music with amazing and mesmerising vocal style.

About improvisation in music today, Hidayat spoke, “Obviously, the soul is Indian Classical. But, Abba always encouraged us to have versatile interests in music and so you appreciate things and life, after which you are able to connect with the people. So, as musicians working internationally, we play Indian classical, fusion and more and event we are enjoying our work.”

“I like variety and different disciplines and different sources of inspiration and I enjoy all of it,” he added.

On asking about his best composition so far, he said, “I cannot be so precise about it, as I will do my best then there’ll be no room for me to do something better. So with time I keep on improving and create something soulful for my listeners.”

While signing off, the loved musician globally, says Indian classical is all about older people is a myth. Today youngsters too are into Indian classical and they talk about it. “I cannot actually advise any newcomer or an aspirant of music. But, all I would say is to stay honest always.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---when-i-play-on-stage--i-do-a-conversation-with-my-audience---.html

7,13-1-20,Good show in India last time boosted confidence: Turner,"Australia batsman Ashton Turner feels his good showing in India last time has helped him grow in confidence and as they get ready for another three-match ODI series, he is looking forward to getting help from Steve Smith and David Warner who have experience of playing spinners in these conditions.

""I take a lot of confidence out of that (2019 series) against a world-class team and a world-class bowling attack. It has given me confidence that my ability is good enough against the best in the world,"" Turner said on the eve of the first ODI here on Tuesday.

Turner had featured in three ODIs in Australia's last tour of India, which they won 3-2, and scored a defining 84 at Mohali. He said he would look to pick Smith and Warner's brains, especially in the way that they play spinners in this part of the world.

""As a young player coming into the team with little international experience, I'd be crazy not to be picking their brains and trying to learn from them because those two guys are the two best in the world,"" he said.

""I was fortunate to spend a few weeks with Steve at the IPL (with Rajasthan Royals). I spent so much time watching him bat in the nets and picking his brains about how (he) plays particularly in India.

""Dave's (Warner) the same, he's had so much success all around the world but particularly here in India and in the IPL,"" said the 26-year-old.

Turner had a poor IPL last time but he said he learnt his lessons from that.

""Yeah, the IPL didn't go to plan -- getting out first ball, I have definitely learnt some lessons but it's definitely not how I am going to be remembered in my career.

""I'm here in a very different environment to what the IPL is, to what franchise cricket is, to be back here again, to be fortunate enough to be picked in another Australian squad is a completely different beast. It's international cricket, you've got no option but to go out there and put your best foot forward,"" he added.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/good-show-in-india-last-time-boosted-confidence--turner-2020-01-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/good-show-in-india-last-time-boosted-confidence--turner.html
8,12-1-20,Al-Shabab raises its ugly head again,"Al-Shabab has been successful in transforming itself primarily from a terrorist unit to an insurgent group and finally raising itself to the status of a proto-state actor

Somalia, a country in the eastern most part of the African continent in the Horn of Africa, is facing the rage of the Islamic jehad spearheaded by Al-Shabab. It lies along the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean which makes it more vulnerable to external attacks even from the sea front.

The group has about 5,000-9,000 trained cadre, apart from sympathisers and radical supporters all across Somalia. Its main target is to topple the internationally recognised Government of Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, in power since 2012, and establish a Sharia-based state. The Al-Shabab has been successful in transforming itself primarily from a terrorist unit to an insurgent group and finally raising itself to the status of a proto-state actor.

However, depending on circumstances, it can take any of these forms. That is how it has grown and become a potential threat to the survival of the fragile Government of Somalia.

The dastardly car bomb attack by the Al-Shabaab last Saturday once again raised the ghost of Islamic terror in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu. It killed more than 79 people, and injured at least 125 people. Claiming responsibility for the attack, one of the group’s spokesperson Sheik Ali Mohamud said, “….the Mujahideen carried out an attack…targeting a convoy of Turkish mercenaries and apostate militia who were escorting them.” This attack was the biggest to hit Somalia since a truck exploded in 2017 near a fuel tanker in Mogadishu, creating a fireball which killed nearly 500 people.

Al-Shabab in the Arabic language refers to ‘The Youth’. The group is allied to Al-Qaeda. In a paper titled, “Breaking the Bonds between Al-Qaeda and its affiliate organisations”, Daniel L Byman wrote in 2012, “In February, 2012, the Somali-based Shabab formally declared its loyalty to Al-Qaeda, a move that capped the transformation of Al-Qaeda’s relationship with Somali militants into a more substantial partnership. In the early 1990s, Al-Qaeda tried to work in the collapsed Somali state, but often found the violent civil war there overwhelming, so much so that its operatives were unable to make significant inroads. It did, however, kept Somalia as a part of a regional base for its attacks against the US and UN peacekeepers and strikes in Kenya against the US and Israeli targets.”

This indicates how Al-Shabab has grown from Al-Qaeda and gradually expanded its wings, becoming a multi-state actor. At its zenith, Al-Shabab controls nearly 81,000 square miles or about one third of Somalia. However, the Islamic State (ISIS) at its peak, used to occupy only over 30,000 square miles, covering areas in three countries of Iraq, Libya and Syria.

The Al-Shabab emerged as the radical youth wing of Somalia’s now defunct Islamic Courts Union (ICU) in early 2007. But its quick success and aggression provoked the Ethiopian forces to invade Somalia and scatter the group. But the ferocious campaign launched by the insurgents finally drove the Ethiopians away from Somalia. The ICU which operated in Mogadishu from 2000-2006 was a legal and political organisation founded by Muslim clerics from Abgal sub-clan of the influential Hawiye clan. These courts adjudicated personal status and criminal law as per Sharia.

Besides, as they were backed by clan-based militias, they were truly effective in maintaining strong law and order in and around Mogadishu.

It must be noted here that ISIS is not the first Islamic radical group to establish a proto-state in modern times. But Al-Shabab controlled and administered vast territories across Somalia. And it mobilised resources and people around their territorial limits and beyond, long before the ISIS did in 2014 and beyond.

In fact, the Al-Shabab developed a sophisticated and comprehensive taxation system that brought them millions of dollars each year. It collects taxes in the guise of zakat and an excessive tax, in the name of fighting a holy war, the way the ISIS did.

Both the ISIS and the Al-Shabab have the same goal: To create a religious state according to their radical interpretation of Sunni Islam. Also they employ similar tactics and draw their allegiance to Wahabi sect of Islam. The Wahabi movement was founded by Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahab in the 18th century in Najd, Central Arabia. It was adopted by the Saud family in 1744. Today it is widely prevalent in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. As it officially goes, the members of the Wahabi movement regard themselves as ‘al Muwahhidun’ i.e. Unitarians. And it is derived from their emphasis on the ‘absolute oneness of God’ (Tawhid). Therefore, its radical followers and advocates like the ISIS and the Al-Shabab reject all acts they see leading to polytheism. Thus they strongly stress on returning to the original teachings of Islam as mentioned in Quran and Hadith i.e. traditions of Muhammad. Further Wahabi followers condemn all innovations i.e. bidah in Islam in any form.

Though both ISIS and the Al-Shabab draw their inspiration from radical interpretation of Islam, they differ on many fronts. ISIS operated, till its recent fall, in much larger geographical areas than that of the Al-Shabab. The former engaged in extreme atrocities such as mass beheadings, crucifixions and burning victims alive, both for its worldwide propaganda and to spread a regime of Islamic terror. But the Al-Shabab, being an Al-Qaeda sponsor, rejects such brutal tactics as purely unproductive. But recent attacks carried out by the group exposes its double standard both within and outside Somalia.

Though it has been pushed out of the major towns of Somalia by the African Union (AU) troops, including Mogadishu and the vital port of Kismayo in 2011-12, it has remained a potential force in some of the rural areas. It is capable of conducting raids and attacks in nearby countries, such as Kenya.

In fact, it has carried out more than 20 terror attacks in Kenya, including the capital city of Nairobi in the last five years. And it has taken the lives of about 300 people in Kenya so far. Many say that African Union Missions in Somalia (AMISOM) and in Kenya at best have stagnated so far. On the other hand, the operational capacities, intimidation techniques and ground fighting prowess of Al-Shabab have been growing. The worst part is that the Federal Government of Somalia is plagued by corruption and infighting. It is seriously creeping as the service-delivery by both Mogadishu and the newly formed states are lacking in true sense of the term.

Clearly, despite its internal and external contradictions, the influence and aggressive mood of the Al-Shabab is on the upswing again. It has been successful in spreading a regime of fear among the commoners. And more importantly, the insurgents have absolutely clogged the basic functions of the civil administration across Somalia. This has, in reality, turned the tide towards the radicals, both in terms of displaying its weight and equally paralysing the mobilisation of the civil society, particularly at the grassroots level. But what has been predicted is that the potential long-lasting damage posed by its continuous killing of Somali civilians may further erode its support base.

9,12-1-20,"Govt needs to nail CAA lies, silence won’t work","It is still too early to be certain as to whether the furore over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be a short-term blast or will have a lasting effect on the politics of the country. The trends as yet are contradictory but the patterns are worth exploring.

First, it is clear that the main body of support for the anti-CAA protests has come from the Muslim community. Without this support, the size of the protests would have been modest and may not have had any sizeable impact. Muslim support has given the protests both its body and its muscle. However, while providing the crowds, the Muslim community has made important political adjustments to secure incremental support. The question is: are these shifts purely tactical or do they symbolise a more profound review of the community’s political stand?

Let us look at some of these shifts. The past few weeks have seen vigorous assertions of their Indian-ness by the Muslim community. The protest marches have seen generous use of the national tricolour flag and gatherings have ended with a respectful singing of the national flag. On top of that, Muslim leaders have proclaimed their allegiance to the Indian Constitution and all that it stands for. There has been a radical overhaul in the public projection of Muslim leaders too. The MP for Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi, for example, has emerged as an articulate voice of the community. This rise to national fame has also coincided with a move away from his earlier status as the militant leader of a minority ghetto. He has now become a respectable mainstream leader, holding forth on profound questions of constitutional propriety. The liberals have come to love him and his political pedigree — as the leader of a party that was once inextricably associated with the pro-separatist Razakarsof the Nizam’s territories — has been whitewashed. Owaisi now projects himself as the leader of a community that voluntarily chose to remain in India because of the Constitution.

This is not to deny that there have been other trends too. Religious war cries and pro-Azadi slogans have also featured in the protests. Muslim leaders have also chosen strategic silence on the question of whether their opposition to Hindus from Bangladesh securing fast-track citizenship is total or conditional on this facility being extended to all illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. There has also been a stubborn refusal by Muslim intellectuals to accept that it is conditions of intolerance by neighbouring Islamic nations that prompted the Hindus and other minorities into coming to India. This has prompted the assertion that the allegiance to the Indian flag and Constitution is tactical and that once it has shown the Narendra Modi Government its place, the old identity politics will resume.

Certainly, there is the unresolved issue of whether in future the Muslim involvement in political life will be centred on ‘secular’ political parties or whether the Owaisi model of a separate pressure group will find acceptance. Mamata Banerjee, for example, has decided that in West Bengal she will do her utmost to keep Owaisi out.

The second issue centres on students and liberals who have given the protests an acceptable face and been responsible for the sympathetic media treatment of the agitation. It is heartening that the students and liberals are concerned over any possible distortions to the secular character of the Indian Constitution — although they are wrong in identifying the CAA as a departure. In the process, however, they have demonstrated spectacular insensitivity towards those who were turfed out of their homes by religious bigotry. They have also shown a bewildering degree of contempt towards Parliament and a legitimately elected government, not to mention alternative points of few. In some places there has also been a marked propensity for violence.

Most important, there is an emerging view of student vanguardism that centres on the idea that the youth, in alliance with Muslims and free-floating liberals, will be the agents of change in India. This is complimented by a belief that all those who disagree with their flawed certitudes are automatically fascists undeserving of any hearing.

Finally, there are the mainstream Opposition parties which, at this juncture has a limited agenda of embarrassing the Modi government and reducing its manoeuvrability. These parties are happy using Muslims and students and piggybacking on them for the moment, at least until the Parliament session. However, Parliament will ensure there are deep divisions which cant be papered over.

For the Centre, the anti-CAA stir is a formidable challenge and its impact should not be minimised, at least in a section of the urban middle classes. The government has so far believed that the protests will fade out sooner rather than later. However, while patience may work, it is equally important that the government undertakes a massive publicity blitz aimed at telling everyone what the CAA is all about and why it does not pose a threat to India’s Muslim population. Charges of making an Indian stateless is too grave to be responded with silence. It needs a quick response. Equally necessary are communications on the rules of the CAA and horrific implications of any state government not cooperating in the National Population Register exercise.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/govt-needs-to-nail-caa-lies--silence-won---t-work.html

He owns 10 acres divided between four family members including himself in Dhaamnod, Kasrawad block-Khargone. His elder son Yogesh studies in class 10th while daughter Tanushree is in 8th standard. ""I have one tube well and one conventional well. Enough for the size of my field. Besides, three buffalos, two bulls and a cow are a great help.

The bulls are still useful, he adds.

Sharing his views about various dimensions of farming, Santosh Yadav informs that the labour skilled in farming is thinning out. I have to perform many labour- intensive farm activities, he says. ""My soil health was deteriorated but timely testing was a great help. Deficiencies of potash and zinc have been removed. I have made it a practice not to use pesticides. Though not easy, but gradually zero level can be achieved, he says.

Appreciating, the Jai Kisan Crop Loan Waiver Scheme, he observes that all debt–ridden farmers in Kasravad now feel relieved. Their crop loans upto Rs two lakh have been waived off, he says. Last year I cultivated bitter gourd on less than one acre and earned Rs 1.10 lakh at the rate of Rs 20 to 30 per kg.

Shivlata Mehto owns 4.5 acre out of total 10 acre in her family. The rest is owned by her husband and two sons. The elder son Rishabh Mehato is pursuing MSc in Agriculture at RKDF college Bhopal while the younger son Arjun Mehto is doing computer science from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Government Polytechnic Bhopal.

She informs that Rishabh is deeply interested in farm machinery and can repair tractor engines. Though they are free to pursue career of their interest but we don't mind if they join us.

""I got the award for production of gram during 2017-18. The yield was assessed round 18 quintal per acre. The market rate of Rs 4,000 per quintal was a big relief.

The biggest advantage is that my field is is in Pathrota village just 5 kilometre from Itarsi tehsil headquarters. It is a Gram Panchayat having a population about 3,000. ""My husband Sahab Lal helps me help me a lot in management of farm activities, she says.

Similarly, Kanchan Verma owns a sizeable land measuring 70 acre but divided into two families in Somalwada village in Itarsi, Hoshangabad. She received the Award for production of wheat in 2016- 17. The wheat output was assessed as 44 quintals per acre.

She has a piece of advice for other farmers regarding examination of soil. Soil testing is fruitful before every season and always avoid monoculture practice. ""I got my soil tested and zinc deficiency was reported. So I got it treated accordingly before the start of sowing.

The last year, we harvested beans on a larger area brought them to market at least one month before the season. Thus, we got handsome price of Rs 70 to 80 per kg, she informs.

31,12-1-20,Threat persists over jobs of 16K teachers in U’khand,"With Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) yet to recognise the in-service training imparted to them, the threat on jobs of more than 16,000 teachers working in different primary schools of Uttarakhand still persists. With passage of the National Council for Teacher Education Bill (Amended)– 2019 which grants retrospective recognition to the teacher education courses of certain institutions in parliament, these teachers were hoping that threat over their jobs was removed. However, their hopes have got dashed as the file for grant of approval for their training which is necessary for saving their jobs is pending in the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) from last many months.

The Uttarakhand Education Minister, Arvind Pandey, while interacting with The Pioneer, accepted that the the special Basic Teaching Certificate (BTC) teachers is still unresolved. He said that the NCTE would take the final decision on the issue. The Minister said that he would take up the issue with the Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank soon.

After the amendment in the NCTE Act, the apex body of teacher education sought details about the in service training provided to these teachers at various District Institute of Education and Training (DIET). The education department sent all the details required to the NCTE and the necessary approval of the training from the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT). However, the important file of approval has got stuck up in the HRD ministry.

It is worth mentioning here that when the NCTE amendment Bill was passed by Rajya Sabha last year, many leaders, including Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Rajya Sabha MP, Anil Baluni and Education Minister Arvind Pandey took credit for saving the jobs of teachers. The new Bill aims to amend the NCTE Act of 1993 which grants retrospective permission to the teacher training courses which were not approved by the apex body of teacher education.

The issue

There are more than 16,000 serving teachers in Uttarakhand who are Special BTC (referred as Vishisht BTC teachers). These Bachelor of Education (BEd) qualified teachers were imparted an in- service training of special BTC in different DIET from the year 2001 to 2016 to make them eligible to teach in primary classes in the Government schools. However, in 2018, it was realised that the all important recognition from NCTE was not taken by the education department of Uttarakhand for special BTC course. A shocked department then pleaded to NCTE to grant recognition in retrospection which was not accepted as it violates the Act by which it is governed. As per the new guidelines of the union Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry, only the Diploma in Elementary Education (DElEd) qualified candidates are eligible to teach the primary students. It had made it clear that after March 2019, all primary teachers who don’t have a DElEd degree or BTC certificate would be removed from primary teaching.

32,12-1-20,"Tourist rush, snow-laden roads halt Himachal","The weekend rush of tourists to enjoy the snowy landscape, coupled with slippery roads and lack of traffic management in picturesque tourist resorts, mainly Shimla and Manali in Himachal Pradesh, have brought them to a halt, literally.

The result: Long traffic jams adding to the problems of the commuters.

For the third consecutive day, tourist spots beyond Shimla like Kufri and Narkanda have been out of bounds owing to all major roads being under a thick blanket of snow.

So was Manali where all the prominent tourist destinations towards the Solang ski slopes have been closed to traffic. Road connectivity to Manali was restored fully on Friday.

Officials said work is on to resume the traffic after clearing the snow piled on the roads but it will take a day or two for normalcy to return.

As per the State Disaster Management Authority, more than 800 link roads, comprising nearly 600 in Shimla region alone, are blocked.

The government advised motorists to check weather conditions before they venture out on the high hills as chances of snapping of road links are still high.

Shimla and its nearby spots like Kufri and Narkanda and the popular tourist resorts of Manali and Dalhousie are still covered in a thick blanket of snow.

""It took 10 hours to cover 65 kms between Narkanda and Shimla due to lack of traffic management and slippery road conditions,"" Akshay Sood, a resident of Shimla, told IANS.

He blamed tourists for irresponsible driving and traffic snarls.

Sood along with his family was stuck in Narkanda for the past three days after closure of road links due to snowfall.

""I was charged Rs 900 by a porter for carrying my luggage from my hotel to the car parking that was just 500 metres away. There is no mechanism to regulate them. They are robbing the tourists,"" Abhay Singh, a tourist, said in Shimla.

Officials said roads in the higher reaches of Kinnaur, Shimla, Chamba, Mandi, Kullu and Sirmaur districts were severely hit by heavy snowfall and work was on to reopen them.

In the state capital and tourist resorts like Manali and Dalhousie, internal roads were too slippery for traffic as these were laden with snow. Even walking in the streets was risky.

Although the Shimla Municipal Corporation has cleared the snow on Cart Road and some VIP roads, most of the other roads have not been cleared yet.

Due to the slippery condition of roads and pathways in Shimla, many pedestrians, most of them tourists, were getting injured. Two Shimla residents died after slipping from snow-laden pathways.

Tourists have been facing much difficulty in Shimla and Manali as most of the parking lots are slippery and covered with a good quantity of snow.

The Himachal Pradesh Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) has been operating buses for Rohru and Chopal areas in Shimla district via Rajgarh in Sirmaur district.

Officials said vehicular traffic on the Shimla-Theog-Rohru road via Kharapathar, the shortest route, remained suspended for the fourth day as a thick layer of snow covered the road.

Buses from Shimla town to Rampur and Kinnaur district were plying via Dhami.

A day earlier, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who reviewed the situation, directed authorities to ensure that all essential services are restored in the areas affected due to heavy snowfall.

Sixty six people, including sick, old and pregnant women, were airlifted from Lahaul-Spiti to Kullu.

The Met Office here has forecast more snowfall across the state from January 12, with chances of a heavy spell a day later.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tourist-rush--snow-laden-roads-halt-himachal.html

35,12-1-20,Capt reiterates demand for VGF from Centre for biomass power and solar hybrid power projects,"Pointing out that the Punjab Government had already submitted a detailed proposal on the subject, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has written to the Centre reiterating his demand for viability gap funding (VGF) for Biomass Power Projects and Biomass Solar Hybrid Power Projects to check stubble burning in the State.

Capt Amarinder, in a letter to the Union Minister of State for Power, New and Renewable Energy RK Singh, has sought his personal attention towards framing of scheme or guidelines for promoting biomass power projects by providing one-time viability gap funding in a phased manner, and for a pilot Biomass Solar Hybrid Power Project by Ministry New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), as suggested by the State Government on several occasions.

“This would go a long way in complying with the directions of the Supreme Court for tackling the problem of stubble burning in Punjab,” stressed Capt Amarinder.

The Chief Minister once again asked the Ministry to provide to Punjab Rs five crore per mega watt (MW) of Biomass Power Projects and Rs 3.5 crore per MW for Biomass Solar Hybrid Power Projects (bundled solar biomass energy in the ratio of 2:1) to help the State address the problem of pollution arising from stubble burning.

He pointed out that the issue was first raised by the State Government in a letter dated February 5, 2019, seeking in-principle approval of VGF at the rate of Rs five crore per MW for biomass power projects of 150 MW. However, the Ministry had responded on May 6 that there was no scheme in operation at present to provide VGF for Biomass Power Projects.

In his letter, Capt Amarinder further recalled that in a meeting chaired by the Union Minister, on November 6, to discuss the issues related to co-firing of biomass etc, it was decided that the “Punjab Government shall submit a proposal for installing the power plants exclusively based on the agro residue (paddy straw) and integrated residue collection system, seeking the grant or subsidy from MNRE for the proposal,” he said.

“The equipment may be procured under Make in India guidelines. The subsidy shall be linked to the operation of the plant, that is it should be ensured that these plants consume the committed amount of agro residue,” he said.

Subsequently, the State Government had submitted a detailed proposal in this regard to the Ministry, the Chief Minister further pointed out.

In fact, he said, as the matter of stubble burning came up before the Apex Court, the Punjab Government, on December 12, 2019, again wrote to the Ministry seeking the formulation of a new scheme for the VGF, as sought by the State, in subsequent annual plans.

Underlining the need for such funding, the Chief Minister noted that agriculture production in the last decade had shown a remarkable upward trend, resulting in production of surplus quantities of food grains.

Punjab being an agrarian state produces about 20 million tons of paddy straw every year, and out of this, 7.5 million tons is utilized in domestic industry, while the remaining 12.5 million tons of biomass is equivalent to about 1250 MW of power, he pointed out.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-reiterates-demand-for-vgf-from-centre-for-biomass-power-and-solar-hybrid-power-projects.html
36,12-1-20,CM addresses public issues through Twitter,"Soon after swearing in as the Chief Minister, Hemant Soren won hearts by his well-meaning gesture of asking for books instead of bouquets. And hardly a fortnight into his tenure at the helm, he is giving his due attention to even the smallest of concerns raised by commoners — all it takes is a Tweet, and the CM will come to one’s rescue.

Right from anomalies in public distribution system to negligence towards patients in Government hospitals and bribery by officials to power failures, the CM has addressed the pettiest of issues plaguing people of the State only with a tweet from his official Twitter handle.

People facing problems related to anomalies in Government machinery are tweeting to Soren and he is being prompt in directing the concerned Deputy Commissioner to look into the matter. This practice of addressing issues on Twitter has shown some quick results too. The licence of a Public Distribution System (PDS) shop owner in Hazaribag, who did not supply ration to poor beneficiaries in a particular village, was cancelled soon after the CM’s intervention. Soren was informed about the anomaly by a commoner on micro blogging website Twitter and he was quick to direct a probe into the matter.

“Twitter has become a platform for fast-track solution of problems. The Chief Minister is active on the platform and is very prompt in addressing such issues,” said Navin Singh, one of the Twitterati, who had sought the CM’s help online.

On Friday, Soren retweeted a complaint highlighting involvement of police in coal smuggling in Dhanbad. One Dhananjay Mandal had shared a video of the bodyguard of a policeman demanding bribe from coal smugglers in the district. “DC Dhanbad and Dhanbad Police, corruption, illegal mining won’t be tolerated at any cost. Please ensure that adequate action is taken to curb these practices,” Soren tweeted.

Responding to a tweet on Tuesday, Soren asked Deputy Commissioner of Latehar to inquire into a case of power failure in 200 households of a village. The DC has initiated an inquiry into the matter.

The CM’s activity on Twitter is not only limited to highlighting concerns of commoners, but also to seek follow ups on media reports.

He has tweeted several media reports lately asking the concerned authorities for explanations and directing probes if necessary.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-addresses-public-issues-through-twitter.html

40,12-1-20,AAP to move motion to scrap Power Purchasing Agreements,"The Punjab Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday challenged the Capt Amarinder Singh government for holding an open debate on high power tariff in the state, saying the private power agreements inked by the erstwhile government could be scrapped in just five minutes.

Talking to reporters, senior leader Aman Arora, Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Meet Hayer and Jai Krishan Singh Rouri (All MLAs) said that the agreements signed between the private players and the Badals involved a scam worth crores of rupees, saying that earlier Sukhbir Singh Badal and now Capt Amarinder Singh was pocketing huge ‘profits’, which was why the latter had neither nixed the anti-state PPOs nor reviewed the accounts, as he had promised to the people of the state before coming to power in 2017.

""If the Capt government could scrap the water sharing agreements and the 2100 government-run service centres paying Rs 220 crore to BSL company, why couldn’t it scrap the PPOs in Punjab"", Arora asked.

Commenting on the one-sided PPOs, Arora alleged that SEPKO, a Chinese company installed thermal plants in Sasan in Gujarat and at Talwandi Sabo in Punjab with similar technology and budget, saying Sasan was paying 17 paise per unit while Talwandi Sabo was coughing up 8 times more, precisely Rs 1.42, forcing the common consumer to pay Rs 9 per unit, which, he said, was on the higher side compared to other states.

Similarly, citing the Thermal plant at Rajpura and Mudra Port power plant in Gujarat, saying that hefty kickback was being usurped from private players, saying that the agreement on the thermal power plant also involved a bigger scam, Arora said.

The Sunam MLA said that the AAP would move Private Member Bill in the coming assembly session to scrap all power pacts, which, he said, would put across the perspective of all political parties including the government, indicating whether they were in favour of the common consumer or the power mafia ruing the roost in the state.

Arora said that, after open admission by former power ministers, Rana Gurjit Singh and Gurpreet Singh Kangar, of paying worth several crores annually to the power plants under the agreement, the 7-page letter shot off by his cabinet colleague Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to Amarinder Singh pointing out the flip side of the pacts was significant.

Meet Hayer said that the Capt Amarinder government was in no mood to scrap the PPOs, for simple reason that he was allegedly pocketing huge ‘amounts’ leaving the people to pay high tariff for electricity.

Kultar Singh Sandhwan on the occasion said that that the meters installed in the state were not weather friendly and therefore there was loot upon loot over the power. Jai Krishan Singh Rouri said that the Arvind Kejriwal government had been providing cheapest electricity in Delhi by scrapping all deals with the private players there.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-to-move-motion-to-scrap-power-purchasing-agreements.html

42,12-1-20,Drones in Punjab matter of concern: DGP,"The echo of the drone attack by the US on Iran killing the Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani was heard in Punjab on Friday. Just about a week after the attack, Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta minced no words to say that the increasing use of drones was indeed a “matter of concern”, especially as far as the VIP security is concerned.

To make the matters worse, a drone was hard to detect. The DGP said that a drone makes a little noise and there was no technology to detect its presence, making visual spotting the only effective method to check its presence.

The State has been on high alert since the outbreak of drone activity along the Indo-Pak border in August when the drones were first sighted, followed by the recovery of two in August and September.

The state police is working in close coordination with the Border Security Forces (BSF) to check the drone activity across the border.

Admitting drones to be a “threat”, Gupta said that drones are of different specifications and capacities according to its make.

“VIP security is a matter of concern. Especially, as the recent instances are there where the drones are being used to attack,” said DGP while mentioning the US killing Iranian army commander, besides other similar cases.

At the same time, he expressed serious concern over its “easy availability” and “simple operation” of drones.

“The drones are not difficult to operate. Moreover, one can even order it from a website and get it. One does not require any special skills or training to operate a drone, in fact one can learn and it by going through the instructions,” said the DGP.

He pointed that one of the three persons arrested by the Punjab Police, Army soldier Rahul Chauhan, had bought a drone from OLX website.

“Chauhan has revealed that he bought a black coloured, partially damaged Drone – Aspire 02 model – during the second half of 2019 from OLX for about Rs 1.50 lakh, which was partially damaged. After repairing the drone, he sold it on OLX for about Rs 2.75 lakhs. From these sale proceeds, Rahul purchased a new Drone – DJI Inspire 02 model for about Rs 3.20 lakh from Pune and sold it to a criminal residing in Amritsar for Rs 5.70 lakh. He purchased another Drone – DJI Matrice 600 – for about Rs 5.35 lakh, and stored it in Karnal, from where it had been recovered,” said the DGP, indicating at the easy availability of the drones.

Regarding countering the drones, the DGP said that technologies to immobilize drone were available and efforts were on to develop them indigenously in the country too.

“As of now, we solely depend on visual spotting which is sole reliable method. These drones don’t have any light on it, and even its sound is not much. The sorties were made at night and spotting a drone at night is not an easy task,” he said adding that but the BSP personnel, and villagers have spotted the drone activity near the border.

The state police chief maintained that there are various technologies available. “One is cutting off the signal, like if beam, which is operating the drone, is cut through electro-magnetic. Then there are guns also. Various countries, like Israel, also have developed various anti-drone equipments,” he said.

Efforts were being made develop in-house solutions in the country, he added.

Following the increasing incidents of drone hovering inside Indian territory on Indo-Pak border, the state police department was considering to buy anti-drone equipment from Israel to detect such devices and jam communications between them and their operators.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/drones-in-punjab-matter-of-concern--dgp.html

47,12-1-20,Creativity will decide future leadership: Borah,"“Engineering has new challenges before it and in future also. Now nano-engineering, bio-engineering, mecotronics have emerged. The biggest strength is creativity and through which only the future leadership will be prepared,” said Sonmoni Borah, secretary to Governor while addressing the Indian Engineers Federation Western Region and Engineering Council meeting.

He further said creativity is a unique character which should not be allowed to die but each design has new thinking and new format, adopting which the engineers can progress.

He said artificial intelligence and robotics role have increased and within minutes new design can be made.

“Idea can be shared but even if any new technique arrives even then robot will not be able to be creative. Leadership is not limited to developed countries but the third world countries can also have it,” he said.

Borah urged engineers to be ready to match the global changes. Their effort towards design or infrastructure should have social relationship in sync with culture and traditions. He added that engineers should come up with out of box thinking and maximum utilization of existing ones.

On closure of engineering colleges, he said seats are becoming limited as only traditional faculties are being taught there and the need is for re-engineering courses, he said.

48,12-1-20,Amendment in APMC Act need of hour: NABARD CGM,"NABARD Chief General Manager AK Padhi, on Saturday, has stressed on amending the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act to make it more farmers’-friendly. In the present form, the Act is benefitting the traders only and farmers are forced to sell their produce on the terms dictated by traders, he added.

Addressing a daylong workshop on ‘Development of efficient and effective system for small holder farmers practicing integrated farming’ at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Padhi said 19 APMCs are working at District and sub District level in Jharkhand but electronic trading has not started anywhere. “Weighing, assessing, storage and internet facilities will have to be properly developed there for connecting them with electronic market. Government of India has planned to link 22000 rural markets with electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) with the objective of making the marketing system more transparent and giving greater voice to farmers. Aggregation of farmers into groups like Farmers’ Producers Organisations, cooperative societies and companies was a must for effective and remunerative marketing of their produce,” he added.

Padhi further said that the agricultural graduates can easily get a loan of Rs 20 lakh in individual capacity and Rs 1 crore by forming group of five graduates from NABARD on 40 per cent subsidy for starting agri-clinics and agribusiness. “They should try to become job providers by starting their own enterprise instead of running after jobs. Jharkhand has over 5,000 farmers’ cooperatives but almost all of them are non functional. As a result of the Rs 100 paid by consumer for agri produce, farmers get only Rs 35 and rest goes to middlemen. If farmers are more organized, they can fetch higher prices,” he added.

MS Malik, Principal Investigator (PI) of CAAST project entitled ‘Standardization of Integrated Framing System Models for the State of Jharkhand’ sanctioned to BAU under National Agricultural Higher Education Project (NAHEP) said integrated farming models are to be developed in all the Districts of Jharkhand under the project to benefit small and marginal farmers. “An Environment Lab would be set up on the University campus, which will work on understanding the consequence of climate change and research for new techniques. Under this project worth Rs 23 crore to be implemented in three years a number of national and international seminars are to be organised,” h added.

Managing Director, Medha Dairy Ltd, Ranchi, SK Singh said farmers have benefitted a lot by dairy cooperatives. “Collection and marketing of milk by the company during last five years reached from 9000 litres to 1.25 lakh litres due to increasing strong network of milk cooperative societies,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amendment-in-apmc-act-need-of-hour--nabard-cgm.html

53,12-1-20,‘Cong doing movie tourism to deviate attention from issues’,"State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo has condemned Congress ministers Rameshwar Oraon and Alamgir Alam and other Congressmen for making ‘Chhapak’ movie a media event. Pratul said that the Congress did nothing for these acid-affected young women during their 50-year rule at the Centre.

On the other hand the NDA Government at the Centre not only worked to bring it under the category of heinous crime but also made a provision for reservation in Government job to the victims of acid attack.

He said that the NDA Government made a provision for punishment up to life imprisonment for the perpetrators of this crime.

The NDA Government also enacted stringent laws to control the sale of acid. Pratul said that the Congress leaders have acted as publicity agents of Deepika Padukone by making it a media event.

He added the Congress leaders, who made this whole issue just a publicity stunt, should also look into the struggle within the acid attack victims.

If the Congressmen were truly heartbroken for the youths suffering from acid attacks, then they would have made awareness against this by making some big announcements. But, when the reality of the JNU protest comes to the fore and the public is angry at the public outrage by opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, the Congress is trying to divert attention through ‘movie tourism’, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---cong-doing-movie-tourism-to-deviate-attention-from-issues---.html
54,12-1-20,Cop held for raping minor,"nA school student was reportedly raped by an assistant constable posted in Durgkondal police station of the district and three others, police said here on Saturday.

“The assistant constable has been arrested and suspended,” Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Kirtan Rathod said while adding the three are yet to be traced.

According to police, the victim was raped by Assistant Constable Parab Jade who was posted at Durgkondal police station, on November 16 last year.

“The incident happened while the victim was returning home from her school,” Lohattar police station in-charge Bhojraj Bhoi informed.

Four days later, three bikers caught the girl and took her to jungle nearby where they raped her. They threatened her of dire consequences if she spoke to anyone about the incident, the TI added.

The entire episode came to light when the girl became pregnant following which an FIR was lodged under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act, the TI added.

As per the ASP two separate FIRs have been registered in this case. Following the FIR the cop was suspended and arrested, while police are trying to find the whereabouts of the other three youths.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cop-held-for-raping-minor.html
55,12-1-20,Legal hurdles may mar Babulal’s ‘homecoming’,"Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P) chief Babulal Marandi may have to convince one of his two other legislators to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with him or give away his membership of House if at all he makes a return to the saffron party, legal experts said on Saturday.

“As per the 10th schedule of the Constitution, a legislator alone cannot join another party. At least 2/3rd majority of the total number of MLAs of a particular party have to merge with the other party in order to avoid legal complications,” said Sanjay Kumar Vidrohi, senior lawyer and elected member of the Jharkhand State Bar Council (JSBC).

Speculations about the return of Marandi — the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand — to the BJP are rife. Rumours about the final sealing of a deal between Marandi and BJP’s senior leadership have kept the media and the political circuit here abuzz. However, no official statement has come on this regard from Marandi or any of his party’s legislators.

JVM-P, which was the only party to field candidates in all the 81 Assembly constituencies during the recently held polls, managed to win only three constituencies — Dhanwar, Mandar and Poreyahat. JVM-P General Secretary Pradeep Yadav — now the Legislative Party Leader of JVM-P — won from Poreyahat, while former Minister Bandhu Tirkey won from Mandar on a JVM-P ticket.

Yadav as well as Tirkey have been staunch critics of the BJP throughout their respective political careers. And Marandi, who comes from a BJP background, will have to convince one of them to join the BJP with him in order to retain his legislatorship, said legal experts.

“There are rumours that Marandi may even give away his legislatorship to join the BJP. There will be no legal disputes if he gives away his legislatorship. However, if he wishes to stay a legislator and join the BJP, then he will have to follow the rules laid down by the Constitution,” said A Alam, a Ranchi-based lawyer.

The two JVM-P legislators — Bandhu Tirkey and Pradeep Yadav — did not respond to The Pioneer’s phone calls on Saturday. Marandi’s phone, on the other hand, was unreachable. However, Tirkey told a news channel on Saturday that he will not join the BJP even if Marandi does. “If at all the rumours prove to be true, I will not support any such decision. However, I still have trust in Marandiji and I don’t think he will take such a step,” Tirkey said.

BJP in Jharkhand is trying to recover from a humiliating loss in the recent elections. The party that ruled the State for the past five years could only manage to win 25 seats and also lost its place of being the single largest party.

Political gurus see BJP’s loss as a result of an anti-incumbency wave in the tribal community, which was won over by Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) in Jharkhand. The party, they said, now wants to re-induct Marandi — a tribal leader — to regain the trust of tribals here.

Marandi, who became the CM on a BJP ticket in 2000, has his roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological organization of the BJP. Sources in the BJP said that Marandi may even give away his legislatorship to join the party as the party is likely to give him a respectable position in the organisation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/legal-hurdles-may-mar-babulal---s----homecoming---.html

It all began with a ‘match’ on dating app Tinder as the youth, a bank staff, and the girl, a college Lecturer, came to know each other on the platform on January 2 and exchanged mobile phone numbers on the very day. The incident later took an ugly turn as the youth alleged that the girl’s friends kidnapped and blackmailed him for money. “After exchanging contact numbers on Tinder on January 2, we decided to meet next day.

“While I was taking her to the hospital on my motorcycle, her two associates intercepted the vehicle, thrashed me and forcibly dragged me to a house, where I was held captive for a day. They took away money and debit/credit cards from my possession, and also demanded Rs 5 lakh,” he added.

On the other hand, the girl accused the youth of ‘harassing’ her besides taking her photos and recording her videos without her ‘consent’ while she was ‘unconscious’. “I had sought help of a person for deleting the photos and videos from his mobile phone,” she said and refuted the abduction allegation levelled against her by the youth.

65,12-1-20,Kejriwal slams BJP for questioning free services,"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday slammed Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) for opposing AAP's policies of providing free services to residents of the national capital.

Kejriwal said that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is a party showing interest in serving people rather indulging in corruption. BJP is opposing free electricity, water, education, medicine, bus travel in Delhi. We have given these facilities to the people of Delhi by saving the money which would have been siphoned off in corruption,"" Kejriwal asserted.

""My question to the BJP is - Is it okay to steal the money of the public or is it okay to stop the theft and give the people free facilities with that money?"" Kejriwal said in a tweet.

The AAP has been claiming that BJP is against the Delhi Government's pro-people policies, and if the saffron party is voted to power in next month's Assembly polls then it would stop all these policies.

Reacting on BJP's National General Secretary Ani Jain's statement on distributing free electricity and water to Delhiites, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that each vote cast for BJP is a vote against free electricity, education and healthcare.

AAP leader said that BJP is insulting the people of Delhi who are the beneficiaries of the AAP Government's pro-people policies by calling them freeloaders.

Sisodia demanded apologies from BJP leader and said ""BJP should apologize to the people of Delhi for calling them freeloader. It's the duty of every Government to serve the people. We are here to serve our citizens of Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

""BJP is against free electricity, free water and free travel for women.

This can be their agenda as a party but they cannot insult the people of Delhi who are the beneficiaries of this pro-people policies,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-slams-bjp-for-questioning-free-services.html

Sharma said that it was very strange that the masked ABVP hoodlums, who unleashed violence in JNU, have not yet been arrested despite the emergence of the videos of their attacks, which clearly establishes that the attacks against students were masterminded by the BJP.

The Cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at the Lok Seva Bhawan here, suggested that a Socio-Economic Caste Enumeration be done either by inserting suitable columns in the census format or by prescribing a separate format for a simultaneous enumeration of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes and Other Backward Classes/Castes.

The Cabinet also resolved to impress upon the Central Government to ensure that these enumeration details are published without any delay.

“This Socio-Economic Caste Enumeration will enable the State Government to accelerate the pace of development of SEBC and OBC communities for greater inclusive growth. As we are commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, this will be a fitting tribute to his idea of India guided by his talisman in which the welfare of the poorest and the weakest becomes the core objective of the State,” Law Minister Pratap Jena told reporters.

While Odisha has made appreciable progress in improving the human development indicators of these sections of society, especially during the last two decades, there is a need to further accelerate this process of inclusive growth and transformation, argued Jena.

While no formal census with caste details has been done since 1931, the Cabinet observed that unavailability of reliable and authentic data about the exact numbers of the SEBC and OBC, geographical areas of their spread and density has been a huge challenge in ensuring focussed and outcome specific planning.

The necessity of having such data was well appreciated by the Union Government as evident from the Socio-Economic Caste Census of 2011, added Jena.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-seeks-sebc-enumeration-in-2021.html

87,12-1-20,"AAP, Cong may forge an alliance for Delhi elections: Vijay Goel","Senior Bhartiya Janta Party leader Vijay Goel on Saturday accused the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress of being hand-in-glove and said the two parties may forge an alliance for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections.

Goel said AAP and Congress are on same page on issues like corruption, protest against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizen. In the run up to the 2013 assembly elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had claimed he had 375-page evidence against then Congress government, but all know what action he took after coming to power, Goel, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, said.

In Delhi, the Congress and the AAP ""instigated riots"" on the issue of CAA, Goel said, adding that both parties are misleading the people of Delhi.

Congress's Delhi unit chief Subhash Chopra has dismissed any possibility of an alliance with the AAP for the assembly polls, asserting his party will win a ""clear majority"" on its own and form the next government in the city.

The Delhi Assembly elections will be held on February 8 and results declared on February 11.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap--cong-may-forge-an-alliance-for-delhi-elections--vijay-goel.html

90,12-1-20,Jharkhand — The way forward,"Sustainable Development’ is the ability to meet the needs of the present while contributing to the future generations’ needs. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to improve the future generations' life by restoring the previous ecosystem damage and resisting to contribute to further ecosystem damage. The relevance of sustainable development line of thought can never be overemphasized for the newly carved State of Jharkhand. Hence the planners must never lose sight of holistic development needs of the State while making the blueprint for the growth and development in the State.

Growth from the perspective of Developed countries takes into account pure economic growth considerations. The focus changes considerably if a holistic view of development i.e. sustainable development is taken. Focusing merely on fast trajectory of growth may overlook the growth and priorities of less developed economies which are still grappling with the problems of fulfilling basic human needs and infrastructure. United Nations’ (UN) studies and many others have underlined the fact that humankind is using up and depleting natural resources at a faster rate than they are being replaced. If this continues, future generations will not have the resources they need for their development. In this sense, much of current development is unsustainable—it can’t be continued for both practical and moral reasons. Related issues include the need for greater attention to poverty alleviation and respect for human rights. A useful articulation of the values and principles of sustainability can be found in the Earth Charter. It offers an integrated vision and definition of strong sustainability. The document, an ethical framework for a sustainable world, was developed over several years after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and launched officially in 2000. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

This year, MAXI Fair once again has five research problems from among the biggest names from diverse industries — ITC, Allied Blenders & Distillers, Polycab, Perfetti Van Melle, and Hindustan Unilever.

The team at MAXI has always striven to break the frontiers of market research and as a part of its attempt to go big with the 41st MAXI Fair, it would be undertaking its very first B2B off-ground research project in partnership with Hindustan Unilever that will be carried out for a duration of two months by the Research Analytics and Web wing of the Marketing Association of XLRI in collaboration with Nielsen and the XLRI marketing faculty.

Given MAXI's rich history and the special place it holds in Jamshedpur’s heart, every year the city flocks to the XLRI grounds to play these games that are used for research, and also to enjoy the numerous other attractions that the fair offers.

This year, MAXI Fair would be hosting not one but two renowned comedians, Sorabh Pant, from East India Comedy label, and Kumar Varun from the Canvas Laughter Club label on Sunday.

“India is moving ahead with self-respect and dignity. This law (CAA) is not against any caste or religion. The Congress is playing with the national interest,” the chief minister said while addressing a public gathering after inaugurating the ‘Hunar Haat’ along with Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Lucknow on Saturday.

“The Congress is doing appeasement politics. Those who are talking about saving the Constitution are strangulating it,” he added.

Referring to the Liaquat-Nehru Pact, the chief minister said, “It was clear from the 1950 Liaquat-Nehru agreement that minorities will be taken care of by both the countries (India and Pakistan). But the population of Muslims has increased by six to seven times in India while in Pakistan it has decreased.”

The SP chief on Saturday visited Firozabad to meet the families of the anti-CAA protesters who died in the violence during the protest on December 20 and handed over cheques of Rs 5 lakh each from the party fund as relief.

“If all is well and there is nothing wrong with the CAA, then what has compelled the BJP and its senior leaders to hit the streets. Its leaders are criss-crossing the country and addressing press conferences and organising public meetings to convince the people about the amended citizenship law. They have failed to convince the people so they are now trying to confuse them,” Yadav said.

The SP chief said the BJP leadership had drafted UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for this job and he would address a series of rallies in support of the CAA in UP and several other states. He said Yogi Adityanath addressed a rally in Gwalior district of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday.

After meeting the families, Yadav demanded a judicial probe into the violence on December 20 by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court.

He said police were responsible for the violence against the peaceful protesters and they could not conduct an inquiry against themselves.

Arguing against the CAA, Yadav said, “The government has already provided Aadhaar cards to the people then where is the need for National Population Register and National Register of Citizens?”

He said the CAA was highly disruptive and divisive in nature and would inflict huge damage to the social fabric of the country in the long run.

Yadav said the people were protesting against the CAA in all parts of the country and youths from universities and colleges had joined the protest in a big way.

Expressing grief over the death of the bus passengers in a road accident in Kannauj, Yadav said the government was responsible for the accident and should explain how permit for plying bus on long route was given against the existing rules and regulations.

He said the BJP government had also stopped work on construction of fire station at Kannauj and this led to delay in fire-tenders reaching the spot to douse the fire caused by the head-on collision between the bus and a truck.

He demanded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each for the kin of those killed in the accident.

Meanwhile, the SP will take out a cycle rally in the state capital on Sunday from Dubagga on Hardoi road to Janeshwar Mishra Park in Gomti Nagar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-meets-kin-of-those--killed-in-anti-caa-protest.html
99,12-1-20,UP govt finalising blueprint of police commissioner system,"The Uttar Pradesh government is preparing a blueprint for introducing police commissioner system in the state and it is expected to be cleared by the cabinet in the meeting scheduled for Tuesday. Once the cabinet gives its nod, the new system will be introduced in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) in the initial stage.

Sources said that despite strong opposition by the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) fraternity, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has held several rounds of discussions with the officers concerned to give final touches to the blueprint to place it before the cabinet on Tuesday.

Besides modalities, the chief minister also discussed the names of IPS officers who could be posted as the first police commissioners of Lucknow and Noida.

A police commissioner is of IG or higher rank.

According to a senior police officer, besides posting police commissioners in Lucknow and Noida, the government would also post two additional commissioners of police (ACPs).

While one ACP will look after law and order, the other one will manage administration. These officers will be of DIG rank.

The ASP-rank posts in the district would be converted into deputy commissioner of police (DCP) posts while DySP would be re-named as assistant commissioner of police (ACP).

The sources said that the officers also discussed the additional powers to be given to the police commissioner after the introduction of the police commissionerate system.

The police commissioner, besides having absolute powers regarding law and order is also likely to have all powers for issuance of arms as well as liquor shop licences. These powers at present vested in district magistrates.

It may be mentioned that the Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Yogi Adityanath is seriously considering introduction of police commissioner system in the state in a phased manner for effective control over crime by making the police officers directly accountable for law and order.

To implement the plan, the state government on Thursday did not post any officer in place of suspended Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna and Lucknow SSP Kalanidhi Naithani who was transferred.

“The government is discussing the commissioner system for Lucknow and Noida,” DGP OP Singh had confirmed on Friday.

The system has been introduced in around 71 cities across 15 states of the country.

In December 2018, former Governor Ram Naik had suggested the state government to seriously consider introducing the police commissioner system in the state for improvement in the law and order situation. He wanted the government to introduce the system on trial basis in Lucknow, Kanpur and Ghaziabad where the population exceeds the 20-lakh mark.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-finalising-blueprint-of--police-commissioner-system.html

104,12-1-20,"Babus, Bordellos, and Gaslit Nights","Calcutta Nights was written almost a hundred years ago and first published in Bengali as Raater Kolkata (by Hemendrakumar Roy) in 1923. Much of this book is set in a time which stretches back even further to the first two decades of the twentieth century. Calcutta was still the capital of British ruled India then — a bustling metropolis with a dark underbelly, where untold dangers lurked behind the glamour and shine, writes Rajat Chaudhuri in the introductory chapter of his book. An edited excerpt:

Calcutta. Second city of the British empire, India’s most important urban centre, Paris of the East, melting pot of all races, pride of Bengalis, cradle of the renaissance, city of palaces!

Day and night, multitudes pass through the streets-flowing like a stream. Alongside ancient palanquins from mythical king Mandhata’s times, bullock-carts and pedestrians, run ultramodern electric trams, buses and motorcars while aircrafts fly above, casting shadows on her expanse. Spectacles dangling on their noses, shod in fancy shoes and with fashionable hairstyles, the cane-wielding kapure-babus — the upper class gentlemen with social capital and recognition only on the outside; impeccably attired in western clothes over their swarthy forms; the great specimens of ingo-bongos or the anglophile Bengalis; donning curious hats and a variety of dresses the Parsis, Gujeratis, Marathis, Sikhs, Pathans, Kabulis, Nepalis, Bhutanese, Punjabis, Mongols, Japanese, Chinese and Marwaris among a variety of human specimens from the entire East; English, Scotch, Irish, French and Americans among aggressive specimens of western races, and alongside these, half-naked Oriyas, and completely naked groups of Naga mendicants … such a curious kedgeree of humanity is not to be found anywhere in the world. At one side colourful mansions reach out to the sky, and in their shadows lean mud walls of cottages plastered with dung cakes — a rare sight anywhere else. On one flank of the street, like wealth personified, are welldressed, nonchalant, vehicle-riders, blessed sons of Lakshmi — the Goddess of Wealth — ignorant to the sorrows and scarcities of the world, and on the other side, right there in the dust of the street, lying on blankets riddled with holes, worshippers of permanent destitution, hooded-eyed, skin-and-bones bands of poor beggars, gasping their last and waiting for death. And right in front of their drooping eyelids, beating huge drums — the dhaaks and dhols — and blowing trumpets, wafting flowery perfumes, their kilted scarves and drapes billowing, pass bands of the groom’s party of a marriage ceremony. Where else can one see such a crooked smile on the lips of destiny? Life and death live here together, like thorn and blossom on the same branch.

It was about Calcutta that acclaimed poet Satyendranath Dutta said:

Ei Kolikata-Kalikakhsetra, kahini ihar sobar sruto,

Bishnu chakra ghurechhe hethae, Mahesher padodhule e puto

Hindur kali achhen hethae, Musalmaner Moula Ali,

Chari koney sadhu pir charijon muskil asan cherag jali

Sakal dharma milechhe hethae samanyaer mantra-surey

Swagata sadhak-bhakta-brinda marater Baikunthapurey

Roughly translated it reads: ‘This Kolkata — Kalika’s ground, everyone has heard its story, Bishnu’s discus spun here — Mahesh’s feet made it holy. Here’s the abode of the Hindus’ Kali, and Maula Ali of the Musalman, Four pirs and sadhus at four corners, light the lamp of redemption, All religions have merged here, in a tune of hymn and harmony This earthly paradise welcomes, every worshipper and devotee.’

And truly Calcutta on first acquaintance looks like a city which is a pilgrimage for sadhus, a place for religious practice of devotees, and an abode of the sacred. Hindu temples of Kali, Tara, Mahadev, Sani, Jagaddhatri, Sitala, Buddhist viharas, Jain shrines of Pareshnath, Christian churches, mosques of Muslims are scattered all over — holding their heads up against the smoke swathed sky — a diversity of styles of different ideologies. At every step, a temple or the other with their crowds of devotees draws the attention of pedestrians. Scenes of religious rituals and routine prayers being offered morning and evening abound, amidst the blowing of conches, the clamour of visitors. By observing the polished floors, the bright gold ornaments of the deities, and the softness and signs of indulgence in the bearings of temple attendants, it does not take time to realise that most of the Hindu gods and goddesses are well-off.

But without a sharp eye, no one would be able to decipher the extent of wrongs, the extent of vileness and brutality concealed beneath this outward shield of religiosity. Despite Chitteswari of Chitpur at one end and Kalikadebi of Kalighat at the other keeping watch on the domain of Calcutta, every day Satan and his sinful followers enter the city in hordes, pulling wool over their divine eyes.

Poet Satyendranath says:

Ei Kolikata byagrhobahini chhilo he ekoda bagher basa

Bagher moton manush jahara tahaderi chhilo jawa o asha!

(‘This Kolkata on a tiger rides, ‘twas once a tiger’s den Those men who were tiger-like, would come and go often!’)

Just as in those times there were people who were like tigers, this day too there is no dearth of tigers in human garb in Calcutta. Rather the legions of these tiger-people have grown. But they are more tiger-like in their cruelty and beastliness rather than in vigour and energy. These tigers and tigresses are scattered all across the city — through the day they move about in groups amongst us. Always alert and waiting for prey, like an invisible pestilence. We don’t know them, but they have every bit of information about us at their fingertips. When at night the curtain of deepest darkness descends on the heart of Calcutta, these tigers and tigresses employing trickery, attack us unawares. Tigers of the wild crave human flesh, but these human tigers want the substance of our souls. And once someone’s soul comes into their clutches, he cannot be saved. Easy-going parents from villages, you send your naive children to Calcutta to become worthy humans. But often, under the influence of these tigers and tigresses, their humanity is drained and they return home transformed into a beast or a ghost.

No one should be fooled by the outward sheen, the glamorous beauty, the light and laughter, the mock-religiosity, the crowds at temples, churches and mosques of Calcutta. How much darkness has congealed at the lamp’s base — today we will reveal some of those secret scenes. We spend our lives cradled by this Calcutta; our lives, our deaths, our marriages are in sync with the rhythms of this Calcutta, our hearts are full with pride and we feel honoured being residents of Calcutta. Yet how many among us have seen the true face of Calcutta? How many of us dare to roam about in the silence of the deepest night amongst Calcutta’s scary and impassable forest of palaces? How many are interested to know about the romances unfolding, the fascinating incidents, the tragedies being played out around us each day? What is the value of a report in the morning newspaper? Braving great dangers, time and again avoiding the knives of hoodlums, in the spirit of adventure, I alone, like a creature of darkness, just a short and stout stick on my person, have regularly roamed the streets of Calcutta from evening till the end of night. Without bothering about moral corruption, I have entered evil and forbidden places with no hesitation. My long experience cannot fit into these pages. Here I will provide some glimpses, some hints. If readers enjoy, then in future I will try to describe different facets of Calcutta in greater detail.

105,12-1-20,‘Content is hero today’,"SHALINI SAKSENA reports the changing face of cinema

In the last 10 to 15 years things in Indian cinema have changed drastically. Back to those years only the superstar who were making a big on the box office whether it was Shah Rukh, Salman, Aamir or Akshay. It all changed from Vicky Donor or from Khosla ka Ghosla.

“It was the first time that small budgets film did wonders. It was not about having big stars in the movie but it was about having good content. The industry and audiences made space for people other than the favourite superstars,” Nitin Arora, MD, Katalyst Entertainment says.

He tells you that new boys have taken over and it is no more about stars now. “It is difficult to say whether it was Ayushmann, Rajkumar Rao, Kartik Aryan or even Nawazuddin Siddiqui who are a guarantee for box office opening. Content is the hero today. You see Nawazuddin a totally unconventional hero doing so well. Just because of the scripts he is choosing. The kind of cinema he have opted is amazing,” Arora says and tells you that people are no more interested in run of the mill films, where actor and actress dance around trees.

“Whether it was Stree, Andhadun, Article 15 or Gangs of Wasseypur, it was all content-based. Though Wasseypur... was violent people could connect to it because lot of us know that these kind of things happen in some parts of our country,” Arora shares.

Another change that has taken the cinema by storm according to Arora is the kind of comic films that that being made. “People also love comedy. A film like Badhai Ho was high on content and was fun as well. There are lot of households where people could relate with it and for those who didn’t the subject made them love the film,” Arora says.

An important aspect of the changing face of cinema needs to be attributed to how people today, want to see new world, which is a big factor.

“Audience in the past have seen Mumbai from the days of Bachchan sahab. Now, they want to see another world. Look at Bala. A film in the back drop of a small town, in UP, a State that is now being portrayed in a different way and people are liking it.

“The audience of today is intelligent. They are looking for movies that are relatable than see films that are visually beautiful,” Arora says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---content-is-hero-today---.html

Director Adeeb Rais’s recently released short film Baatein is garnering rave reviews and a lot of love from short film lovers across the country. Starring Supriya Pilgoankar, Shivani Raghuvanshi, Sankalp Joshi and Adeeb Rais himself, the film touches issues with parenting and communication that youngsters may face in their everyday lives.

Adeeb made his debut as an actor with MX Player Original web series — Yeh Crazy Dil opposite Zoa Morani. In Baatein, Adeeb plays a documentary filmmaker who is passionate about telling real stories and documenting interesting experiences of people from slum areas, red light areas and prisons. Interestingly in real life too, Adeeb’s forte lies in relatable slice of life stories.

Adeeb says: “Baatein has been a wonderful and truly satisfying journey. After the overwhelming response I received for my previous short Aunty ji starring Shabana Azmi and Anmol, I was keen on pushing myself to take the mantle of telling meaningful stories that not just entertain but also impact society positively further.”

Aditya roy is the new action hero

While Aditya Roy Kapur’s first look and the poster of Malang continues to set the internet on fire, The actor’s sizzling chemistry with co-star Disha Patni was already the talk of the town; amid that buzz, the former emerges as the new action hero of the Indian film industry with the release of the trailer of the romance-thriller.

The newly launched trailer introduces Aditya as a compulsive killer on a murder spree. What arrests the attention of the viewers, is the menacing shades of the actor’s character and the wild romance between him and Disha Patni. One of the most noteworthy aspects of the trailer is the two looks that Kapur sports in the forthcoming film. Malang will see Aditya in a lean look and a beefed-up look. From the trailer, it becomes clear that in one phase of the movie the actor is captured as funloving and easygoing and in the other phase, he undergoes a metamorphosis that brings with it elements of rage and revenge.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/weeklynatter-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/weeklynatter.html
107,12-1-20,Why privileged citizens of neighbouring nations must also get India’s succor,"The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a humanistic approach by the Government of India to provide relief to the persecuted persons from the neighbouring Islamic nations. The relief must not be wasted

It has been a strange practice that for almost anything related to India, more specifically to Hindus, is construed as wrong by the American mainstream media. All kinds of accusations against India are freely heaped. A large section of the Indian media and the mainstream world media go by the same tradition. Muslims and Europeans are somewhat perturbed due to loss of large empire and freeload ownership. But they need to wake up.

British truncated India at the behest of the Muslim leadership and then Hindus were driven out from two Islamic theocracies, carved out after the partition and further bifurcation of Pakistan. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, at the least, assures the persecuted persons in these two neighbouring nations of safe habitat in India. The New York Times’ main story on December 10, 2019 (India’s Parliament Takes Step Toward Blocking Naturalization for Muslims) by Jefferey Gettleman and Suhasini Raj is another example of peddling of concocted narratives, laced with acrimony towards India and Hindus.

The fact of the matter is that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has got nothing to do with any existing citizens of India: Hindus, Muslims, Christians or others. The Act has given some relief in matter of granting asylum in India to the most repressed brutalised section — minorities of three neighbouring Islamic nations. It has not touched rights of any Muslims anywhere in India. Even after the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, any Muslim can anytime apply for citizenship in regular course, as before.

India is trying to deter illegal infiltration. The superpower USA has three times land mass of India, but only one-fourth population and the number of illegal persons estimated at just 11 millions, yet the US enforces stringent regulation to cope with illegal immigrants. While, India, which is fighting against the high unemployment rate and other myriad problems, has about 60 million to 90 million illegal immigrants. Despite that India has kept its gates open for the refugees.

As a normal rule, there is an aversion to religious minorities in Islamic theocracies, and India’s neighbouring Islamic nations are no exception to it. However, depending on regimes there, the persecution intensity differs. Here this Act in India can stem the process of the ethnic cleansing of minorities in the neighbourhood. The hellish brutalisation gives testimony to the fact that 49 million Hindus vanished from Bangladesh since 1947. The condition of Hindus and Sikhs is more precarious in Pakistan. The most recent proof of the persecution of the minority communities in Pakistan was the bid of a mob to lay siege to Nankana Sahib Gurudwara in protest against police action against those accused of forcing a Sikh girl to convert to Islam.

Hindus are the ancestral inhabitants of the soil before Islam arrived in the region. Therefore Hindus connect to India and neighbouring countries. This is why they don’t want to leave their homes in the Islamic states as long as possible. However, the spate in cases of abduction of their women, forced conversion, and ethnic cleansing leave them no option but to seek refuge in the secular India. As they live as refugees, they are unable to avail any relief available to the citizens of India. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a move to address that concern. However, the mainstream American media consider these inhuman treatment to minorities “Not fit to print”.

In 1947, the population of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan was 20 per cent of the total, and that of Hindus, Buddhists and Christians in Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) was 29 per cent, which now standa at 2 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. The population of Muslims and Hindus in India in 1947 was about 7 per cent and 88 per cent respectively, which now stands at 15 per cent and 78 per cent. Therefore, there is whopping100 per cent percentile growth of Muslims in India. Yet New York Times alleges that Muslims are second-class citizens in India.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is giving citizenship to the persecuted religious minority refugees from three Islamic nations around India. Because Pakistan and Bangladesh made mockery of the Nehru-Liaqat pact of 1950 to protect the minorities, I think the Act was the only way left to heal the wound of the disenfranchised people.

Muslims in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan are the favoured citizens there. They are not asylum seekers. They are not the victims of Islamic expansionism. This Act is for the relief of persecuted victims, Hindus and other minorities of those nations. Why Muslims in India have to object it?

108,12-1-20,"Armed forces owe allegiance to Constitution, says Army Chief","With former Army Chief General Bipin Rawat being criticised for giving political statements, his successor General Manoj Naravane sought to put the records straight on Saturday saying the armed forces owe allegiance to the Constitution and its preamble. His comments came on the backdrop of growing perception of politicisation of the armed forces over the last few years.

Addressing his maiden news conference after assuming charge earlier this month, Naravane said the conduct of the 1.3 million-strong Army is guided by its ""allegiance"" to the Constitution and its core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.

Elaborating upon his focus as the chief, Naravane said it will be 'ABC' - ""allegiance, belief and consolidation,"" noting that protecting the core values of the Constitution will remain the driving force of his personnel.

""We swear allegiance to the Constitution of India. Be it officers or jawans, we have taken oath to protect the Constitution and that is what should guide us in all time and all our actions,"" the Army Chief said.

""What it translates into is also the core values which are enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution which are justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. That is what we are fighting for,"" he said.

The Army is deployed on the border safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity, ""it is to secure for our people these core values. And, I think, that is what we and I would like to say that we need to keep in mind,"" he added.

The present Army Chief's observations come at a time when former chief Rawat was criticised for wading into political issues and not remaining neutral.

Last month, he triggered a row publicly criticising people leading protests over the new citizenship law, saying leadership is not about guiding masses to carry out arson and violence across the country.

He was slammed by opposition parties as well as veterans who stressed that the armed forces must follow the decades-old principle of serving the country and not any political force.

Meanwhile, Naravane also said his other focus areas would be 'ITPQ'which he explained as Integration, Training Personnel and Quality. He said integration of purposes within the Army and with the two other forces would be a key area for him.

In this regard, Naravane said the creation of Chief of Defence Staff(CDS) to achieve integration to fight a modern war is 'game changer"" adding the Army will make sure that this is a success.

IAF chief RKS Bhadauria also backed the CDS and said in Chennai on Saturday the forces have started taking steps to build a new joint infrastructure & bring jointness. He also said the idea is to synergise and bring the cost down, and deliver bigger punch with the resources we have.

Meanwhile, the Army Chief said the focus of training will be on preparing the Army for future wars which he said will be network-centric and complex.

He said the personnel were the ""greatest strength"" in the Army, adding ""quality and not quantity will be the mantra, be it the selection of personnel or equipment.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/armed-forces-owe-allegiance-to-constitution--says-army-chief.html
109,12-1-20,LCA Tejas lands on INS Vikramaditya,"In a major breakthrough, the naval variant of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA)-Mk1 Tejas under development successfully landed for the first time onboard aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya on Saturday.

""After completing extensive trials on the Shore Based Test Facility (SBTF), Naval version of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) did a successful arrested landing onboard INS Vikramaditya at 10:02 hrs today,"" the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said in a statement. Commodore Jaideep Maolankar did the maiden landing, it added.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, in a tweet, said the successful landing of the aircraft on INS Vikramaditya is a ""great event"" in the history of Indian fighter aircraft development programme.

With this feat, the indigenously developed niche technologies specific to deck based fighter operations have been proven, which will now pave the way to develop and manufacture the twin engine deck based fighter for the Indian Navy, the Navy said.

The Naval LCA recently successfully completed take off and landing trials on the SBTF in Goa.

The contributions of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) include the landing gear, arrestor hook and support staff controlling at SBTF Goa along with Indian Navy, said R Madhavan, Chairman and Managing Director of HAL.

Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh had stated in December that the DRDO has offered to develop a new twin engine deck based fighter for the Navy based on the experience of the Naval LCA and it should be ready by 2026. The Navy is in the process of finalising the Quality Requirement for the new twin engine deck fighter.

The Naval LCA-Mk1 made its maiden flight in April 2012 and two prototypes have been flying as part of the development.

The SBTF, which replicates the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, was built to train naval pilots in the complex manoeuvres of landing on the short flight deck of an aircraft carrier after before they move on to the actual carrier.

Naval LCA is designed with stronger landing gears to absorb forces exerted by the ski jump ramp during take-off, to be airborne within 200m and land within 100m as against 1000m required for normal runways.

The Navy currently operates Russian Mig-29K fighters from INS Vikramaditya which will also fly from the first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant once it enters service.

110,12-1-20,ISI revives Afzal Guru Squad for attack on Indian forces,"Amid tight security footprint along the Line of Control (LoC) and in the hinterland in J&K and improving situation on the ground, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has shifted terror tactics and revived the Afzal Guru Squad in their bid to execute attacks against the Forces.

As part of the new strategy, ISI's key terror affiliate Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has constituted assault teams of the Afzal Guru Squad which included both Pakistani (foreign) terrorists and local Kashmiri militants in order to achieve an improved ""success"" against the forces.

The Squad had last hit forces at the Indian army camp at Sunjuwan where the terrorists had killed six soldiers even as three terrorists and a civilian lost their lives and 20 others (14 soldiers) were injured on February 10, 2018.

After the Sunjuwan attack, the security forces eliminated all the members of the Squad including mastermind of the Sunjuwan attack Mufti Waqas. The attack coincided with the death anniversary of Afzal Guru's hanging for the 2001 Parliament terror attack.

The reorganisation of the terrorist ranks comes as the security situation on the ground has begun improving months after the erstwhile State of J&K was reconstituted into two Union Territories-J&K and Ladakh and Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to the State was nullified, officials said.

They said Shia Muslims in Kargil and Budgam protested against the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike by the US in Baghdad last week.

The Kashmir Valley is currently dominated by Wahabism and Salafism and the Shias holding protest march especially in Budgam indicates other sects are now raising their voice.

The protests by Shias could also signal a desire amongst a section of the community to return to their roots that was essentially Sufi Islam, a senior security official said.

The official said markets in Srinagar are now open even after 6.30 PM which is also indicative of the people's realization of the changed security environment in the Valley.

""Besides the elimination of the terrorist leadership, an improved security situation on the ground can wean away the local youth from joining the ranks of the jehadis. The foreign terrorists also mistrusted the local militants. To offset this, the ISI is seeking to put in place a matrix hit groups under the Afzal Guru Squad to stay relevant. The Forces, however, will have to continuously remain vigilant to further bolster the improvement in the security situation,"" another official said.

The JeM has also released a hit-list which includes an SSP, a doctor with a paramilitary, one professor and a journalist.

The JeM has confirmed that the three terrorists killed by the security forces this month during their infiltration bid belonged to the revived Afzal Guru Squad.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/isi-revives-afzal-guru-squad-for-attack-on-indian-forces.html
111,12-1-20,Cong wants probe by high-powered panel,"The Congress too on Saturday demanded the withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act besides an inquiry by a high-powered commission into the incidents connected with the anti-CAA protests, and the stoppage of the ongoing process of National Population Register (NPR).

Addressing the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi termed the CAA a ""discriminatory and divisive"" law whose ""sinister"" purpose was to divide people on religious lines. She also said that the NPR in form and content was ""disguised NRC"".

Sonia said thousands of young men and women, especially students have realized the ""grave harm"" that implementation of the new Citizenship law will cause. They have taken to the streets braving the cold as well as police brutalities, Sonia Gandhi said.

The grand old party also passed a resolution stating the BJP-led NDA Government has used brute State power to suppress voice of students and youth and the Prime Minister and ruling party have betrayed the trust of the youth.

The CWC resolution demanded that CAA should be withdrawn and process of NPR be stopped forthwith as situation in some states is alarming and turning them into police states, notably Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi.

Apart from Sonia, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, top party leaders P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, AK Antony, KC Venugopal, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyotiraditya Scindia were among those present at the meeting but Rahul Gandhi was conspicuous by his absence being his third miss to a crucial party meeting after he relinquished the party chief post taken over by her mother Sonia.

As the students' protest gains momentum, Sonia said it is clear that the Government is digging in its heels. ""Not a day passes without the Home Minister and on some days the Prime Minister himself making provocative statements,"" the Congress president said.

""The situation in some states is alarming, turning

the states into police states, notably in Uttar Pradesh and the Union Territory of Delhi,"" she said.

Coming down hard on the National Population Register (NPR), Sonia told Congress top brass not to be under any illusion that it was a ""benign exercise"". ""In form and content, NPR 2020 is a disguised NRC,"" she said.

She also hit out at the government over the state of the economy and the situation in J&K.

""It is a matter of anguish and concern that the people in J&K continue to be denied their fundamental rights while the Government makes farcical claims of normalcy and arranges guided tours of diplomats,"" she said.

The CWC also deliberated upon the social, economic and international challenges confronting the country. Almost every institution in the country - Delhi University, JNU, Jamia Millia University , Banaras Hindu University, Allahabad University, AMU, and many others have seen massive protests, it noted.

It also expressed deep concerns over the recent

112,12-1-20,Evolving a dynamic education system,"The Dynamics of Indian Education

Author : Professor JS Rajput,

Publisher : Yash Publishers, Rs 995

In his book, The Dynamics of Indian Education, the author has explored the vast canvas of critical concerns that form the basis of educational change and transformation, writes Sudhir Singh

India is awaiting a new national education policy (NEP); the last one was prepared in 1992. The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of former Cabinet secretary TSR Subramanian in October 2015 to prepare the draft of NEP. This Committee submitted its report in April 2016. This five member Committee had four retired bureaucrat and only one academic member; the author of the present book under review, Professor JS Rajput. Subsequently, MHRD appointed a more-broad-based Committee under the Chairmanship of eminent scientist Dr K Kasturirangan. Its report, submitted in May 2019, was made available to public domain on the same day, and MHRD invited public comments on this draft as well. It has received numerous inputs from every section of the society. Hopefully, these would help the government to take a comprehensive view of the changes required in education policy.

The last four-five years have seen education issues being seriously discussed and deliberated upon at every stage and level throughout the country. During this period, the writings of Professor JS Rajput in print media, in English and Hindi as also his lectures and books have contributed in enhancing the relevance of such interactions and their output. The Book ‘The Dynamics of Indian Education’, released on August 1, 2019 by the Vice President of India, M. Venkaiah Naidu, is one amongst these.

Every family wishes to know more about education, good education, and quality education. The demand now is no more only for ‘education and school’, but for “good quality education; imbued with skill acquisition; in a good School”. Just some sixty years ago, people were reluctant even to send their children to schools, and had to be particularly persuaded to send girls to schools. The attitudinal transformation itself is a great achievement. India needs to evolve a visionary, futuristic and pragmatic education policy that could respond to the national requirements and aspirations of the young and aged in a fast-changing globalised world. These are the critical times for the country to have a fresh look on its education system and revamp it on modern lines. Our education systems must remain deeply rooted to culture, and simultaneously committed to new knowledge.

A cursory perusal of the topics contained in the book clearly indicate that the author — a veteran educationist — has dexterously explored the vast canvas of critical concerns that form the basis of educational change and transformation. These require regular dynamic inputs based upon experiences gained and the future vision to remain relevant. Education systems just cannot afford stagnation at any stage over even a short period. The content of this book clearly appreciates our Post-Independence achievements in education. We have near total enrollment in schools, in spite of over-threefold increase in the population!

The book also brings forth how the ancient Indian tradition of knowledge acquisition, and dissemination received widespread acclaim across the seven-seas; we were the Vishwa-Guru! We must aim to rise to that pedestal again. Ancient India contributed not only in philosophy and spirituality, it contributed in sciences, mathematics, Astronomy and every other relevant area. The objective was “welfare of one and all — Sarva Bhut Hite Ratah”. The distinguishing features of Indian tradition of knowledge generation, creation, dissemination and utilisation emerge very clearly in this book.

It pleads for restoration of respectful bonds amongst the State and intellectuals, and particularly to give school teachers their due. The author articulates his anguish and pain in the context of deterioration in quality of education, loss of the credibility of teacher education institutions, and reports on the increase of unethical instances in schools and universities. However, it also indicates how the system could be enthused with new inspiration and dynamism through a dynamic reform process.

The author firmly believes that social cohesion and religious amity are two major responsibilities before the education system. He is known to have initiated a movement to let every child be familiarised with the basics of all the religions. Children should know the commonalities and learn to respect differences wherever these exist. No rituals and dogmas are to be taken up in schools. That shall remain family responsibility. India is globally respected for its valued tradition of acceptance of diversity and presents a rare example of various religions co-existing together for ages!

It also emerges from this book that teacher preparation must be based upon the educational philosophies of Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, and several other Indian luminaries. It is now globally recognised that every country should develop its own education system, that borrowed and transplanted systems only bring disaster and disconnect with culture, history and heritage. So finally education must be ‘rooted to culture and committed to progress’!

The neglect of right curricular approach to India’s history, heritage and culture has resulted in an unprecedented in an all round decline in values, morals and ethics. The moral crises often makes lakhs of children suffer for no fault of theirs. Leakage of board examination papers causes immeasurable misery and pain to children and families. If the system fails to prevent sale of teacher training degrees, it would be impossible to prevent quality deterioration through other means and measures. The need for creating ‘educational leadership’ at each stage hardly needs overemphasis in a system that has to respond to innumerable diverse situations. It clearly emerges that India must pay more attention to its education system, particularly to public school education system, giving due priority to teacher preparation. It would; ipso facto; enhance the quality of higher education, research and also innovations and entrepreneurship.

This book contains 97 chapter titles, spread over 314 well-printed pages. One wonders why the contents of this book were not arranged in around a dozen chapters, dealing the major issues in one place. Even in the present format, some eight to ten sections could have been created at the editing stage. This book is a significant addition to the contemporary discourse on practically every aspect of education and education system. It is full of practical experience, epistemological comprehension as also of the finer philosophical inputs wherever necessary. It could be a treasured handbook for every section; from professors of education to school teachers and concerned parents. Professor Rajput is known for his regular writings in Hindi and English, and also for lectures and talks. This book is one more instance of his commitment to educational change and transformation.

113,12-1-20,The Nest is strongly perched,"The Cuckoo’s Nest

Author : A. Sethumadhavan (Sethu),

Publisher : Niyogi Books, Rs 345

The first English novel by the noted Malayali writer A Sethumadhavan, popularly known as Sethu, is a landmark by its superb craft and theme, says K. KUNHIKRISHNAN

Tiny birds of different colours and sizes would flock in the nest, far above the ground, atop a tree, in the midst of woods, which could withstand rains and winds; birds per force fleeing from the prying eyes of hunters would reach the Nest. They would flip and chirp and flap their frail and weak wings, unsure of flying back. One had to “vitalise these little birds by strengthening their wings and avoid the hunters — men”.

The nest would have all kinds of birds — good and bad, heroes and villains, shapes and shades of different feathers. They would be nurtured with compassion and spirit of co- existence. In time, they would fly away. This inspiring and lofty idealism was what made Madam Agatha, a nun who left the monastery, and hostel warden to start and run The Cuckoo’s Nest, the first English novel, by Sethu (A Sethumadhavan), one of the best among contemporary Malayalam fiction writers. He is equally at ease and adept and evocative in English as evident from this novel.

The novelist has always been a strong promoter of feminism, be it his stories or novels, and always empathised to the extent of clearly taking sides. So is it in The Cuckoo’s Nest, where the young and desolate inmates are empowered to live gloriously, “like a mother bidding goodbye to her daughter, a mother bird watching her tiny ones flying away , flapping and spreading their wings…. Never to return”. Madam Agatha had trained her inmates to “dream the mountain and not the valley”.

The message of optimism is commendable as narrated in an excellent and convincing manner for emulation. The reader is moved by the manner in which total darkness and gloom in the lives of nearly a dozen inmates of the Nest was overcome into bright sunshine by empowering the girls through a model charitable institution, run entirely on donations from well-wishers, known and unknown.

Madam Agatha stands out as a colossal and influential character in the novel and she is able to weather the storm and rains and occasional cyclones holding onto her Nest firmly with pragmatic and high ideals mustering support from well-meaning quarters and close friends and she is the profile of intent and strong will, having walked out of the monastery (when even survival itself is not easy).

There is another character, Kadambari, who has come from Devagiri , a small town in Tamil Nadu, where she was an adopted daughter, but had to leave home after a gruelling experience. Kadambari has another mother in Madam Agatha and she is finally given to shoulder the responsibilities of the Nest. Other characters in the novel are profiled to represent the oppressive circumstances in which young females are made to suffer agonies. In portraying them, the novelist has put his narrative excellence into perfection with arresting readability, as is his wont.

The profiling also attains universality and pan-Indian appeal transcending geographical and psychological barriers. Each character, be it, Col. Annie Fernandez, the crippled army doctor, Sarala, Secretary of Nest, Karuppayya, security guard, who are not inmates per se but closely associated, is etched indelibly and stands out. Residents of Nest, Lisie, Gouri, Sabeena, Ranjini, Apoorva, Kamakshi-Kamalakshi (twins), Didi, Parveen Singh, Seetha etc are all from different backgrounds and faiths (But Nest is strictly secular in every sense) and each one’s tale of woes is touching.

Except in the case of Parveen Singh, who meets with a tragic death due to her intense love for Salim, all others are enabled in every sense to undergo life in better circumstances. Two instances where the lovers (Sabeena and Seetha) reunite with their love through social media are motivating and revealing. Each character has a history of pathos and untold miseries and they reveal the current social fabric, which is heavily skewed against the downtrodden women. The tale of woes of each inmate of the Nest has been dexterously condensed demonstrating the mastery of the novelist in his art of storytelling. The weaving around of the plot and characters almost in lyrical style in the novel marks Sethu’s dexterity at its best.

“Life is nothing but an open-ended story. Won’t it be better to leave some doubts as they are and make the reader ponder on them later? After all, aren’t such clueless riddles the very element that makes life interesting?” asks Didi, the wheel chair-bound optimist Jewish inmate of the Nest, with a Third Eye to Apoorva, who is in the Nest due to the quarrel of her Bengali father and Tamilian mother. The novelist reflects: “the writer….. naturally expected his readers to be reasonably intelligent so that they would be able to find out a solution of their own”.

At the end Madam Agatha asks: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, have I failed?” Riposte is that the story is a brilliant literary work bringing out the divine elements of conveying improvement over societal values. Going by any literary values, The Cuckoo’s Nest is a profound work, placing the novelist in the pinnacle of his glorious career.

114,12-1-20,Astroturf : Better to be practical than perfect,"There was self-created disorder at the ‘Primal source’, earlier in a perfect equilibrated state, which when gravitated, differentiated energies got excited. Immediately thereafter began harmonisation of those energies, which following a course of progressive evolution, culminated in the manifestation of plural world with all its enormity and diversity. As the cause permeates the effect, the imprints of both order and disorder find presence in our cognitive instrument. Given a trigger either of the two or both could come into play, which primarily depends on how individual mind is inherently framed. It is pertinent to note here that human beings are born unique, each manifesting varying mindset and desire trends, coming as they may as Karmic carryover from the past. Evidently, it varies from person-to-person depending on what short of experiences one would have undergone in the past. So, we are all born with a preconditioned mind, which serves as defining principle of individual mind. The way it is framed is how one acts, reacts, or responds.

In many cases, it has been observed that the ‘sense of order’ is overplayed. Such characters are often found to have a perfectionist attitude. They wish to be perfect in all their endeavour, precisely to a point, of course, on their self-defined terms, which may or may not be in sync with ground realities. More often than not, they remain stuck to their self-delusional perceptions, and not open to look beyond for a reality check. Until pushed to the wall, they will keep pursuing their line of thinking. By the time they realise, the damage is done. They wish to go about in life on their own exclusive terms. They can’t digest anything happening to the contrary. They evaluate others by his own measures, not realising that everybody is born unique. That often makes it difficult to relate to others on even terms. In search of perfection, they go overboard, rejecting options available one after other. In the process, they fail to make timely initiative, and when they are left in the run of life, they resign to fate. Else, they hunt out those who may promise extra-terrestrial intervention through some belief driven puja.

Here is the case of a person who wished his wife to be perfect. His continued sermons on what to do or what not pushed her off so much that she finally broke off the marriage. Later, when he started looking for a prospective partner, none would fit into his long check list, so thirty years now but with no result. Speculating salary hike in future as was the trend in a growing economy, he opted for housing property beyond his means, ignoring the advice and counsel of elders. As the economy took a down slide, his career growth trajectory got adversely affected. He then realised that he could no more service debt. Even in terms of works, he may not accept an offer till all his preconditions are met. As the economy took a downturn, he lost his job, and thereafter he has been without job for long.

Let us now look at his astrological pointers. Gemini Lagna with mind-signifying Moon there, brings in the tendency to live on one’s own exclusive terms. He may go by his self-defined beliefs and perceptions. So long as you sing his tune, you remain the best friend. The moment you offer a contrarian view, he may immediately get put off. Also, he has a vacillating mind.

Jupiter in the 5th house brings in a perfectionist streak. Moon favourably placed to Neptune brings in a very fine taste. Saturn beautifully aligned to Uranus makes him serious and thorough in work, with an eye on even finer details. He can’t agree to anything until it fully satisfies his taste.

But then Moon is opposite Venus. If that would not be enough, the Sun too is locked in adverse formation to Venus. All put together makes him too much emotionally touchy and sensitive. He may get over exercised even on trivial issues not to his taste, which he may overstretch beyond due and keep mulling over them for long. In the process, often his priority preferences get compromised. Added to that is 9th lord Saturn placed adverse to mischievous Neptune and Mars, which makes him self-deluding and moody. Also, it makes him habitually suspicious. Once he gets vexed, he may lose his sense of reasons and order. On top of that is a cluster of 5 planets, which makes him a very complex character. And the result is there to see.

115,12-1-20,Talktime : ‘I don’t have any complaints’,"Vinay Pathak | Known for films like Bheja Fry, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi and Khosla Ka Ghosla, Pathak speaks with Musba Hashmi about how acting happened and his debut project, among other things

What is Chhappad Phaad Ke about that released on Hotstar Specials?

It is a film about a middle class family and as the name suggests they come across a lot of money which they have always desired but now they don’t know what to do with it. I play Sharad Gupchup. The film talks about the changes in the relationships in the family. It touches upon the basic fabric of the life in middle class families.

Were there any apprehensions before taking up the role?

Not at all. When I heard the story for the first time I knew that I was taking up the project. I liked the concept and the story line. In fact the director Sameer Hemant Joshi and I sat along with the writer and added a lot of interesting elements in the story. It was fun to be a part of the project.

How did acting happen to you?

Acting fascinated me since my childhood but never thought of taking it up as a profession. I grew up in a boarding school in Ranchi and actively participated in stage plays back then. Initially, I wanted to be a teacher. I had some great teachers in my life and I wanted to follow their footsteps. Then, I went to New York to pursue further studies. There, I saw a play by Peter Shaffer — Equus and it changed my life and saw it four-five times. It was then that I realised that acting is what I am born for. I got myself registered in a drama school and did theatre in New York for four years before I shifted to Mumbai.

You debuted with Fire (1998). How did you come on board for the project?

I was in Delhi attending a film festival. I came across my friend from New York Ranjit Chaudhary who had just finished the shooting for Mira Nayyar’s Kamasutra. He told me that he is staying back in the country and prepping for Deepa Mehta’s next, Fire. He asked me if I would be interested. I went on for the auditions and got selected.

Do you have a checklist?

First, the script should be good. Second, the story should be enthralling. I believe all the characters in a well-written script are etched in the memory. This has been the template for me all this while. And so far it has worked for me.

Dasvidaniya was a hit. Yet films like Bheja Fry and Khosla Ka Ghosla have become synonymous to your name. Does this bother you?

No, not at all. Dasvidaniya was a film that I produced also. It was made similar to Bheja Fry only. Bheja Fry made me a successful and bankable actor and I was able to raise money. I am thankful to all the films that I was a part of. I was at the right place and the right time.

Is it a concern that you have an image that you can play comic roles flawlessly?

I never take a project because there is comedy in it. There has to be a good story. Comedy and seriousness are all emotions. I haven’t take these roles deliberately but they happened with me. Moreover, if you see Bheja Fry, it is not a deliberate humorous character. Instead he is a serious person who is concerned about his work. There is a sense of sincerity in the character. So, most of the characters that I have played have had mixed emotions.

Is there a genre you’d like to explore?

Looking for a genre is the wrong approach. The focus should be only on a good script. That’s all.

How has your journey been thus far?

It was an extremely happy one. Ups and downs are a part and parcel of life. But I have no complaints and no regrets at all. I have been extremely fortunate to have been a part of the industry.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-don---t-have-any-complaints----2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-don---t-have-any-complaints---.html
116,12-1-20,Little ones 70mm,"The 3rd edition of International Kids Film Festival was held in the Capital recently hosted by schools in 40-plus countries targeting over 2 million students and their families.SHALINI SAKSENA brings you a report

If one thought that film fetivals were only for those who were looking at serious cinema, they could not have been more off the mark. The International Kids Film Festival (IKFF) in its 3rd edition is a unique international film festival hosted by schools across the globe.

This year, India, the UAE, England, France, Mexico, South Africa and Saudi Arabia were some of the countries that were part of the festival. The aim of this festival is to provide an opportunity for students to watch some of the best of international children’s films. The reason for this festival was from two perspectives.

“The first, literacy leads to read and writer. But more content is being created and consumed in an audio-visual manner. The kids are not going to read and write as much as we did. For me to expose children to good content is basics to education. Film festival is an opportunity for kids to watch some fanstastic films. We had films from 35 countries in 25 languages. Around 100 films were shortlisted from 800,” Syed Sultan Ahmed, MD & Chief Learner@LXL Ideas, says

The other aspect, he tells you, was to teach the children about the world. One of the biggest change has been world migration. How do we prepare childeren to this? “We have to expose them to world issues, cultures and languages,” Ahemd tells you.

“Sadly, the kind of films that children are watching is commerical content. Good children’s films are available at film festival. Here, we are taking the festival to the children — to 9,000 schools out of which 7,500 are Government schools in Karnataka, Telangana, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. The whole idea is to show them good cinema,” Ahmed says.

The two-month global event included film screenings, filmmaking master classes and be part of world’s largest students filmmaking competition making it is learning process as well.

Some of the films that were screened at the festival were Maestro, Cup of Tea, 3 Feet, A Day in the Park, Dog Gone and Athleticus Gym Keeper. The films were divided on the basis of age: two-five year categoty, six-eight category, nine-11 category, 12-14 categoty and 15-17.

“Traditionally literacy meant our ability to read and write as all knowledge was in books, in today’s world of screens, literacy has a new definition — read, write and create. The big challenge today is that children across the world are exposed to very low standards of films and content. The best films that are made for children are not easily accessible to them. There is a big need to expose our children to good films, real world issues, cultures and stories,” Ahmed says who has introduced the concept of film pedagogy by creating school cinema and this film festival.

He opines that this film festival is a great opportunity for children to watch the best of world cinema right in their schools, learn the art of film-making and make films to participate in the world’s largest student film-making competition. The School Cinema App gives students and their families an opportunity to watch world cinema at their homes.

“This platform is a great example of the change that needs to be made in our education system. It is exciting, relevant, scalable and affordable — all the qualities that a good learning programme should have,” Ahmed says.

He tells you that while these filmswere about different issues and topics, one common theme was respect: Respect for the self, respect for other cultures, respect for others views and thoughts, respect for the environment, respect for labour and respect for the Arts.

A film that was much appreciated was 3 Feet that is directed by Giselle Geney from Colombia. “The film which is in Spanish is about a 10-year-old boy who loves football, goes through the mountainous town of Pamplona in Spain every morning in the company of his best friend (his soccer ball), playing with it before theschool day begins and getting his shoes dirty. Every day, he is scoldedduring the inspection of uniforms by his teacher Ramón, and forced to polish his shoes, while others enjoy their rest. Everything changes the day the teacher decides that not only will he punish Gonzalo during the break, but he will also take away his best friend forever,” Ahmed says.

The event also saw the presence of two child jury members — Akshyat Sharma and Anant Gokhale along with directors of School Cinema film, Saving Green — Shivani Monga and Najmus Saqib.

Not only this, the jury that chose the films not only had eminent personalities like Anna Nikina-Ruohonen, Ambassador, Education Innovations, HundrED Finland, Jaya Bachchan, MP, Manisha Koirala, actor and John Edmond, festival Director, Qurrnsland Film Festival, it consited of children aged nine to 17. These children were from cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai.

Neha Jain, head of Films @LXL Ideas, said that one highlight of the last one year has been ‘Make Cinema’ — the filmmaking competition for students. “We were fortunate to watch some lovely films made by young, amateur filmmakers who had clearly put their heart and soul in their film. Our winners of Make Cinema 2018 as well as our Child Jurors from last year got the wonderful opportunity to travel to Italy and participate in the 50-year-old Giffoni Film Festival. We also hosted young people from Giffoni last year, and will be doing the same this year as well. We will also be having two of the winners of Make Cinema from Kyrgyzstan. They will be visiting schools in India and interacting with students here. Moreover, our other Make Cinema winners from 2018 get to be on the Child Jury this year,” she added.

The IKFF would not have been complete without the support and love of the many people and organisations it received over the last three years. The Australian Consulate in India is one of them. They brought in five films from Australia as well as a chance to meet a talented filmmaker.

“I would also like to thank our wonderful Film Festival partners Children's Film Festival Seattle, Providence Children's Film Festival, Busan International Kids & Youth Festival, Giffoni Film Festival, Boston International Kids Film Festival and Rolan International Childrens Film Festival Armenia,” Jain said.

117,12-1-20,Over to the Lohri kukkads,"Food festivals have a way with the stomach particularly when they strive to bring the local foods and flavours to your stressed out platter seasonally. It's Lohri time and Delhi will be plucking into the juices of winter for that one last time before a long-haul summer takes over. The Lohri Food Festival at The Dhaba, helmed by Chef Tikka Manpreet Singh all the way from Muktsar, is one special pit stop you need to park in at least once during the next fortnight. A tasting report by Sunday Pioneer

Harvest time is all about food, authentic, rural and only from the roots. It is about celebration of a harvest, of the delightful result of all the toil and stress that has gone into growing a crop, nursing it through thick and thin and then worshipping the bountiful success reaped from Mother Nature. Hence, it is the time to celebrate what’s on your platter and how flavourful and authentic is it.

That’s Lohri for you, signifying the change of season too. From makkey di roti and sarson da saag, this is the time that the food plate starts making the shift to prepare for the long summer ahead. But for one last January-February push, the platter is all about the juicy kukkads on the roast and the flavourful bathu in the dal.

Bringing to you this root food from Punjab right into the heart of the Capital at Dhaba at The Claridges, is chef Tikka Manpreet Singh from Chandigarh. He may currently be ruing the Gurugramisation of Chandigarh but he makes sure he spends most of his time exploring platters deep in the rural hearths of his countryside. Hailing from Muktsar in between Faridkot and Bhatinda, the burly sardar is a simpleton who keeps his food mounts equally simple.

So, as you dig into the incredible Dal-Bathu (Whole green pulse sauteed with fresh Bathu (palak) leaves pot-cooked over slow fire and finished with desi ghee) you understand why the movement “go global, eat local” is becoming such a rage.

Chef Manpreet, who is as passionate about propelling a neem lakdi brush more in the morning as he is about using fresh local products in his cuisine, picks his own spices and says he adds to his dishes only what used to be added by women in the villages eight generations ago. For him, there is no oil other than mustard and no butter other than desi ghee, both of which he uses to optimum taste whether it be his saron saag boti or kali mirch ka murga.

You laugh and ask him why Punjabis are all about kukkads, marinated or otherwise, and he shakes his head to politely signal your ignorance. “All this is new fad. It was always bakra for the real Punjab. And chhota bakra at that,” he insists.

However, the dishes he has curated for the upcoming Lohri Food Festival at the Dhaba cater to the Dilliwala obsession for and chicken which outweighs the mutton on the menu. But that does not take away from the Muktsar Wala Saag Meat, the famous local mutton dish cooked in fresh mustard leaves. He has chosen his mutton well because it melts in your mouth without fuss and the sarson is unfathomable, thanks to the absence of even a hint of bitterness. Of course, the spices are all his and he has been busy shopping for khada masala to spice up the proceedings once the Tikka festival starts in real earnest from Lohri Day, January 13.

While at The Dhaba, it is always a pleasure to listen to food stories by corporate chef Tarun and chef Rana, both of whom have been striving to keep the platters tasty and healthy.

As Chef Manpreet talks about his experience with fresh jaggery right off the handmade churner in the bosom of Punjab, Tarun tells you how the sugarcane sticks are red and jucier in the Maharashtra belt as opposed to the Western UP zone. The gur, meanwhile, takes your attention away with the ajwain and the fennel flavouring, not to mention a crunch here and there of raw peanuts. Indeed, winters come alive, with this rural offering just before the main course fades into dessert with home-made Kalakand, Boondi Rabri which is malai all the way and the differently enabled Sund Makhaney ki Panjeeri. Just a dash of tulsi leaves would have completed the staple Punjabi region supplement made from wheat flour fried in ghee with makhana and dry fruits.

And just before one signs off, there is a whole lot of Punjabi take on jheenga and fish tikkas for starters where the Kalonji Wali Tandoori Machhi rubs fins with the traditional Bharwein Murgh Di Tangri which tells you why it is so good to be with rich Punjabi cuisine.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/over-to-the-lohri-kukkads-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/over-to-the-lohri-kukkads.html

What is Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare about?

I play Usman in the film that is about issues that women middle class families face in their lives. There are different characters that come in Dolly and Kitty’s lives. My part comes in Dolly’s (played by Konkona Sen) live and the two form an interesting and strange friendhsip — Dolly is married Usman is a young boy. With time, they form a bond and share all kinds of things and confide in each other. Usman’s character sees Dolly’s life differently as opposed to how others see her. But the movie is more than just this.

What attracted you to the role?

The people associated with the film. Alankrita (Shrivastava) who is the director. She has done some great fims like Lipstick Under the Burqa. She gave me an outline of the film. Though it was not enough to judge the story, I knew that Alankrita was directing it and had written it. I knew my character was with Konkona Sen and then Ekta (Kapoor) is involved whom I had worked with, Alankrita with whom I wanted to work with and acting opposite Konkona was good enough for me. Though I had already made up my mind, but like a professional actor, I told her I would read the script. I was assured that there would be a certain quality to the project. I really liked the script and the perspective it takes as well.

Bollywood is making different kind of cinema. What does it mean to actors like yourself?

I am getting certain kind of work. They are not films like Tiger Zinda Hai where I play Tiger. It doesn’t fit in anybody’s mind to offer such movies to me. These movies are made keeping in mind a certain scale and purpose. Probably, at this time in my carerr, the kind of films that I am doing today, the fans that I have anyways, I will not be able to do justice to such kind of movies at present since they are made with certain sensibilities. I know that the kind of films that will be offered will be what I am getting doing. But I get to do different kind of roles. Once you become big and are in the paid business, I will end up doing different versions of Amol. I am at the best stage in my career at present since I get to do a variety of characters and take risks craft wise.

Do you think that the industry makes slapstick comedy?

I am doing a comedy but don’t know how much I can talk about it. This is the kind of movie that will be riding on my shoulders. I can safely say it is not a slapstick comedy. It is done by a friend of mine and genuinely laughed when I read the script. But don’t know if the audience will laugh. It may not make 50 people laugh and maybe just five, but it will make them laugh.

How did acting happen? Was it something that you wanted to do?

No, not at all. I got a job after doing my engineering from IIT-Delhi. A lot of my friends were quiting and going into start-ups. I did a bit of theatre on the side. But never saw myself in that set-up. But then I quit my job and met a few people in Mumbai who were excited about a play that I had written. Then I started getting work. That gave me confidence to explore. Then three years back, I took it more seriously and here I am.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-can-take-risks-and-do-variety-of-roles-now----2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---i-can-take-risks-and-do-variety-of-roles-now---.html
119,12-1-20,"‘Hot water’ DIG transferred to Manipur, Nagaland sector","The CRPF has transferred DIG DK Tripathi, accused of throwing hot water on a jawan who served it to him at a training centre, to the Manipur and Nagaland sector with immediate effect, according to an official order issued by the paramilitary.

The transfer has been done pending a detailed probe into the incident,Tripathi has been transferred to the Manipur and Nagaland sector from his current posting in Mokamaghat, Bihar.

The purported incident took place early this month at the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Recruit Training Centre in Bihar's Rajgir district. The jawan, constable Amol Kharat, is reported to have suffered scalding injuries to his face and chest.

The DIG has been transferred after a preliminary inquiry report into the incident was submitted by an Inspector General-rank officer. A full investigation into the incident was underway, officials said.

The contents of the preliminary inquiry report were not immediately known but officials said a recommendation for a detailed and full probe was made.

Earlier, an official communication by the force had said that the DIG, who was staying at the officers' mess of the Rajgir-based institute for an official work, had ordered hot water to drink. Constable Kharat, who was on duty at the facility, served him the water in a thermos flask.

The officer is said to have burnt his mouth on drinking the water without applying his mind to mix cold water before drinking. After this, Tripathi summoned Kharat and the DIG ""threw"" hot water on the jawan's face and on his winter jersey.

As per the previous trend in the Force, officers are hardly made accountable even in cases involving serious lapses in operational roles.

This is the first time that any civilian has been beheaded by the BAT, which comprises Pakistani army regulars and terrorists, though similar incidents involving security personnel have taken place in the past, they said.

The body of Mohammad Aslam (28) was badly mutilated and his head was missing, a senior police officer said.

Asked about the killings by Pakistan, Army Chief Gen M M Naravane said on Saturday that professional armies never resort to “barbaric” acts and they “will deal appropriately with such situations in a military manner”.

A defence spokesman had earlier said that Aslam and Altaf Hussain (23), both residents of Kassalian village of Gulpur sector, were killed and three others injured after being hit by a mortar shell when Pakistani Army targeted a group of Army porters who were carrying logistics for the troops in a forward area close the LoC on Friday.

However, officials said on Saturday that the head of one of the porters was missing and is believed to have been taken away by the BAT.

“The body of Aslam was headless when handed over to police for completion of legal formalities. The bodies of both the porters were handed over to their families and their last rites were conducted in their village on Friday evening,” the police officer said on condition of anonymity.

He said the injured porters — Mohamamd Saleem (24), Mohammad Showkat (28) and Nawaz Ahmad (35) — are undergoing treatment in the hospital and their condition is stated to be “stable”.

“We will deal appropriately with such situations in a military manner,” Gen Naravane said when asked about the incident at a press conference in Delhi ahead of the Army Day.

He said the Indian Army conducts itself in the most professional and ethical manner including on the LoC. “Professional armies never resort to barbaric acts,” he said.

The opposition Congress strongly condemned the killings and questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh were “silent” on the “barbarism” by Pakistan.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bat-beheads-porter--army-chief-says-will-deal-with-such-barbaric-acts-in----military-manner---.html

122,12-1-20,"Lalu’s son supports Deepika, BJP hits back at Tej’s ‘gyaan’","RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav’s elder son Tej Pratap on Saturday came out in support of actor Deepika Padukone and her movie ‘Chhapaak’ in which she has essayed the role of an acid attack survivor.

The film is facing a boycott call from sympathisers of the BJP-led NDA government at Centre in the wake of Padukone’s recent visit to the JNU following violence in the campus.

The RJD leader’s tweet in favour of the actor and her film, however, drew instant ridicule from Bihar BJP which was quick to point out the alleged ill-treatment suffered by the mercurial leader’s estranged wife, Aishwarya Roy.

Yadav, who takes to the micro-blogging site far less frequently than his father, mother Rabri Devi, eldest sister Misa Bharti or younger brother Tejashwi Yadav, offered his take in typical Bihari slang.

“Why is Chhapaak coming like a ‘dhapaak’ (blow) to those who are occupying seats of power? These are the same people who swear by women’s empowerment and safety and coin slogans like ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’. You are an inspiration, @deepikapadukone ji,” Tej Pratap tweeted.

Padukone is being trolled ever since she visited the JNU campus and stood beside students protesting the recent assault by masked attackers allegedly supporting RSS-affiliate ABVP.

The hashtag #boycottchhapaak has been trending on Twitter as Padukone’s gesture was seen as supportive of those opposed to the BJP.

‘Chapaak’ hit the screens on Friday.

Yadav’s averment came a day after his party colleague and former state culture minister Shiv Chandra Ram urged the Nitish Kumar government to declare the film tax-free.

State BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand responded by issuing a strongly-worded statement, condemning as “ridiculous, bordering on shamelessness” the “gyaan” (wisdom) that Yadav sought to offer in his tweet.

“His parents may have named him Tej (bright) but he would do well to stop taking it literally and, in view of his actions, start calling himself ‘chirkut’ (worthless).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lalu---s-son-supports-deepika---bjp-hits-back-at-tej---s----gyaan---.html

The protester, who was identified as Johnny, poured kerosene on his person and tried to set himself ablaze. However, the alert police responded quickly and foiled the suicide attempt.

Meanwhile, the police deployed more forces and the farmers continued their protests in the rest of the Capital villages. The agitators raised ‘Jai Amaravati’ slogans.

The deliberation was one of the first in a series of listening to the pain points of companies operating in Maharashtra (which contributes 20% of India’s GDP) noting the suggestions for improvement and quantifying the impact of the same. Maharashtra has an ambition of becoming a trillion dollar economy by itself and will play a crucial role in India reaching its target of becoming a $5 trillion economy.

Naushad Panjwani, President (West), IACC, opened the roundtable with the following statement; “The present Govt has done well to introduce structural reforms be it in the segment of labour laws, banking, bankruptcy, digitisation and GST amongst others. These reforms were long overdue and the intent of introducing them was right, but these could have been executed better.”

Saurabh Shah, VP (West) — IACC, said, “It is heartening to see the Prime Minister personally meeting the industry leaders, taking a cue from that we are meeting leaders of the next rung of companies and going to 10 cities (Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Goa) to get a very wide perspective of their challenges. A detailed white paper on the same will be presented to the state chief Ministers, relevant union ministers and respective American Consulates along with engaging with them on the subject.”

Ease of Doing Business in India Roundtable — Key Takeaways

Digitisation is a key — Be it in compliances, stamp duty, court records or land records. While we are on track, the process needs to be accelerated, integrated and simplified.

Key to have clear rules — This is necessary to avoid any issues in interpretation or delay in implementation. Further, the punishment/ penalty should be clear, severe and uniform.

Facilitation — Focus should be on facilitation rather than on regulation.

Pendency of courts — This area needs a lot of work. Some thoughts include increased use of digitization, artificial intelligence, etc. Another suggestion is to have ‘mediation’ or ‘conciliation’ as pre-requisite before approaching any judicial authorities — this will reduce number of cases being filed.

Capacity building — More focus on capacity building by all Governmental/judicial authorities. Forums like AICC can play a big role in this area.

Easy access — Automated process to access government facilities. Say, access to ESI hospitals, PF withdrawals, etc.

Ease of doing business — Time taken to setup and close business needs improvement. We need to provide incentives and handholding to set-up businesses and documents/ compliances required — while some states are performing well in this area, as a country we are far behind our developed counterparts.

Performance review — To incentivise better performance, accountability, a clear performance evaluation system needs to be implemented at Govern-mental authority level.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---ease-of-doing-business-crucial---.html
136,12-1-20,Lamborghini sales highest in S India,"South India contributes to more than 50 per cent India sales to Lamborghini and has emerged as one of the strongest markets, said an official on Saturday.

“Today, Bengaluru or the Southern region is contributing more than 50 per cent of our business in India. In this part of the country, the customers are more evolved and they are looking at collecting these super cars,” Lamborghini India head Sharad Agarwal said.

Agarwal said the Southern market is growing much faster than rest of India, owing to the investments coming to the South Indian states and by virtue of IT hubs being located in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai.

“All these regions are attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI) vis-a-vis rest of the country, this is reflecting also in the business. Bengaluru is definitely important and strategic for us,” said Agarwal.

The importance of Bengaluru for the Italian car maker can be understood from the fact that a city-based buyer was the only Indian to buy one of the 63 limited edition Aventador SVJ 63 cars.

Another Bengaluru buyer was the first Indian to buy limited edition SVJ 900 car.

“We have seen an increase in the number of super car aficionados in India, reflected in the strong demand across the Lamborghini product line including the limited edition super sports cars,” said Agarwal.

Lamborghini has three showrooms in India, Delhi and Mumbai and Bengaluru which serves the entire South Indian market including Hyderabad and Chennai.

However, Agarwal could not share Lamborghini sales for 2019 as the company’s headquarters in Italy is yet to declare the numbers.

“Though the super luxury car industry sales declined by 20 per cent in 2019 and the overall auto industry sales also declined, Lamborghini had a healthy double digit sales growth last year in India,” said Agarwal without sharing the numbers.

Giving a hint at Lamborghini India’s clientele, Agarwal said most of the Italian supercar buyers are entrepreneurs who always had an aspiration or dream to buy the Italian machine.

Lamborghini retails three models worldwide, sports utility vehicle Urus, Huracan and Aventador, under multiple variants, all of which are available in India.

All Lamborghini cars are made at one single factory in Italy, to be exported as completely built units (CBU) across the world.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lamborghini-sales-highest-in-s-india.html

140,12-1-20,IndiGo opens first international call centre in Guangzhou,"To tap the booming Chinese market, IndiGo airlines has opened its first international call centre comprising six employees at Guangzhou in China to cater to queries from passengers that speak in Cantonese, Mandarin and English.

The Guangzhou call center was started around the same time the low-cost carrier started its flight operations between India and China in September last year. Currently, IndiGo operates a daily flight on Delhi-Chengdu route as well as on Kolkata-Guangzhou route.

""We are shortly to be announcing a third service (flight) to China, which will commence within the first half of 2020. China is a market of great potential in our view, and we will continue to look for ways to expand our presence there,"" Willy Boulter, Chief Commercial Officer, IndiGo told PTI.

To address the ""uniqueness and potential"" of Chinese market, and to mitigate the ""language barrier"" for Chinese passengers who cannot speak in Hindi or English, IndiGo started a 24X7 call centre in Guangzhou in mid-September with six staff members, said Boulter.

All six staff members are non-Indian and are fluent in two local languages - Cantonese and Mandarin - noted Boulter.

""Also, the executives in China call centre can speak English, so if any customer travelling from India needs help in China, he or she can reach out to our call centre,"" he added.

At present, India hosts only around 3.5 lakh out of total 50 lakh Chinese international travellers. Indian government has been trying to get a larger share of Chinese tourists.

When asked what kind of customer base is being addressed by the Guangzhou call centre, Boulter said that it is a mix of travellers with 50 per cent of them speaking Cantonese, 45 per cent in English and five per cent in Mandarin.

He added that Guangzhou call centre deals anywhere between 50 and 100 queries per day.

The Chinese international air traffic is experiencing rapid growth, driven by aggressive expansion from Chinese airlines.

The number of Chinese airlines operating international services has grown from 15 to 29 between 2016 and 2019, according to a report by aviation consultancy CAPA in March last year.

IndiGo, India's largest airline, currently has three 24x7 call centres in India - Pune, Gurgaon and Chennai - with around 1000 staff members in them.

""The service levels at IndiGo on a normal day, is 98% which means out of 100 calls, 98 are promptly responded,"" Boulter said.

Talking about IndiGo call-centres, Boulter said,""It is strategically located across 3 varied geographical areas (in India) that helps us to mitigate challenges with regards to manpower; climatic conditions etc...The call centre caters to all kind of queries, pre and post travel.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indigo-opens-first-international-call-centre-in-guangzhou-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indigo-opens-first-international-call-centre-in-guangzhou.html

As per latest depositories data, FPIs invested a net amount of Rs 777 crore in equities and pulled out Rs 3,192.7 crore from the debt segment between January 1-10. This translates into a cumulative net outflow of Rs 2,415.7 crore.

Overseas investors have turned net sellers in January after remaining buyers for four consecutive months since September 2019.

""Cautiousness among foreign investors was apparent as they closely watched the developments on the global front before investing in the Indian equity markets. Geopolitical turmoil triggered by increased tension between US and Iran played a key role in the way equity markets behaved globally,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

However, both the US and Iran have shown their intentions to de-escalate military tensions. This may result in the rebuilding of risk-on sentiment which may be positive for foreign flows into Indian equity markets going ahead, he added.

Additionally, FPIs have the Budget announcements in their sights.

142,12-1-20,Did not receive invite from Indian Govt to visit J&K: Russian envoy,"Russian Envoy to India Nikolay Kudashev has said he did not receive an invitation from the Indian Government to be a part of the group of envoys which paid a two-day visit to J&K this week.

He also said there were no hiccups in the deal to supply a batch of S-400 air defence missiles to India in the wake of fresh threats by the US to not go ahead with the multi-billion dollar deal.

""I have never seen an official invitation to be part of this team. This was not a private journey. My colleagues (other envoys) got the invitation. It was their sovereign decision to travel. If I have one (an invitation), I would consider it,"" he told reporters.

A group of 15 envoys, including the US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster, visited J&K this week where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as the military top brass.

The visit by the envoys was the second one of a foreign delegation to J&K since the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 on August 5. Earlier, Delhi-based think tank International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies took 23 EU MPs on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the union territory.

The situation in J&K is an internal matter of India and not an issue in Indo-Russia relations, Kudashev said on the sidelines of an event on Friday.

""Quite frankly, we believe that the situation there (Kashmir) is strictly an internal matter of India. Russian diplomacy is not in the habit of commenting on internal developments of our friendly partners. If anyone (who) has any questions on Kashmir can travel there. we do not have any questions,"" he added.

Asked about the S-400 air defense systems deal between Russia and India and the US stance on it, he said Russia truly appreciates India's position as far as the S-400 deal is concerned.

""India's commitment is there to implement it and to continue it. As far as we are concerned, there are no issues with us,"" Kudashev said.

He also said the delivery of the first batch of missiles will come by the end of this year or early 2021.

""There are no issues on the payments. No complaint as far as I can understand. The contract is being implemented safely,"" he added.

His remarks come days after a senior US official said the Trump administration does not want to degrade India's defence capabilities. The official asserted that there will be a case-by-case analysis on where punitive measures under the CAATSA could be applied on countries buying significant military equipment from Russia.

India and Russia signed the $5 billion S-400 air defence system deal in October 2018, after wide-ranging talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Responding to a question on implications of India going ahead with its decision to purchase S-400 missile defence system from Russia, the official had said, ""I know India has expressed valid concerns. They don't want to have a sustainment line completely shut down.

That's the last thing we want to do with a significant partner.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/did-not-receive-invite-from-indian-govt-to-visit-j-k--russian-envoy.html

“The Opposition does not have any other issue, so they are spreading misinformation and falsehood on the CAA. This has resulted in anarchy in the entire country,” he said.

His statements come in the wake of violent protests in parts of India over the CAA, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

“Persecuted minorities have to come to India to save themselves. However, the previous Governments did not give any facilities to these migrants thinking that it would make others unhappy,” he said at the inauguration of various projects of the Gujarat Police here.

“Rahulbaba, Mamata, Kejriwal and Communists are spreading lies that CAA will take away the citizenship of Muslims. I challenge them to show me any such provision in the Act,” Shah said.

“I urge the BJP workers to visit every household and bust the lies and misinformation being spread against the CAA. Since there is no alternative to Modiji in politics at present, the Opposition is resorting to falsehood,” he added.

“We have the power to make people understand the truth. After our campaign is over, people of the country will understand the importance of the CAA,” the BJP chief said.

149,12-1-20,'Modi govt's USD 5-trillion GDP target by 2024 looks unimaginably ambitious',"India would need to grow at 9 per cent to achieve the target of USD 5 trillion economy by 2024, which currently looks ""unimaginably ambitious"", eminent economist R Nagaraj said on Sunday.

Soon after assuming office for the second term in May 2019, the Narendra Modi-led government set a target of taking the economy to USD 5 trillion over the next five years.

But there have been several clouds over the economy since then, leading many to question the maintainability of the target.

India's GDP is currently estimated at around USD 2.8 trillion.

""The target appears exceptionally daunting, if not impossible, going by the record of the current decade. Last July, as per my estimate, India needed to grow on average at 9 per cent per year in real terms from the fiscal year 2020 to 2024 to achieve the target of 5 trillion dollar economy.

""With the growth rate slumping, the goal looks unimaginably ambitious,"" Nagaraj, a professor of economics at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR), told PTI.

India's GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and construction sectors, as per government data.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2019-20 was 5 per cent, which further slipped to 4.5 per cent in the subsequent three-month period.

Talking about rising trade tensions, he said the prospects of a reversal in declining trends look very unlikely.

""India's exports to GDP ratio has steadily declined since the early 2010s. So, I don't see any signs of reversal of the declining trends,"" he said.

Asked whether a fiscal stimulus is the only way out of the slowdown, Nagaraj said that lowering of interest rates over the last few years has not helped and there is a need for fiscal stimulus.

On the upcoming Budget for 2020-21, he said, ""I hope the Budget targets a high and rising investment to GDP ratio for the next 3-4 years with credible budgetary figures, and with a bright, implementable strategy in place.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-modi-govt-s-usd-5-trillion-gdp-target-by-2024-looks-unimaginably-ambitious--2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/-modi-govt-s-usd-5-trillion-gdp-target-by-2024-looks-unimaginably-ambitious-.html
150,12-1-20,Taiwan's Tsai wins landslide in stinging result for China,"Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen declared a landslide victory in Saturday's election as voters delivered a stunning rebuke of Beijing's campaign to isolate the self-ruled island and handed its first female leader a second term.

Tsai, 63, announced her victory as thousands of jubilant supporters cheered and waved flags outside her party headquarters with the ongoing vote count revealing an all but unassailable lead.

“Taiwan is showing the world how much we cherish our free, democratic way of life and how much we cherish our nation,” she told reporters.

Her main rival, Han Kuo-yu of the China-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) party, had conceded defeat shortly beforehand.

Official results showed Tsai was romping ahead with 57 per cent —more than eight million votes -- on Saturday evening. Han trailed behind with 38 per cent. The Central Election Commission was still counting votes when Tsai declared, but Han knew he could not close the gap. The result is a huge blow for Beijing, which has made no secret of wanting to see Tsai turfed out and the KMT take her place.

Over the last four years it ramped up economic and diplomatic pressure on the self-ruled island, hoping it would encourage voters to support Tsai's opposition.

But the strong arm tactics backfired and voters flocked to her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), fuelled in part by China's hardline response to months of huge and violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

Tsai pitched herself as a defender of liberal democratic values against the increasingly authoritarian shadow cast by China under President Xi Jinping.

Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to retake the island one day, by force if necessary.

Her campaign frequently invoked Hong Kong's protests as a warning of what might lie ahead should China one day take control of Taiwan.

During her victory speech on Saturday night Tsai said she was committed to dialogue with China's leaders and wanted peace. But she called on Beijing to halt its sabre rattling towards Taiwan and respect the idea that only the island's 23 million inhabitants can decide its future.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/taiwan-s-tsai-wins-landslide-in-stinging-result-for-china.html
151,12-1-20,"Qaboos, the sultan who shielded Oman from region's turmoil","Oman's Sultan Qaboos, who died on Friday aged 79, transformed the former Arabian Peninsula backwater into a modern state and sought-after mediator while shielding the sultanate from a region in turmoil.

The intensely private sultan -- the longest-reigning ruler in the modern Arab world -- left no apparent heir and the royal family was charged with selecting a successor.

Instead however they opted for the sultan's own choice, his cousin Haitham bin Tariq, who was named in a sealed letter that Qaboos had prepared in case of a deadlock.

Qaboos was born on November 18, 1940, into the centuries-old Al-Said dynasty in the southern provincial capital of Salalah, in an isolated country on the margins of the modern world.

Older Omanis recall the capital Muscat had no electricity or running water and the gates of the medieval city were locked at dusk.

The young Qaboos was sent abroad for his education to Britain, attending the elite Sandhurst Royal Military Academy from where he graduated in 1962.

He went on to join a British infantry battalion in Germany, returning home to bide his time under the close watch of his father, Sultan Said bin Taymur.

On July 23, 1970, Qaboos deposed his father in a palace coup, pledging “a new era” for the nation.

Oman is strategically located on the Strait of Hormuz -- the narrow seaway through which much of the world's oil supply passes -- and between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Qaboos maintained good ties with both nations, a balancing act that made his capital a must-stop for Western and Arab diplomats as well as military chiefs alike.

The sultan's first foreign trip was to Iran, whose shah -- along with the British -- helped him quell the Marxist insurgency he inherited from his father in the restive Dhofar region.

152,12-1-20,N Korea says will resume US talks if demands fully met,"North Korea said on Saturday it had received Donald Trump's letter wishing a happy birthday to leader Kim Jong Un, but warned it will return to nuclear talks only when Washington fully accepts its demands.

The US president and Kim have held three meetings since June 2018 but negotiations have been largely deadlocked since the breakup of their Hanoi summit last February.

Kim Kye Gwan, North Korea's foreign ministry adviser, said Trump's congratulatory letter had arrived in the isolated, nuclear-armed state directly from the US.

“As acknowledged by the world, it is true that the personal relations between (Kim Jong Un) and President Trump are not bad,” he said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency.

However, it would be “absent-minded” to expect Pyongyang to resume dialogue because of that warm personal relationship, the statement continued.

“We have been deceived by the US, being caught in the dialogue with it for over one year and a half, and that was the lost time for us,” the adviser said.

On the gridlocked nuclear talks, he said that reopening dialogue would only be possible in the case of Washington's “absolute agreement” on the issues raised by North Korea.

But the senior official was sceptical that the US would accept these demands, saying: “we know well that the US is neither ready nor able to do so. We know... The way we should go and will go on our way.”

At a meeting of his ruling party in December, Kim Jong Un declared an end to North Korea's moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

The leader also threatened a demonstration of a “new strategic weapon” soon.

Saturday's statement on KCNA came a day after South Korea's presidential security adviser said Trump had asked Seoul to deliver his birthday message for Kim.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/n-korea-says-will-resume-us-talks-if-demands-fully-met.html
153,12-1-20,Texas to reject new refugees under Trump order,"Greg Abbott, the Republican Governor of Texas, has said that the State would not accept new refugees under President Donald Trump's resettlement programme. a media report said on Saturday.

In a letter to the State Department on Friday, Abbott said that Texas had done “more than its share in assisting the refugee resettlement process”, and argued that the state should be focused on “those who are already here, including refugees, migrants, and the homeless”, the BBC report said.

On that basis, Abbott said he “cannot consent to initial refugee resettlement” in 2020, but added that the decision “does not deny any refugee access” to the US.

Refugees who are already settled in other states, Abbott said, would be allowed to move to Texas if they choose.

Texas has large refugee populations in several of its major cities. In the 2018 fiscal year, Texas took in 1,697 refugees - more than any other state, but a large drop from 4,768 in the previous fiscal year.

Abbott's decision means Texas will become the first US state known to do so, the BBC report added.

In September 2019, President Trump announced that states must actively consent to any resettlement of refugees after June 2020.

So far, the Governors of more than 40 other states have said they would opt in to the government programme.

Trump has made reducing immigration a key aim of his administration. He has slashed the number of refugees allowed into the country for the 2020 fiscal year to 18,000 - a record low.

About 30,000 refugees were resettled in the US during the previous fiscal year.

The previous lowest admissions figure was in 2002, after the 9/11 attacks, when about 27,000 refugees were allowed into the US.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/texas-to-reject-new-refugees-under-trump-order.html
154,12-1-20,Bushfires bring fears of ‘new normal' to life Down Under,"A grim summer of fire and smoke has sullied Australia's outdoorsy and healthy image, and left many fearful for the future.

For the unfortunate few, three long months of bushfires have brought almost unfathomable pain —homes lost, lives destroyed, families ripped apart.

But for many millions more the crisis has also shattered the long sunny days typically filled with beaches, barbecues and backyard cricket.

Sporting events were cancelled, windows shuttered against weeks of menacing toxic haze and barbecues banned to prevent even more fires.

Famed beaches like Bondi were partially blackened, as the tide washed the ash of incinerated eucalypts back to shore.

Holidays were cancelled as entire towns were shut off, highways were bumper-to-bumper with fleeing tourists and petrol stations mobbed as fuel ran out during the largest peacetime evacuations the country has ever seen.

“We've seen the whole Australian way of life over summer across the continent upended,” social researcher Rebecca Huntley, who has surveyed Australia's attitudes to the changing climate, told AFP.

“Instead of looking at the end of the year as a time to relax, (Australians) are getting quite anxious.” Images of military evacuations and frightened families huddled on beaches under red skies have challenged many people's previously idyllic idea of the continent.

Huntley said the severity of the fires was challenging the perception that living in Australia meant having a high quality of life, with Sydney and Melbourne long-ranked as among the most liveable cities in the world.

Now residents have become expert at reading wind forecasts and fire maps to predict whether their kids will be able to play outside tomorrow.

157,12-1-20,Auto industry seeks bold fiscal measures in the Budget to revive growth,"In middle of a prolonged slowdown, the automobile industry has asked the government to take bold fiscal measures to revive the sector that has reported its worst-ever sales decline in two decades during 2019, industry sources said.

In the upcoming Union Budget, the auto industry has sought measures, such as reduction in GST rates on vehicles and abolition of duty on import of lithium-ion battery cells, to encourage electric mobility.

The industry, which has been facing a downturn for almost a year now, has also sought an incentive-based scrappage policy and an increase in re-registration charges of vehicles to discourage use of old vehicles.

Sources said that the introduction of BS-VI emission norms is a positive step to reduce emissions significantly but the initiative would lead to an 8-10 per cent increase in vehicle cost, leading to enhanced GST collections for government.

""However, this extra cost would lead to a fall in demand. As a win-win situation, we are requesting the government to consider reducing GST on BS-VI vehicles to 18 per cent from the current 28 per cent from April onwards,"" an industry source said.

The decision-making power for GST reduction lies with the GST Council and not related to the Budget directly but this is an important element for demand revival, he added.

The auto industry is also scrapping duty on import of lithium-ion battery cells so that battery packs can be manufactured locally and progressively cell manufacturing can also be established in the country.

It would also help in reducing cost of electric vehicles and aid in accelerating adoption of green mobility in the country, another source said.

He added that a formal incentive-based scrappage policy with monetary support from the government as well as manufacturers is required to take old vehicles off the roads and generate demand for new vehicles.

""Incentive in the form of 50 per cent tax rebate in GST, road tax and registration charges is proposed,"" the source noted.

The industry has also sought adequate Budget allocation for the Ministry of Urban Development to support state transport undertakings in procuring buses.

""Robust public transportation will reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby will reduce pollution and hence positively impact climate change. This would also lead to reviving demand for commercial vehicles which is very much needed in the current economic scenario,"" the source said.

Besides, the industry has asked increase in depreciation rate on passenger vehicle and two-wheelers to 25 per cent to have depreciation aligned to real useful life of the vehicle.

Similarly, it has asked the government to permanently withdraw the proposed hike in the vehicle registration fee as a higher fee would further impact the demand negatively.

""Besides, we are seeking income tax benefits on the interest part of vehicle loan to be provided to individuals purchasing green vehicles,"" the source noted.

The automobile industry recorded its worst-ever sales decline in two decades in 2019, with an unprecedented slowdown hampering vehicle offtake across segments.

According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) last week, all vehicle segments reported de-growth last year as low consumer sentiments, weak rural demand and economic slowdown took toll on demand.

Overall wholesale of vehicles during the year across categories, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, saw a decline of 13.77 per cent in 2019 at 2,30,73,438 units as against 2,67,58,787 units in 2018.

This is the worst fall in sales since the industry body started recording monthly and yearly sales data in 1997. The previous lowest was recorded in 2007 when overall sales had declined by 1.44 per cent.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/auto-industry-seeks-bold-fiscal-measures-in-the-budget-to-revive-growth-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/auto-industry-seeks-bold-fiscal-measures-in-the-budget-to-revive-growth.html
158,12-1-20,Ukraine demands punishment for Iran plane downing,"Ukraine on Saturday demanded that Iran punish those guilty for the downing of a Ukrainian airliner and compensate victims while praising Tehran for cooperating with the “objective” investigation.

Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelensky was due to discuss the incident with his Iranian counterpart President Hassan Rouhani at 5:00 pm local time, his press office said.

“We expect Iran... To bring the guilty to the courts,” the Ukrainian leader wrote on Facebook, calling also for the “payment of compensation” and the return of remains.

Tehran admitted Saturday that it accidentally downed the Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) plane, killing all 176 people on board on Wednesday, shortly after launching missiles at bases hosting US forces in Iraq.

Rouhani said Tehran “deeply regrets this disastrous mistake”. Tehran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.

Kiev said that Iran had cooperated with its experts and it expects an objective probe.

Tehran has handed Ukrainian experts enough data including “all the photos, videos and other materials” to show the investigation “will be carried out objectively and promptly,” Zelensky's office said.

“The political part of the work is finished,” it added.

It published photos of experts examining the scene and close-ups of holes in the fuselage and shrapnel damage.

Ukraine said Friday its experts dispatched to Iran had been granted access to the flight's black boxes, debris from the plane, the crash site and to recordings of conversations between the pilot and the airport control tower.

Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, which is coordinating the probe, told AFP Kiev did not yet have evidence on where the missile was produced, only that it was “launched from Iranian soil.”

Zelensky said earlier that Ukraine hoped the inquiry would be pursued “without deliberate delay and without obstruction.” He urged “total access” to the full inquiry for the 45 Ukrainian experts, and in a tweet also sought an “official apology”.

UIA chief Yevhenii Dykhne said at a press conference in Kiev on Saturday that Tehran should have closed the airport due to the escalation of tensions in the region following the US assassination of a top Iranian general.

“It's absolutely irresponsible... If you're playing at war, they were obliged to close the airport,” Dykhne said.

He wrote on Facebook that the Ukrainian crew and the aircraft “were the best.” Iran's official IRNA news agency published a statement from the military saying the Boeing 737 was mistaken for a “hostile plane” at a time when threats were at the highest level.

The majority of passengers on UIA Flight PS752 from Tehran to Kiev were Iranian-Canadian dual nationals but also included Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes Many in Kiev have compared the crash to the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines MH17 killing 298 people over eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists are fighting government forces.

Moscow has denied the findings of international investigators that a Russian BUK misile hit the Malaysian flight.

“Iran has shown itself to be more civilised than Russia,” pro-western Ukraine MP Volodymyr Ariev wrote on Facebook.

It became a defining moment — one that stunned Washington — after the House impeached Trump when Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to immediately transmit the charges to the Senate.

The abrupt move vexed the Republican president and his party, annoying some, angering others, and caused a political firestorm as the days turned to weeks. It was approaching a month.

It was also a strategy. On Friday, it neared an end with Pelosi announcing the House would take steps next week to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for the president's trial.

While the delay produced an avalanche of theories and strategies about the sudden impasse, it hasn't much changed the widely expected final verdict: Trump's acquittal of charges he abused power and obstructed Congress in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/analysis--pelosi-s-delay-tests-public-opinion-on-impeachment.html
164,12-1-20,Eagles catch Gunners pace,"Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring at Crystal Palace on Saturday but was later sent off as the hosts fought back to draw 1-1 at Selhurst Park.

New Gunners boss Mikel Arteta was on course for a third straight win when his skipper made the breakthrough in the first half, but a deflected effort by Jordan Ayew cancelled it out early in the second period.

When Aubameyang received a red card with 23 minutes left, the experienced Roy Hodgson would have fancied his chances of gaining three points against the youngest manager in the league and but had to settle for a share of the spoils.

Arsenal’s difficulties this season were highlighted by the fact this was the first time Palace were facing the Gunners after Christmas in a top-flight match with the Eagles higher in the table.

Hodgson was boosted by the return of Wilfried Zaha after he missed the defeat to Derby with a knock but new loan signing Cenk Tosun was only named on the bench.

Captain Aubameyang was recalled by Arteta after sitting out the FA Cup win over Leeds and opened the scoring at Selhurst Park in the 12th minute.

Mesut Ozil’s licence to roam had already caused the hosts problems and he moved inside to combine with Alexandre Lacazette, who played in his fellow forward to curl into the bottom corner for his 16th goal of the season.

It was a breathtaking Arsenal move, which started with a brave through ball between the lines by David Luiz, and Palace struggled to gain possession during the opening 30 minutes.

Arteta introduced Matteo Guendouzi at half-time, with Torreira not returning but Palace continued to win free kicks in dangerous positions after the break.

Eventually they made one count, when Jairo Riedewald found Max Meyer in space down the right. His cross was poor, but Kouyate was first to it and set up Ayew, who saw his strike take a big deflection off Luiz and loop over Leno in the 54th minute.

Arsenal’s problems deepened when Aubameyang caught Meyer high on the ankle with a poor challenge by the touchline.

Referee Paul Tierney showed a yellow card but VAR had a look and after a two-and-a-half minute delay, the caution was upgraded to a sending off.

Aubameyang was distraught as he left the pitch in the 67th minute and Meyer had to follow him down the tunnel after failing to recover from the tackle.

That allowed Hodgson to introduce Tosun for his debut, while Arteta withdrew Ozil for Brazilian forward Gabriel Martinelli.

James Tomkins almost produced a winner 12 minutes from time, but his header was cleared off the line by Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Arsenal then almost stole it.

Vicente Guaita came to the rescue though, when he superbly tipped Pepe’s shot on to the post and saved Lacazette’s follow-up in the 83rd minute as it finished all square.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eagles-catch-gunners-pace.html

Asked if Dhoni can make India’s T20 World Cup squad, Gavaskar said, “Fitness is something that I can’t tell you anything at all. The question that needs to be asked is of MSD himself. He has not made himself available to play for India since 10th of July (9th actually).

166,12-1-20,Hardik to wait for Ind return,"With all-rounder Hardik Pandya’s anticipated return getting delayed after he failed the fitness test, India’s limited overs squads are unlikely to be tinkered with much for the upcoming six-week tour of New Zealand.

Starting January 24, India will be playing five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Test matches, and squads for the tour will be picked today.

Pandya was expected to make the Indian squad after remaining out of action for four months due to a back injury but the all-rounder could not clear the mandatory fitness test, indicating that it will take him more to recover from the surgery he recently had.

India will be playing eight white ball games in New Zealand, and it will be interesting to see if the selectors pick a 16 or 17-member squad, instead of 15.

With the India A team’s shadow tour coinciding with the seniors’ visit, it gives the selectors an option to draft players on SOS basis if the need arises.

The selectors will primarily focus on zeroing in on the core for white ball cricket considering that this is a T20 World Cup year.

While the T20 squad that played against Sri Lanka in the just-concluded series all but picks itself, Pandya was expected to be included once he proved his fitness in the warm-up games. However his failure to clear the fitness test is an indication that he is far from ready for interests.

It will be interesting to note if the ODI team is an extension of the T20 squad.

In case the Indian team looks for technical solidity, Ajinkya Rahane could make a comeback, but if the team management is thinking in terms of treating 50 over games as an extension of T20 series, Mumbai player Suryakumar Yadav’s explosive power hitting at No 5 or 6 could be an option. Both Surya and Sanju Samson are in the A squad.

The Test squad wears a very settled look with the only contention being the third opener’s slot.

Picked as a reserve for the home series, the young Shubman Gill deserves to be the third opener, but K L Rahul’s current form and experience in Test cricket could also be considered.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hardik-to-wait-for-ind-return.html

170,12-1-20,Good vs Better,"Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will face each other in the final of the inaugural ATP Cup after winning epic three-set matches on Saturday to steer Spain and Serbia into the decider.

World number one Nadal ground down pumped-up Australian Alex de Minaur to guide the Davis Cup champions through their semi-final while Djokovic battled past Russia’s Daniil Medvedev.

Under the format of the innovative team event in Sydney, the top-ranked singles players from each country play each other, ensuring the two legends clash for a 55th time since their first showdown in 2006.

World number two Djokovic leads the head-to-heads 28-26, including beating his arch-rival in the Australian Open final last year.

Nadal outlasted De Minaur 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 after unflappable teammate Roberto Bautista Agut tamed Nick Kyrgios 6-1, 6-4.

Djokovic had an equally tough time against impressive fifth-ranked Medvedev, coming through a top-draw contest 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 on the back of Dusan Lajovic beating Karen Khachanov 7-5, 7-6 (7/1).

“Alex was playing at a very high level and for me my energy was a little bit lower than usual. But it has been a very emotional evening and a pleasure playing here,” said Nadal.

“We know it’s going to be a super tough final (against Serbia),” he added. “Novak likes a lot to play here, he’s had a lot of great results. So let’s see. We have a good team too.”

Exceptional

Sixteen-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic, who is targeting an eighth Australian Open title this month, had looked on track for a comfortable win against Medvedev after sailing through the opening set and breaking in the first game of the second.

But the dogged Russian, who won their last two encounters, roared back.

He broke in the next game and then again for 3-1, with Djokovic smashing his racquet as Medvedev took the set to level the match.

A third set of long, high-quality rallies went with serve until Djokovic got the crucial edge in the fifth game, converting a volley to go 3-2 in front and Medvedev had no answer.

“It was an exceptional match. Lots of rallies and very exhausting. Daniil Medvedev is one of the best players in the world and he showed today why,” said Djokovic.

“He’s difficult to break from the baseline, he’s tall and has a good serve. This was the most difficult challenge I have had so far this year.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/good-vs-better-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/good-vs-better.html
171,12-1-20,Bumrah set to receive Polly Umrigar Award: BCCI,"India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will receive the prestigious Polly Umrigar Award for his exploits in international cricket in the 2018-19 season, the BCCI announced on Sunday.

The world's leading pacer will be honoured during the BCCI Annual Awards here on Sunday.

The world's No. 1 ODI bowler made his Test debut during India's tour of South Africa in January 2018 and hasn't looked back since.

He picked up a five-wicket haul in South Africa, England, Australia and the West Indies becoming the first and only Asian bowler to achieve the feat.

He played a stellar role in the historic 2-1 Test series win in Australia, India's first Down Under and which helped them retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy.

While Bumrah nets the biggest prize in the men's category, Poonam Yadav will claim the top prize in women's section and will be awarded the best international cricketer.

The award will be another feather in the leg-spinner's cap who recently received the Arjuna Award.

Former India captains Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Anjum Chopra will be presented with the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award and the BCCI Lifetime Achievement Award for women respectively.

A member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, Srikkanth took on the fearsome West Indies fast bowlers and scored an attacking 38, the top individual score in the low-scoring final at the Lord's.

He also captained India and post-retirement served as the chief selector and it was during his tenure that the 2011 World Cup squad was picked.

Anjum is one of the finest batswomen and the first Indian to play 100 ODIs. In a career spanning 17 years, Anjum represented India in four 50-over World Cups and two T20 World Cup (played in one).

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said, ""The BCCI Awards is our way of recognising the finest on-field performances right from the age group to senior level and also honour our legends.

""It will be a special evening in Mumbai as we will also have the 7th MAK Pataudi lecture and I am delighted to inform that it will be Virender Sehwag, who will address the gathering.""

Board secretary Jay Shah said, ""The BCCI Awards are an important feature in India's cricketing calendar, a melange of aspiration and inspiration.

""We wanted to make Naman bigger and better and have introduced four new categories – highest run-getter and wicket-takers in WODIs and best international debut men and women – from this year. A total of 25 awards will be presented.""

Arun Singh Dhumal, the board's treasurer, said, ""Right from domestic to international level, Indian Cricket has had a memorable 2018-19 season.

""We have started the year on the right note with Team India completing a convincing series win against Sri Lanka and they will be in attendance.

""The U-19 team is in South Africa for the World Cup and all eyes will be on the stars of tomorrow. It will be a special evening and I congratulate the award winners.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bumrah-set-to-receive-polly-umrigar-award--bcci-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bumrah-set-to-receive-polly-umrigar-award--bcci.html
172,12-1-20,Momota vs Axelsen in final,"World number one Kento Momota is through to the Malaysia Masters final after defeating homegrown hopeful Lee Zii Jia 21-10, 21-19 on Saturday.

Momota will face Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen, who was equally impressive in his 21-14, 21-18 win over Hong Kong’s Angus Ng Kah Long.

“It is a good start for the new year,” the Japanese star told reporters after the match.

“My opponent played well with a home ground advantage.”

Lee conceded Momota’s superior form and even claimed the reigning world champion was only playing at half capacity in the 43-minute win.

“I noticed he wasn’t as serious about the match. He was clearly just out to enjoy himself,” Lee said.

But Momota seemed clinical from start to finish, using deceptive shots and ferocious speed to keep the Malaysian flat-footed.

Momota is widely expected to clinch Gold at home in July’s Tokyo Olympics. He missed out on the Rio Olympics four years ago due to a gambling suspension.

The 25-year-old had a stellar 2019 with 11 titles, the most ever by a male player in a badminton season.

Axelsen said he was delighted to make his first final in nearly a year.

173,12-1-20,Ibrahimovic arrives in Italy,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked the first start of his return to AC Milan by scoring in a 2-0 league win over Cagliari on Saturday.

The 38-year-old Swede had come on as a substitute in AC Milan’s goalless draw against Sampdoria last weekend, days after his return to Italy.

Ibrahimovic met a cross Theo Hernandez after 64 minutes in Sardinia with a low-first time shot into the far corner. It was his first Milan goal since leaving the club for Paris Saint-Germain eight years ago.

Portuguese forward Leao, 20, had struck the opener just after the break as Milan got their first win in just over a month.

AC Milan move up to eighth in the Serie A table, 10 points off the Champions League berths.

It was a disappointing performance for Cagliari as the Sardinians unveiled the new jersey to mark the 100th anniversary of the club this year.

Cagliari remain sixth after their fourth consecutive defeat.

Ibrahimovic started up front alongside Leao, who had described the towering Swede “as a big brother” during the week.

Cagliari goalkeeper Robin Olsen denied Ibrahimovic’s stopped header after half an hour with Milan counterpart Gianluigi Donnarumma avoided an embarrassing goalkeeping blunder before the break.

With the Italy international off his line, Cagliari’s Uruguayan midfielder Nahitan Nandez hit a lob but Donnarumma raced back to clear.

After the break Leao latched on to a Samuel Castillejo free kick with his shot taking a deflection over Olsen.

Ibrahimovic sealed victory for his first goal in the Milan jersey since May 2012, and 57th for the club.

He headed in a second past Olsen with eight minutes to go but the goal was disallowed as offside.

174,12-1-20,Madrid derby in Super Cup final,"The coaches of the two big Madrid clubs, talking on Saturday in Jeddah ahead of the Spanish Super Cup final, said they are still learning and growing.

Zinedine Zidane, who returned to Real last season, told a press conference for today’s match that he considers himself a “better” coach than he was during his first term on the club’s bench from 2016 to 2018.

Atletico coach Diego Simeone, who spoke later, agreed.

“Of course, you get better with the years,” said the Argentine, in his ninth season as Atletico coach.

“All these accumulated experiences, if you learn from them, you get better in life. I think I’ve progressed in life as well as in football, and I think that’s linked.”

Zidane also linked growth as a coach to growth as a person.

“I listen a lot, because the people around me are really worthwhile. That’s why I’m making a lot of progress as a coach, as a person, and that’s always been my goal,” he said.

Zidane won three straight Champions League titles in his first spell in charge at the Bernabeu yet he feels he has improved at his job.

“I consider myself better, I feel good, I feel I’m progressing,” the French coach said. “We learn from every situation, from people.”

He returned in March with Real struggling and has revived their form.

“The team hasn’t changed much,” he said. “But I have.”

Atletico overhauled their squad last summer and according to Simeone are in a “transitional year”.

He also said their display, as they scored twice in the last nine minutes to beat Barcelona 3-2 in the semifinal on Thursday, showed that “some youngsters have arrived.”

“You can see that they want to improve, and that gives me immense hope,” he said.

“My energy is my footballers. When I see that my players are good, I’m not afraid of anything.”

Facing an opponent like Real “helps us and makes us better,” he said, praising Zidane as “a coach who wins everything, who conveys that feeling that you have to win.”

Zidane said matches like today’s final were the most important to Real “because there’s a trophy at stake.”

“That’s what we’ve prepared for,” he said. “That’s the law of this club.”

Both men were asked about Ernesto Valverde, who has taken Barcelona back to the top of La Liga but who flew back to Spain after the loss to Atletico with his job reportedly once more under threat.

“For me, Valverde is a huge coach,” said Simeone. “He’s proved over the last few years that he has the ability to lead that club.”

Zidane was more circumspect. “What is happening to Valverde happens to all of us coaches. And that’s never going to change,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/madrid-derby-in-super-cup-final.html
175,12-1-20,Serena aims for double success,"Serena Williams delivered a masterclass in her semi-final at the WTA Auckland Classic on Saturday, needing only 43 minutes to down rising star Amanda Anisimova and set up a showdown against Jessica Pegula.

The unsung and unseeded Pegula stunned Caroline Wozniacki in a three-set semi-final 3-6, 6-4, 6-0.

Top-seed Williams, at her imperious best, rapidly eliminated third-seed Anisimova 6-1, 6-1.

It highlighted the gulf between the 38-year-old, the women’s tennis figurehead for the past two decades, and the next generation of players led by the 18-year-old Anisimova.

“I was definitely in the zone today. I knew I was playing a really great player and an even better person and I knew I had to come out serious,” Williams said.

“It feels really good. I’ve been working hard for a couple of years, I tend to be really hard on myself but considering everything, I'm doing pretty good.”

Former World number one Wozniacki, who has announced she will retire after the Australian Open, arrived at her penultimate tournament determined to win in Auckland at her seventh attempt to add to her 30 WTA titles.

Instead, it was the 25-year-old Pegula, the world 82nd-ranked player who won her only WTA title at the Washington Open last year, who came out on top.

“I didn’t expect the first set to be so easy so I knew the second set would be so much tougher,” said Alexandrova, who is poised for the top 30 in the world.

“In the second set I think she played well but after I got the break to make it 4-4, she got a bit nervous.

178,12-1-20,"I am also back in picture, says Dhawan","“I am also back in the picture,” India opener Shikhar Dhawan said after his fluent fifty in the third T20I against Sri Lanka and insisted that zeroing in on the second opener is the team management’s “headache”.

With Dhawan back in form in the shortest format, the Indian team management and captain Virat Kohli will have the headache of picking from three in-form openers — K L Rahul and Rohit Sharma being the other two.

Asked about the race for the opener’s slot, Dhawan said, “All the three players (Rohit, KL and me) are doing well. Rohit had an excellent 2019. Rahul has been doing well since 1-2 months and he is a good player and ‘mei bhi picture mei aagya hu, maine bhi aaj acha kar diya hai’ (And I have also entered the fray and have done well today).

“Toh picture achihi ban rahi hai abhi (the picture is looking good), khair yeh sardaredi meri nahi hai (but this is not my headache). So I don’t think about it, because that thing is not in my hands. What is in my hands is to perform and play well.

“I am happy and satisfied that I got two opportunities and was able to express myself. Baki coaches aur captain ke upar hai, toh unki sardadi mei kyun lu? (Rest is on the coaches and the captain, then why should I take their headache),” Dhawan told reporters in the post match conference.

The swash-buckling Delhi batsman, however, feels being a left-hander augurs well for him.

“Absolutely, that (left-hander) is advantage because it disturbs bowlers’ line and length and it has its own impact,” he said.

Shikhar also says that India are seeking complete mastery over defending totals, the ambition prompting them to make a “conscious” decision to bat first on winning the toss in a T20 World Cup year.

He said that as a unit, the team wanted to bat first.

“Today we wanted to bat first because we want to refine ourselves more while batting first and winning more games, so that brings more confidence,” the opener said.

“So that is why, consciously, we are doing it and the result is in front of you that we are winning even while batting first.

“We are making (setting) big targets and that brings a lot of confidence to us as a team.”

He also lavished praise on fast bowler Shardul Thakur for his batting skills.

“Yes, he (Shardul) is bowling well and the way be batted (on Friday) was amazing. The shots he played was tremendous and I feel he is becoming more into an all-rounder, especially in shorter formats.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-am-also-back-in-picture--says-dhawan.html
179,12-1-20,Hope Test cricket continues for as much time as possible: Pujara,"Acknowledging T20 cricket's growing popularity, Cheteshwar Pujara is hoping that the traditional Test format, in which he thrives with his workmanlike approach, will continue to exist.

""Times are changing and white-ball cricket has become popular. But Test cricket is always special and it will always remain special. And let us hope it continues for as much time as possible,"" Pujara was quoted as saying in 'ESPNcricinfo'.

The ICC recently contemplated making Test cricket a four-day affair from 2023 but the idea has been met with vehement opposition from some of the game's greats such as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.

Pujara said his 50th first-class century will boost his confidence ahead of India's upcoming Test tour of New Zealand, where he will need to ""trust"" his game.

The two-match series assumes significance as a win there will leave India within touching distance of making the 2021 final of the ongoing inaugural World Test Championship.

On Saturday, Pujara joined a select group of cricketing greats by reaching the landmark ton during Saurashtra's Ranji Trophy Group B match against Karnataka here.

""If you achieve such a thing before such tours, you feel confident and you start trusting your game again.""

""That is because when you are going abroad and you are playing in challenging conditions, you need to trust your game, trust your preparation.""

With his 50th first-class century, Pujara joined nine Indians led by Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid.

""It is the right time actually - we are going to New Zealand soon so it is good for the preparation. Whenever you score runs, you are high on confidence and you also get back your rhythm.""

The 31-year-old Pujara, who has 18 Test centuries to his credit, is fourth on the list of active players with most first-class centuries behind England's Alastair Cook (65), South African Hashim Amla (52) and India's domestic cricket giant Wasim Jaffer (57).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hope-test-cricket-continues-for-as-much-time-as-possible--pujara-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hope-test-cricket-continues-for-as-much-time-as-possible--pujara.html
180,12-1-20,One more illegal high rise demolished in Kochi,"One more illegal lakeside apartment complex here was demolished on Sunday using controlled implosion method, complying with a Supreme Court order.

The 55-meter high Jain Coral Cove, built in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone norms in Maradu Municipality, was brought down at around 11.03 am with the area in a 200 metre radius kept out of bounds for people and all kinds of traffic.

In a precise sequence, the over 350 kgs of explosives filled in the structures were blasted in a controlled manner at the end of the third warning siren and the concrete colossus came crumbling down in seconds, triggering mammoth 'clouds' of dust.

Just in a few seconds, the towering building, whose interior walls had been removed in pre-demolition work over the past weeks leaving it a concrete shell, became mounds of debris.

The stunning spectacle was witnessed by a large number of people who perched themselves on top of houses and other buildings in vantage points just outside the 200m radius evacuation zone even as police and district officials kept a vigil.

Residents in the neighbourhood moved out and Section 144 of CrPC come into force at 8 am in the evacuation zone ahead of the demolition to ensure there was no untoward incident.

With this, three of the four luxury complexes ordered to be demolished by the apex court for CRZ violations have been razed down.

""It was a perfect implosion. Not a single debris have fallen in the lake,"" Ernakulam District Collector S Suhas said after visiting the site along with city police commissioner Vijay Sakhare after the demolition.

Sakhare said the operation was executed as planned.

""It was an absolute success. No damage has happened to the building adjacent to the demolished one. And no harm to any human life or any animal life. No properties in adjoning area damaged,"" the police officer said.

Another building of the same height will be demolished at 2 pm, marking the completion of implementation of the court order passed last year.

On Saturday, two complexes -- H2O Holy Faith and the twin towers of Alfa Serene -- abutting the bakwaters were destroyed in the similar implosion method in which explosives filled in the structures blasted in a controlled manner.

Mumbai-baed Edifices Engineering carried out the explosion with the assistance of experts from South Africa-based Jet Demolition.

A total of 343 waterfront flats were built in the complexes, violating the Coastal Regulation Zone norms.

The Supreme Court had in September 2019 directed demolition of the apartment complexes within 138 days after the Kerala government submitted the time line for carrying out the operation.

The owners of the flats, for whom the apex court had ordered an interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh, had vacated the premises in October first week after a last ditch protest to prevent the demolition ended in vain.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/one-more-illegal-high-rise-demolished-in-kochi-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/one-more-illegal-high-rise-demolished-in-kochi.html

The incident happened on Saturday night after the Mumbai-bound flight carrying 114 passengers took off at 9.57 pm from the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, they said.

A few minutes after it took off from the airport, the woman passenger on board allegedly gave a note to one of the cabin crew, asking it to be delivered to the pilot. The note said there were bombs strapped to her body and she would detonate it any moment, an airport official said.

Following this, the pilot informed the air traffic controller (ATC) which directed him to return to the city airport, he said.

The prime minister said that he was pained to see that the poor in the state were not getting benefits of the Centre's welfare schemes.

""Eight crore farmers across the country are getting benefited (due to the central schemes). But there will always be pain in my heart (about the schemes not being implemented in Bengal).

""I will always pray to god for the welfare of farmers and poor patients. May God give them (Bengal government) good sense.... However, I have a feeling that the people of West Bengal will not remain deprived of central schemes for long,"" he said.

During the 2019 general elections, Modi had consistently attacked Banerjee, accusing her of running a ""syndicate raj"" in the state. The BJP tally rose from two to 18 in West Bengal which has 42 Lok Sabha seats, while the ruling Trinamool Congress won 22 seats, down from 34 in 2014.

The prime minister on Sunday also rechristened Kolkata Port Trust after Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee.

The chief minister, who was scheduled to attend the port trust programme, was conspicuous by her absence. None of the Trinamool Congress ministers were also present at the event.

Banerjee, one of the most bitter critics of the prime minister, met him at Raj Bhavan on Saturday, after deciding not to receive him at the airport, and was seated with him later at an event at Millennium Park.

Modi had arrived here amid protests by students and other groups against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population register exercise.

""I told him that we are against CAA, NRC and NPR. I told him there should be no discrimination among masses and no citizens are left out and tortured,"" the chief minister had told reporters after meeting Modi at Raj Bhavan.

Moments later, she was present at an anti-CAA protest nearby. Banerjee, who called her meeting with Modi a ""courtesy visit"", said the prime minister had asked her to come to New Delhi to discuss the vexatious issues.

Banerjee, however, skipped the inauguration of renovated heritage Currency Building, founded in 1833, by the prime minister.

On Sunday, Modi said his government at the Centre was making every possible effort to develop Bengal especially its poor, underprivileged and exploited sections.

He also inaugurated and laid foundation of infrastructure projects for the expansion and modernisation of the Kolkata Port.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tmc-govt-not-implementing-central-schemes-as-there-is--no-cut-money---says-pm-as-mamata-skips-event-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tmc-govt-not-implementing-central-schemes-as-there-is--no-cut-money---says-pm-as-mamata-skips-event.html
187,12-1-20,Women's World T20: Rookie batswoman Richa only new face in Harmanpreet-led squad,"Bengal's rookie batswoman Richa Ghosh was the only new face in a 15-member Harmanpreet Kaur-led India squad for the ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia, starting February 21.

The team, announced on Sunday, has no other surprises.

15-year-old Haryana schoolgirl Shafali Verma will be playing her first global meet following some good performances at the international level in her first season.

Richa has been rewarded for her exploits in the recent women's Challenger Trophy, scoring 36 off 26 balls in one of the games with four boundaries and a six.

""See, in the past one year, we have taken five to six debutants. Earlier, the same team used to play but after 2017 ODI World Cup, a lot of new prospects have emerged. We feel we have nurtured five or six new players, who are playing now.

""Richa Ghosh is a new player and here the role of selectors increases,"" chairman of women's selection committee Hemlatha Kala told reporters at the press conference.

The selectors also announced a 16-member squad for a tri-series in Australia prior to the T20 World Cup, with Nuzhat Parveen being added as the 16th member. That tournament starts on January 31 and also features England.

Skipper Harmanpreet feels that playing the tri-series before the big event will be advantageous for the team.

""Before the World Cup, this series is going to be a big one for us and we will look for our best combination and with that we will give chances to newcomer also.

""As (Hemlata) ma'am mentioned, we have Richa, who did well in the Challenger Trophy and domestic cricket, so we will stick to our best XI. Before the World Cup, we will be able to decide our best XI,"" Harmanpreet said.

Harmanpreet has had the experience of playing in the Women's Big Bash League and that will help her plan better.

""I think that experience will definitely help and we know how the wickets are over there and that definitely give us extra boost (over) there,"" said the skipper, who has played for Sydney Thunders in WBBL.

She also agreed that spinners have been India's strength in bowling and it wouldn't change much on the bouncy Australian tracks.

""We are looking for more spinners in our side and we have got that. Now the only thing is how we are going to use their strengths. They are very good and always give us breakthroughs.

""Our strength is spin and we have to stick to that and whenever we need them they will perform for us,"" Harmanpreet exuded confidence.

She is well aware that 2019 didn't start off well for them but they picked up the pieces by the end of the year.

""See, it is always about how you execute yourself. We did not execute on what we were expecting from ourselves (in the first half in 2019). But against South Africa and West Indies, we played to our potential and that is the reason we were able to get positive result,"" she said.

The presence of coach W V Raman and his tactical acumen has also helped the team.

""He is a very experienced cricketer and now he is coaching us. He is someone who always helps us on how to calm ourselves in pressure situations and help each other and he is doing a good job for us and we are happy to have him in the side. His experience will help in the World Cup.""

189,12-1-20,CAA made world aware of religious persecution in Pak: Modi,"Strongly defending the new citizenship law, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday the dispute that has arisen over it has made the world aware of persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan.

He, however, deplored that a section of the youth is being ""misguided"" over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is aimed at giving and not taking away anybody's citizenship rights.

""CAA is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship. Today, on National Youth Day, I would like to tell this to the youngsters of India, West Bengal, North East that this is not an overnight law for giving citizenship.

""We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There's no problem in that,"" he told a gathering at Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramkrishna Mission.

Modi said even Mahatma Gandhi had favoured Indian citizenship to those fleeing religious persecution and that his government has only delivered on the wishes of the freedom fighters.

Referring to anti-CAA protests in the North-East, Modi vowed to protect the distinct identity and culture of the people of the region, and asserted the new law will not hurt their interests.

""We've only done what Mahatma Gandhi had said decades ago. Should we send these refugees back to die? Are they our responsibility or not? Should we make them our citizens or not?"" he said, evoking a thunderous applause by the gathering.

Modi said some people with political interests are deliberately spreading rumours about the new citizenship law, despite ""complete clarity"" over the CAA.

""Our initiative to amend the citizenship act has created a dispute. It is the result of our initiative that Pakistan will now have to answer why they have been persecuting minorities for the last 70 years. Human rights have been demolished in Pakistan,"" he said.

Seeking to assuage the concerns of the people of the North-East, Modi called the region ""our pride"". ""Their culture, traditions and demography remains untouched by this amended law,"" he said.

He said the citizenship law was only ""changed a little"" for those who were ill-treated in Pakisan after Partition.

""They were having a bitter time living there. Women were in danger of losing their pride,"" he said.

""Young people have understood the whole thing but those who want to indulge in politics over it will not,"" he said.

Modi said five years ago, there was disappointment among the youth of the country, but the situation has changed now.

""Not just India, the entire world has a lot of expectations from the youth of the country. The youth are not afraid of challenges....They challenge the challenges,"" he said at the Belur Math, the abode of Swami Vivekananda for several years until his death in 1902, aged 39 years.

Modi, an ardent devotee of Vivekananda, spent the night at the Math.

He has a long association with the Ramkrishna Mission order founded by Vivekananda in 1897. Inspired by the teachings of Vivekananda, Modi had arrived at the Mission Ashram in Gujarat's Rajkot and expressed desire to join the order.

Swami Atmasthananda, who later went on to become the 15th president of the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, then headed the Rajkot branch and had advised him that sanyas was not for him and that he should work among people.

During those days, Modi used to regularly meet Atmasthananda and sought his spiritual guidance.

Although Modi went back after spending some time there his the relationship with Swami Atmasthananda and the Ramkrishna Mission continued.

Whenever Modi used to visit Kolkata, even during his days as Gujarat chief minister, he would travel to the Math.

In 2013, during his Kolkata visit, he had gone to Belur and sought the blessings from Atmasthananda.

He had in 2015 called on ailing Swami Atmasthananda at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, a hospital run by the Mission in south Kolkata and enquired about his health.

After Atmasthananda's death in 2017, Prime Minister Modi had termed it as a ""personal loss"".

On Sunday, the prime minister paid tributes to Swami Vivekananda on his birth anniversary, which is celebrated as the National Youth Day, and spent some time in the spiritual leader's room in quietude.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/youth-being-misguided-on-citizenship-amendment-act--pm-modi-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/caa-made-world-aware-of-religious-persecution-in-pak--modi.html
190,12-1-20,Wrong to boycott Deepika or her film: Sanjay Raut,"Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday came out in support of actor Deepika Padukone, who is facing flak from the BJP and some other quarters over her visit to the JNU campus in Delhi to express solidarity with students who were recently attacked by armed assailants.

Raut, who is a Rajya Sabha member and the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', said the country cannot be run in a ""Talibani"" style.

After Padukone's visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday, many appreciated her ""silent solidarity"", but some others criticised her for ""supporting Leftists"", saying it was a promotional stunt for her latest film ""Chhapaak"".

Some also demanded a boycott of her film, based on the life of an acid attack survivor, played by Padukone.

A section of BJP leaders also criticised the 34-year- old actor over her JNU visit.

Talking to PTI, Raut said, ""The demand for boycott of the actress and her film is wrong. The country cannot be run in a 'Talibani' style.""

""Chhapaak"", directed by Meghna Gulzar, hit the theatres on Friday.

The Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on Thursday declared the film tax-free in the two states.

Declaring a movie tax-free means the state has waived the entertainment levy imposed on it, thereby bringing down the ticket rates and encouraging more people to watch it.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wrong-to-boycott-deepika-or-her-film--sanjay-raut-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/wrong-to-boycott-deepika-or-her-film--sanjay-raut.html

According to the recently released NCRB data, 32,608 cases were reported in 2017 while 39,827 cases were reported in 2018 under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).

POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. It requires special treatment of cases relating to child sexual abuse such as setting-up of special courts, special prosecutors, and support persons for child victims.

As many as 21,605 child rapes were recorded in 2018 which included 21,401 rapes of girls and 204 of boys, the data showed.

In 2017, 1,29,032 cases of crime against children were recorded.

Priti Mahara, Director of Policy Research and Advocacy at CRY – Child Rights and You (CRY) said, that while on the one hand, the increasing numbers of crimes against children are extremely alarming, it also suggests an increasing trend in reporting which is a positive sign as it reflects people's faith in the system.

""It also provides a direction in which government interventions must be made and evidence needs to be created. While some major efforts have been taken to ensure child protection, a lot more is needed to see expected results on the ground,"" Mahara said.

In percentage terms, major crime against children during 2018 were kidnapping and abduction which accounted for 44.2 per cent followed by cases under POCSO, which accounted for 34.7 per cent, the data showed.

As many as 781 cases of use of child for pornography or storing child pornography material was also recorded in 2018, more than double that of 2017 when 331 such cases were recorded, the data showed.

The state-wise segregation of crimes against children reveals Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar accounted for 51 per cent of all crimes in the country, the data said.

While Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 19,936 recorded crimes against children (14 per cent of total crimes), Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are the close second and third with 18,992 and 18,892 crimes registered respectively.

The report also showed that cases of sexual harassment in shelter homes against women and children reportedly increased by 30 per cent, from 544 cases recorded in 2017 to 707 cases in 2018.

Mahara suggested that financial investments must be adequately increased with a focus on prevention of crimes against children and the identification of vulnerable children and families.

""Strengthening community level child protection system is also a key to prevention. While there is growing evidence of the precarious lives that children in India are leading, it is essential that this evidence is used to effectively inform policy and programme initiatives,"" she said.

As many as 501 incidences were also recorded under The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, a 26 per cent jump from 2017 when 395 cases were reported under the Act.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/109-children-sexually-abused-every-day-in-india-in-2018-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/109-children-sexually-abused-every-day-in-india-in-2018.html

The ski-jump is the upwardly curved ramp on the deck of aircraft carriers designed to provide sufficient take-off lift for fighter jets.

""The naval version of Tejas achieved another important milestone today by successfully undertaking the maiden ski-jump take-off from INS Vikramaditya,"" a Navy Spokesperson said.

On Saturday, the aircraft made its first landing on the deck of INS Vikramaditya which was also a major milestone.

Both the landing and take off by the aircraft put India among a select group of nations having the capability to design such a jet which can operate from an aircraft carrier.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is involved in development of the naval variant of Tejas along with Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), Aircraft Research and Design Centre of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC) and CSIR among others.

""This landmark event demonstrates professional commitment and synergy between various agencies ADA, HAL, CEMILAC and Indian Navy in harnessing the potential of our scientists, engineers and naval flight testing community towards meeting the expectations of the nation,"" the Indian Navy tweeted.

After Saturday's successful landing of the aircraft on INS Vikramaditya, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called it a ""great event"" in the history of Indian fighter aircraft development programme.

195,12-1-20,This is how reality should be shown,"CHHAPAAK

*ing: Deepika Padukone, Vikrant Massey

Rated: 8.5/10

Powerful, sensitive and grounded, that’s Meghna Gulzar’s highly emotive and simple true story on acid violence victims, Chhapaak. To do a full length feature on a subject from which you intrinsically turn your eyes and mind away, to go 70mm with seared disfigured skin and to put on screen the glamour girl to portray the life and times of Laxmi, an acid victim who spent a lifetime fighting for a face not just over her neck but also in courtrooms and campaigns for the 152 recorded victims so far, means that the director and producer had both courage and conviction in equal measure.

Chhapaak does not wrench your guts but it does make you feel deeply for these unsung victims of the most cruel violence that can be unleashed on young girls and with not even half the focus of the media on them unlike rape cases which have churned both anger, protests and national movements from time to time.

Deepika Padukone, who helms the film, comes out as a powerful actor despite being a big star and she shows simple gumption and un-fussed determination to step into the skin of Laxmi, howsoever disfigured it may have become due to the attack of a spurned suitor.

Meghna takes you through the struggles of the acid victim with equal absence of fuss and that’s what makes this film powerful and sensitive, not to mention a trigger for deep introspection on our outdated and dogged laws which, as the lawyer says on screen, “can ban the sale of eggs in UP but not the sale of acid” which is the cheapest, most easily available tool to ruin the lives of so many young girls.

It’s films like Chhapaak that forgive Bollywood for all the song and dance it generally serenades in. It is films like these that may be rare but show the acumen of an industry which has scant time for anything meaningful, least of all meaningful cinema.

Padukone as the producer has treaded in front of the camera without even once playing to the gallery, with either needless songs or melodrama that a subject like this is often clothed in and succumbs to.

The Chhapaak title song is wonderfully worded, sung and composed, and it signifies the goodness of such weighty cinema.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/this-is-how-reality-should-be-shown-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/this-is-how-reality-should-be-shown.html
196,12-1-20,‘I try to upgrade myself and my craft’,"Known for playing varied roles, Shivin Narang speaks with Chanchal Goyal about his career trajectory, love for Delhi’s food and upcoming projects

What is your role in Beyhadh 2?

I play Rudra Roy, a businessman. He is family oriented. The character is intense and full of different emotions. He is a man of his words. He is hurt and holds a lot of grudges against his father.

Do you share any similarities with your character?

Yes. One thing in common is that we both are family oriented. Just like my character, I too value all my relationships.

How did acting happen to you?

I was always fond of Bollywood movies but never thought of trying my hands on acting.

After some years, I decided to give it a chance. I got a portfolio done and posted my pictures on Facebook. A modeling agency saw those pictures and called me for some assignments. After that, I got an audition call for my first show — Suvreen Guggal — Topper of the year. Initially I thought it was a fake call, but then I thought to give it a try and shifted to Mumbai. Fortunately, stars were in my favour, I cleared the audition and was signed for the show.

Did your family support you in your decision?

Yes, they did. In fact when I broke the news to my mother, she broke into tear. It was surreal for her.

What all preparations did you do for acting?

I started working on my craft, learnt new skills and worked hard. Initially when you get into acting, you crave for fame, but after that the actual process begins you start working upon yourself to deliver your best.

I would give the credit to my parents for convincing me to do the hit show — Veer ki Ardaas: Veera on Star plus. I was initially reluctant to do that show as it was a family drama and I wanted to do more youth oriented shows.

It made me believe that listening to your parents not only helps you in personal life but also helps you to succeed professionally.

If not an actor, what else would you have been?

I was always into sports. I am a National level shooter. If not an actor, I would be definitely doing something related to sports.

What do you miss about Delhi?

I miss Delhi’s food, especially chhole bhature. Mumbai has its own flavour, but Delhi food holds a special place in my heart.

Apart from acting what else keeps you busy?

When I am not working, I watch movies. Recently, I tried my hands in Gymnastics. I try to learn skills which help me in upgrading myself and my craft.

How has your journey been so far in the TV industry?

It is going to be eight years now. It was interesting. Full of highs and lows. I have evolved as an actor and as a human being. I am fortunate enough to have met some great souls. My journey gives me a feeling of contentment and I thrive to work upon myself and improve every day.

What all challenges did you face?

Challenges are there in everything that we do. But God has been kind to me. I was fortunate to work with some great people.

I had to take a year sabbatical when why father was not keeping well back in 2017. I was with him for his medical treatment and did no work. It was a tough time for me, but I came out strong. Now everything is back on track and I am doing well both in professional and personal life.

What kept you going?

I can’t explain that feeling in words, but when you are passionate about something and have your emotions attached to it, it gives you the power to keep going.

What are your upcoming projects?

I have recently finished shooting for Khatron ke Khiladi 10 (KKK 10) in Bulgaria. The show will air in February. I shot a movie for a digital platform. It will release soon. The plot is set on the backdrop of 1983, the story is unconventional and I will be seen in a different avatar.

What made you say yes to KKK 10?

I have turned down the offer many times. But the team kept approaching me every year. This year round, when I got the offer, I thought of giving it a try. That’s how I landed in the show.

Also I like to challenge myself and come out of my comfort zone and this was the best opportunity. Initially I was scared but then I convinced myself to face my fears.

A lesson that you took back home from the show?

I have become more confident. I have learnt to face my fears and prepared myself to take up new projects.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-try-to-upgrade-myself-and-my-craft----2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-try-to-upgrade-myself-and-my-craft---.html
197,12-1-20,Loneliness as dangerous as smoking or obesity: Study,"Loneliness rivals smoking and obesity in its impact on shortening longevity and has become a public health concern, especially for the older adults, say researchers.

With older adults increasingly moving into senior living or retirement communities, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine sought to identify the common characteristics of residents who feel lonely in these environments.

The new study, published in the journal 'Aging and Mental Health', found that people's experience of living with loneliness is shaped by a number of personal and environmental factors.

Age-associated losses and inadequate social skills were considered primary risk factors for loneliness.

""Some residents talked about the loss of spouses, siblings and friends as the cause of their loneliness. Others mentioned how making new friends in a senior community cannot replace deceased friends they grew up with,"" said Alejandra Paredes, a research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at University of California San Diego School of Medicine.

The feeling of loneliness was frequently associated with a lack of purpose in life.

Others expressed a sense of ""not being attached, not having very much meaning and not feeling very hopeful"" or ""being lost and not having control"".

The research team also found that wisdom, including compassion, seemed to be a factor that prevented loneliness.

Other protective factors were acceptance of aging and comfort with being alone.

To reach this conclusion, researchers conducted individual interviews of 30 adults of ages 67-92, part of an overall study evaluating the physical, mental and cognitive functions of 100 older adults living in the independent living sector of a senior housing community in San Diego.

""It is important that we identify the underlying causes of loneliness from the seniors' own perspectives so we can help resolve it and improve the overall health, well-being and longevity of our aging population,"" suggested senior author Dilip V.

""This was a terrible tragedy,"" the senior administration official said, adding that ""ultimately, Iran made an awful mistake.""

200,12-1-20,UK ambassador to Iran arrested: British govt,"Iranian authorities briefly detained Britain's ambassador in Tehran on Saturday, according to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, after he was reportedly arrested during protests against the regime.

The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,"" Raab said in a statement after the detention of Rob Macaire.

He minister warned Iran that it was ""at a cross-roads moment"", and had to choose between ""its march towards pariah status"" or ""take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards.""

Caire was arrested for allegedly ""inciting"" protesters in Tehran angry at the military's accidental downing of a Ukranian passenger jet, killing 176 people, most of them Iranian citizens, according to the Daily Mail.

He was released after around an hour, it added.

President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found ""missiles fired due to human error"" brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an ""unforgivable mistake"".

The admission was an ""important first step"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier Saturday.

""We will do everything we can to support the families of the four British victims and ensure they get the answers and closure they deserve,"" he said in a statement issued by his Downing Street office.

Johnson added that Britain would work closely with Canada, Ukraine and other international partners to ensure ""a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died.""

""This tragic accident only reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region,"" he said.

""It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-ambassador-to-iran-arrested--british-govt-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-ambassador-to-iran-arrested--british-govt.html
201,12-1-20,Trump warns Iran against 'massacre' as protests erupt over jetliner downing,"US President Donald Trump has said that the United States was monitoring Iranian demonstrations closely, warning against any new ""massacre"" as protests broke out after Tehran admitted to shooting down a passenger plane.

Iran said earlier it unintentionally downed a Ukrainian jetliner outside Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard, in an abrupt about-turn after initially denying Western claims it was struck by a missile. The firing came shortly after Iran launched missiles at bases in Iraq housing American forces.

President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found ""missiles fired due to human error"" brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an ""unforgivable mistake.""

At a student protest to pay tribute to the crash victims on Saturday, Iranian authorities briefly detained Britain's ambassador, in what the British government called a violation of international law. He was later released.

Trump told Iranians -- in tweets in both English and Farsi -- that he stands by them and is monitoring the demonstrations.

""To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you,"" he tweeted.

""There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching,"" he added, apparently referring to an Iranian crackdown on street protests that broke out in November.

""We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage,"" he said.

The new demonstrations follow an Iranian crackdown on street protests that broke out in November. Amnesty International has said it left more than 300 people dead.

Internet access was reportedly cut off in multiple Iranian provinces ahead of memorials planned a month after the protests.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has demanded that Iran provide ""full clarity"" on the downing of the plane. Ottawa says the dead included 57 Canadians.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also offered his condolences and ordered the armed forces to address ""shortcomings"" so that such a disaster does not happen again.

Tehran's acknowledgement came after officials in Iran denied for days Western claims that the Ukraine International Airlines plane had been struck by a missile in a catastrophic error.

The Kiev-bound jet slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Wednesday.

The crash came hours after Tehran launched missiles at bases hosting American forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.

Fears grew of an all-out war between Iran and its arch-enemy the United States, but those concerns have subsided after Trump said Tehran appeared to be standing down after targeting the US bases.

On Saturday evening, police dispersed students who had converged on Amir Kabir University in Tehran to pay tribute to the victims, after some among the hundreds gathered shouted ""destructive"" slogans, Fars news agency said.

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said UK envoy Rob Macaire had been detained.

""The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,"" Raab said in a statement. The US called on Iran to apologize.

Iran's Tasnim News Agency, which is close to the country's conservatives, said the envoy had been ""provoking radical acts"" among students. He was released a few hours later and would be summoned again by Iranian officials on Sunday, it said.

State television reported that students shouted ""anti-regime"" chants, while Fars reported that posters of Soleimani had been torn down.

The aerospace commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility for Wednesday's accident.

But Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said the missile operator acted independently, targeting the 737 after mistaking it for a ""cruise missile"".

The operator failed to obtain approval from his superiors because of disruptions to a communications system, he said.

""He had 10 seconds to decide. He could have decided to strike or not to strike and under such circumstances, he took the wrong decision.""

Iran had been under mounting international pressure to allow a ""credible"" investigation after video emerged appearing to show the moment the airliner was hit.

In footage that the New York Times said it had verified, a fast-moving object is seen rising into the sky before a bright flash appears. Several seconds later, an explosion is heard.

Iran's military said it had been at the highest level of alert after American ""threats"" and that the plane had turned and come close to a ""sensitive"" military site before it was targeted due to ""human error.""

Rouhani said Iran had been on alert for possible US attacks after Soleimani's ""martyrdom."" Rouhani added he had ordered ""all relevant bodies to take all necessary actions (to ensure) compensation"" to the families of those killed.

The majority of passengers on Flight PS752 were Iranians and Canadians, including dual nationals, while Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes were also aboard.

Rouhani told his Ukrainian counterpart Saturday that ""all the persons involved in this air disaster will be brought to justice,"" Ukraine's presidency said.

This is Iran's worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-warns-iran-against--massacre--as-protests-erupt-over-jetliner-downing-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-warns-iran-against--massacre--as-protests-erupt-over-jetliner-downing.html
202,12-1-20,Nine-judge SC bench to hear issue of women's entry in Sabarimala temple from Jan 13,"A nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court is scheduled to commence on Monday hearing a batch of pleas on the issue of allowing women of all ages to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple, along with other contentious issues of alleged discrimination against Muslim and Parsi women.

The nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde will hear a batch of 60 petitions.

The other judges on the bench are Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S A Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant.

The nine-judge bench has been set up after a five-judge bench headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi, by a 3:2 majority verdict, referred the matter to a larger bench while examining the review petition filed against the historic September 28, 2018 judgement which had allowed women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala temple.

Besides Justice Gogoi, Justices A M Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra (the lone woman judge on the bench) were in majority while Justices R F Nariman and D Y Chandrachud had penned down a minority verdict on November 14, 2019.

Of the nine-judge bench, which will hear the matter from Monday, there is no judge from the previous bench.

The top court had on January 6 issued a notice informing about listing of the batch of petitions seeking review of the 2018 judgement.

While referring the matter to a larger bench, the five-judge bench had however said that the debate about the constitutional validity of religious practices like bar on entry of women and girls into a place of worship was not limited to the Sabarimala case.

The top court said such restrictions are there with regard to entry of Muslim women into mosques and 'dargahs' and Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, being barred from the holy fire place of an Agyari.

It said it was time for the apex court to evolve a judicial policy to do ""substantial and complete justice"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nine-judge-sc-bench-to-hear-issue-of-women-s-entry-in-sabarimala-temple-from-jan-13-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nine-judge-sc-bench-to-hear-issue-of-women-s-entry-in-sabarimala-temple-from-jan-13.html
203,12-1-20,Scrap CAA: Didi to Modi,"Mamata terms meeting as courtesy call on PM

Amid allegations of “sabotage” and “meek surrender” levelled by the Congress and the Left Front, TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon after the PM landed in Kolkata and requested him to withdraw the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA.

While protests, black flags and angry chants of “Modi, go back” greeted Modi as he arrived on a 2-day visit here on Saturday, nicety was not abandoned as Mamata shared dais with him while remaining insistent on annulment of the new citizenship law.

Emerging from the meeting, Mamata defined her confabulation with the Prime Minister as a “courtesy call” during which she squeezed in a couple of pecuniary demands in favour of her State and a request to withdraw the CAA.

The meeting came amid a bitter showdown between the BJP and the TMC — over a host of issues including CAA.

Moments later, Mamata was present at an anti-CAA protest nearby, where she said the PM had asked her to come to New Delhi to discuss the vexatious issues.

In both the cases, the Prime Minister assured her of a future discussion in Delhi, the Chief Minister claimed. “I met the Prime Minister … it is a part of constitutional courtesy… I meet the President too when he comes to Kolkata. In fact, I sent our Minister Firhad Hakim to receive him at the airport. This is protocol. You have to send a Minister-in-waiting.”

While CPI(M) Politburo member Md Salim alleged at a massive protest rally that Didi had gone to show her allegiance to Modi, Mamata vouched for the genuineness of the meeting iterating the courtesy call apart, she has placed a demand of `38,000 crore which is long overdue from the Centre. “He has assured me that he will go through the relevant papers in Delhi,” she said.

The Chief Minister also said, “I told him that though he being the guest of the State it was inappropriate to raise the issue at this point of time …I requested him to withdraw the CAA which is hurting the unity and integrity of India.”

From the dharna podium, Mamata dared the Centre to implement the CAA saying “this will remain in the form of notification as no State will comply with it… and Bengal will be the last State to be a party to this anti-people divisive law.”

She would continue to agitate endlessly “till I am alive” taking along with us the regional parties “until the Act is not taken back… that is my pledge,” Mamata said attacking the Left and the Congress for taking the movement to a violent path.

“Torching buses do not make movements … walking in rallies and raising slogans do,” Mamata said attacking the Left even as Pradesh Congress leader said how the “Chief Minister has knelt down before the BJP lest they set CBI after the TMC leader in Narada and Saradha cases.”

The Prime Minister was on a tight weekend visit of Kolkata when he would take part in a host of inauguration ceremonies including those of the Kolkata Port Trust --- that included the restoration of the iconic colonial structures of the colonial capital of India like Old Currency Building, Metcalfe Hall etc.

Subsequent to her talks with Modi, the Chief Minister retired briefly to the dharna dais at Rani Rashmoni Avenue soon after which she again rejoined the Prime Minister to watch a light and sound show at Millenium Park by the Hooghly which was decked up with flowing lights and laser shows.

Later the Prime Minister took a specially-designed boat and left for Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission across the Hooghly, where he would spend the night instead of Raj Bhavan where he was earlier scheduled to stay.

Meanwhile, the Kolkata was on Saturday inundated by protest rallies right from the entry gates of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport --- where the Prime Minister’s aircraft landed --- to the Royal Kolkata Turf Club grounds, some 25 km down south, where he was flown in by a military chopper apparently to avoid the road blockades on account of ongoing rallies.

Near the Race Course and Esplanade, thousands of people gathered with black flags, banners, festoons and black balloons shouting “go back” slogan for the Prime Minister.

The massive procession broke police barricades and rushed towards the podium where the Chief Minister was staging a sit-in with the Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad members.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/scrap-caa--didi-to-modi-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/scrap-caa--didi-to-modi.html
204,12-1-20,Will reclaim POK if Army is ordered so: Gen Narvane,"‘Forces owe allegiance to Constitution’

In line with the Government’s renewed emphasis on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK), newly-appointed Army chief General Manoj Narvane on Saturday recalled a Parliament resolution in this regard to assert that the Army was ready to carry out the mandate even as he outlined the need for a “rebalancing” act with equal focus on China, not confining to just Pakistan.

Asked about senior Ministers in the present regime talking about taking back POK, Naravane referred to a parliamentary resolution passed in 1994. He said the entire erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir belongs to India. He said if Parliament wishes that “POK be ours, we will act on it”.

The Army Chief mentioned about the threat of two-front war with Pakistan and China and said Siachen is the closet point for “collusion” between those two countries. It is, therefore, important to keep Siachen in India’s possession, he said, adding the Army is rebalancing its weaponry to the northern borders facing China. India dominates all the heights at Siachen, the world’s highest battlefield, which is the wedge between China on the one side and Pakistan on the other.

With his predecessor General Bipin Rawat being criticised for giving “political statements”, the new Army chief sought to put the records straights saying the armed forces owe allegiance to the Constitution. He said the conduct of the 1.3- million-strong Army is guided by its “allegiance” to the Constitution and its core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.

Ahead of the Army Day on January 15, Naravane was addressing his maiden Press conference after assuming charge as the Army Chief earlier this month.

His reply was in the backdrop of Home Minister Amit Shah asserting in the Lok Sabha some months back that POK and Aksai Chin are part of Jammu and Kashmir saying, “We are ready to give our lives for it.”

“Kashmir is an integral part of India, there is no doubt about it. When I say Jammu & Kashmir, I include Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and Aksai Chin, both are included in the territorial boundaries of Jammu & Kashmir,” the Home Minister said after moving a resolution for revoking provisions of Article 370 and the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar too had said: “PoK is part of India and we expect one day that we will have physical jurisdiction over it. Our position on PoK has always been and will always be very clear. PoK is part of India.”

For his part, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh went a step further saying any future discussion would be held on PoK and not on Jammu & Kashmir.

He had also warned Pakistan not to “repeat its mistake” to go for war with India as it did in 1965 and 1971 and said Pakistan would lose POK if it dared to fight a war with India.

On the issue of collusion between China and Pakistan, the Army Chief, who recently visited Siachen, stressed on the importance of the glacier. He said, “that is one area which faces the Western and Northern front.... We should not lose sight that it’s one place where collusivity can happen. So we should keep control...”

Elaborating on it, he said as far as land borders are concerned this is where (Siachen) the two countries (China and Pakistan) are the closest. He also warned about collusion between those two countries in realms of technology and coming to each other’s help in times of crisis.

In that context, the Army Chief was asked about preparations to fight a two-front war simultaneously with China and Pakistan. He said India is conscious of the fact that we have threats “both on the Western and Northern side.” Elaborating it, he said in case of a simultaneous threat there will be a primary front and a secondary front. While the western border is with Pakistan, the northern border faces China.

“Our forces will be concentrated on the primary front and we will adopt more deterrent posture on the secondary front so that we are not found wanting,” Naravane said adding to cater to this, the Army has formations with dual tasking which can move between the Western and Eastern borders.

Speaking of the Northern borders, the Army Chief said they are rebalancing advanced weaponry to the Northern borders. At one point of time, threat was more from the western border and “now we think both the borders are equally important. It is in that context that the rebalance is taking place.”

Realising this point, over the years capacity building was undertaken including construction of roads facing China, habitat, storage of ammunition and deployment of more advanced weapons to the eastern side, he said adding these measures were taken to meet threat from any side.

As regards the present situation on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in terms of transgressions leading to face-offs in the recent past, Naravane said post Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, differences on border are being settled at the lowest level. After the strategic guidelines, small differences are sorted locally and not allowed to escalate, he stated.

The Army Chief also said the hotline between China and India will soon become functional. The hotline, which was agreed upon some years back, will be between Director General Military Operations (DGMO) of India and Western Theatre Command of China.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/will-reclaim-pok-if-army-is-ordered-so--gen-narvane-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/will-reclaim-pok-if-army-is-ordered-so--gen-narvane.html

206,12-1-20,"Under global push, Iran admits it shot Ukrainian jetliner","Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on Saturday acknowledged that it accidentally shot down the Ukrainian jetliner that crashed earlier this week, killing all 176 aboard, after the Government had repeatedly denied Western accusations that it was responsible.

While Ukraine on Saturday demanded that Iran punish the guilty and compensate victims, Iran has invited the US, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation as global pressure mounted on it.

The plane was shot down early Wednesday, hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on two military bases housing US troops in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Gen Qassem Soleimani in an American airstrike in Baghdad. No one was wounded in the attack on the bases.

A military statement carried by State media said the plane was mistaken for a “hostile target.” The military was at its “highest level of readiness,” it said, amid the heightened tensions with the United States.

“In such a condition, because of human error and in a unintentional way, the flight was hit,” the military said. It apologised and said it would upgrade its systems to prevent future tragedies.

Those responsible for the strike on the plane would be prosecuted, the statement added.

Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guard’s aerospace division, later said his unit accepts “full responsibility” for the shootdown.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/under-global-push--iran-admits-it-shot-ukrainian-jetliner.html
207,12-1-20,US says foreign envoys' visit to J-K 'important step'; expresses concern over detentions,"The US State Department has described the recent visit of envoys of 15 countries to Jammu and Kashmir as an ""important step"" but expressed concern over the continued detention of political leaders and restrictions on internet in the region.

The restrictions were imposed on August 5 last when India abrogated the Article 370 that gave special powers to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories.

In the first such trip by foreign diplomats post August 5, envoys of 15 countries, including the US, last week visited Jammu and Kashmir where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as top military brass with the Indian government rejecting criticism that it was a ""guided tour"".

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells, who will be travelling to South Asia this week, on Saturday expressed hope that the region will return to normalcy.

""Closely following @USAmbIndia & other foreign diplomats' recent trip to Jammu & Kashmir. Important step. We remain concerned by detention of political leaders and residents, and Internet restrictions. We look forward to a return to normalcy,"" she said in a tweet.

Wells will travel to New Delhi from January 15-18 to attend the Raisina Dialogue. She will also meet with senior government officials to advance the US-India strategic global partnership following the success of the 2019 US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, and will discuss topics of mutual interest with members of the business community and civil society.

From New Delhi, Wells will fly to Islamabad where she will meet with Pakistan's top officials and members of civil society to discuss issues of bilateral and regional concern.

Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status.

Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian high commissioner.

208,12-1-20,Sri Lankan PM Mahinda Rajapaksa to visit India next month: report,"Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will visit India early next month and hold talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, a media report said on Monday.

This will be his first trip to India after assuming office in November last year and the third high-level visit to New Delhi by a member of the new Sri Lankan government headed by the prime minister's brother and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to travel to India in early February but the dates are yet to be finalised, Sri Lankan news website 'The Sunday Morning' quoted sources in the Prime Minister's Office as saying.

India is keen to establish closer links with the new Sri Lankan government and offer financial assistance to develop the country, particularly the Tamil-dominated North and East and estate community areas, the report said.

In his first overseas tour after taking over the reins of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa travelled to India on a three-day visit and held talks with Prime Minister Modi.

Prime Minister Modi had announced a financial assistance of USD 450 million to Sri Lanka including USD 50 million to fight terrorism after holding ""fruitful"" talks with the island nation's President.

Last week, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena was in India and held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on exploring ways to further deepen bilateral ties in a range of areas including trade and investment.

The Prime Minister's visit will come as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in Sri Lanka continues to push for a political solution for the Tamils which includes the full implementation of the Indian-brokered 13th amendment to the Constitution.

During President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's visit to India, Modi had highlighted the importance of implementing the 13th amendment to the Constitution.

The 13th amendment forced a temporary merger of the two provinces - Northern and Eastern provinces - subject to a referendum there, but the Supreme Court, in 2006, ruled the merger as ""unconstitutional"" and said the two provinces must be separated.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sri-lankan-pm-mahinda-rajapaksa-to-visit-india-next-month--report-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/sri-lankan-pm-mahinda-rajapaksa-to-visit-india-next-month--report.html
209,12-1-20,Firefighter dies as Australia works on long-term battle plan,"A firefighter was killed by a falling tree while battling the Australian wildfire crisis overnight and the prime minister on Sunday said his government was adapting and building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change.

Bill Slade - one of the few professionals among mainly volunteer brigades battling blazes across southeast Australia - died on Saturday near Omeo in eastern Victoria state, Forest Fire Management Victoria Executive Director Chris Hardman said.

The 60-year-old married father of two was in November commended for 40 years service with the forestry agency.

""Although we do have enormous experience in identifying hazardous trees, sometimes these tree failures can't be predicted,"" Hardman said. ""Working on the fire ground in a forest environment is a dynamic, high-risk environment and it carries with it significant risk.""

The tragedy brings the death toll to at least 27 people in a crisis that has destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area larger than the US state of Indiana since September. Four of the casualties were firefighters.

Authorities are using relatively benign conditions forecast in southeast Australia for a week or more to consolidate containment lines around scores of fires that are likely to burn for weeks without heavy rainfall. The reprieve from severe fire conditions promises to be the longest of the current fire season.

The crisis has brought accusations that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts say has worsened the blazes. Thousands of protesters rallied late Friday in Sydney and Melbourne, calling for Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take tougher action on global warming.

The chief executive of Siemens said on Friday that the German engineering company will review its involvement in a coal mine in Australia after climate activists called for it to pull out of the project.

The group Fridays for Future, which has held weekly protests demanding action against climate change for over a year, wants Siemens to quit the mine project because emissions from coal-fired power plants contribute to global warming.

Morrison said his government was developing a national disaster risk reduction framework within the Department of Home Affairs that will deal with wildfires, cyclones, floods and drought. The government was currently working through the details of the framework with local governments.

""This is a longer-term risk framework model which deals with one of the big issues in response to climate changing and that is the resilience and the adaptation that we need in our community right across the country to deal with longer, hotter, drier seasons that increase the risk of bushfire,"" Morrison said.

Morrison said his government accepted that climate change was leading to longer, hotter and drier summers, despite junior government lawmaker George Christensen posting on social media over the weekend that the cause of the latest fires was arson rather than man-made climate change.

Another junior lawmaker Craig Kelly has also publicly denied any link between climate change and fire crisis.

State authorities have said a minority of fires are deliberately lit.

""The government's policy is set by the Cabinet. Our party room has a broad range of views,"" Morrison said of those within government ranks who reject mainstream climate science.

Morrison later announced that 76 million Australian dollars (USD 52 million) would be spent on providing psychological counselling for firefighters and fire-effected communities as part of a previously announced AUD 2 billion (USD 1.4 billion) recovery fund.

""There has been a deep scar in the landscape that has been left right across our country,"" Morrison said.

214,12-1-20,Little ones 70mm,"The 3rd edition of International Kids Film Festival was held in the Capital recently hosted by schools in 40-plus countries targeting over 2 million students and their families.SHALINI SAKSENA brings you a report

If one thought that film fetivals were only for those who were looking at serious cinema, they could not have been more off the mark. The International Kids Film Festival (IKFF) in its 3rd edition is a unique international film festival hosted by schools across the globe.

This year, India, the UAE, England, France, Mexico, South Africa and Saudi Arabia were some of the countries that were part of the festival. The aim of this festival is to provide an opportunity for students to watch some of the best of international children’s films. The reason for this festival was from two perspectives.

“The first, literacy leads to read and writer. But more content is being created and consumed in an audio-visual manner. The kids are not going to read and write as much as we did. For me to expose children to good content is basics to education. Film festival is an opportunity for kids to watch some fanstastic films. We had films from 35 countries in 25 languages. Around 100 films were shortlisted from 800,” Syed Sultan Ahmed, MD & Chief Learner@LXL Ideas, says

The other aspect, he tells you, was to teach the children about the world. One of the biggest change has been world migration. How do we prepare childeren to this? “We have to expose them to world issues, cultures and languages,” Ahemd tells you.

“Sadly, the kind of films that children are watching is commerical content. Good children’s films are available at film festival. Here, we are taking the festival to the children — to 9,000 schools out of which 7,500 are Government schools in Karnataka, Telangana, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. The whole idea is to show them good cinema,” Ahmed says.

The two-month global event included film screenings, filmmaking master classes and be part of world’s largest students filmmaking competition making it is learning process as well.

Some of the films that were screened at the festival were Maestro, Cup of Tea, 3 Feet, A Day in the Park, Dog Gone and Athleticus Gym Keeper. The films were divided on the basis of age: two-five year categoty, six-eight category, nine-11 category, 12-14 categoty and 15-17.

“Traditionally literacy meant our ability to read and write as all knowledge was in books, in today’s world of screens, literacy has a new definition — read, write and create. The big challenge today is that children across the world are exposed to very low standards of films and content. The best films that are made for children are not easily accessible to them. There is a big need to expose our children to good films, real world issues, cultures and stories,” Ahmed says who has introduced the concept of film pedagogy by creating school cinema and this film festival.

He opines that this film festival is a great opportunity for children to watch the best of world cinema right in their schools, learn the art of film-making and make films to participate in the world’s largest student film-making competition. The School Cinema App gives students and their families an opportunity to watch world cinema at their homes.

“This platform is a great example of the change that needs to be made in our education system. It is exciting, relevant, scalable and affordable — all the qualities that a good learning programme should have,” Ahmed says.

He tells you that while these filmswere about different issues and topics, one common theme was respect: Respect for the self, respect for other cultures, respect for others views and thoughts, respect for the environment, respect for labour and respect for the Arts.

A film that was much appreciated was 3 Feet that is directed by Giselle Geney from Colombia. “The film which is in Spanish is about a 10-year-old boy who loves football, goes through the mountainous town of Pamplona in Spain every morning in the company of his best friend (his soccer ball), playing with it before theschool day begins and getting his shoes dirty. Every day, he is scoldedduring the inspection of uniforms by his teacher Ramón, and forced to polish his shoes, while others enjoy their rest. Everything changes the day the teacher decides that not only will he punish Gonzalo during the break, but he will also take away his best friend forever,” Ahmed says.

The event also saw the presence of two child jury members — Akshyat Sharma and Anant Gokhale along with directors of School Cinema film, Saving Green — Shivani Monga and Najmus Saqib.

Not only this, the jury that chose the films not only had eminent personalities like Anna Nikina-Ruohonen, Ambassador, Education Innovations, HundrED Finland, Jaya Bachchan, MP, Manisha Koirala, actor and John Edmond, festival Director, Qurrnsland Film Festival, it consited of children aged nine to 17. These children were from cities like Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai.

Neha Jain, head of Films @LXL Ideas, said that one highlight of the last one year has been ‘Make Cinema’ — the filmmaking competition for students. “We were fortunate to watch some lovely films made by young, amateur filmmakers who had clearly put their heart and soul in their film. Our winners of Make Cinema 2018 as well as our Child Jurors from last year got the wonderful opportunity to travel to Italy and participate in the 50-year-old Giffoni Film Festival. We also hosted young people from Giffoni last year, and will be doing the same this year as well. We will also be having two of the winners of Make Cinema from Kyrgyzstan. They will be visiting schools in India and interacting with students here. Moreover, our other Make Cinema winners from 2018 get to be on the Child Jury this year,” she added.

The IKFF would not have been complete without the support and love of the many people and organisations it received over the last three years. The Australian Consulate in India is one of them. They brought in five films from Australia as well as a chance to meet a talented filmmaker.

“I would also like to thank our wonderful Film Festival partners Children's Film Festival Seattle, Providence Children's Film Festival, Busan International Kids & Youth Festival, Giffoni Film Festival, Boston International Kids Film Festival and Rolan International Childrens Film Festival Armenia,” Jain said.

215,12-1-20,China says world should stick to 'One China' after Tsai win,"China said Sunday that the world should abide by the idea that there is only one China, ruled by the Communist Party, after Taiwan reelected its democratic leader.

“We hope and believe that the international community will continue adhering to the One China principle, understand and support the just cause of Chinese people to oppose the secessionist activities for 'Taiwan independence' and realize national reunification,"" said a statement from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party won in a landslide Saturday against pro-China Nationalist Party candidate Han Kuo-yu. Her victory speech warned China not to threaten force against the self-governed island.

Taiwan's voters “have shown that when our sovereignty and democracy are threatened, the Taiwan people will shout out determination even more loudly,"" Tsai said.

Taiwan has developed its own identity since separating from China during civil war in 1949, but has never declared formal independence. Beijing still claims sovereignty over the island of 23 million people and threatens to use force to seize control if necessary.

“No matter how the situation changes on Taiwan island, the basic facts — that there is only one China in the world and that Taiwan is part of China — will not change,"" Geng said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-says-world-should-stick-to--one-china--after-tsai-win-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-says-world-should-stick-to--one-china--after-tsai-win.html
216,12-1-20,Queen calls emergency meeting over Harry-Meghan crisis,"Queen Elizabeth II has summoned senior royals to her Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Monday for an emergency family meeting to discuss the future roles of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and solve the crisis triggered by the couple's bombshell announcement that they were stepping back from Britain's royal frontline.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and their father Charles, the Prince of Wales, have all been invited to the meeting, while Meghan is expected join the discussion over the phone from Canada, the BBC quoted palace officials as saying.

Monday's meeting - dubbed as the 'Sandringham summit' - will be the first time the 93-year-old monarch has come face-to-face with Harry since the Sussex crisis exploded.

The couple made their bombshell announcement on Wednesday that they intend to ""step back"" from being frontline royals, split their time between the UK and North America, and work towards becoming ""financially independent"".

It is hoped that the talks will produce a ""next step"" on the way to defining the couple's new relationship with the Royal Family - in line with the Queen's wish to find a solution within days, the report said, adding that there are still ""formidable obstacles"" to overcome in the talks.

The meeting will be an opportunity for the family to discuss proposals, drawn up after a series of consultations between palace officials and representatives of the UK and Canadian governments over how Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, can achieve their aim of carving out new ""progressive"" roles as hybrid royals.

The couple have said they plan to continue helping charitable causes through their new Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year.

Last month, they made an application to trademark the brand across a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

However, that process may face some legal wrangles as it emerged that an application has been lodged in the European Union (EU) to trademark a range of goods including beer and jewellery under the same brand.

In their statement released earlier this week, they also said they would be adopting a ""revised media approach"", engaging with ""grassroots media organisations"" and using their Instagram account, which has more than 10 million followers, to ""personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public"".

The royal family, led by the Queen, was said to be ""hurt"" and ""blindsided"" by their shock announcement, which they said was finalised after ""many months of reflection and internal discussions"".

It came soon after the coupe returned to the UK from a six-week holiday on Vancouver Island in Canada, the country likely to be their second home given Meghan's former actress connections with the city of Toronto.

217,12-1-20,Police identify 37 more JNU suspects from WhatsApp group,"A day after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) identified nine suspects involved in the JNU violence, the sources in the Delhi Police on Saturday said that the SIT has identified 37 more suspects from a “WhatsApp” group that was created during the violence on the campus.

Meanwhile, the JNU administration on Saturday conducted security audit of hostels to assess how many outsiders and unauthorised persons are staying on the campus. Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar met students on the campus and rued that some activist students backed by a group of teachers have defiled the peaceful atmosphere, forcing some students to vacate hostels.

He also said that the JNU administration has taken adequate steps to ensure the safety and security of the students residing on the campus.

However, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) accused the police of inaction.

According to a police source, the 37 suspects identified do not belong to any political group active in JNU. “Those identified are students of JNU who were in favour of the semester registration process and wanted to enroll themselves. The group had 60 members and 37 of them have been identified,” said a source.

“These identified persons will be called for questioning and after that it will be ascertained whether they are associated with any student outfit,” said the source.

ABVP’s secretary, JNU unit, Manish Jangid, who had earlier alleged that he was attacked by Left-wing students, was part of “Unity Against Left” WhatsApp group and some other ABVP members were also in this group,” said another source. However, Jangid claimed that on January 5, after he was attacked by some people, his phone broke and he had no knowledge about being added to that group.

“When my phone got repaired, then only I came to know I have been added to that group,” Jangid said.

In a letter sent to hostel wardens, Umesh Kadam, dean of students, asked them to notify all hostel residents to “follow the rules regarding having guests in the hostel room as per the procedures and rules of IHA and provide the necessary details in the forms accordingly.”

In case, any outsider/un-authorised student/guest is found staying in the rooms, necessary action will be initiated against the resident student as per Inter-Hall Administration (IHA) rules and the details of such guests shall be forwarded to the Station House Officer, Police Station, Vasant Kunj North, New Delhi, the notice stated.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/police-identify-37-more-jnu-suspects-from-whatsapp-group-2020-01-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/police-identify-37-more-jnu-suspects-from-whatsapp-group.html
218,12-1-20,Selena Gomez was happier off social media,"Singer-actress Selena Gomez says she was ""so much happier"" when she was off social media.

In an interview on ""New Music Daily"" on Apple Music's Beats 1, the singer opened up about her decision to ditch the virtual world, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

In 2018, the ""Lose you to love me"" hitmaker decided to take a two-year break from Instagram and Twitter.

""I didn't have social media for two years. You've just got to do it. I was driving myself crazy. First off, there was a million things that I didn't want to see. I would see them over and over and over again. Then I'm comparing. Then I'm looking at these people, and I'm like, 'How do they' ... It's all the things that people say, right? It's nothing new. It's that you usually sometimes feel like shit. You have FOMO (fear of missing out). Everyone's life looks amazing, and that happens to me, too. I'm like, ""Well, what am I? I'm missing the plot here. Right? How come it's so fun for everyone else?,"" she said.

The singer continued: ""Then it just started getting dark. There were accounts that were dissecting me, down to my body, to my face, my features, choices I've made, telling stories, and it drove me crazy, because I honestly just wanted to be like, 'None of you even know what you're talking about', and it just destroyed me. So I stopped, and I tell every single person everything changed.

""Also, I'm living in that time where there's a specific look that's going on within females. So that would get in my head as well. Yeah, I do look young, so there's nothing I can do about that. Of course, I am 27, but sometimes I'm like, 'Oh, I look like a baby', which is stupid. I don't fit into that look, which isn't a bad thing, and it's not bad that that's what people enjoy and like. It's whatever makes you feel comfortable, of course.""

Gomez said when she was out of social media, ""I was so much happier with just me, myself, how I looked, and that helped a lot"".

""I just needed to let my old self go. I was purging multiple different things, but it was specifically who I was then,"" she added.
