0,04-4-20,Economic cost of the lockdown,"The Indian economy will face an income loss of Rs 1.7 lakh crore per week or a total of Rs 5.1 lakh crore during the three-week-long shutdown called by the Govt

The pandemic COVID-19 has already affected over 10,16,395 people across the world and there have been 53,238 deaths worldwide. Out of this, over 20,000 people died in the last three months alone. Health experts across the world are yet to discover a vaccine for this deadly virus that can be applied for human use worldwide. This is despite the fact that about 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create an anti-Coronavirus vaccine. There are at least four candidates, which are being tested on animals now. The first firm to conduct a human trial, Boston-based biotechnology firm Moderna, will enter Phase-II of trials, which means widespread human application by early summer. But this is not fast enough. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is expecting an exponential spike in the number of Coronavirus cases across the world in the coming days and is providing necessary information to vulnerable countries. As a result, national and local governments across the world are encouraging social distancing among the people and more and more nations are going into a lockdown mode.

India is already in the second week of its 21-day lockdown that was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 in a televised address to the nation. Despite its size and the density of the population, the entire country, that includes 28 States and eight Union Territories, has gone into a lockdown, making it the largest such exercise in the world.

The country, which has a poor healthcare infrastructure has no option but to do this, as social distancing is probably the surest way of stopping the spread of the Coronavirus among the 1.3 billion Indians. However, health experts say that nothing can prevent the country from going into stage-III of the outbreak and the lockdown is just delaying our entry into it. It is giving us more time to prepare for stage-III and increasing the chances of us taking advantage of any medical breakthrough that takes place.

But, the big question is, for how long can India afford to shut itself down? As it is the Indian economy was in a shambles before the outbreak. Now, it also has to bear the huge economic loss of the three-week-long complete shutdown and the burden of the financial relief package of Rs 1.75 lakh crore that was announced by the Government for the country.

Once this nightmare is behind us, it will become really hard for the Finance Ministry to prepare an effective package for a quick revival of the economy. Here are some estimates of the direct economic loss to the nation and some possible interventions for quick recovery.

The third advance estimate of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) published by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) revealed that India’s estimated GDP for 2019-2020 stood at Rs 47 lakh crore, which turns out to be Rs 3.6 lakh crore per week, of which 17 per cent is earned by casual labour, 21 per cent by regular wage employees and 62 per cent by self-employed workers. The lockdown will affect all these workers on a different magnitude. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for 2017, a whopping 25 per cent of total workers in India are casual labourers (i.e. almost 93 million people) earning about Rs 1,754 per week. Another 23 per cent of the total are regular wage earners who get an average Rs 4,063 per week. The rest, 52 per cent workers, are self-employed ones that include own account workers, the self-employed and helpers in household enterprises. According to the PLFS’ estimates, a self-employed person earns about Rs 3,460 per week. The complete shutdown will affect casual labourers the most as their income depends on working days available in a week.

The situation is, of course, marginally better for regular wage employees. But nearly 46 per cent of the total regular wage earners in India do not have the benefit of paid leave. Therefore, if their salary is not protected during the lockdown period, they will lose their income. On the other hand, self-employed people will lose profit earning from their enterprises/firms due to close of operations.

The lockdown will affect various sectors differently. As Modi’s speech indicated, only production and distribution of essential commodities and services have been allowed to be operational. That includes food supply, goods transport, manufacturing of medical equipment, pharmaceutical, medical facilities, communication and financial services. Therefore, workers will definitely suffer income loss if they are engaged in the locked down sectors.

Another 40 per cent casual labourers are engaged in the construction sector, which will surely be closed for 21 days leading to income loss to the respective workers. A further 10 per cent of casual workers are engaged in manufacturing industries, where almost 90 per cent of economic activities are closed for now. The assumption of 90 per cent shut down of manufacturing is based on the output share of food and medical equipment sectors in total production.

The estimate is based on the 2016 Supply Use Table (SUT) of the CSO, which indicates that foodgrain processing and medical equipment contribute to about 10 per cent of the total GDP of the manufacturing sector. Thus, about 45 million casual workers (i.e. 50 per cent of total casual workers) will be vulnerable, provided agriculture and allied sectors continue to provide job opportunities to the rest of the workers. This is a reasonable assumption for the agriculture sector as harvesting of Rabi crops usually starts in most of the States in late March/early April, coinciding with the complete lockdown period in the country. Hence, the aggregate income loss of the casual workers will be Rs 0.3 lakh crore per week during the lockdown period if we consider their per week income earning to be of the same level as in the third quarter (October-December 2019) of 2019-20.

Additionally, as 46 per cent of regular employees do not have the benefit of paid leave, it is estimated that almost 15 per cent of total regular wage employees will lose their income due to the shutting down of economic activities. Thus, it is estimated that the regular salaried group will lose Rs 0.35 lakh crore per week as compared to their weekly income obtained during the third quarter of the Financial Year 2019-20.

Since 53 per cent of self-employed people are engaged in agriculture, we assume, there will be no direct impact on their income during this time. However, the income of the rest of the 47 per cent of self-employed people will be affected if they are engaged in locked down sectors. Based on calculations of the sector-specific impact, almost Rs 1.05 lakh crore income of the self-employed people will be lost per week.

In effect, the Indian economy will face an income loss of Rs 1.7 lakh crore per week or a total of Rs 5.1 lakh crore during the three-week-long lockdown.

Considering that almost 95 million workers/entrepreneurs will be hit and if we consider that each of them supports on an average four people, nearly 380 million people will face severe welfare threats. This estimate is only for the direct impact on income for a period of 21 days. The economic loss will be much higher if timely recovery does not take place and if we are forced to go in for an extended lockdown going forward. So what should the Government do to improve the situation?

As per estimates, the shutdown will cause a loss of Rs 5,261 per casual worker, which is nearly equivalent to the income support given by the Government to the farmers through the PM-KISAN scheme (i.e. Rs 6,000 annual income support to farmers). It makes sense to extend this scheme to the casual labourers engaged in the non-agricultural sector.

Regular wage employees without entitlement of paid leave are highly vulnerable during this period. Therefore, firms can be encouraged to compensate wage loss to those employees and a tax benefit package for the firms may be thought of.

Self-employed people will also face a severe loss due to the economic downturn. Boosting effective demand in the economy can encourage investment and in this context the first two measures will play a key role. So far, an amount of Rs 15,000 crore has been allocated for the heath sector for improving healthcare facilities.

The Finance Minister’s recent announcement of a Rs 1.75 lakh crore package to help the economically-weaker sections survive the loss of jobs and income that would be the inevitable fallout of the Coronavirus outbreak is not adequate.

As indicated above, this is only one-third of the loss of income estimated during the shutdown. Of course, the Government has issued instructions exempting workers and labourers from paying rent for a month and assured wages for them during the lockdown period. This may no doubt lessen the burden. However, foolproof implementation would not be an easy proposition despite the Government’s best intention.

1,04-4-20,The social media pandemic,"During this lockdown we need to keep our spirits up and not be bogged down by the fake news being spread by scaremongers

The Coronavirus outbreak has put the entire world under lockdown with the total number of cases rising to a whopping 10,16,395 globally and the death toll reaching 53,238. On January 30, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak as a Global Public Health Emergency. As more and more new hotspots emerge daily, experts are anticipating that the onslaught of this pandemic will continue for a few more months before we see the end of it. In the meantime, it has wreaked havoc on the world economy and every social activity known to man. Many countries, including India, have asked people to self-isolate themselves and set a 14-day quarantine period for citizens returning home from abroad.

Almost all global and national sports events have been indefinitely postponed, TV shows and film productions have been suspended, schools, colleges, malls, restaurants and cinemas have been closed. Foreign and domestic tourism is at a standstill due to closure of borders and aviation activity has been suspended in most parts of the world as well as India. People are working from home as inter-State borders have been sealed, so much so that transportation of goods across borders in the country has become difficult. Now, with the 21-day lockdown imposed by the Government, people are confined to their homes.

Naturally, anxiety due to the Coronavirus outbreak around the world is at an all time high, with people sporting social distancing discs that limit contact with others, using hand sanitisers as well as wearing masks to protect themselves against this epidemic. Governments around the world have also scaled up their respective healthcare systems and enhanced their capacity to provide timely screenings as well as treatment to people.

Nonetheless, there are various fake news portals as well as social media posts that are being circulated to spread misinformation about the Coronavirus, which is adding to the already-prevalent anxiety. Some myths like cow urine can prevent Coronavirus, spraying alcohol and chlorine on oneself can keep it at bay, mosquitoes can transmit the virus, eating garlic can prevent it, drinking lots of water will flush out the virus as well taking antibiotics will prevent the virus are doing the rounds of social media. People are unthinkingly passing such posts around despite leading scientists and healthcare professionals debunking these myths.

The nature of social media is such that anyone can share any fake or unverified information on their timeline which can cause anxiety among the people who see it. This has led to deterioration of their mental health as they are living in perpetual fear of the disease and resorting to measures which will certainly not prevent the Coronavirus but can potentially harm their health.

Thankfully, Governments are cracking down on such irresponsible behaviour and imposing fines as well punishment for people spreading misinformation. The Indian Government has written to top social media companies, including Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, ShareChat and Twitter, to control the spread of misinformation on Covid-19. In an advisory the Government asked social media platforms to start awareness campaigns, remove misinformation from the platform and promote authentic information on the Coronavirus so that wrong information does not add to the people’s stress. So what can we really do to protect ourselves from this dreaded virus? Healthcare professionals have recommended several precautionary and hygienic measures, which include avoiding hospitals unless there is an emergency and as far as possible avoiding direct contact with healthcare professionals. They also advocate washing of hands regularly especially after direct contact with sick people or their surroundings. People must also stay clear of farm as well as wild animals.

People with symptoms of a severe respiratory infection must limit contact with others and cover their mouth while sneezing or coughing. If they develop a number of symptoms of the Coronavirus, they must report to the nearest hospital and not panic unnecessarily. We must also clean everything around the house and workplace with disinfectant as when infected droplets from a person land on a surface it survives for days on end.

Use hand sanitiser regularly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose, especially if you have just been outside. Now when India is in a 21-day lockdown, we also need to keep our spirits up and not be bogged down by boredom or give in to fake news being spread by scaremongers on social media.

If you are not working from home and hence have a lot of empty time on your hands, use it productively to finish chores that have been pending for long. Take up a hobby that you never had time for earlier. Pray and meditate. Spend time with family. Play board games, read, watch movies. Do whatever it takes to protect your sanity by keeping negative thoughts in check and escape the pandemic called social media.

2,04-4-20,Police excesses during shutdown not justified,"Fines coupled with clarifications regarding the extent of the restrictions and positive propaganda like the ‘Corona Warrior’ videos shared by the Prime Minister are most effective and humane ways of ensuring that people understand the need for social distancing

In the aftermath of the commencement of the lockdown, various incidents surfaced where the police lathicharged ambulance drivers, stranded migrant workers and other people for venturing out of their homes to buy essential items like milk and groceries. These incidents have been recorded and circulated on social media by onlookers. However, this has resulted in not just physical but also mental trauma for the victims. So, are such police excesses justified, even if they have been committed in the face of the threat of COVID-19?

In order to understand the legality of the incidents of police action, we must first distinguish between a “lockdown” and “curfew.” A curfew is a short-term measure, where essential services are also disrupted, to keep people off the streets in times of riots or terror activities.

On the other hand, a lockdown is a relatively long-term measure, requiring the closure of public and private establishments, schools and religious places in order to restrict the large-scale movement of people. As essential services continue to operate, a lockdown is less restrictive than a curfew. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) guidelines, issued under Section 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA), 2005, despite having the effect of a lockdown, do not use the term curfew or lockdown. Moreover, the guidelines do not specifically state that people cannot venture out of their houses. Even in States which have invoked Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), no order has been issued which explicitly makes it criminal to step out of the house. This is less so if one is rendering an essential service or has ventured out to buy essential items.

However, given the Coronavirus outbreak, it is our duty as responsible citizens to ensure that we don’t leave our homes. But in the event that we do have to, there is no justification for the police subjecting people to the appalling treatment that we have witnessed over the last few days. We live in a country plagued by illiteracy and poverty. There has been widespread confusion regarding what can and cannot be done during the lockdown. The plight of the migrant workers, who were compelled by their poverty to walk thousands of kilometres back home as they could not afford to live in the city without work, is a glaring instance of why we must exercise compassion and not violence in this hour of crisis. The majority of the police force must be commended for their remarkable efforts in maintaining order in a situation of extreme panic and for putting their personal safety at risk during a pandemic. However, some errant policemen have chosen to violate the law and strict action must be taken against them. Voluntarily causing hurt to a person is a non-cognisable offence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provides for imprisonment of up to one year. Victims of police violence should not succumb to such blatant misuse of authority. Instead they must record such incidents, subject themselves to immediate medical examination, if possible, and file a complaint before the nearest Magistrate under Section 190(1) of the CrPC. If this is difficult to pursue during the lockdown, it must be followed up once the restrictions are eased.

The MHA guidelines clearly state that a person found violating stipulations can be charged under Section 188 of the IPC and Sections 51 to 60 of the DMA, 2005. Section 188 of the IPC provides for a fine and an imprisonment term for one month for the violation of an order of a public servant. Further, the DMA also prescribes penalties which can attract fines as well as imprisonment up to two years for violating orders issued under it.

However, these penal provisions must be invoked cautiously, with due application of mind. Consideration must be given to the fact that it is difficult for people to approach the courts, which are functioning on an extremely limited basis. The State must also take care to ensure that the punishment is proportionate to the offence in question, as held by the Supreme Court in the Vikram Singh vs Union of India case, especially when the Government has not expressly clarified whether a single person walking on the street amounts to an offence.

Yascha Mounk, a professor at John Hopkins University, in his book The People vs. Democracy, argues that a liberal democracy strikes a balance between two fundamental principles, the “will of the majority” and the “rule of law”, which gives primacy to individual rights.

India’s constitutional framework may allow for individual rights to be curtailed but they cannot be completely sacrificed at the altar of the “will of the majority.” In the face of a public health challenge, it is all the more necessary to be vigilant about human rights, as history teaches us that the gravest human rights violations have taken place during wars, emergencies and disruptive situations. The “majority” should be careful before applauding or normalising police excesses in the name of public interest when alternate and proportionate penalties exist.

The ideal approach in this case would be for the police to fine people who are found violating a Section 144 order or the MHA guidelines on the lockdown. This can be done by the President or the Governor by promulgating an Ordinance under Articles 123 and 213 of the Constitution respectively, empowering local authorities to impose fines to violators. Such fines must be based on a differential system, accounting for the socio-economic background of the violators.

Fines are being used effectively as a deterrent in the UK, the UAE and Canada. In the UK, police officers have the power to issue on-the-spot fines of £60 for people found violating the lockdown rules. Such fines, coupled with clarifications regarding the extent of the restrictions and positive propaganda like the “Corona Warrior” videos shared by the Prime Minister, are most effective and humane ways of ensuring that people understand the need for social distancing.

3,04-4-20,The invisible people,"The long march undertaken by migrant workers has reminded India of its poor but how long will this awareness last?

One can argue that this is not the time to discuss the view, however credible, that the 21-day lockdown has been imposed without adequate thought to its consequences, particularly on the poor. The emphasis now, the argument may continue, should be exclusively on repulsing the COVID-19 invasion which has brought India to a standstill and threatens to play havoc with its life. There is a point in this, as there is equally a point in the contention that the subject needs to be discussed threadbare both from the viewpoint of ensuring accountability on the part of the authorities and the need to avoid in future the mistakes that have been made.

While leaving such a discussion for a post-Corona time — which, one hopes, is not far away — one needs to focus on a related question: How is it that few could anticipate the post-lockdown trudge of hundreds and thousands of migrant daily wage workers, often with their entire families including women and children in tow, to their village homes hundreds of miles away? Anyone familiar with the Indian tradition of family and community support, which survives in a great measure in rural areas despite erosion in urban societies, should have known that the first instinct of starving labourers, without work and shelter and facing uncertain futures, would be to go back to their village homes, with which most of them retain close ties.

The reason is simple: The poor have vanished as an active presence in the consciousness of those who now set the agenda for discourse in India. This was not always so. Mahatma Gandhi’s abiding concern for the poor and making their well-being the touchstone for all action has been reflected in his iconic observation, “Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to him.” He also stated, “Poverty is the worst form of violence.” Equally well-known is his theory of trusteeship, the essence of which he expressed succinctly when he said, “Supposing I have come by a fair amount of wealth — either by way of legacy, or by means of trade and industry — I must know that all that wealth does not belong to me; what belongs to me is the right to an honourable livelihood, no better than that enjoyed by millions of others. The rest of my wealth belongs to the community and must be used for the welfare of the community.”

The presence of a socialist influence in the Indian National Congress as early as the 1930s was reflected in the formation of the All-India Congress Socialist Party in 1934 under the chairmanship of Acharya Narendra Deva with Jayaprakash Narayan as secretary. The Congress had a number of important socialist leaders like Sampurnanand, Achyut Patwardhan, Ram Manohar Lohia and Minoo Masani. After Independence, the socialists left the Congress and established the Praja Socialist Party, Socialist Party and the Samyukta Socialist Party respectively and their leaders like SM Joshi, NG Goray, Madhu Limaye and George Fernandes played important roles in the country’s politics. Anger over exploitation and the suffering of the poor was, perhaps, the most powerful driving force behind Karl Marx’s intellectual and political exertions and the programmes of the Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the various Naxalite groups.

For a long time after Independence, the Congress remained oriented towards a moderate, albeit nebulous, form of the ideology. After Parliament had accepted in 1954 the establishment of a “socialist pattern of society” as the aim of economic development, the Avadi session of the Congress, adopted, in January, 1955, a resolution calling for the “establishment of a socialistic pattern of society where the principal means of production are under social ownership or control” and there is “equitable distribution of the national wealth.” Later, Indira Gandhi, who nationalised banks, insurance, coal mines and abolished the privy purses of the princes, rode to a massive victory in the 1971 mid-term elections on the slogan of Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty).

The shift towards a change in the party’s political and economic trajectory, however, became manifest from the early 1980s. The launch of the “economic reforms” in 1991 saw, in effect, the defenestration of all talk of socialism. The emphasis was now on the market economy and unleashing the animal instinct of Indian entrepreneurs. As in most cases, economic change had its cultural and social consequences. Poverty has ceased to be of concern to the middle class, which enjoys unprecedented purchasing power and which sets the agenda for discourse in the country, constituting over 30 per cent of the population.

The instinctive tendency to look away has been reinforced in its case by the dynamics of a market economy where the driving force is sales, the volume of which is critically linked to revenue and the quantum of profit. Its cutting edge advertising seeks to boost sales by projecting products as not only covetable in themselves but their possession as a measure of a person’s worth. With advertising dominating media, particularly television, the latter shaping people’s mindsets as never before, conspicuous consumption as a means of showing off, has assumed an unprecedented universality. It is almost a new religion that worships wealth and possession and not the character of a person. There is no time for the poor who are reduced to invisibility and are often looked down with contempt as failures.

There have been other changes. The poor and the alleviation of their poverty no longer occupy the centrestage of the political discourse in India. They have now been taken over by issues like the terrorist threat to the country, the Ram temple, the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens. One reason for this is, of course, the advent of Hindutva politics and its concomitants. Another is the Congress’s new orientation. It does refer to the poor from time to time but that is mostly en passent. Even otherwise, the decline in its political fortunes gives a cry-in-the-wilderness dimension to its pronouncements. Equally a factor has been the decline in Marxism’s political appeal given its abandonment in Russia and China and the decline of Left politics in general in India. The result: Loss of visibility by poor. The long march and its horrors have made them visible again. But for how long?

4,04-4-20,"SP leader, aide gunned down by rivals in Gonda","Despite the lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus, a local leader of Bharatiya Janata Party and his aides opened indiscriminate fire on Samajwadi Party leaders, killing two and injuring four others in Gonda in broad daylight on Friday.

The assailants were alleged to be local zila panchayat member Atul Singh Paras, his brother and half-a-dozen cronies.

Senior officers rushed to the spot and initiated a probe into the killing after registering a case. The injured were shifted to the district hospital.

Reports said that officials of MGNREGA scheme and APO, Tarabganj, called job card holders to record their statement at Sangampurwa primary school in Tarabganj Paraspatti Majhdhar area of Gonda on Friday afternoon. They were busy recording statements about alleged irregularities in MGNREGA payments made by Atul Singh’s mother and sitting pradhan of Paraspatti when Atul Singh, his brother and his cronies reached there on two vehicles and opened indiscriminate fire on former pradhan Devendra Pratap aka Lathi Singh and his group.

The incident sent shock waves and people started running in all directions to save their lives.

An eyewitness, who was playing volleyball there, said that soon after the firing stopped, the injured were shifted to district hospital where two of them were pronounced dead upon arrival. The deceased were identified as Devendra Pratap aka Lathi Singh and Kanhaiya Pathak.

A Samajwadi Party leader, Lathi Singh was earlier the pradhan of Paraspatti and was a political rival of BJP leader Atul Singh Paras.

Lathi’s brother, Vijay Singh ‘Tintu’ is a student leader in Lucknow University. He was critically injured in the firing.

Further investigations are on.

Expressing concern at the daring shooting during lockdown in Gonda, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked the district magistrate and district police chief to arrest the assailants as soon as possible and invoke NSA against them.

He also expressed condolences to the families of the deceased.

Meanwhile in Maharajganj, a doctor died while returning from duty on Friday morning.

Dr Nikhil, posted at community health centre in Basantpur, Bansi, was returning home after night duty when he suddenly lost control over his four-wheeler and it plunged into a pond at Koiladad hamlet on Gorakhpur-Siddharthnagar on Friday morning.

With no solution in sight, Singh has switched off his cell phone and posted some landline numbers. Meanwhile, the numbers uploaded by Singh on social media include those from other cities of India and some overseas numbers as well including those from Russia.

The cyber cell of Madhya Pradesh has taken up the complaint from the senior Congress leader and has started an investigation into the matter.

However, the twitter users started posting all kinds of replies as soon as the senior leader shared his problem on twitter.

Several of them started poking fun at the Congress veteran whom was at the helm of affairs recently as the Kamal Nath government was brought down by party rebels in Madhya Pradesh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/digvijay-files-plaint-to-dgp-over-calls-from-unknown-numbers.html
9,04-4-20,Tabligh-e-Jamaat attendees entered Hry before lockdown: DGP,"All those who had attended the Tabligh-e-Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin area in Delhi and were traced in the State had entered Haryana before the nationwide lockdown was announced, State Director General of Police (DGP) Manoj Yadava said on Friday.

The DGP said during investigation it had come to the fore that all 1,277 people including 107 foreigners had entered the State before the lockdown was enforced and a majority of them came on March 14, 17 and 20. The countrywide lockdown was enforced from March 25.

""There were no restrictions in place when they entered Haryana. I can assure that no one entered after March 25,” the DGP said during a joint media conference addressed by him and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Vijai Vardhan and ACS (Health) Rajiv Arora via video link.

State Home Minister Anil Vij had earlier said the 107 foreigners were from countries, including Bangladesh, Malaysia, South Africa, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

These foreigners were traced to five districts of Palwal, Faribadad, Panipat, Ambala and Nuh, Yadava said. If any other violation comes to the fore during the probe, then charges will be added in the already registered FIRs, he added.ACS (Home) Vardhan said all the foreigners have been quarantined.

When asked about the nearly 60-70 people who were in attendance at the Nizamuddin event and had been brought to AIIMS Badsa in Jhajjar district, ACS (Health) Arora said, “As far the National Cancer Institute at Badsa is concerned, it has been declared as a designated COVID-19 hospital by the Centre. It is also the sub-centre of AIIMS, Delhi and directly comes under the Centre."" He added that only AIIMS or the Union Ministry of Health can give updates on who all have been admitted there.

DGP Yadava said police is at the forefront of the fight to prevent spread of coronavirus infection. “We have put adequate police force at all 162 entry points to the enforce the lockdown. Police personnel are also deployed in the mandis to ensure that when people purchase essentials, social distancing is maintained,” the DGP said.

Care is also taken to ensure that police personnel on duty are provided with masks and sanitisers and each week their medical examination is conducted, Yadava pointed out.

ACS (Health) Arora sought to assure that there was no dearth of personal protection equipment for doctors, nurses and paramedics, who are at the frontline of the battle to prevent the spread of coronavirus, pointing out that none of them will be deprived of proper protection.

In reply to a question, ACS (Home) Vardhan said 573 relief camps and shelters have been set up across the state to provide succour to poor sections including daily wage workers who have been hit hard by the ongoing situation.

As many as 15,850 migrant workers have been accommodated in 288 relief camps, Vardhan added.

CHIEF SECY DIRECTS OFFICERS ON ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES

Haryana Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Friday directed the officers to ensure the supply of all the essential commodities being given under the Public Distribution System (PDS) at the depots in each district by April 5. She said that the availability of wheat, rice, pulses, and edible items being distributed under PDS should be done in a staggered manner, ensuing social distancing.

Presiding over a meeting of the Crisis Coordination Committee meeting through video conferencing here, she was apprised that there is adequate availability of essential commodities in the markets. Apart from this new supply chain of Dal and mustard oil from New Delhi market has also started. It was further informed that proper arrangements have been made for ensuring the availability of LPG cylinders and refilling of the same.

She directed that to ensure the adequate availability of PPE kits in each district, the officers should explore the possibilities of identifying the textile industries and manufactures which can make these kits. She directed the officers to identify such manufactures, while the testing of these kits as per the prescribed medical standards should be ensured.

Showing concern about the doctors, paramedics and health workers, involved in COVID-19 duty, she said that it should also be ensured that availability of essential medical equipments including, PPE kits, masks, , and sanitizers have been made for their safety. She directed that the availability of ventilators, PPE kits and oxygen cylinders in each hospital should be ensured.

Arora directed that a supervisor officer should be deployed for private labs and it should be ensured that new COVID-19 testing labs are to be set up. She said that the facility of telemedicine and mobile OPDs should be started immediately.

Meanwhile, showing concern over the issue of the people living in slum areas across the State, the Chief Secretary directed that close vigil of the people living in these slums should be done and medical testing of such people should be ensured to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

She directed the Deputy Commissioners to keep a close vigil on the control and stop the movement of migrant labourers making inter districts movements and it should be ensured that they are asked to stay in the dedicated ‘Relief Camps' set up across the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tabligh-e-jamaat-attendees-entered-hry-before-lockdown--dgp.html

The amount has been released by the Revenue, Rehabilitation and Disaster Management Department, and the funds have been charged to the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

Giving the district-wise breakup of funds released to the DCs, maximum Rs 6.75 crore has been allotted to Sri Muktsar Sahib district to tackle quarantine clusters in slums etc as a preventive measure. Mainly, these funds will be used for food and rations, said the state’s Special Chief Secretary, Punjab Disaster Management (COVID-19), KBS Sidhu.

11,04-4-20,The food challenge,"While we have enough stocks, the supply chain breakdowns and curfew protocols to choke the virus point to a crisis

The country may have sufficient foodgrain stocks in Central and State warehouses as reserves to tide out an emergency but the breakage of supply chain management due to the lockdown has also meant that they are not reaching beneficiaries. The Government claims that we have nearly 10 times the emergency reserve needed for this time of the year and the fair price shops can go on an overdrive to meet our nutritional requirements. But these are just dry rations, such as rice, wheat, sugar and pulses. Farm supplies have been badly hit because of sudden closure. Even if there are vegetables waiting to be loaded, varying curfew protocols by different States and the still patchy system of curfew passes for truckers mean that there is no movement. Police harassment has only complicated transit. States like Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Delhi, Maharashtra and West Bengal have issued curfew passes promptly and set up police task forces to facilitate smooth movement. But virus hotspot States like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan have totally closed their borders and even sealed their drop point depots. Although the Government is contemplating a staggered release from lockdown, mainly to ensure the April harvest from the fields, the exodus of daily labourers has meant that there are far fewer hands available to manage field work. There are also reports of truck drivers joining the migrants. The second biggest bottleneck is of manufactured, processed and packaged food items. With consumers hoarding anything with a shelf life, the sudden gush of demand, the flight of labour at units rolling them out and the supply chain gaps have meant that our breakfast platters are beginning to look different. Fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) companies are already registering an upswing in demand from urban centres, indicating the hoarding spiral. The retail network has completely collapsed, its earnings now down to 15 per cent. A longer lockdown would mean that sector players would have to shut down and let go off their staff by June. It is, of course, the neighbourhood stores and grocers, who are back in business, having just enough capacity to serve their ecosystem and, therefore, able to smoothen some shocks given their scale. The online delivery platforms have already collapsed with the supply chain breakdown, running out of stocks, delaying deliveries and some of them not signing up new customers at all. The less said about the poultry sector the better; eggs are still available though chicken and meat are mostly off the shelves because of the zoonotic virus. Even dairy products could be affected as a report said that the Aarey dairy has just enough fodder for the cattle to last a week or so.

In the end, what is needed is enabling bulk supplies and that, too, at a time of isolation protocols that demand there is no over-crowding at procurement sites. Most agricultural produce market committees, where every business sources supplies, have been shut for a while. Some of them have negotiated limited trading hours to minimise numbers. Respecting protocol and enforcing it with precision is a big challenge as is the enormous time lag. Besides, it is the high heat of summer and perishables, without fast movement, run the real risk of being wasted. At least for a month or so, a risk-free procurement will have to be evolved in consultation with Central and State representatives. If the situation prolongs, then the Government may have to look for other alternatives. For example, the Food Corporation of India has both operational and food security stocks. At a stretch, the Centre can offer them to States and then perhaps to select retail chains should the market so demand. Wheat and rice godowns are already overflowing but the holding capacity of fair price shops will have to be ramped up. Of course, we will also have to deal with the possibility of reduced food imports what with export restrictions in place. And while we might be able to ensure emergency food needs of vulnerable populations, pricing interventions just might be required. As for civil society, it can be incentivised to donate to food banks, the amount exempted from taxes, for the vast numbers of homeless and jobless. Saving lives is not just about treating the infected but nurturing a whole nation back to life from a calamitous disruption that had neither been foreseen nor imagined. Call it social welfarism but innovation and enterprise can only come when a nation is well-fed.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-food-challenge-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-food-challenge.html
12,04-4-20,Business unusual,"Whenever we emerge from the viral attack on the global economic system, business will never be the same again

Where will businesses stand in a post-Coronavirus world? Even as countries make plans to extend their lockdowns, both Government officials and citizens have no clue when the world will return to normalcy. There are those who are looking into the aspects as to where things may stand once everything settles down. However, one thing is certain: Things will not be the same as they were before the Wuhan contagion swept the world. Of course, there will be a lot of families and individuals who will be devastated by the fallouts. Every passing day, it appears more and more likely that several businesses, which were swimming fine until the outbreak of the virus, will now sink into the depths of bankruptcy, with or without Government intervention. And those that survive will be fundamentally different. One of those differences will be driven from the “work from home” culture that has begun in many industries.

Work from home is a luxury that not every sector can avail. Even in the media industry, while online portals may have been able to spin their stories from a dark basement somewhere, that isn’t a change for most such news parasites. Newspapers can survive on limited staff in offices but the printing presses need to be manned. Television channels need to have fully-crewed output desks and editors even if the anchors can be isolated. Nevertheless, working from home is a reality in many sectors and this will lead to some interesting changes in demand for commercial real estate and transportation requirements. Maybe there will be less demand for shared cabs. More companies might invest in “hot desking”; having shared stations for employees where anyone can log in and work. Collaboration applications such as Zoom, which has become extremely popular, and Microsoft’s Teams will begin to rule the roost. And as tele-commuting becomes standard, will companies use the opportunity to cut costs as employees spend more time at home? That is extremely likely, salaries are certain to face a reality check. But this may not be the case across the world and in every sector. Whatever happens, it might be too soon to make a prediction of how things will play out in the coming months. There will be some interesting new developments and some puzzling trends that will play out. It is clear that this generation, which has become accustomed to social distancing and wearing masks, will be traumatised for years to come and handshakes might go extinct. But what will business as usual look like in 2021? It is too soon to say but rest assured it will not be the same as it was on February 1, 2020.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/business-unusual-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/business-unusual.html
13,04-4-20,CM orders invoking of NSA against misbehaving Jamaatis,"Acting tough on complaints of isolated Tablighi Jamaat members misbehaving with women paramedics at a Ghaziabad hospital on Thursday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked the authorities to invoke National Security Act (NSA) against six accused.

Terming them enemies of humanity, Yogi said on Friday, ‘They (accused) will not obey the law neither will they accept the system as they are enemies of humanity. What they have done to women health workers is a heinous crime and they should be slapped with NSA. We will not spare them.”

The chief minister further directed officials that no woman health worker or police officer/personnel should be deployed in service of quarantined Tablighi Jamaat members.

“Woman officers and workers should not be deployed to treat and provide security to quarantined Tablighi Jamaat members. Only male health staff and cops will be posted in wards having Jamaat members,” said a statement issued by the state government on Friday.

The development came a day after an FIR was registered against six members of Tablighi Jamaat who are quarantined at MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad. The six Jamaatis walked around the ward without their trousers and made lewd gestures towards nurses.

These Tablighi Jamaat members were taken for check-ups at city hospitals in Ghaziabad and they misbehaved with police and government officials and also with others hospitalised there.

The Ghaziabad authorities have so far quarantined 156 Tablighi Jamaat members and attempts are on to trace others they contacted after attending a religious congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in mid-March.

Chief Medical Officer of Ghaziabad, Dr NK Gupta, said that 90 people were quarantined at Sunder Deep Collage hospital, 56 at Surya Hospital in Murad Nagar and five each at MMG Government Hospital and another hospital in Sanjay Nagar.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-orders-invoking-of-nsa-against-misbehaving-jamaatis.html
14,04-4-20,Yogi transfers two months’ pension to 86.7L beneficiaries,"With the click of the mouse, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath transferred Rs 871.46 crore into the accounts of 86,71,781 beneficiaries across the state as two months’ pension.

The funds sent relate to old age, illiterate women, disabled and leprosy pensions. The money was transferred to the beneficiaries at a programme held at the 5 Kalidas Marg official residence of the chief minister in Lucknow on Friday.

On the occasion, Yogi also interacted with the beneficiaries of Varanasi, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Moradabad and some other districts through video-conferencing.

The chief minister said that the world was fighting a battle against COVID-19 pandemic.

On the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a lockdown was enforced and people have been asked to ensure social distancing, he added.

“At this juncture, when all economic activities have come to a grinding halt, we cannot leave the poor, the deprived and the destitutes in a helpless state. The government stands by them. The administrative machinery of the state has carried forward various schemes for the poor in a time-bound manner,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that Rs 871.4693 crore had been transferred to the accounts of 86,71,781 beneficiaries getting pension through various schemes.

“For ordinary people, the amount may be very small but what it means to a poor person can be understood by looking at the glow on their faces. Besides, the amount of Divyangjan pension was Rs 300, which has been increased to Rs 500 by our government,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that his government had earlier sent Rs 1,000 to the accounts of more than 27.15 lakh construction workers.

“The process of providing free ration to MGNREGA workers, Antyodaya card holders and other people affected by unemployment due to the lockdown is in operation from April 1.

Besides, wages amounting to Rs 611 crore have been transferred to the accounts of 88 lakh MGNREGA workers,” Yogi Adityanath said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yogi-transfers-two-months----pension-to-86-7l-beneficiaries.html
15,04-4-20,CM asks officers to plan for phased lifting of lockdown,"Following directives from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked officers to chalk out plans to ease lockdown in a phased manner after April 14 so that people stranded at various places could reach their destinations while ensuring social distancing.

He also declared that the state government would set up a Rs 1,000-crore Corona Care Fund.

“If the lockdown is lifted from April 15, people stranded at different places will try to return to their homes, posing a challenge to maintaining social distancing. In order to deal with such situation, thrash out an action plan now,” Yogi told officials at a meeting of COVID Team-11 at his 5, Kalidas Marg official residence in Lucknow on Friday.

The chief minister said that officers should prepare an action plan on when and how schools, colleges, markets and malls would reopen after the lockdown.

Yogi also announced that the state government would set up a Corona Care Fund of Rs 1,000 crore that would be used for upgrading testing labs and purchasing medical equipment like ventilators, masks, sanitisers, PPE (personal protection equipment).

“Efforts will be made to provide testing facilities in every division and all 24 government medical colleges,” he said.

“Not only will the government provide money for this fund, but help will also be sought from corporate houses under Corporate Social Responsibility,” he said.

Yogi further said that officers would have to work at two levels. “Develop strategy keeping in mind the current situation and the future condition. Operate community kitchens in every district and take help from voluntary organisations and others wanting to extend support. Establish a collection centre so that everyone does not go out to distribute food. Collect food there and then distribute it,” he suggested.

“For future preparations, train volunteers from NSS (National Service Scheme), NCC (National Cadets Corps), Scouts and Youth Mangal Dal. Train them to prevent infection from coronavirus and also coach them about steps to be taken during infection. They will also help in ensuring supply of food and essential commodities and prove vital for us when the infection spikes,” Yogi said.

The chief minister pointed out that during corona infection, anaesthetists, physicians, and women and child specialists were needed the most. “Make a list of such doctors in private sector with related expertise and train them. Similar training is also needed for paramedical staff and doctors of AYUSH department. Make a list of how many beds and ventilators can be made available in private hospitals if needed,” he said.

Yogi asked the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises department to ensure production of masks by units of the state. “It will lower the cost and their availability will also increase. Prepare masks using khadi that can be reused. For this, take help of women self-help groups. This will help in promoting khadi besides helping women get employment and users will be able to make it a habit if they get masks at cheaper rates,” he said.

The chief minister asked officials to convey a message to those who violate social distancing in lockdown. “An incident like Indore should not happen anywhere in UP. File cases against such people under Disaster Act. Those who disagree with the government, keep a tab on them. Take stern action against all those who created chaos in the Ghaziabad hospital,” he said.

“If someone runs away from quarantine, then make the administration there accountable. Use large buildings for such centres instead of primary schools. Make a list of people doing good work during lockdown. The government will honour them when the situation normalises. Strictly curb black marketing and hoarding. If the essential goods are available at a higher price from wholesale market, then take action against the accused,” he warned.

Chief Secretary RK Tiwari along with other members of COVID Team-11 were present in the meeting and briefed the chief minister about actions taken by the team.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-asks-officers-to-plan-for-phased-lifting-of-lockdown.html

18,04-4-20,Punjab CM reviews Rabi season arrangements,"To check overcrowding during the Rabi season in view of COVID-19 restrictions, Punjab Government is considering the doorstep wheat procurement mechanism.

For the same, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday asked the State Agriculture and Food Departments to work out the ways to procure wheat grain from within the villages that are located more than one to two kilometers from the mandis.

The Chief Minister, reviewing the Rabi harvesting and marketing arrangements through video conferencing with officials of Agriculture and Food Departments, directed them to minimize the exposure of the farmers during this critical period. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has conceded Punjab Government’s request for release of Rs 22,936 crore against the cash credit limit (CCL) for April 2020.

“While an Uber-type system of pooling farmers to the distant mandis, on the lines of the suggestion made by the Prime Minister, could be considered, I am open to accepting the Chief Secretary’s proposal to arrange for doorstep kind of procurement of grain if comprehensive modalities could be worked out to ensure feasibility,” said the Chief Minister during the meeting.

While around 50 per cent of the villages in the State are located in close proximity to the mandis, and curfew passes could be issued to the farmers to go to the mandis in few numbers at a time, for the villages in distant areas, the Chief Secretary suggested sending officials to handle the procurement.

Arhtiyas, who currently undertake bagging of the grain in the mandis, could be entrusted with the task of handling it in the villages itself, he added. The Chief Minister asked the Chief Secretary to submit a detailed proposal so that a final decision in this regard could be taken in the next couple of days.

He also directed increase in the number of purchase centres and the total procurement days to ensure that the farmers do not overcrowd the mandis.

The minister also emphasized that the procurement should fully comply with COVID-19 preventive measures. He said the arrangements will again be reviewed in the Cabinet meeting scheduled on Saturday.

The state Additional Chief Secretary (Development) Viswajeet Khanna said that incentives for staggered marketing, which the State Government had already suggested to the Centre, would go a long way in checking crowds at the mandis and purchase centres, as that would encourage farmers to delay bringing in their produce.

A total of 1.8 lakh metric tonnes of wheat is expected to be marketed this year, he added. Combine machines would be allowed to operate in the fields from April 15 onwards.

PAY THROUGH ARHTIYAS THIS SEASON INSTEAD OF DBT

Capt Amarinder also directed his Chief Principal Secretary Suresh Kumar to get the rules amended to provide for payment to farmers through arhtiyas (commission agents), saying that any changes in the system, including direct bank transfers (DBT), should be put in abeyance in the current circumstances.

The system of direct transfer to farmers was to be commenced from this season, as pointed out by Food and Civil Supplies secretary KAP Sinha.

ACT AGAINST HOARDERS: CM TO DGP

Taking note of reports of hoarding and shortage of critical supplies, the Chief Minister has set up a committee of senior officers to monitor essential supplies on a day-to-day basis. He directed the DGP Dinkar Gupta to take strict action against those found guilty of hoarding of material.

Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh informed the meeting that supply of essentials was being ensured through smooth truck movement, with 35-40 per cent of the usual trucks strength still operational. The process would be further streamlined as more and more trucks would be permitted to bring supplies into the state and across districts in the coming days, he added.

SHORTAGE OF BALES TO BE MET THROUGH PP BAGS

Updating the Chief Minister about the other logistics being put in place for the season, Khanna said that in case the West Bengal government, which had ordered the closure of jute mills till April 6, does not open the same, the shortage of bales in Punjab would be met through PP (Polypropylene) bags, which are currently under production. Of the five lakh bales needed, 2.5 lakh had been received so far, he added.

Khanna further said that orders had also been placed for tarpaulin and net as most procured stocks would be stored in the open. The department was also in the process of arranging for the six lakh wooden crates needed, he said, adding that contracts for labour and transportation had already been finalized, and area for stocking had been earmarked already.

All arrangements were in place for sanitization and distribution of masks to procurement agency staff and farmers (through arhtiyas), said Khanna, adding that segregation and marking were being done at the mandis for social distance.

The bales would also be kept at a distance, he said, adding that during peak season, stocks would be accepted only from farmers carrying tokens issued by the administration or police.

As many as 1498 clusters of the migrant labour had been formed in all the districts, in addition to 162 shelters or relief centres. To cope with any labour shortage, MGNREGA workers would also be hired, said the Agriculture secretary.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cm-reviews-rabi-season-arrangements.html
19,04-4-20,SHO Rewa removed after he was spotted in video thrashing priest,"A Station House Officer (SHO) of Rewa district was on Friday removed after he was seen in a video thrashing a priest at a temple.

It was reported that the priest was performing puja on Ramnavmi despite prohibitive provisions in place due to novelcorona virus threat on Thursday. The police reportedly dispersed the mob after landing at the temple in Dhekha colony.

The SHO, Rajkumar Mishra was seen in a photo thrashing the priest with his stick and also threw away the articles used for the prayers at local Devi temple.After the picture went viral in social media, the Inspector General of Police Rewa Chanchal Shekhar line attached the SHO. Early in the day, senior BJP leader Gopal Bhargav had taken to twitter on Friday sharing pictures of the police officer beating up the priest with stick. “A police officer without putting on shoes close to havan vedi is threatening a lonely priest and I can’t see anyone nearby.”

Bhargav had demanded from CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan proper action against the said ‘indecent’ officer. Sources claimed that the locals had also complained to DGP Vivek Jauhri about this police excess. Besides the local MLA and the former minister Rajendra Shukl too had approached senior police officers on this incident. “The IG Rewa has informed the State Government that the action at Rewa temple was undertaken after information of a gathering.

The police officer seen in the pictures is not SP Abid Khan and SHO has been removed for improper action,” said a tweet from the publicity department of MP.

41,04-4-20,"Use COVA app to order grocery, other essentials in Punjab","Punjab citizens can now use the State Government’s unique COVA App to request for delivery of essential goods and grocery amid the COVID-19 clampdown.

The Government has expanded the App to cover such delivery, thus reaching out more effectively to the people amid complaints that many of the delivery contact numbers were being found unavailable, busy or invalid by many citizens.

The vendors were also finding it difficult to deal with the high number of incoming orders and deliver to the right addresses.

Under this initiative, the App, available on Android PlayStore and iOS AppStore, will facilitate delivery of grocery and essential goods, as notified by the government, through local vendors.

The feature has been built into the App with support from Uengage Services Private Limited, which has worked pro bono with the government team on this initiative, said the state’s Additional Chief Secretary (Department of Governance Reforms and Public Grievances) Vini Mahajan.

The move is aimed at helping citizens access essential services during the lockdown easily, while also enabling vendors maintain the supply and deliver to people’s homes with appropriate passes.

This module shall enable the vendors register themselves as a suppliers and enlist their delivery executives for passes. This will also empower the district administration to approve or reject the vendor, and also act as a monitoring authority if a complaint is registered by the citizen on the grounds of overpricing or adulteration.

The citizen only need to select his or her location and the App shall populate the nearby vendors. The citizen can place an order on the App itself and pay post-delivery of the items.

This is an additional feature in the App which was already providing solutions to help citizens’ access authentic information, report gatherings, access medical advice from doctors.

46,04-4-20,ISM develops ventilator adaptors for multi patients,"ISM Dhanbad developed a 'multi-patient ventilators', wherein four patients can be supported by a single ventilator, as the number of COVID-19 cases in India is surging at an exponential rate.

A team consisting of professor A R Dixit, Ashish Kumar and Ratnesh Kumar has developed the ventilator adaptor with different configuration (1-2, 1-4) using 3D printing.

These multi-channel adapters may be used to increase the capacity of the existing ventilator, said Professor Dixit adding, “It will be possible to use one ventilator machine for more than one patients simultaneously depending upon their criticality or if the COVID-19 outbreak goes out of control.”

We all know that COVID-19 is stressing our health system to the limit. One of the most important machines in this battle is the ventilator. Ventilators are critical for patients experiencing the worst symptoms of respiratory distress from the virus. Most of the numbers predict that hospitals won’t have enough ventilators to keep up with the needs during the height of the pandemic, he said.

As the number of coronavirus cases is increasing at an exponential rate, it is expected that most hospitals will face short of ventilators which are absolutely vital for critically infected patients. The number ventilator in Dhanbad is also very limited in comparison to its a population so we have decided to develop it for multi patients, said Dixit.

The concept was first reported in 2006 in Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and technique was successfully used by Dr Menes in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting mass casualty incident.

Now 3D printing is used worldwide to develop different Personal Preventive Equipment like Face shield, mask and also n important medical attachments like venture valve, splitter including many others too, said Professor Dixit.

The adapter is equipped with different sized flow limiter (controller), which is required in cases where the flow ratio between two patients from a splitter has to be different requirements. “We have sent a sample to PMCH for their feedback,” added Dixit.

Professor Shalivahan, Dean Research and Development ISM said, the functional prototype is prepared in the Reverse Engineering Lab of Mechanical Engineering Department under the guidance of Prof. A R Dixit.

Now the team has started to develop a sanitizing tunnel for hospitals and other public places. It will help to disinfect the person within a few minutes.

“We have requested the faculty to submit more technical solutions which will help the local administration and hospitals to combat Covid19,” said Shalivahan.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ism-develops-ventilator-adaptors-for-multi-patients.html

The Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat himself met the representatives of many private hospitals and office bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and appealed that the OPDs of private hospitals should start functioning.

The decision was taken with an objective of ensuring that people don’t face problem in getting treatment.

The court has asked whether the State Government has any positive figure regarding the number of persons returned or coming from outside to the State of Jharkhand during the period of lockdown or even one week prior to that including foreign nationals and whether they have been screened or are being screened properly?

It has also asked how many of them have been quarantined at quarantine centres and how many of them have been quarantined at their respective homes?

Also, how many doctors and support staffs have been engaged for taking care of quarantined persons in the State of Jharkhand at different quarantine centres of the State of Jharkhand including the homes of quarantined persons?

The court further asked how many PPEs have already been supplied and how many are in reserve? How many of the screened persons have been found positive with the Coronavirus? How many Testing Kits are available with the State Government and how many of them have already been supplied to the various centres of the State?

It further questioned how many ventilators are available in Jharkhand and how many would be required to cater to the present crisis? Also, whether the quarantine centres including the persons who are quarantined at home, sufficient security measures have been taken by the State so that they do not come in the contact with the persons of the locality? And, whether sufficient basic amenities, medical equipment, medicines and food etc are being provided to them?

The court has further asked to put up the matter before it on April 7.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-preparedness--status.html
89,04-4-20,Admin issues guidelines to landlords for rent relief,"The Ranchi district administration on Friday issued few guidelines for both permanent and contractual workers as well as asking landlords to provide relief on rent for a month from tenants. As per Ranchi district administration guidelines, industries, shops and commercial establishments must pay wages as usual to their workers during the lockdown period. These applies to both permanent and contractual workers as well as workers not currently working due to the lockdown. Payment should be made through direct transfer as far as possible, it said.

The district administration has also asked landlords to provide moratorium on rented accommodation for a period. Rent exemption for 30 days starting from 29.03.2020 for tenants residing in Ranchi district. Landlords cannot evict any tenant during the lockdown period for non-payment of rent, discrimination due to COVID-19, profession , religion, caste and others.

The district administration directive also states that those living in employer provided accommodation too cannot be evicted during the lockdown period.

Sources said that the district administration guidelines can be a great relief for those, who are unable to pay rent due to lockdown period as most of the shops and business establishments are closed.

Upendra Prasad, an auto rickshaw driver and resident of Ratu Road area said, “The district administration directive is a great relief for us as we were confused how we will pay the rent as due to lockdown we are not taking out our autos.”

Meanwhile, the district administration on Friday too carried out sanitization work at Hindpiri area after a Malaysian woman was tested positive with Covid19. The Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) team in various group visited lanes and bylanes of Hindpiri area carrying out sanitization work.

On Thursday, a section of residents in Ranchi’s Hindpiri locality, where Jharkhand’s first Covid-19 case was reported, resisted the medical teams which went for screening from entering their houses, suspecting that the data to be collected from every household would finally be used for National Population Register (NPR).

However, the team later carried out the screening test of people on the intervention of senior district administration officials and religious leaders.

Moreover, the district administration to tackle any emergency situation has decided to convert premier establishments as quarantine centre. Some of the government as well as private structures which have been converted as quarantine centres are Khel Goan sports complex, Haj House at Kadru and Maheshwari Bhawan in Upper Bazaar.

On Thursday evening when the district administration team reached Haj House at Kadru for converting building as quarantine centres the team had to face people wrath. However, on the interference of local police and religious leaders it was decided to develop the Haj House as quarantine centres.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/admin-issues-guidelines-to-landlords-for-rent-relief.html

92,04-4-20,Denizens to light candles on April 5,"In his address to the nation on Friday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked everyone to switch off all lights at home and illuminate their surroundings with diyas or candles for nine minutes at 9 pm on Sunday, April 5. After the Janta Curfew observed on March 22, Ranchiites have once again welcomed the PM’s call amid the rising fear of Cornoravirus.

People from all walks of life and across all age groups in the City are keen to support Modi and curb the spread of the deadly virus.

“I support the initiative of our Prime Minister in this fight against Coronavirus. I hope that it goes not just from the country but the world very soon so that we can resume our normal lifestyles. Just like everyone had participated by clapping or ringing bells last time, hopefully this time too they will light up their balconies with hopes of winning this battle. Go Corona Go!!” said Hridaan, a class VII student.

“We are with the PM in this battle and support him whole heartedly. We do plan to light up candles on Sunday and also meditate and pray for everyone’s well being. I have also asked my daughter who works for a multinational company in Bangalore to light up the same in her house as well. With Modi as our leader and guide, I am sure we are going to emerge as winners in this battle and that too very soon,” said a city based event planner Vandana.

Nilesh Agrawal, a city based industrialist feels that the way Modi is dealing with this pandemic is phenomenol. “Personally I don’t agree with Modi on a lot of things but now his way of handling this crisis is great. A lot of people are trying to make this whole thing communal but the PM not addressing those issues is very good. It is not a communal battle and at the end of the day this virus can affect anyone in the same way. The idea of lighting diyas shows we are all in this together and we are united during the outbreak of Coronavirus.”

“I am going to light diyas on my terrace and also put on the Om chant to make it more powerful. I feel by illuminating candles or diyas and also chanting, we will give more power to the sun. This in turn will make us and our immunity systems strong and less prone to any disease. According to the Hindi calendar it is also a very auspicious day for lighting diyas,” said senior citizen Chanda Bhasin.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/denizens-to-light-candles-on-april-5.html

96,04-4-20,Yogi prepares for post lockdown scenario in UP,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday held a meeting with top officials to discuss ways and means to meet the challenges after the lockdown is lifted.

The Chief Minister said that the biggest challenge would be to control movement of population since a large number of migrant workers have been kept in shelter homes at present.

He said that efforts should be made to maintain social distancing even after the lockdown is lifted. Special care will be taken to enforce the safety protocols in the 16 districts that have reported corona positive patients.

Sources, however, said that the lockdown could be lifted in a phased manner. Cinema halls and shopping malls may continue to remain shut for a few more days and a decision will also be taken regarding schools and colleges.

Addressing a meeting of Team 11, set up to combat the coronavirus pandemic in the state, Yogi said the doorstep delivery of food will have to continue even after the lockdown is lifted since people may not return to work immediately.

Community kitchens will continue to function in every district and collection centres for food packets will also continue.

The Chief Minister said that a volunteer force comprising NSS, NCC, scouts and Yuva Mangal Dal, should be set up and trained to overcome the crisis.

The volunteer force could also be deployed in the distribution of food.

Yogi also asked officials to prepare a list of private physicians and doctors who could be available to the common man on phone.

He said that the state government has decided to set up a Corona Care Fund of Rs 1,000 crores which will be used to purchase ventilators, personal protective equipment and other medical equipment. Donations would also be taken from the corporate sector under the corporate social responsibility scheme.

The state government has also moved to enforce doorstep delivery of FIRs to those who violate the lockdown and misbehave with police personnel.

The scheme, under which the police will serve the FIR at the doorstep of the violator, was launched in Muzaffarnagar on Friday.

97,04-4-20,Lamps may lead us to knowledge: Scholars,"The nine minute long video message to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aired at 9 am on Friday has evoked mixed reactions ranging from taunts to appreciation. The Prime Minister asked the people to switch off the lights in their houses at 9 pm on Sunday for nine minutes and light up candles and diyas as a show of solidarity to fight the Corona Virus.

While the Opposition leaders came down heavily on the Prime Minister for his request to the countrymen to light up candles and small oil lamps as a move to take the country away from its proposed path of scientific temper, Sanskrit scholars, physicists and vedanata experts welcomed the suggestion as a right move in the right direction.

Shashi Tharoor, Congress leader and MP from Kerala described Modi’s speech as a return to Ram Bharose. In a message in Twitter, the controversial MP from Thiruvananthapuram said: “This is no accident: the PM spoke on Ram Navami at 9 am for 9 minutes, asked us to light diyas and candles on April 5 at 9 pm for 9 minutes. He is invoking all the auspicious elements Hinduism associates with number 9. Back to Ram Bharose?! #COVID19 must be more serious than we thought!”.

The CPI(M) leaders, the virulent critics of the PM too took to the social media. The party cadre went to town making fun of the PM for taking the country back to the days of religious obscurantism. But Sanskrit and Vedic scholars in Kerala said that the suggestion to light up diyas and candles on Sunday is justified as it finds justification in Upanishads and Vedas.

Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panikkar, Vedic scholar who spends his entire time during the lockdown in prayers and pooja told The Pioneer that Modi’s request to light diyas and candles has similarities with a silent prayer. “Our tradition is based on the prayer tamassomaa jyotirgamaya which means lead us from darkness to light, It is a prayer to lead us from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge,” said the scholar.

He said this is the way to make people understand the seriousness of a complex medical situation and the PM has done it in his own style. “Don’t you feel that this is better than the Chumbana Samaram (agitation of kiss) and human wall organised by political parties under the pretext of ushering in renaissance?” asked Panikkar.

PM Gopala Menon, Thanthrik scholar, and his son Prof MG Gireeshan a physicist, preferred to analyse the April 5 lighting of lamps through the eyes of astrology. “Sunday begins with the star Makam which lasts upto 3pm. The combination of Makam and Sunday result in two Yogams (phases) , Mrithyu Yogam an Visha Yogam (Death and Poison). The Makam phase gives way to Visha Mukthi yogam (phase free of poison) after 3pm and the choice of the time of 9 pm to light up lamps is an apt move. It is after the period of Visha Mukthi Yogam, the lamps are being lighted. As per Indian philosophy, God is in the form of Viraat and hence the offering of prayers in the form of lamp is similar to praying to the almighty to light up the world from darkness,” said Menon.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lamps-may-lead-us-to-knowledge--scholars.html
98,04-4-20,"CORONA: 4 NEW CASES, 9 MORE CURED IN BENGAL","Even as her senior ministerial colleagues questioned the “logic” behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to switch off electric lights and light up candles on April 5 to express solidarity for the nation’s fight against Corona virus Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee refused to get drawn into politics saying she was nobody to issue advisories on the Prime Minister’s appeal and said it was upon the people to consider as to what they would do on Sunday.

Apparently losing her cool when asked to comment on how she would react to Modi’s appeal to switch off power for nine minutes on Sunday, Banerjee retorted “Don’t politicise the issue. It is a grave situation. I will not make any statement on this… How can I say what you will do on what the Prime Minister says … It is upon the people to decide as to what they will do … whether they will follow his (PM’s) advice or not … If I will feel like sleeping I will sleep and if you feel like responding to his appeal you will do accordingly … I am nobody to make a comment here. Let us not play politics.”

Instead of dwelling on the Prime Minister’s speech the Chief Minister questioned the attitude of “some political parties (read BJP)” for “doing nothing but taking all the credits.” She alleged that “these people are saying that the Centre is providing ration to the people in this hour of crisis… In fact they have not even given a mask. It is the State Government which is bearing the huge costs of providing free ration to the people.”

Questioning the “logic” behind the Prime Minister’s appeal to switch off electric light one of the senior Ministers of Banerjee’s Cabinet Subroto Mukherjee said he would follow the Prime Minister’s advice if he were to be explained the reason behind doing what has been asked to do by Modi. “I will definitely follow his instructions but before that one has to explain the logic behind switching off electric light for nine minutes and lighting up candles,” he said.

Disapproving of the Prime Minister’s appeal Congress leader in Parliament Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said “if switching off power and lighting up candles or torches can solve the problem there is no need to do researches to discover medicine against the Corona virus.”

Bengal Pradesh Congress president Somen Mitra said “we were expecting more important things from the Prime Minister. We were expecting a policy speech on the way out for the poor people, the migrant workers and farmers who are suffering economically in this hour of crisis. Will switching off power handle the crisis?”

Attacking the Prime Minister for “playing politics and seeking to extract political mileage in this hour of crises” former CPI(M) MP and State Left Legislature Party Leader Sujan Chakrabarty said “last time he make people beat thalis. This time he is telling them to light up candles and tail lamp… What additional purpose will it serve besides uniting the saffron people or identifying and get a feel of saffron following in the entire country.”

Meanwhile, Bengal’s total number of active corona related cases went up to 38 with 9 people getting cured and released on Friday.

“We have 4 new cases reported today which takes the total number of active Corona cases in the State to 38,” the Chief Minister said adding, “nine people have been cured and released today which is in addition to the 3 people cured earlier.” Three people have succumbed to the disease, she said.

Incidentally the Health Department experts had put the total number of Corona deaths to 7 on Thursday, leading State Chief Secretary to quickly call a second press conference and issue clarifications doubting whether four other deaths were because of the virus. Playing up the co-morbidity factor he said the victims had been hospitalised for other ailments and it was only subsequently that they were found to be Corona positive.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/corona--4-new-cases--9-more-cured-in-bengal.html

“When US president Donald Trump visited Agra on February 24, water was released by upstream barrages, but it did not reach Agra. Trump, however, did not go to the rear side of the Taj Mahal, otherwise the polluted and dry Yamuna would have disturbed him. But for the last 25 days or so, we are enjoying a rare view of Yamuna at the Etmauddaula View Point park. The river bed is under water and birds have returned,” said River Connect Campaign member Jugal Kishore Shrotriya who conducts a daily arti of Yamuna to mobilise locals to keep the river clean.

River activist Devashish Bhattacharya said, “Perhaps due to the lockdown due to COVID-19, industries in Haryana and Delhi are not drawing water from the river. We have had several spells of rain in March, which could have raised the water level.”

Water level in Vrindavan and Mathura had also seen a steady rise in the past few weeks.

In Agra, surplus water from the Ganga Jal Pipeline was also being released in the Yamuna. The two water works in Agra receive 140 cusec of water continuously from the 130 km long pipeline. The entire quantity is not used. The excess goes into the Yamuna, according to a local corporator Anurag Chaubey.

The river behind the Taj Mahal, along Mahtaab Bagh has come alive, offering a breathtaking view. Due to the lockdown, the Taj Mahal, for the first time in its history, is relaxed and breathing freely, deprived of the daily human load, as all monuments have been shut down in Agra for visitors.

102,04-4-20,"‘CoroFlu’, all set to take on deadly Covid-19","A unique intranasal vaccine for coronavirus, ‘CoroFlu’, is all set to take on the deadly Covid-19.

An international collaboration of virologists at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the vaccine companies FluGen and Bharat Biotech-has begun the development and testing of the unique vaccine named ‘Coroflu’ against the COVID-19 that has infected over one million people and claimed over 54,000 lives.

Bharat Biotech has till date commercialised 16 vaccines, including a vaccine developed against the H1N1 flu that caused the 2009 pandemic.

Head of Business Development, Hyderabad based Bharat Biotech pharma, Dr Raches Ealla explained that, CoroFlu will be built on the backbone of FluGen's flu vaccine candidate known as M2SR. Based on an invention by UW¬–Madison virologists and FluGen co-founders Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Gabriele Neumann, M2SR is a self-limiting version of the influenza virus that induces an immune response against the flu.

“Kawaoka’s lab will insert gene sequences from SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, into M2SR so that the new vaccine will also induce immunity against the coronavirus,” Dr Ella said, sharing further details.

He said, “Bharat Biotech will manufacture the vaccine, conduct clinical trials, and prepare to produce almost 300 million doses of vaccine for global distribution. Under the collaboration agreement, FluGen will transfer its existing manufacturing processes to Bharat Biotech to enable the company to scale up production and produce the vaccine for clinical trials.”

Refinement of the CoroFlu vaccine concept and testing in laboratory animal models at UW–Madison is expected to take three to six months. Bharat Biotech will then begin production scale-up for safety and efficacy testing in humans. CoroFlu could be in human clinical trials by the fall of 2020.

Four Phase I and Phase II clinical trials involving hundreds of subjects have shown the M2SR flu vaccine to be safe and well tolerated. This safety profile, M2SR’s ability to induce a strong immune response, and the ability of influenza viruses to carry sequences of other viruses make M2SR an attractive option for rapidly developing CoroFlu as a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

“We are going to modify M2SR by adding part of the coding region for the coronavirus spike protein that the virus uses to latch onto cells and begin infection,” said Gabriele Neumann, a senior virologist in Kawaoka’s lab and co-founder of FluGen. “CoroFlu will also express the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein, which is the major influenza virus antigen, so we should get immune responses to both coronavirus and influenza.”

CoroFlu, like M2SR, will be delivered intranasally. This route of administration mimics the natural route of infection by coronavirus and influenza and activates several modes of the immune system.

Intranasal delivery is more effective at inducing multiple types of immune responses than the intramuscular shots that deliver most flu vaccines.

“Ninety percent of our vaccines are sold in lower middle-income countries with affordable pricing being core to our business model. We will fervently work toward the successful development of an efficacious COVID-19 vaccine,” said Dr Ella.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---coroflu-----all-set-to-take-on-deadly-covid-19.html
103,04-4-20,‘Gangtva' can cure coronavirus: Team of Indian Army veterans,"A team of Indian Army veterans have come together on a platform ‘Atulya Ganga’ and claimed that there are evidences that 'Gangtva' can cure coronavirus.

The team of 100 army veterans have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Shekhawat to give a presentation in this regard and further conduct research on Ganga Jal’s impeccable power amid the grave threat posed by the pandemic.

""Atulya Ganga finds reference that shows Gangtva can treat the deadly virus,"" said the letter.

Gopal Sharma, founder of Atulya Ganga said: ""The Ganges bears a nectar element called Gangtva (Bacteria that feeds on the virus), the hallmark of our great civilization on the river. There was a time when those bacteriophages were present in four of the world’s main rivers. The remaining three rivers and their civilizations were struck by rapid industrialization and developments. Now Ganga exists as the only one that has this nectar element.""

The group claimed that Ganga water has been proven to be capable of defending against various bacteria and viruses.

""In various studies, it has been shown that even bacteria from serious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, meningitis and tuberculosis do not thrive in the water of the Ganges. We assume in the current corona crisis the Gangtva of Ganga is capable of defending against this virus,"" the group said in the letter.

The team has now demanded that the Prime Minister pursue a detailed research to see if the Ganga water can combat a “biological 'attack'' like coronavirus.

Atulya Ganga is a team of ex-military officers who earlier announced a walk along the banks of the Ganges from Gomukh, the origin of the Ganges, to the Bay of Bengal, in what they claim was world’s first ever Mundaman Parikrama.

Earlier in the day, the UP government spokesman had stated that 42 persons who had attended the Jamaat event have tested positive.

With reports from Agra, the Jamaat toll has gone up to 49 and if sources are to be believed, the number is bound to shoot up since more than 100 samples of this group are under testing.

105,04-4-20,Maha leaders slam PM’s ‘light’ call on April 5,"The ruling alliance partners in Maharashtra— the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena — slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday for his call to people to light candles, lamps or mobile torches on April 5 at 9 pm, by saying that the call was “irresponsible” and “stupid” and that it did not behove well for a Prime Minister to give such a call.

Reacting to the Prime Minister’s call, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee and State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said: “The country is going through a tough time as the number of Coronavirus cases increasing each day. During such times, the Prime Minister is expected to take some firm policy decisions. Is it the Prime Minister’s job to ask people to clap, light lamps etc? It is about time that PM gets serious about the issues at least now”.

Dubbing the Modi’s call is an act of stupidity, NCP leader and State Housing Minister Dr. Jitendra Awhad said: “Prime Minister of India asks people to light lamps & candles. Is this some kind of a joke? Not a word on where the country stands in this war. It’s preparedness, additional financial aid, new facilities created, diagnostic centres added, what his government proposes to do with gargantuan problem of stranded migrants. Shame!”.

Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut tweeted: “When people were asked to clap , they crowded the roads and beat drums , I just hope now they don’t burn down their own houses , sir ‘diya to jalalenge ‘ but please tell us what the government is doing to improve condition”.

“To fight the crisis, doctors, nurses, police, para-medical staff are all working by putting their lives at risk. The need of the hour is to stand firmly behind these people and give them the necessary help. What is required at this time is making available adequate number of ventilators, increasing the number of testing labs, providing doctors and their staff with PPEs, to provide financial assistance to states to fight this crisis,” Thorat said.

“Also, the general public needs to be given hope, to announce relief packages for people who have lost their livelihoods. Nothing of this was done only an event of lighting of lamps was announced. After hearing the address, the question that is being raised is: whether Narendra Modi will behave like a Prime Minister or not?,” the State Congress chief asked, adding that the ruling BJP was trivialising the Coronavirus issue through such “PR stunts”.

“His (Modi’s) so called address to nation this morning smacked of irresponsibility and incompetence personified. It was the most apt example of how a prime minister of the country should not be. He never does his homework. It was desired he will at least at this hour,” Awhad said.

“All he ( Modi) is consistently giving people is sedatives such as clap, bang the utensils and light the lamps like celebration or an events. His blind, irrational followers will do it dutifully, oblivious that they too are being cheated. They will not think even for a minute how this will help to tide over the alarming situation. His cockamamie & gimmicks is a narcotic they are addicted to”.

“On his part, PM is more than happy to peddle this drug as it hides his bankruptcy of will and ability to take any concrete action. On my part, I vow not to indulge into this stupidity. I will share the cost of same oil with some poor and needy. Let Modi know one cardinal truth that you cannot fool all the people all the time,” Awhad said in a strong statement issued here.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maha-leaders-slam-pm---s----light----call-on-april-5.html

108,04-4-20,Doctors: Tablighis not cooperating,"Doctors from various hospitals in the national capital, where the members of Tabligh-e-Jamaat are admitted, have complained to the Delhi Government that those from the religious organisation undergoing treatment are not cooperating with the medical staff, sources said on Friday.

The doctors have also demanded enhanced security outside and within the hospitals where the Markaz evacuees have been admitted. A doctor said some patients evacuated from Nizamuddin Markaz, the headquarters of Tabligh-e-Jamaat in south Delhi, don't follow instructions from doctors and are reluctant to take medicines.

Another senior doctor with the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital recently complained to the Delhi government that the people brought from Nizamuddin Markaz are not cooperating with the medical staff. In the neighbouring Ghaziabad, the Tablighi Jamaat members quarantined at the district hospital allegedly misbehaved with the nurses, making lewd remarks and dropping their pants, following which the Uttar Pradesh government slapped the stringent National Security Act against them.

They were later shifted to a temporary isolation ward at a private educational institute. Some of them are in Ghaziabad at an isolation ward of the MMG District Hospital.

In a sharp reaction, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called those involved in the hospital incident ""enemies of humanity"". Police said the Tabligh-e-Jamaat members have been booked for indulging in ugly acts and passing lewd remarks against the women staff membersat the hospital. On Wednesday, the Delhi Government, along with the Delhi Police, cleared the Nizamuddin markaz and evacuated over 2,000 people.

In Delhi alone, 1,810 people linked to the markaz have been quarantined and 536 are undergoing treatment at different hospitals. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that the total number of coronavirus cases stood at 384 of which 259 were linked to Nizamuddin markaz. One more death was reported on Friday, taking the COVID-19 toll in Delhi to five – three fresh cases were also linked to Tabligh-e-Jamaat.

On Thursday, the Delhi Health department officially sought more security from police in hospitals as the coronavirus patients brought from the Markaz and some other patients were triggering a ""law and order problem"" and ""commotion"" in hospitals. It said those who had congregated inside the mosque were brought out in a ""massive exercise"" held from March 30 to April 1, 536 of them were sent to various hospitals after they showed symptoms and 1,810 were sent to quarantine facilities.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/doctors--tablighis-not-cooperating.html

Currently, it is at 2.2 per cent below its historic average of 2.5 per cent.

The ‘Bull & Bears’ report also noted that India’s market cap has declined more, compared to the fall in the world market cap in the past 12 months.

“Over the last 12 months, the world’s market cap has decreased 12.3 per cent ($9.6 trillion), while India’s market cap is down 31 per cent,” it said.

The report also noted that the market cap-to-GDP ratio of India has declined swiftly from 79 per cent as on FY19 to 54 per cent (FY20EGDP), much below its long-term average of 75 per cent and closer to the levels last seen during FY05 and FY09.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) sees India’s economic growth slipping to 4 per cent in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), while S&P Global Ratings earlier this week further slashed its GDP growth forecast for the country to 3.5 per cent from a previous downgrade of 5.2 per cent.

India Ratings & Research too has revised its FY21 forecast to 3.6 per cent from 5.5 per cent earlier.

Moody’s Investors Service last week slashed its estimate of India’s GDP growth during 2020 calendar year to 2.5 per cent, from an earlier estimate of 5.3 per cent and said the coronavirus pandemic will cause unprecedented shock to the global economy.

These growth estimates compare to an estimated 5 per cent growth rate in 2019-20 fiscal that ended on March 31.

From January to February, China’s exports to India were 67.1 billion yuan (USD 9.5 billion), down 12.6 per cent on a yearly basis and imports from India dropped 11.6 per cent to 18 billion yuan (USD 2.5 billion), the state-run Global Times reported on Friday.

Bilateral trade fell by 12.4 per cent to 85.17 billion yuan (USD 12 billion) in the first two months, the report quoted Chinese Customs data.

The lockdowns in both the countries due to Covid-19 is expected to badly affect the bilateral trade which declined by three billion billion dollar last year to USD 92.68 billion from USD 95.7 billion in 2018.

The declining trade was largely attributed to the slowdown of the economies of the two countries.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened at 75.97. During the day, it lost further ground and finally settled at 76.13, down 53 paise over its previous close.

114,04-4-20,"Stock market tumbles, Sensex settles below 28,000","Equity indices spiralled lower for yet another session on Friday, pressured by heavy selling in bank stocks, as the the steady rise in Covid-19 cases fuelled uncertainty over the economic impact of the pandemic. Unabated foreign fund outflows and a depreciating rupee, which skidded below the 76-mark against the dollar, further kept investors on the sidelines, traders said.

After hitting a low of 27,500.79 during the day, the 30-share BSE barometer ended 674.36 points or 2.39 per cent lower at 27,590.95. The NSE Nifty shed 170 points, or 2.06 per cent, to finish at 8,083.80.

During the holiday-truncated week, the Sensex lost 2,224.64 points or 7.46 per cent, while the Nifty sank 576.45 points or 6.65 per cent.

Bank stocks came under heavy selling pressure on Friday after Moody’s Investors Service changed the outlook for Indian banking sector to negative from stable due to the coronavirus crisis.

Axis Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, cracking 9.16 per cent, followed

by IndusInd Bank, ICICI Bank, Titan, SBI, Maruti, HDFC and Asian Paints. On the other hand, Sun Pharma, ITC, ONGC, M&M and Tech Mahindra were among the gainers.

With fresh cases of novel coronavirus mounting by the day, concerns over a looming economic recession kept investors on the edge, traders said. The Asian Development Bank warned on Friday that the Covid-19 pandemic could cost the global economy USD 4.1 trillion as it ravages United States, Europe and other major economies. It also said that India’s economic growth rate will slip to 4 per cent in the current fiscal.

“The Indian markets opened and stayed negative, with reduced volatility. A ratings downgrade for the Banking sector, due to the impact of Covid-19 and ensuing stressed asset concerns, impacted the financial stocks.

“The slide in the markets, after a brief interlude of short recovery, continued during the course of this week , but it is comforting to see that the pace of the fall is relatively feeble now.

115,04-4-20,"Stocks fall on Wall Street, heading for another weekly loss","Stocks are falling in afternoon trading Friday, putting Wall Street on track for its third losing week in the last four.

The losses came after the government said U.S. employers cut 701,000 more jobs than they added last month, the first drop in nearly a decade. Many businesses have screeched to a halt amid attempts to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, and economists say the dire data is only going to get worse.

U.S. stock indexes held steady at first, then headed lower after the price of oil lost some of its momentum. That undercut a rally for energy stocks, which had been helping to keep the overall market's losses in check. Losses accelerated after New York's governor announced the biggest daily jump yet for deaths caused by the coronavirus in the country's hardest-hit state.

The worry is, there's just too much uncertainty, said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research for Nationwide.

The S&P 500 was down 2.5% as of 2:05 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 526 points, or 2.5%, to 20,886, and the Nasdaq was down 2.6%.

Such losses would be striking during a normal market, but since the market began selling off in mid-February, the average down day for stocks has brought an even steeper loss of 3.8%.

It shows that markets have already factored in dismal economic numbers for at least the next few weeks, said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network..

Friday's jobs report likely doesn't even fully capture the extent of the recent job losses, which have been accelerating by the day, because it collected data from before stay-at-home orders were widespread.

There is far worse to come, said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein.

Economists say next month's report may even show the economy has wiped away the last of the 22.8 million jobs created during its nearly decade-long hiring streak.

The S&P 500 is down 27% since its record set in February, reflecting the growing assumption that the economy is set to slide into a sudden, extremely sharp recession.

But the panic selling that dominated the first few weeks of the sell-off has calmed a bit since Washington unleashed massive amounts of aid to help markets and the economy. The Federal Reserve has promised to buy as many Treasury securities as it takes to keep lending markets running smoothly, and Congress approved a 2.2 trillion rescue plan for the economy.

Together, these actions are staggering and unprecedented and will go some distance toward helping to cushion the economic blow of this health crisis and help get the country to the other side, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.

Mizoram’s much awaited coronavirus testing laboratory became operational at the Zoram Medical College on Thursday.

Assam is the gateway to the other Northeastern states, sharing 2,616 km borders with Nagaland (512.1 km), Arunachal Pradesh (804.1 km), Manipur (204.1 km), Mizoram (164.6 km), Tripura (46.3 km) and Meghalaya (884.9 km).

119,04-4-20,4 detained in Indore under NSA for attack on docs,"Four men were on Friday detained under the National Security Act (NSA) for the alleged attack on health workers in Indore even as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said this stringent act will be invoked against quarantined Tablighi Jamaat members accused of misbehaving with the nursing staff at a Ghaziabad hospital.

As sporadic attacks on doctors, social workers and police personnel come to light in the country's battle against the coronavirus outbreak, the UP authorities also said the NSA will be slapped on people who assault policemen enforcing the 21-day national lockdown which entered the 10th day on Friday.

Under the NSA, people can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to the national security or law and order.

President Ram Nath Kovind also voiced concern over the attacks on doctors, health workers and police personnel.

The president was participating in a video-conference with Governors, Lieutenant Governors and Administrators of states/union territories.

""In the conference there was unanimity that there is no scope for laxity or complacency in fighting the invisible enemy. In this context, the president noted with concern the incidents of attacks on doctors, health workers and police personnel in some parts of the country,"" according to a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

The Union Home Ministry asked the states and union territories to take strict action against those involved in the attacks.

The Bollywood fraternity also expressed its solidarity with the healthcare workers who were risking their lives on the front lines of the pandemic, and said the attacks on them were “shameful and condemnable”.

The Indore district Administration invoked the NSA against four men involved in the alleged attack on health workers in the city.

A five-member team from the state health department had gone to Taatpatti Bakhal area on Wednesday to quarantine relatives and acquaintances of a COVID-19 patient, when an unruly mob attacked them with stones, injuring two women doctors.

The police arrested seven persons for the alleged attack on Thursday and the district administration has slapped the NSA on four of them, the official said.

The police on Friday detained six more men in connection with the incident.

Tablighi Jamaat members quarantined at the MMG district hospital in Ghaziabad allegedly misbehaved with nurses, making lewd remarks and dropping their pants, officials said. Chief Minister Adityanath took a serious note of the incident, calling those involved “enemies of humanity”.

“They will neither accept the law nor follow arrangements. Whatever they did with women health workers is a heinous crime. The NSA is being invoked against them. We will not let them go scot-free,"" he said in a statement in Lucknow.

The six Jamaat members were later shifted to a temporary isolation ward set up at a private educational institute following complaints against them. The Jamaat members were among the thousands who attended a religious congregation at the organisation's New Delhi headquarter, now emerging as a coronavirus hotspot.

Police said the Jamaat members were booked for allegedly indulging in ugly acts and passing lewd remarks against the women staff members at the hospital.

A case was registered against them at the GT Road Kotwali on receiving a complaint from the chief medical officer.

SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said stringent action will be initiated. In the complaint, a nurse alleged that the coronavirus suspects were roaming in the hospital without trousers.

The Jamaat members sang vulgar songs and made ugly gestures, the nurse alleged, adding that they were not taking their medicines.

They were also not following social distancing norms, she said in the complaint.

Police have registered the case under Sections 269, 270, 271, 294 and 354 of the IPC, the SSP said. The sections relate to sexual harassment and acts relating to the spread of disease.

A senior UP Home Department official said NSA will be slapped on people who attack policeman enforcing the lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

""The police is doing its duty by preventing people to come out during lockdown. There have been incidents in the state in which policemen were attacked by people. To deter such persons, it has been decided to invoke NSA against such persons,"" the official told PTI in Lucknow. Five persons were arrested and a case registered against them and 10 others for allegedly attacking a police team that was trying to enforce lockdown restrictions at Morna village in Bhopa police station area in Muzaffarnagar, police said.

Two policemen, including the in-charge of the police outpost sub-inspector Lekhraj Singh were seriously injured in the attack that took place on Wednesday, it added.

In another incident in UP, two policemen were injured on Friday when they came under attack by some people, who were stopped from gathering for Namaz in a mosque in Kannauj district, an official said. In Chattisgarh, a policeman was attacked by a group of villagers after he intercepted a man for violating the COVID-19 lockdown in Raigarh district, an official said.

Veteran actors Shabana Azmi, Hema Malini and Rishi Kapoor condemned the attack on medical professionals in Indore. ""Respect. Dr Trupti and Dr Raziya are true role models. And the behaviour of those who pelted them with stones is shameful and condemnable,"" Azmi said on Twitter, referring to the two women doctors who were injured.

Actor-turned-politician Hema Malini said, ""In the midst of the entire country's appreciation of the sacrifices of doctors, health workers and paramedics comes the news of unwarranted attacks on them in Indore by ungrateful miscreants. How could a mob attack people who are risking their own lives to save ours? Sad! Shameful.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/4-detained-in-indore-under-nsa-for-attack-on-docs.html
120,04-4-20,Noida Govt hospital sends back man with virus symptoms with paracetamol: Family,"A man in Noida has developed symptoms for coronavirus but a government hospital here has denied treatment and multiple calls to helpline numbers over the past few days have also yielded no results, his brother claimed on Friday.

The 27-year-old resident of Sector 30 had consulted doctors at a private hospital in the city after he falling ill, his elder brother said, adding now they are trying to go to Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia hospital using personal contacts.

Phone calls and text messages to the Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate and the chief medical officer by PTI for their response went unanswered.

""The private hospital has suggested that we should go for the coronavirus test and that their doctors will no longer be able to see us. We have been trying to get help through the various helpline numbers in Gautam Buddh Nagar over the last four-five days, but in vain,"" the elder brother, 28, told PTI.

""We were told on the helpline that somebody would reach out to us, but nobody did. We sought an ambulance so that we could go to any hospital and go for COVID-19 testing on our own but nobody is helping us,"" he alleged.

The district administration had launched round-the-clock helpline numbers 807662361, 6396776904 (health department) and 0120-2569901 (Noida administration) to provide help to the people but these numbers are not effective, he said.

The brother, an art teacher, said after a lot of effort and help from a city-based journalist they got an ambulance from the 108 service on Friday which took them to a government hospital in Sector 30.

""The helpline numbers in Gautam Buddh Nagar don't work most of the time. Once through, I told them the patient is in a critical condition and needs immediate help. The call attenders are polite but they are not able to provide any solution. Getting an ambulance was also difficult because ambulance drivers said they need order from superiors before attending any call,"" the journalist, who wished not to be named, said.

The brother of the patient, a chef by profession, claimed, ""Today, we went to one of the designated hospitals for COVID-19 cases but the officials there wanted my brother to have a paracetamol and go home. They are not ready to examine him or guide us to a place where he can get treated. We came back walking from the hospital... Now we don't know what to do now.""

He said the family has now got help from a personal contact in Delhi and they might go to the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital for test.

Gautam Buddh Nagar adjoining Delhi in western Uttar Pradesh has so far recorded 50 positive cases of coronavirus and the district has emerged as a major hotspot for the virus across the country, according to official figures.

123,04-4-20,"US, UK and Spain deaths mount","Experts warn that the more than one million cases of COVID-19 confirmed globally are probably just a small proportion of total infections, as testing is not widely available.

With more than 55,000 dead, the threat has never been more stark. Deaths from the global coronavirus epidemic accelerated again on Friday as the US, Spain and Britain grappled with their highest tolls yet and the world economy took a massive hit.

Prosperous countries in Europe and North America are currently bearing the brunt of the disease but — with infections also reported in war zones and refugee camps — there are fears of a new explosion among the world’s most vulnerable.

“The worst is yet to come,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, referring to countries beset with fighting like Syria, Libya and Yemen.

“The COVID-19 storm is now coming to all these theatres of conflict.” For the moment, the United States accounts for around a quarter of confirmed cases, but Europe is far from being out of danger — Spain reported more than 900 deaths in 24 hours on Friday, for the second day running.

While Italy still leads the world in fatalities, France, Belgium and Britain have also been hard hit. The UK Government opened a 4,000-bed field hospital on Friday ahead announcing a its highest one-day toll of 684.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is himself entering a second week of isolation with a high temperature after testing positive for the virus, but Queen Elizabeth is to make an historic address to Britain and the Commonwealth nations on Sunday.

The public health battle being waged across the world ebbed and flowed, with Germany saying the rate of new infections is slowing but once confident Singapore closing schools and workplaces to fend off a possible renewed upsurge in cases.

The virus has now killed more than 10,000 people across Spain, but it spared 29-year-old Javier Lara, who has returned home after being treated in an overburdened intensive care unit and told AFP of his suffering.

“I was panicking that my daughter would get infected. When I started showing symptoms, I said I wouldn’t hold her or go near her,” he said, describing facing death with an eight-week-old as the “worst moment in his life”.

The world economy has been pummelled by the virus and the associated lockdowns, with more than half the population of the planet under some kind of stay-at-home order.

The US economy shed 7,01,000 jobs last month, its worst since March 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis, boosting the jobless rate to 4.4 percent for the first time in 45 years. Things were no better in Europe, where analysts from IHS Markit warned that business activity in the 19-nation eurozone had suffered its worst crunch ever recorded, and the central bank of eurozone member Ireland said its output could be slashed by 8.3 percent this year.

Financial ratings agency Fitch predicted both the US and eurozone economies would shrink this quarter by up to 30 per cent and the Asian Development Bank warned on Friday the global economy could take a $4.1 trillion hit —equivalent to five percent of worldwide output.

China’s central bank became the latest to announce special stimulus measures Friday when it cut reserve requirements for smaller banks in order to release around 400 billion yuan ($56 billion) in liquidity. The outbreak began last year in China, which announced a day of national mourning on Saturday for those who died fighting against the disease. Fourteen deceased frontline workers will be celebrated as “martyrs” of the epidemic.

Australia took the extreme step of banning the 15,000-strong crews of virus-stricken cruise ships from coming ashore — dealing the world’s teetering tourism industry another blow.

Even in the world’s richest country, the US, healthcare providers are under pressure. New Yorkers like COVID-19 survivor Diana Berrent are donating blood plasma in the hope their hard-won antibodies can be used to treat future victims.

“We can be superheroes,” the 45-year-old photographer told AFP. “These are unprecedented, frightening times where everything is beyond our control — except we as survivors can help.” The virus has chiefly killed the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions, but recent cases of deaths among teenagers and babies have highlighted the dangers for people of all ages.

In Kenya, the health ministry said a six-year-old boy had died and in Spain, mothers like 34-year-old Vanesa Muro who gave birth with COVID-19 are warned not to touch their newborns without wearing gloves and masks.

Meanwhile, in northeast Nigeria, aid workers say the virus could rampage through camps for 1.8 million people displaced by a decade-long Boko Haram insurgency.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us--uk-and-spain-deaths-mount.html
124,04-4-20,Poor nations need COVID-19 research to avoid system ‘breakdown’,"Research on the prevention of treatment of COVID-19 in poor and developing nations is urgently needed to avert a “complete breakdown” of health services, a coalition of more than 70 scientific bodies said on Friday.

The pandemic is currently hitting Europe and the United States the hardest, straining even their health systems to the limit. But there are growing fears that widespread coronavirus outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia could prove even more catastrophic. While there are over 600 clinical trials focused on COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccines, there are virtually none planned in resource-poor countries.

With hundreds of millions of people lacking easy access to clean water and sanitation and with many overcrowded urban settings unable to implement social distancing effectively, the stakes are huge. In addition, many health workers lack the necessary protective equipment and training in handling infectious diseases.

“Disruption or complete breakdown of those healthcare systems would result in high direct and indirect mortality since care of all illness would be affected,” said the authors of a letter published on Friday in The Lancet.

The COVID-19 Clinical Reserarch Coalition — an unprecedented consortium of scientists, policymakers, public health experts and researchers — is to make it easier for developing nations to access research data to help inform their response.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/poor-nations-need-covid-19-research-to-avoid-system----breakdown---.html
125,04-4-20,Virus deals end to US hiring; Europe’s hospitals buckle,"The coronavirus outbreak finally snapped the United States’ record-breaking hiring streak of nearly 10 years, while US and European medical workers struggling to save ailing patients Friday watched supplies of medicine, protective equipment and breathing machines dwindle by the hour.

Jobs numbers released in the US showed the virus dealt a swift end to the nation’s 50-year-low unemployment rate, with employers reporting hundreds of thousands of job cuts in March. The true picture, though, is far worse, because the government figures do not include the last two weeks, when nearly 10 million thrown-out-of-work Americans applied for unemployment benefits.

Worldwide, confirmed infections surged past 1 million and deaths topped 54,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Experts say both numbers are seriously undercounted because of the lack of testing, mild cases that were missed and governments that are underplaying the extent of the crisis. Europe’s three worst-hit countries — Italy, Spain and France — surpassed 30,000 dead, or over half of the global toll. From those countries, the view remained almost unrelentingly grim, a frightening portent for places like New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, where bodies are being loaded by forklift into refrigerated trucks outside overwhelmed hospitals.

Shortages of critical equipment led to fierce competition among buyers from Europe, the US and elsewhere. A regional leader in Paris described the scramble to find masks a “worldwide treasure hunt.” Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned that New York could run out of ventilators in six days.

With more than 245,000 people infected in the US and the death toll topping 6,000, sobering preparations were underway. The Federal Emergency Management Agency asked the Pentagon for 100,000 more body bags.

One Spanish hospital turned its library into an intensive care unit. In France, space was set aside for bodies in a vast food market. The French prime minister said he is “fighting hour by hour” to ward off shortages of essential drugs used to keep COVID-19 patients alive.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-deals-end-to-us-hiring--europe---s-hospitals-buckle.html
126,04-4-20,Hydroxychloroquine azithromycin mix dangerous for heart,"As the combined use of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to treat coronavirus patients gains momentum, cardiologists are advising caution because both medications can increase the risk for dangerous abnormal heart rhythms.

In guidance published in the American College of Cardiology publication titled ‘Cardiology Magazine’, cardiologists from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) and Indiana University recommend clinicians who treat COVID-19 patients with the malaria-antibiotic drug combination to also consider monitoring those patients for “ventricular arrhythmia,” which involves the lower heart chambers beating quickly and irregularly and can lead to cardiac arrest.

There are hundreds of drugs that can increase the risk for cardiac arrest, but using two together in patients who are already at risk or critically ill could increase that risk further, the authorswarned.

“While there is yet very little data regarding hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin’s effectiveness as a treatment for COVID-19, some clinicians are considering combining them during this global pandemic,” said lead author Eric Stecker, associate professor of medicine (cardiovascular medicine) in the OHSU School of Medicine and OHSU Knight Cardiovascular Institute.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin-mix-dangerous-for-heart.html

President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last talked on Oct. 16, when Pelosi pointed her finger at the seated president during a heated exchange in a White House meeting that was captured in a widely shared photograph.

Pelosi stormed out, and the two leaders’ frayed relationship was soon severed by the House’s impeachment of Trump months later.

Now, there are worries the broken relationship could hinder the federal government’s ability to respond to the growing coronavirus crisis, the extent of the damage reflected in Thursday’s report that a record 6.6 million people filed for unemployment, adding to more than 3 million from two weeks earlier.

“Relationships are the beginning of everything. Trust in one another is key to cooperation,” said John M. Bridgeland, who held government posts under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

129,04-4-20,The show must go on,"Founder and director of Teamwork Arts Sanjoy K Roy tells Saimi Sattar that in times of social distancing, it is imperative that entertainment and cultural events shift to the online space

If you ask even a non-reader to guess the name of a literary festival which takes place every year at the Diggi Palace at Jaipur, the prompt answer would be Jaipur Literary Festival. That is the kind of traction the JLF, with its celebrity writers, impressive background, cultural spread and large crowds invites. But then the last is certainly an anathema in current times of social distancing. So then Teamwork Arts, the group behind JLF, which is known to keep abreast with changing times, has decided to evolves and announced a digital literature series. Called the Brave New World, it is perhaps the answer to testing times. But then literature also has the power to instill hope when the bleak world doesn’t seem to hold out any.

The aim of the virtual initiative is to celebrate the power and positivity of books and rather than the backdrop of the Diggi Palace, it is powered by the borderless Internet. Scheduled to kick off from April 4 which will see eminent author and advocate Abhinav Chandrachud and journalist Pragya Tiwari, in conversation on the devastating Bombay bubonic plague epidemic of 1896 and its repercussions today.

However, it is not just this particular session but the others as well that are relevant to current times. When we are constantly hooked on to our phones all the time, another conversation is relevant where writer and broadcaster Bee Rowlatt will explore the need to protect the “forum internum” — our private mental space — from the incursions of digital technology — at a session titled Freedom of Thought with Baroness Helena Kennedy.

Similarly, there are writer, politician and public intellectual Shashi Tharoor and President of Observer Research Foundation Samir Saran, co-authors of the recent The New World Disorder and the India Imperative, in conversation and will share their views on the current crisis the world is going through.

JLF is known to be a forum open to discussion, debate and dissent. Walls and Bridges will be a session on dystopian fiction and its increasingly real and uncanny presence in our lives in which Prayaag Akbar, author of Leila (which was adapted into a Netflix series), and Amrita Tripathi, author of The Sibius Knot will share their views.

One wonders if it was easy getting the authors on board for such an exercise where they conduct the session online. “The lucky thing is that nothing is happening these days as everything has been cancelled worldwide. JLF is not a new kid on the block and people know what we do. We have a fairly robust advantage to be able to reach out to a fairly large audience quickly and make these interactions fun, interactive and allow the authors to get out there,” says founder and director of Teamwork Arts Sanjoy K Roy.

When we connect over a phone call to understand more of the move, he is his erudite self. He enquires how newspapers continue to publish in current times and goes on to quote examples from the world to elaborate upon his understanding of the situation. “A report that I read said that the financial losses of this on sports, arts and more has been gauged at one trillion. And you are looking at events like Dubai Expo, Olympics and more. By the way, this calculation is just for May-June! So there is no way we would be able to compensate this through online business. But every crisis ensures that Man tries to paddle furiously to stay alive and afloat like newspapers are doing by going online and what we are also doing,” he says.

The change naturally would bring about drastic transformation in the world the way we know it. “The consequences would be two or three-fold in the Indian scenario where social distancing norms will be in place till October,” says Roy who is at pains to point out that, “We fail to see the pandemic outbreak as primarily a health crisis and focus on the economic aspect. So you need to address the former, first. We need isolation, aggressive testing like Japan and South Korea and try to control the spread by focussing on science and technology to find a vaccine or a medicine to control this. The virus or flu won’t disappear on April 14 when the lockdown ends.”

Coming to the economy, Roy says that in order to ensure a resurgence the need of the hour is ensuring safe places. “There has been a flight of labour which is not coming back in a hurry so supply and production chains will be disrupted. Kickstarting the economy will take another three to six months after the situation has become normal. But by that time everyone would be so used to eating and buying local that any demand would be kicked out of the window. These things certainly do not bode well for the recessionary economic situation that we were coming out of. This has further increased gloom and doom.”

However, Roy besides being pragmatic and well-read also has a tendency to find a silver lining in the situation. He points out that, “The only good thing mentioned in the Boston Consultancy Report is that entertainment will be consumed at a greater level and will go online. And so will the media. In the recovery, entertainment would recover faster but media won’t as it is dependent on advertising , which is disappearing.” However, with social distancing and the fear of infection having been inbuilt into the sub conscience, entertainment will naturally not be on the lines of huge jamborees where success is measured in terms of the number of footfalls. “We are looking more at online products and those that are for online. It is certainly not a rehashing of what we had earlier. But really new stuff which is tailor made for this platform,” he says.

Naturally there arises the question of financial viability. “Subscription, online payment and all that will have to be put into place. We cannot do the same old as it will not work,” says Roy and adds, “So much has gone online so quickly as there are a plethora of options including music, programme, talkshow and more. These have to be looked at differently and given a more of 360 degree look and feel.”

He says that this has become essential since entertainment, as we know it, has changed for a long time to come. “An American survey of about a thousand people had 49 per cent of the respondents saying that they would not go back to a film theatre again. We know that they are more careful but the reality is that we aren’t getting a situation anytime soon when people are rushing off to the Kumbh Melas of the world,” he says.

Incidentally, Teamwork Arts has several other successful cultural festival including Ishaara Puppet Theatre, Mahindra Kabira Festival, The Sacred Pushkar and many other national and international ones under its ever-expanding belt.

Not just entertainment, but even travel for business, entertainment and destination weddings will change. He says, “The information coming out of aviation ministry is that we would consider case by case basis where we can fly. We would not have into place a system that would allow business as usual even after the lockdown, or the peak of infection disappears.”

However, since human beings are essentially social animals, the need to be in touch and connected with others remains. “Every evening there is either a Zoom party or Houseparty that I am attending. These video chats would be the need of the hour. Offline, people would come together but in much smaller numbers. When the virus began to spread two Teamwork colleagues were getting married and there was a grand celebration across cities but then they had a quick court wedding with a lunch where there were just the immediate family members,” says he.

Yes, entertainment will remain but the platform are all set to change in this new world.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-show-must-go-on-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-show-must-go-on-the-show-must-go-on-2020-04-04.html
130,04-4-20,To share or not,"American singer-songwriter Sam Hunt says that he doesn’t know how much of his life should he put out there

Sam Hunt’s sophomore album opens and closes with two of the most personal songs he’s ever written, as he draws from his own life to paint candid portraits for listeners.

But the country star admits he wavers when it comes to spilling his own tea in song form. “I’m torn at times about how much of my own life I want to put out there,” he said.

Southside, the 35-year-old’s sophomore album out Friday, opens with 2016, a remorseful, rueful song that recounts a variety of misdeeds, including chasing other women. It evokes classic country with lyrics like: Put the tears back in your eyes/Cause all my lies could still come true. The album closes with Drinkin’ Too Much, a confessional apology where he namedrops his wife. Hunt, who apologised last November after he was arrested for driving under the influence, released the song on SoundCloud in 2017, a couple months before they were married.

“Sometimes you hear a song or a lyric and you say, ‘Okay, this person couldn’t have made that up, that has to be really about them,’” he said. “The whole honesty is the best policy approach is what I end up circling back to, especially in this genre of music that has always been described as three chords and the truth.”

But not all of the 11-track Southside is a first-person narrative: “It’s definitely not autobiographical.”

In an interview, Hunt — whose multi-hit, Grammy-nominated 2014 debut Montevallo was named after the hometown his wife grew up in — talks about getting deep on songs and testing the waters with pop and rap producers like Diplo and Murda Beatz, who worked on Drake’s massive hit Nice for What.

2016 is a poignant story. Was it hard to write?

Yes, that one is the closest thing to a more honest reflection on my own life experience over the past two years. It touches on a story that I talked about publicly, in terms of what I had going on between putting out the last record and putting out this record, especially year three and four. This song touches on that a little bit and kind of closes the chapter I think more than anything.

Drinking Too Much reminds me of Usher’s Confession from 2004. Did you purposely put it at the end of the album?

I think it’s the only place on the record where it felt appropriate. It just didn’t feel right to put it anywhere else.

The biggest conflict I ever had was about putting that song out. Now that I have put that song out, it’s a lot easier to put out songs that are more honest. That was about as honest of a song as I’ll ever put out or I could ever put out.

Your wife is playing the piano on the song?

I didn’t want to make a big deal over it but I wanted her to. I wanted the song to have her blessing. Just her playing that part, I felt like it brought an energy of healing to the song — more than anything, her approval of it. I wanted to end the song on a hopeful note. I didn’t want it to be a complete down-and-outer. I wanted the listener to hear the redemption in the song and not just ... the dark place that the guy’s in as he’s singing it.

It’s also nice to somehow involve the person you’re singing about in the song.

Yes. Feels like it could be exploitative. That’s the main thing I wanted to avoid is doing that or it even feeling like that.

What was it like trying out recording sessions with pop and hip-hop producers?

I wanted to branch out and find some new inspiration. One of the beauties of writing with the same two people for a long period of time is that you really get to know each other and there’s a level of comfort in the room. There’s a clear understanding of what I would say and how we should approach writing the song. At the same time, you can get too comfortable with your co-writers, so it’s nice to experiment with bringing new people in, writing with new producers to find some new inspiration.

That’s what I was attempting to do for a time there. I wrote with some great writers and wrote with some great producers. (But) I never found that click the way I did with Zach (Crowell).

Who were some of the people you worked with?

I worked with Diplo a little bit, trying to find the right song or the right sound. Another girl, Sasha Sloan (Camila Cabello) ... Sasha is one of the best writers I’ve written with in the past, or ever, really. A guy named Charlie Handsome (Post Malone, Kanye West) was in town for a few weeks, somebody introduced me to him.

Your wedding anniversary is this month — how will you celebrate since we’ll still be stuck at home?

I haven’t thought about it. I don’t have a plan yet. I’m sure it’ll have to be something creative. ...We both do pretty well at the house. At least we have each other to keep each other company.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/to-share-or-not-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/to-share-or-not-to-share-or-not.html

132,04-4-20,"Italian PM tells EU to ‘show more ambition, unity, courage’","Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday extended his feud about coronavirus money with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in the pages of a Roman newspaper.

Conte wrote a letter to Italy’s La Repubblica in response to an apology that von der Leyen had published in the same paper on Thursday.

“I am sorry,” von der Leyen had told Italians. “The EU is with you now.” Conte sounded unimpressed in his letter.

“Dear Ursula,” he wrote. “I hear ideas (from you) not worthy of Europe.” He told her it was time for the EU “to show more ambition, more unity and more courage”.

At issue is billions of euros that Italy wants from the European Union to help fight the novel coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 14,000 people in Italy and shattered the country’s economy. Conte wants the EU to start issuing lots of joint debt —dubbed “coronabonds” — that could let countries such as Italy address the crisis more cheaply. Von der Leyen has sided with Germany and some other northern European countries’ suspicion of pooled risk because it could raise their own borrowing costs at the expense of more indebted countries.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italian-pm-tells-eu-to----show-more-ambition--unity--courage---.html

135,04-4-20,Corona beer producer halts brewing over virus,"The Mexican brewer of Corona beer said Thursday it was suspending production because of the health emergency in the country over the COVID-19 pandemic.

Grupo Modelo — whose brands also include Pacifico and Modelo — said the measure was in line with the Mexican government’s order to suspend all non-essential activities until April 30 to slow the spread of coronavirus.

“We are in the process of lowering production at our plants to the bare minimum,” the company said in a statement, adding it would complete the suspension in the following days.

Mexico’s government has said that only key sectors such as agribusiness will be able to continue to function.

Grupo Modelo said it was ready to operate with 75 percent of its staff working remotely to guarantee the supply of beer, if the Government agreed.

Mexico’s other major beer producer Heineken — which makes the Tecate and Dos Equis brands — could also stop activities on Friday, the Reforma newspaper said, although the company did not confirm the report.

On Wednesday, the northern state of Nuevo Leon, where Heineken’s Mexican operations are based, said it would stop the production and distribution of beer, which led to panic buying.

Since the start of the virus crisis, Corona beer has been the punchline of jokes and memes, and an online rumour said sales in the US dropped by around 40 percent after the outbreak.

However, in late February, Constellation Brands, which owns the Corona label, denied the rumour and said sales had stayed strong in the US even as the virus has spread internationally. Mexico has so far registered over 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 50 deaths.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/corona-beer-producer-halts-brewing-over-virus.html

He called on all governments, groups and people with influence “to urge and pressure combatants around the world to put down their arms,” saying the need is urgent because “the COVID-19 storm” is now coming to all conflict areas.

Guterres told a briefing at UN Headquarters in New York that his appeal 10 days ago was rooted in the recognition that “there should be only one fight in our world today: our shared battle against COVID-19.”

The UN Chief said the appeal is “resonating” across the world, citing a growing number of endorsements for the cease-fire from 70 countries, civil society, religious leaders including Pope Francis, and more than 1 million people in an online petition organized by Avaaz.

He said parties to conflicts in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Colombia, Libya, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen have also expressed their acceptance.

But Guterres said: “There are enormous difficulties to implementation as conflicts have festered for years, distrust is deep, with many spoilers and many suspicions.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/un-chief--ceasefire-appeal-backed-by-parties-in-11-nations.html
137,04-4-20,AI can predict corona patients’ risk if they need ventilators,"As companies the world over commit to make ventilators to meet the demand, researchers are now developing computer models based on artificial intelligence (AI) that calculate the risk of an individual patient’s need for a ventilator or intensive care.

Several non-health companies are now scrambling to produce vents as more and more critical COVID-19 cases are showing up globally.

“With these AI models, hospitals will be able to know — for example —that 40 per cent of their 300 hospitalised patients will probably require a ventilator within one week. This allows them to plan and deploy their resources in the best possible way,” said Mads Nielsen from University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

According to the researchers, algorithms will harvest vast amounts of data from multiple sources.

The data consists of X-rays, tests and measurements taken of patients at the time of their admittance to the hospital, along with their electronic health records. “All data will go to a supercomputer where, within minutes, our model calculates how likely a specific patient is to require a ventilator, and how many days will go by before such a need arises. That’s our goal,” Nielsen said.

Although the models will not be used as a basis for treating individual patients, they will be used as a planning tool that can still make a big difference for hospital staff.

In doing so, doctors hope to identify shared traits among the most severely affected patients. This may turn out to be the number of white blood cells, the use of certain pharmaceuticals or something else.

Researchers said they are aware of certain things that increase risk, such as age, smoking, asthma and heart problems, but there are other factors involved. “After all, we hear about young people who end up on ventilators and older people who do well without understanding why. So let’s get the computer to find patterns that we aren’t able to see ourselves,” explained Espen Solem, Chief Physician, Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospitals.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/ai-can-predict-corona-patients----risk-if-they-need-ventilators.html
138,04-4-20,"For fun, laughter and relief","Actor Rahul Dev tells Sakshi Sharma that his character in Who’s Your Daddy? goes a notch higher with each episode as he explores himself

Given that the Coronavirus pandemic doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon, the promotions of new series and shows, especially the smaller ones, are suffering a major setback. But for actor Rahul Dev, the issues of the world are of a larger concern than his recently released series. “A lot of people find it tough to afford two meals a day. They struggle for their basic needs. We need to be conscious of that and try to help the vulnerable around us. There are bigger world issues at stake. The show is definitely getting affected in terms of its publicity. But we also need to pay attention to the fact that since everyone is at home, watching shows, it is bound to do better. We all have more extra time now than what we did in our normal work days. So the show’s fortune might only benefit from it,” says he.

The actor’s web series Who’s Your Daddy? revolves around his son Soggy (played by Harsh Beniwal) and him, a retired Major Subedar, Prem Singh Barnala. It showcases the day-to-day adventures of the father-son duo. Based in ‘Dilwalon ki Dilli’ they are the coolest family in town. Soggy runs a DVD rental shop and earns a sizeable chunk by renting blue films to boisterous lunching ladies of Delhi’s posh societies. Prem becomes an overnight star with the women patrons of the DVD world and the duo runs a successful business until their world turns upside down.

The actor usually plays negative characters, way different from this one which is predominantly comedy and fun. “Yes, this one is very different. I thought it would be nice to know this character as the Subedar is simple, naive, humorous and straightforward — certainly a package,” says he.

It is a situational comedy. Things happen in a way that they appear funny. “If you play the role sincerely, you don’t have to push yourself to do comedy, it will automatically look comic. You just have to react. For instance, if you look and play a certain way, it becomes comic. Imagine a six feet tall person being scolded by his mother, ‘Ja kaam kar gadhe, kaam kyu nahi karta?’ and he says, ‘Biji main toh retire hoke aa gaya hoon,”’ adds he.

Though the role is quite different, emotional, instinctive and funny, it was not tough for Rahul to play the character. He says:, “It’s very easy because there’s nothing deep and intense in it. It is not that kind of a subject. If I tell you that yes I worked on it, you’ll feel ‘what is he talking about?’ if you ever see the show. I just followed a line — ‘Just be.’ You just have to be yourself and play it simple.”

As the series revolves around the DVD rental shop, one wonders why DVDs as these are outdated in the current scenario. The actor tells us that the show is a flashback story set in 2000s.

With each episode, the actor goes a notch higher as he explores himself. He start out as somebody naive and simple who is self-absorbed. But as he deals with a variety of situations, he gets better. He says, “It was an exploration of various characters because of the journey that the character goes through. He evolves as the show goes on. In the first six episodes, he’s finding himself and later he goes on to form a relationship and understanding with his son and mother. There’s a new start in life. There are beautiful emotional scenes with his mother which often give rise to a lump in the throat.”

As the show explores the father-son relationship, there is something in common with the actor’s personal life. He went through a tough phase when he lost his wife in 2009. Since then he has been a single parent, the experiences of which he shared. So did he relate to the character as it deals with the same? “Except for the fact that I am a single parent, there’s nothing in common. My journey is totally different. In terms of the father-son relationship, I do relate to it a bit but altogether it isn’t the same. When you lose your partner it’s very tragic but this show doesn’t explore those lines,” says Rahul.

Another genre which Rahul really wants to explore is thriller as it is intriguing and engrossing. He finds dark and suspense-driven stories fascinating. “I finished watching the film Heat at 3:30 in the morning. It’s a legendary film. I loved one sequence of six minutes and 16 seconds where two enemies sit in a cafe and have a conversation. Though they both know about each other but there’s mutual respect. No raised voices, banging fists on the table or threats. It’s just a conversation and that’s interesting,” says he. It was interesting to note that the actor who is usually seen doing larger-than-life characters and beating up people, finds two enemies having a conversation interesting. It strikes us that the kind of person is at complete variance with the roles that Rahul has done. “Those characters are not written by me. For example, you might be not be interested in this story. Your heart might be in reporting something else. But you get stuck and you have to choose the best out of what comes your way. So I believe destiny plays a role in this,” says Rahul, raising a thousand questions in our mind.

The actor believes that the platform belongs to the writer and the director primarily. They weave something first and then want you to be a part of it. You might try to play it in your style but it is ultimately their call. For instance, for the Subedar’s character, in two scenes the director wanted him to react in an over the top manner and shout. However, he wanted it a bit subtle because a retired Army personnel would not behave that way. Rahul says, “One can show their disappointment in many ways. You can not talk to your son or just emotionally pour it out. I wanted it to be more expressive.”

He draws life lessons from the role. “My character teaches the audience to go with the flow of life, irrespective of its pace. But I don’t know if people will be able to draw that message out. They will watch it mostly for fun, laughter and relief,” adds he.

(The show is streaming on ALTBalaji and ZEE5).",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/for-fun--laughter-and-relief-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/for-fun--laughter-and-relief-for-fun--laughter-and-relief.html
139,04-4-20,IOC announce new deadline for Oly qualification period,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday that the new deadline for the qualification period for the postponed Tokyo Olympics has been set to June 29, 2021. It further stated that International Federations (IF) of each sport retain full discretion for defining their own respective deadlines and pathways.

“The new qualification period deadline is June 29, 2021 and IFs can define their own qualification period deadlines should the deadline be prior to this date,” said the IOC in a letter addressed to the National Olympic Committees (NOC).

The IOC said that it aims to finalise the qualification systems “by mid-April” with details on specific events to follow when available.

“The priority remains to reflect, where possible, the allocation method/pathway of the original qualification systems for each sport. This principle encourages IFs to follow a like-for-like approach by replacing those lost opportunities that were allocating quota with the same number of events,” it said.

Importantly, the IOC said that in case of sports that have age group-based limits, it is willing to extend the criteria in the case of those athletes who had qualified for the 2020 Olympics.

“The only exception will be if the IF establishes that the one-year relaxation of the upper age limit represents a safety and/or medical risk for athletes. Regarding the eligibility criteria for the lower age limit, if any, the IOC recognises the full authority of IFs to assess the eligibility of those athletes who are not eligible in July 2020 but meet the lower age limit in 2021,” said the IOC.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioc-announce-new-deadline-for-oly-qualification-period.html

142,04-4-20,Bayern extend Flick's contract till 23,"German Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich have handed coach Hansi Flick a new contract keeping him at the club until 2023, the club announced on Friday.

“Bayern are very happy with Hansi Flick’s work. The team has developed well under him and are playing attractive football,” said club CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a statement.

Flick, a former assistant to Germany coach Joachim Loew, took the reins at Bayern in November after his predecessor Niko Kovac was sacked.

Initially hired as an interim solution, the 55-year-old led Bayern from fourth back to the top of the table, and was rewarded with a contract until the end of this season.

With 18 wins in 21 competitive matches at the helm, Flick put Bayern on course for a record-extending eighth successive Bundesliga title before the season was interrupted by the coronavirus crisis.

“Football is facing big challenges. We believe that Hansi is the right head coach for these times,” said sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.

Rummenigge, meanwhile, praised Flick’s “human qualities” and “empathy”.

143,04-4-20,Wimbledon chief fears ‘no more tennis this year',"Wimbledon chief Richard Lewis admitted that he feared the remainder of the 2020 tennis season could be wiped out.

Tennis has been in lockdown since early last month and is not scheduled to return until July 13 at the earliest following the cancellation of Wimbledon on Wednesday.

“I don’t think it’s unrealistic to say that there may be no more tennis this year,” said All England Club chief executive Lewis.

“But I would like to think that things will settle down so that tournaments can be played sooner rather than later. Who knows what will happen?”

Lewis told the Guardian that, despite his fears, he hoped that the season’s next Grand Slam, the US Open in August-September could take place.

“Let’s hope the US Open and Roland Garros (rescheduled to start in Paris a week after the final of the US Open in New York) can take place,” he added.

“The optimist in me — and I am often not optimistic — still hopes the American hard-court season, the big tournaments, the Masters and the Premiers, will take place: Montreal, Toronto and then Cincinnati.

“But we all know that’s probably tenuous at the moment.

Earlier, the president of the Spanish tennis federation, Miguel Diaz, said he hoped the sport could return to the courts “in the last quarter of the year”.

“I think that in the last quarter of the season we will be able to see tennis again, we don’t know if it will be with fans in attendance or without, but I think our sport will return to the courts,” said Diaz.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wimbledon-chief-fears----no-more-tennis-this-year-.html
144,04-4-20,PM seeks support of India’s sports heroes to battle COVID-19,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday turned to India’s sporting heroes for support in the herculean battle to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and more than 40 accomplished champions such as Virat Kohli and P V Sindhu responded by vowing to raise awareness and spirits amid a national lockdown.

The athletes, along with sports minister Kiren Rijiju, participated in nearly an hour-long video call which started at 11am.

From Sachin Tendulkar stressing on the need to keep the vigil even after the lockdown ends on April 14, to sprinter Hima Das expressing sadness at the recent attacks on frontline warriors such as health care workers and police officers, to others sharing their experience of being in a lockdown, the sportspersons had lots to offer during the interaction. All these athletes have been generous donors to the funds being raised to fight the crisis.

The Prime Minister, on his part, sought their support to raise awareness about the need for social distancing and personal hygiene at a time when the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in India has crossed 2,000.

“Your suggestions will be taken note of. We are fighting this pandemic like Team India. I am confident that India will be rejuvenated by the inspiration provided by you,” the Prime Minister can be seen telling athletes in a clip shared by shuttler B Sai Praneeth, a world championship Bronze-medallist, who also attended the call.

All sporting activities are currently shut in the country and it is still not clear when normalcy will resume.

When Ganguly was asked about the development this morning, he said, “Yes, I will be joining our Honourable PM via video call.” But he refused to go into the details.

Cricketers formed a major chunk of the participating list.

Apart from Tendulkar, Ganguly and Kohli, others in the call included top batsman Rohit Sharma, former pacer Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh.

The names of World Cup-winning former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and K L Rahul were in the list of participants but it is learnt that they could not attend the call. Olympic Silver-medallist shuttler Sindhu, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, chess wizard Viswanathan Anand, sprinter Hima Das, boxing star Amit Panghal, wrestler Vinesh Phogat, and teenage shooting sensation Manu Bhaker were among the other accomplished athletes who took part in the video call.

“Of these, 12 have been given three minutes each to speak and present their view,” a ministry source said without revealing the names of the chosen athletes.

It was later learnt that Tendulkar, Ganguly, M C Mary Kom and Kohli were among those who were to speak during the interaction.

“I suggested that as much as possible, I will use our way of greeting — saying Namaste instead of shaking hands, even after we overcome this pandemic,” Tendulkar said after the interaction.

“I told him that it is sad that health care workers and police have been attacked,” said Asian Games medallist Hima Das, who is employed with Assam Police as a DSP.

However, six-time world champion Mary Kom could not connect to the call due to network issues.

Among those who managed to, former world champion weightlifter Mirabai Chanu said the PM urged everyone to be united in the fight to combat the pandemic. “The PM asked us to spread awareness on social distancing and hygiene. He spoke about how we need Virat’s (Kohli) fighting spirit to win this battle,” added veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal.

World championship Silver-winning shooter Abhishek Verma said the PM urged athletes “to be positive and spread positivity”.

“He said appreciate and highlight the work of frontline workers. Take good care of yourself and family at home. He asked us to e-mail any suggestions we have on how to handle the situation better,” Verma said.

The Prime Minister said the ability to face challenges, self-discipline, positivity and self-belief, which are essential to sports, are crucial tools to combat the spread of the virus as well.

Olympic-bound archer Deepika Kumari said the PM advised the athletes to keep their immunity levels high during a time when they are not getting enough training exposure.

“PM Sir urged us to post videos about the awareness campaign. He gave us a few pointers like Laxman Rekha (Don’t cross the line while maintaining social distancing); Sankalp Lena (Taking a pledge not to step out)

“He said Dhairya Rakhna (don’t press the panic button). He also advised us to boost our immune system and stay fit by doing daily exercises,” she revealed.

Tennis player Ankita Raina said the PM equated the virus to an unknown opposition.

“(He) told us that athletes are stronger mentally and have the quality to adapt to different conditions and in unknown territories. So he wanted us to spread the positive and encouraging message since this is also an unknown territory (fight against coronavirus),” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm-seeks-support-of-india---s-sports-heroes-to-battle-covid-19-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pm-seeks-support-of-india---s-sports-heroes-to-battle-covid-19.html
145,04-4-20,Cummins feels nice about skipper Paine picking him as contender for future Test captaincy,"Australia fast bowler Pat Cummins feels nice about skipper Tim Paine rating him as one of the contenders for future Test captaincy but says the topic is just a moot point as the wicket-keeper is still playing.

Discussions about who should lead Australia whenever the 35-year-old Paine retires are ongoing. Former captain Steve Smith's leadership ban has also expired.

Earlier this week, Paine named Smith, Cummins, Travis Head, Alex Carey and Marnus Labuschagne among those who could take up the captaincy.

Former skipper Michael Clarke has long been pushing for Cummins -- the current vice-captain -- to lead the national side.

""It's nice to hear, (I) don't think it makes me want it more or less. I'm glad being a vice-captain underneath him that I get that nod. He's brilliant,"" Cummins was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

""Like I've said a hundred times before, I kind of feel it's not quite right talking about captaincy now when we've got someone like Painey and Finchy (limited-overs captain Aaron Finch) doing great jobs. We'll see down the track, but at the moment it's bit of a moot point.""

The 26-year-old Cummins, who has taken 143 wickets from 30 Tests since making his debut in 2011, is expected to top Cricket Australia's contract list for 2020-21 whenever it is announced, underling his importance in Justin Langer's team.

The 26-year-old has become the most resilient member of the attack after an injury-plagued start to his career. He was appointed one of Paine's deputies last year, but currently has no captaincy experience at the domestic level.

""In the perfect world, your first experience of being captain - say Australian captain, you've (already) had quite a bit of experience leading and you know exactly what it entails,"" he said.

""But things don't always work out as exactly as you planned.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cummins-feels-nice-about-skipper-paine-picking-him-as-contender-for-future-test-captaincy-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cummins-feels-nice-about-skipper-paine-picking-him-as-contender-for-future-test-captaincy.html
146,04-4-20,When hope is her decision,"Author Anwesa Chaudhury tells Ayushi Sharma that even as the world seems to be engulfed by negativity, the existence of hope cannot be denied

We are living in a world where hope seems to be dwindling each day and very soon we may find ourselves without it. Through the eyes of a teenager, this seems all the more terrifying and dismal because this is their future. Bleak Hope, a collection of poetry written by teenage author, Anwesa Chaudhury, as she lives in anguish and views the destruction of the world with a heavy heart has been published by Notion Press.

Excerpts of the interview:

How did you first conceptualise the book? What was the idea behind it?

I have always loved reading poetry. I started penning my thoughts when I saw how disturbing these real life situations have become. Today, it is easy to call teenagers oversensitive, entitled and babied. Though, to some extent, this criticism is not wrong, however, if looked at closely, they face challenges that could be difficult for anyone. They are living in a completely different world, as compared to few decades ago. There was no agenda to publish my feelings but when I had finished writing about 40 to 45 poems during the last three years, my parents said, ‘why not publish them?’ They encouraged me to do so because I wanted to reach other kids of my age. I wanted them to feel that they are not going through the roller coaster ride of emotions alone. Publishing my thoughts was the only way out.

Are there any real life incidents that you can share with the reference to the book?

I started writing after experiencing some unusual incidents in our society. I wanted to express them in my way. That Night was my first poem, which delves into the life of children who beg for a living. We all have come across such kids but rarely have we paused and thought about their situation. The poem presents a contrast between my life and theirs as it’s a dream that I saw lying on my comfortable bed.

On The Streets was about the homelessness in California. The Unwanted was written after reading the news that Algeria expels refugees and asks them to walk through the Sahara. Real Men Don’t Hurt is all about violence against women.

All these are inspired from real life incidents.

On one hand there are deaths and suffering, wars and destruction, rapid degeneration of the environment and child abuse while on the other there are glimmer of hope and feeling of love. How did you try to keep a balance between two extreme situations?

A coin has two sides. One part of world shows and throws negativity at us, whereas the other end makes us experience kindness and existence of humanity. I believe in positive affirmations. Though I read and see a lot of negativity, I always feel that there is room for positivity where people help one another, a world of love and kindness. I have seen people going out of their way to help others. I feel in my heart that there are silver linings.

My poems express the despair and despondency that shrouds and suffocates us, speak of that glimmer of hope, the feeling of love and the chance for new beginnings. These poems stand tall as a witness to the hope that struggles to strive, fights to breathe and accomplishes to thrive in the midst of all the gloominess.

As the book explores the lines: Even as the world seems to be engulfed in the wave of negativity, the existence of hope cannot be denied. What keeps you motivated?

Though the world is going through a lot of darkness. I still think that there is still hope in humanity and in the beauty of nature and that keeps me motivated. The existence of human, world and nature is mere proof of positivity and ray of hope.

We often feel a plethora of emotions looking at the harsh realities of the world. But how difficult is it to make an emotion come alive through words?

For me it is not difficult because when I feel a particular emotion, words come naturally to my mind. I feel I am blessed with the ability to express. Not everybody has that kind of power.

What does the future of written world look like since we are swamped by digital entertainment?

Things have moved rapidly into a digital world. It’s true that ebooks save space on bookshelves and provide convenience, selection and portability. However, there are somethings that will always be valued in their original form. There is something about the smell of a new book and physically turning a page, allowing the reader to have an experience that involves all of the senses. Nothing can replace that impact.

147,04-4-20,Writers must ‘document’ pandemic: Lost Children author,"Cooped up at her Bronx home with her daughter and a niece because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mexican writer Valeria Luiselli says she has lowered the “volume and speed” of her life. She is arranging books in alphabetical order, planting legumes on her balcony and listening to old recordings from Argentinian author Julio Cortázar. Her rhythm has slowed but not the accolades and awards for her latest novel, Lost Children Archive, which last week was honored with the British Rathbone Folio Prize. The book, Luiselli’s third novel, is part fiction part documentary: A family’s American road trip mixed with the stories of migrant children along the Mexico-US border.

Luiselli accepted the prize at a ceremony held online because of Coronavirus pandemic. The 36-year-old writer said she’s sad that she could not be in London to receive it in person but grateful to see people keeping the faith in books. “The fact that the literary community is still in full swing, even from their homes, and behind their screens, is moving and encouraging,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I think it is my duty, and the duty of every writer, whether is a science-fiction writer, a journalist, a poet, each at their own pace and within their own capacities, to document this moment,” she said.

Lost Children Archive has also won the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, and a Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Literature. It is a finalist for The National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction.

Luiselli’s inspiration came from the immigration crisis of 2014, when thousands of children were trying to enter the US in search of asylum, fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. The author said she started paying attention to how that story was being told, both in the media or at casual conversations in diners in Arizona. “I started asking myself how (the migrant) children of this generation were going to eventually tell this story, what were they going to say about this reality — that on one hand was very real but on the other seemingly implausible — about thousands of children in a migratory limbo,” she said.

In New York, she started volunteering with nonprofits as an interpreter in immigration court, writing down the interviews she did with migrant children so attorneys could help them out. That experience led to an essay about immigration, Tell Me How It Ends, in 2017. Lost Children Archive came in February 2019.

Born in Mexico City, Luiselli grew up in South Korea and South Africa, among others. She speaks both English and Spanish and can write in either language. In addition to writing during her seclusion, she’s reading out loud to her family and taking photos. “We are going to need this narrative fabric, some sort of fabric for us to lay down once we overcome this.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/writers-must----document----pandemic--lost-children-author-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/writers-must----document----pandemic--lost-children-author.html
148,04-4-20,Clubs risk CL axe if seasons not completed: UEFA,"UEFA and Europe’s top clubs have stated their determination that the current football season should be played to a conclusion and threatened that teams may be excluded from the next Champions League if their domestic competitions are ended prematurely.

In a joint letter released late on Thursday, UEFA, the European Club Association (ECA), and the European Leagues body representing nearly a thousand clubs in 29 countries, said that they were working on the possibility of playing on into July and August if need be.

The Champions League and Europa League — both of which are frozen in the last-16 stage — could be completed once the domestic seasons are finished, and “stopping competitions should really be the last resort after acknowledging that no calendar alternative would allow to conclude the season.”

The joint response came after the Belgian Pro League announced on Thursday that it recommended declaring the season over with the present table accepted as final.

It is the first European league to take such a measure, although more could follow.

That means Club Brugge would in theory go straight into the next Champions League group stage, but UEFA, the ECA and the European Leagues indicated that they may be barred from continental competition if the Belgian league decision is finalised.

“It is of paramount importance that even a disruptive event like this epidemic does not prevent our competitions from being decided on the field, in accordance with their rules and that all sporting titles are awarded on the basis of results,” the joint letter said.

“We are confident that football can restart in the months to come — with conditions that will be dictated by public authorities — and believe that any decision of abandoning domestic competitions is, at this stage, premature and not justified.

“Since participation in UEFA club competitions is determined by the sporting result achieved at the end of a full domestic competition, a premature termination would cast doubts about the fulfilment of such condition.”

The letter concluded: “UEFA reserves the right to assess the entitlement of clubs to be admitted to the 2020/21 UEFA club competitions.”

There have been calls in other countries for this season to be declared null and void, but any option which rules out completing this season could have serious consequences for leagues reliant on huge television deals and who could find themselves having to reimburse broadcasters if remaining matches are not played.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/clubs-risk-cl-axe-if-seasons-not-completed--uefa.html

Raina has already done his bit in this fight against the deadly virus by donating Rs 52 lakh.

Ask him about the IPL, which has been postponed to April 15 but is unlikely to take place in the near future, Raina says “it is all about life” at the moment.

“Life is most important at this point of time. IPL can surely wait. We all need to follow the government guidelines on lockdown else we all face the consequences. When life gets better, we can think about the IPL. So many people are dying at the moment, we need to save lives,” Raina said.

Raina, whose last competitive game was the IPL final last year, was busy preparing for the 2020 edition in Chennai before the nationwide lockdown was announced. The tournament was also supposed to be M S Dhoni’s comeback event.

“It was a nice camp. I was there for two months but then this happened. Got to spend some time with Dhoni. He was batting so well in the nets, he had the hunger of a younsgter. In one session, he batted for three hours at a stretch,” recalled Raina.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/life-is-most-important-now--ipl-can-wait--raina.html
150,04-4-20,SA cricketers symptom-free after returning from India,"All the South African players, who returned from their incomplete ODI tour of India, were found to be symptom-free of coronavirus and those who underwent tests returned negative, according to the team’s chief medical officer Shuaib Manjra.

The Proteas, who returned from India on March 18, completed a 14-day period of self-isolation on Thursday, but will remain in lockdown for the next two weeks just like the rest of the country.

“All the players were symptom-free and those who opted to perform the tests returned negative results,” Manjra was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

The first match in Dharamsala on March 12 was washed out while the second and third games to be played in Lucknow and Kolkata — on March 15 and 18 respectively — were called off indefinitely.

South Africa is in the midst of a 21-day nationwide lockdown, which prohibits leaving home except to buy food or medicine and does not allow for any outdoor exercise.

CSA’s focus now is on maintaining the players’ fitness and trainer Tumi Masekela has sent all the players their training programmes.

“We’ve got time now to work with players in terms of addressing the small niggles that they may have. They have got time to rest and also to do the strength work,” he said.

“But the one big thing is the running volume, the aerobic capacity base, which I am going to try and build up in the next two weeks, so that means lot of running, or a lot of cardio work, cycling or swimming.”

152,04-4-20,Indian badminton goes online,"With courts out of bound due to the lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian badminton has gone online with chief national coach Pullela Gopichand handing out tips through videos to the country’s top shuttlers.

Staying away from the game can affect fitness of the players and so Gopichand has started putting in place a program for the shuttlers, albeit, through Whatsapp, an application which allows users to send text, voice and video messages.

“We can only do fitness (training) because nobody has access to courts so we are doing what we can. I am sending the players videos of what to do in our Whatsapp group,” Gopichand said.

“It is a generic program but it is tuned in such a way that it caters to the people (Olympic bound) who are important,” explained the 46-year-old, who is waiting for his three-week isolation to be over on Saturday.

Apart from Gopichand, Jamshedpur-born trainer Dinaz Vervatwala, who has worked with London Olympics Bronze-medallist Saina Nehwal, is also taking fitness classes for the Indian shuttlers via Zoom app, a platform for video communication.

The men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, who were assured of a place in the Olympics, is also part of the group which is following the tips.

“Gopi sir sends us program schedule everyday on Whatsapp. It involves mainly meditation, wall practice where I hit the shuttle on the wall, play my strokes and drives, which helps to strengthen the forearm,” Chirag said.

“We are also doing at least an hour of training in the evening with a trainer. Dinaz does a video-call through Zoom app and everybody joins in and then we practice together.”

Talking about the programs, Satwik said: “Gopi sir’s program is a combination of a lot of things like wall practice, skipping, small exercises, breathing exercises, it is more like simulating the actions whatever is possible at home to stay sharp.

“Every alternate day, we also have Dinaz taking our fitness classes. She gives us very interesting and different fitness programs, so it is fun. Almost everyone is there, Sikki (Reddy), Ashwini (Ponnappa), Sai (B Sai Praneeth), Guru (RMV Gurusaidutt), Kashyap (Parupalli) and (HS) Prannoy,” Satwik said.

While online sessions can keep the shuttlers fit mentally and physically for the time being, to get back to being match ready might be challenging once BWF restarts the international calendar.

However, Gopichand assured that players will get at least six weeks to prepare for tournaments once there is resumption.

“We don’t know when the badminton circuit will start but whenever it starts, they will give you 6-8 weeks of headstart,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-badminton-goes-online.html

156,04-4-20,India to go for quicker antibody test,"5L kits procured to conduct test in Covid hotspots in urban, rural clusters

Come Saturday and India will introduce a new way of testing that would identify coronavirus infection through detection of antibody in a patient.

The rapid antibody tests, also known as serology test, will be carried out first in “hotspot” regions in urban and rural clusters. India has reportedly procured nearly 5 lakh such antibody-based rapid testing kits already.

This is not a confirmatory test but the result will come much quicker and will have to be confirmed by an RTPCR test using throat or nasal swab to detect the presence of genetic material of the coronavirus.

In the antibody tests, blood testing is done to trace virus in the human body instead of the traditional testing of nasal or throat swab. The outcome will show whether a person had contacted the disease and recovered on his own.

The rapid tests will be conducted on symptomatic cases and even those with “milder symptoms”. The decision follows concern regarding spread of the disease after the exodus of workers from cities to their villages and the recent spread of the infection through Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area which the Government has identified as one of the 71 risk hotspots.

The Government told the Supreme Court that there is a possibility that 30 per cent of these people are already carrying novel coronavirus infection.

Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal on Friday at a Press briefing said from Saturday antibody rapid tests will be conducted and a guideline in this regard is in the final stage.

Following decision by the empowered group, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had issued an interim advisory on Thursday on the use of the rapid antibody test and has finalised modalities in this regard.

So far, the ICMR has given approval to 12 antibody-based rapid test kits for novel coronavirus detection, which will hit the Indian pharma market soon. Seven of these are from China, and the other five are from the United States and Singapore. At present, symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days, symptomatic contacts of positive Covid-19 cases and symptomatic healthcare workers are tested for coronavirus. Apart from this, on March 21, the Government and ICMR revised its strategy to include all hospitalised patients of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) for testing.

Currently, China, South Korea, Japan and the US are manufacturing antibody testing kits to detect Covid-19. An ICMR official said presently there are a total 182 labs, including 52 in private sector that have been approved by the ICMR.

“Widespread antibody testing could also provide key data for efforts to model the course of the pandemic. Current predictions vary so widely, causing some scientists to question the need for severe containment methods such as lockdowns and social distancing. By indicating how much of the population is already immune because of mild infections, antibody data could offer a key to how fast the virus will continue to spread,” says write up in the Science magazine. .

Meanwhile, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has appealed to patients and their families not to create any obstacle in the path of doctors and expressed concerns over misbehaviour with doctors.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-to-go-for-quicker-antibody-test-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-to-go-for-quicker-antibody-test.html

After clapping and beating of utensils, now it is time to light up lamps to “show solidarity in the fight against Covid-19”. Light candles, diyas and mobile torches at 9 pm this Sunday for nine minutes to energise self and the country to wage a decisive fight against coronavirus, says Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“This Sunday on April 5, we have to challenge coronavirus. I need your nine minutes at 9 pm. Switch off the lights of your house. Light up a candle, lamp or use the mobile torch. This light will show that we are together in this battle,” said the Prime Minister in a nationwide address this morning.

He asserted no one must gather on roads. “The only way to break the chain of coronavirus is to maintain social distancing,” he said. Modi said amid the nationwide lockdown to fight coronavirus, none should feel alone, the massive collective power of 130 crore people is with everyone.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus, Modi has been giving tips to the citizens to cope with the situations emerging from the lockdown, in force since midnight March 25.

The PM’s message came a day after he held a meeting with the Chief Ministers and asked them to “formulate a common exit strategy to ensure staggered re-emergence of the population once the lockdown ends” on April 14.

Modi stated that many were worried about how many days this will continue, PM Modi said, “While this is a lockdown, don’t think you are alone in this process. We are all together in this,” he said thanking the people for their cooperation.

The Prime Minister thanked the States for supporting the decision of lockdown due to which India has achieved some success in limiting the spread of COVID-19. He praised how all the States have worked together as a team to check the spread of the virus. He, however, forewarned that the global situation remains far from satisfactory and informed about speculation of a possible second wave of spread of the virus in some countries.

Modi outlined that the common goal for the country is to ensure minimum loss of life.

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said he listened to the “Pradhan Showman” where there was nothing about how to ease people’s pain, their burdens, their financial anxieties”.

While former Finance Minister P Chidambaram advised the PM to listen to the Opposition and to the wise counsel of epidemiologists and economists, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra asked Modi to “get real” and provide a fiscal package to protect poor workers. “Turn out lights and come on balconies,” she asked in a tweet.

“Get real Mr Modi. Give India fiscal package worth 8-10 per cent of GDP. Ensure immediate wages to construction and other labour during lockdown -- laws exist permitting this. Stop gagging real press in name of curbing fake news,” said the TMC leader.

Chidambaram questioned why the Government had not announced a second Financial Action Plan for the poor amid the three-week nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

“What we expected from you today was FAP II, a generous livelihood support package for the poor, including for those categories of poor who were totally ignored by the Finance Minister on March 25,” he tweeted.

“Every working man and woman, from business person to daily wage earner, also expected you to announce steps to arrest the economic slide and re-start the engines of economic growth.”

He said people were disappointed on both the counts, adding that “symbolism is important, but serious thought to ideas and measures is equally important”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/opp-slams-pm--says-expected-financial-plan.html

The Chief Medical Officer of MMG Hospital in his letter to the Ghaziabad Police stated, “The members of the Tablighi Jamaat who are kept at the isolation ward of the hospital, have been roaming in their wards naked.”

Calling those involved in the indecent behaviour with female members of the nursing staff “enemies of humanity”, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, “They will neither accept the law nor follow arrangements. Whatever they did with women health workers is a heinous crime… The NSA is being invoked against them.”

Yogi directed that no women health worker or police personnel be deployed in service of Tablighi Jamaat members. “Women officers and workers should not be deployed to treat and provide security to quarantined Tablighi Jamaat members. Only male health staff and cops will be posted in such wards housing Jamaat members,” said a statement issued by the State Government on Friday.

In the complaint, a nurse alleged that the Tablighi members roamed without their trousers in the hospital, sang vulgar songs and made ugly gestures towards female staff.

The nurse added that they were neither taking their medicines nor following social distancing norms.

The Ghaziabad police said the Jamaat members were booked for indulging in ugly acts and passing lewd remarks against the women staff members at the hospital. A case was registered against them at the GT Road Kotwali on receiving a complaint from the chief medical officer.

The NSA allows preventive detention up to 12 months without a charge if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to the national security or law and order.

Ghaziabad Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani said stringent action will be taken against them. Police have registered the case under Sections 269, 270, 271, 294 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code, the SSP said. The sections relate to sexual harassment and actions which spread disease.

164,04-4-20,Maulana Saad replies to police notice through son,"Nizamuddin's Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Mohd. Saad Kandhalvi has admitted that the crime branch of Delhi Police has issued a notice to him along with a questionnaire.

Maulana Saad's son and Jamaat Committee member Mohd. Yusuf Saad gave a written statement to IANS on Friday. According to Yusuf the statement was drafted in consultation with the Maulana.

""Media reports about the Jamaat headquarters since March 31 are only a part of conspiracy and attempt to defame the Markaz. Tablighi Jamaat doesn't have any connection with any political party,"" the statement read with the acceptance that the crime branch has registered a case against Maulana saad.

Maulana Saad, in his written statement, has termed the incident of Jamaat headquarters guests being positive for coronavirus, ""a co-incidence"" only.

""This is a co-incidence. As soon as we got to know about the coronavirus, we banned the entry of guests in the headquarters. We have a record of every guest. The Jamaat headquarters made all possible efforts to send back all the guests to their homes,"" Maulana Saad said in his statement.

The statement further read: ""Soon after the Prime Minister declared complete lockdown on the midnight of March 24 following the Janata Curfew, the government machinery had stopped the event organised at the Jamaat headquarters. The event was postponed for undeclared time. In the last few days, all people who have attended the event, whether they are Indians or foreigners, have been evacuated. They have either been quarantined at various places or been hospitalised"".

According to the statement: ""FIR number 63/2020 has been filed with the New Delhi Crime Branch and a notice has been served against this under Section-91 of CrPC. The crime branch has asked for all documentary evidences in this notice"".

According to a source, in a reply to the crime branch on Friday, the Jamaat headquarters said: ""The police have sealed the markaz. Most of the agents of Maulana Saad are now in quarantine homes. Hence, it is impossible to provide these evidences. So, when the Jamaat headquarters will be opened and all managers will be assembled, the crime branch will be provided with the evidences"".

169,04-4-20,Putin says Russia ready to cooperate on cutting oil production,"Russia is ready to cooperate with Saudi Arabia and the United States to cut oil production, President Vladimir Putin said Friday.

Putin said Russia was willing to make agreements within the framework of the OPEC+ group and that ""we are ready for cooperation with the United States of America on this issue,"" according to a statement published by the Kremlin.

""I believe that it is necessary to combine efforts in order to balance the market and reduce production."" Oil prices have tumbled in recent weeks in the face of a drop in demand and global economic uncertainty over the new coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, OPEC and its allies failed to reach a deal on oil production cuts after OPEC+ leader Moscow refused to tighten supply to counter the effects of the coronavirus outbreak.

Speaking with Energy Minister Alexander Novak via conference call, Putin said Russia was prepared to discuss ""a reduction in the volume of about 10 million barrels a day, a little less, maybe a little more."" He said Russia was in close contact with partners Saudi Arabia and that he recently spoke to US President Donald Trump.

The Kremlin on Thursday denied Putin spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after Trump made the claim on Twitter, and oil prices rocketed.

Putin's comments come as the OPEC group of oil producers led by Saudi Arabia plan to meet Monday via videoconference, according to a source close to the organisation. (AFP)

170,04-4-20,France reports record 588 more coronavirus deaths,"France on Friday reported 588 more coronavirus deaths in hospital, its biggest 24-hour toll in the country since the epidemic began.

The new deaths brought to 5,091 the total number of people who have died in hospital of COVID-19 in France, top health official Jerome Salomon told reporters.

There is no daily toll for those who have died of COVID-19 in old people's homes in France. But Salomon said that a total of 1,416 people had died in such establishments from COVID-19 during the epidemic. This brings the total French toll to at least 6,507.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed outside that have to be justified with a signed piece of paper.

In a glimmer of hope, Salomon said that 1,186 more people had been hospitalised suffering from the coronavirus with 263 more entering intensive care, the lowest such increases for over a week.

He said that there were a total of 64,338 confirmed cases in France, an increase of 5,233 on the day earlier. But this does not include all cases as testing is not universal.

According to Salomon there was a reduction in emergency phone calls and while it was too soon to say this was a trend it was ""good news"".

""We cannot analyse the situation based on one number and one day but we have noticed this decrease,"" he said.

Despite the decrease in growth of intensive care patients ""we have still not reached the peak of this wave and even less its diminution,"" he added.

On what in usual times would be a weekend where French families would decamp en masse for the Easter holidays, Salomon repeated official warnings that vacationing was out of the question.

""This evening above all. Stay at home if you want to save lives,"" he said.

Asked about apparent mixed messages over the course of the crisis concerning whether people should wear sanitary masks, Salomon said they could help but gave no indication whether this would be obligatory. (AFP)

Citing health bulletin report on coronavirus, the CM said Delhi has 384 positive cases, out of which 58 patients have a history of foreign travel while 259 patients are from the Markaz event and 38 cases are of the nature of local transmission from foreign travel.

91 new positive cases were reported in the last 24 hours.

“The two new patients are a man (55) and his son (25) from Sector 93B in Noida,” a Health official said.

Two other people who had earlier tested positive for COVID-19 were discharged from hospitals after treatment, taking the total number of cured patients to eight, the officials said.

They added that the total number of active cases now stands at 42 in the district. Gautam Buddh Nagar adjoining Delhi in western Uttar Pradesh is one of the hotspots for coronavirus in India and in the State.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal said the situation of corona outbreak in Delhi is under control. The national Capital reported a total of five corona deaths, one new death of the patient, who was taken out of the Markaz, has been reported in the last 24 hours.

“Information on HRCs, COVID-19 symptoms, measures taken by the Delhi Government to deal with the pandemic and all other information can be gathered from this number,” he said.

Urging people to follow lockdown, he said efforts of the Delhi Government, the Central Government and the people have been able to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi, as a result of which the cases of local transmission have been just 38.

He said out of all the patients who have been admitted to the hospitals, two patients have been put on a ventilator, and the rest of the patients are stable.

“The COVID-19 lockdown announced by the Prime Minister should be followed strictly. We have to learn from other nations and follow social distancing and lockdown norms stringently,” Kejriwal said.

“I am holding regular meetings with the health department of Delhi and the doctors. God forbid, if there is an outbreak of corona, we are fully prepared to handle the situation,” he said.

Lauding the AAP’s effort, he said the Delhi Government has taken several measures to provide relief to the marginalised, who have been affected by the lockdown the most. “72 lakh people are being provided 7.5 kg ration each at our distribution shops and around 60 per cent of people have already received ration and the remaining will receive soon. We have also devised a scheme to provide ration to those who do not have ration cards, and in a few days, we will start providing ration to them as well,” Kejriwal said.

He said, “Around 8 lakh senior citizens, widows, and differently-abled have received Rs 5,000 as under the different pension schemes. Rs 5,000 will further be provided to them in the next week, or in another 10-15 days. Construction workers have also been provided Rs 5,000 as relief assistance and all the public service vehicle drivers, including auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, gramin-sewas, RTVs, etc, will also be provided relief assistance of Rs 5,000 each.”

“To ensure no person in Delhi goes hungry, 1780 HRCs have been opened in Delhi, and lunch and dinner are being provided at these HRCs.

These shelters can accommodate 57,270 people, and 11443 people are living in these shelters,” he added.

Kejriwal, Education Minister Manish Sisodia and experts will interact with the 44 lakhs students of Delhi on Saturday at 3pm. These students are studying in Government, private and MCD schools.

“Our Government and private schools have around 44 lakh students, and I am sure they have a lot of questions now that they are sitting in their homes. Tomorrow at 3 pm, I, Manish Sisodia, and a few experts will interact with all students and parents of Delhi. Children have too many questions about corona, its symptoms and nature.

178,04-4-20,Coronavirus may spread through normal breathing: US scientists,"The new coronavirus might spread through the air via normal breathing and speaking, a top US scientist said Friday as the government was poised to recommend the use of face masks for everyone.

Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told Fox News the guidance on masks would be changed ""because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak, as opposed to coughing and sneezing.""

As it stands, the official advice is that only sick people need to cover their faces, as well as those caring for them at home.

Fauci's comments come after the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) sent a letter to the White House on April 1 that summarized recent research on the subject.

It said that though the research isn't yet conclusive, ""the results of available studies are consistent with aerosolization of virus from normal breathing."" Until now, US health agencies have said that the primary pathway of transmission is respiratory droplets, about one millimeter in diameter, expelled by sick people when they sneeze or cough.

These quickly fall to the ground around a meter away.

But if the virus can be suspended in the ultrafine mist we expel when we exhale, in other words an aerosol, it becomes much harder to prevent its spread, which in turn is an argument in favor of everyone covering their faces.

A recent NIH funded study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could become an aerosol and remain airborne for up to three hours.

This triggered a debate even as critics said the findings were overblown because the team behind the study used a medical device called a nebulizer to deliberately create a viral mist and argued this would not occur naturally.

The NAS letter pointed to preliminary research by the University of Nebraska Medical Center that found the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its RNA, were found in hard to reach areas of patients' isolation rooms. (AFP)

180,04-4-20,Netflix donates Rs 7.5 crore to help daily wage workers in India,"Streaming platform Netflix on Saturday announced that it will contribute Rs 7.5 crore to Producers Guild of India (PGI) Relief Fund to help daily wage earners in the entertainment industry in the country.

This fund, which was set up last month by PGI, will provide emergency short term relief to thousands of daily wage earners in the Indian creative community, who have been directly impacted by the closure of film, TV and web productions in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""We're grateful to be working with the Producers Guild of India to support the hardest hit workers in TV and film production - from electricians to carpenters, hair and makeup artists to spot boys. Crews in India have always been vital to Netflix's success and now we want to do our part and help those who most need support in these unprecedented times,"" Netflix spokesperson said in a statement.

Siddharth Roy Kapur, President, Producers Guild of India said, he values Netflix's contribution to the fund.

I am proud of and thankful to the entire fraternity for contributing to the fund we have created to support our colleagues at this difficult time. We value Netflix's generous commitment to this fund and their resolve to help those who need our help the most.

In addition to this, in India, Netflix has also committed up to four weeks of pay to help all core below-the-line crew and cast who were scheduled to work on the streamer's productions in India, which were forced to be suspended due to coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Netflix announced USD 100 million fund to help the creative community across the world.

While most of the fund is pledged towards supporting the hardest hit workers on Netflix productions around the world, USD 15 million of the fund will go to third parties and non-profits providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast in the countries where Netflix has a large production base. The platform's Rs 7.5 crore contribution to PGI fund is part of this USD 15 million fund.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/netflix-donates-rs-7-5-crore-to-help-daily-wage-workers-in-india-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/netflix-donates-rs-7-5-crore-to-help-daily-wage-workers-in-india.html
181,04-4-20,"China holds memorial for victims, martyrs of coronavirus","China came to a standstill on Saturday as President Xi Jinping led the nation in observing a three-minute silence to mourn the martyrs, including the ""whistleblower"" Dr Li Wenliang, who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak and over the 3,300 people who died of the infection in the country.

Xi and other Chinese leaders attended a national mourning for coronavirus martyrs and victims.

They had white flowers pinned to their chests and paid tribute in front of the national flag to the victims of the COVID-19, which is regarded as the worst public health disaster in modern China's history.

People paused and cars and air raid sirens wailed in mourning as the country observed a three minutes' silence.

In Beijing, people were seen breaking down on the streets as they stood to pay homage to the victims and martyrs who lost their lives to fight the virus, especially in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, where the disease emerged in December last year.

During the commemoration, national flags flew half-mast across the country and in all Chinese embassies and consulates abroad and public recreational activities have been suspended across the country.

Meanwhile, Hubei reported four new deaths and one new case of COVID-19 on Friday.

The province confirmed 38 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, bringing the total to 729 indicating that the battle against the virus is not over yet even though normalcy gradually returned with apprehensions of a rebound.

Hubei has so far reported 67,803 confirmed cases, including 50,008 in Wuhan.

A total of 81,620 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been so far reported on the Chinese mainland, and 3,322 people have died of the disease.

Fourteen frontline workers in Central China's Hubei Province, including ""whistleblower"" Dr Li, were identified as martyrs on Thursday for sacrificing their lives in combating the coronavirus outbreak.

The first group of martyrs includes 12 medics, one police officer and one community worker who fought on the frontlines.

Chinese officials earlier said that over 3,000 medical personnel contracted the disease.

According to the list, eight martyrs were members of the Communist Party of China. The oldest one was a 73-year-old, while the youngest was 30 years old.

Li, 34, an ophthalmologist was one of the eight ""whistleblowers"" who tried to warn other medical workers of the novel coronavirus outbreak but was reprimanded by the local police. He died on February 7 after contracting the disease.

Saturday is also a solemn occasion in China as it marked Qingming Festival, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day.

It is a tradition for the Chinese people to pay respect to their ancestors, deceased family members and national heroes and martyrs on the day of the festival.

China held its last national day of mourning in May 2008 for the victims of the Wenchuan earthquake in Southwest China's Sichuan Province, which killed more than 69,000 people.

182,04-4-20,Looks like Hydroxychloroquine is having some good results on coronavirus patients; says Trump,"Decades old malaria-drug Hydroxychloroquine appears to have some good results in the treatment of coronavirus patients, US president Donald Trump has said.

""We continue to study the effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine and other therapies in the treatment and prevention of the virus and will keep the American people fully informed in our findings,"" Trump told reporters during a press briefing at the White House on Friday.

Trump said that it looked as if Hydroxychloroquine is having some good results.

""It's looking like it (Hydroxychloroquine) is having some good results. I hope that would be a phenomenal thing, Trump said, days after the US Federal and Drug Administration approved the drug being used in the treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19) patients.

The Trump administration has stockpiled millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, given the urgency of the situation.

""We have a tremendous supply of it, we ordered in the case that it works and it's going to have some pretty big impacts. We'll see what happens, Trump said.

However, a top member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus has cautioned against arriving at any conclusion right now as tests in this regard are still underway.

""We still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News in an interview.

But when you don't have that information, it's understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective, he said.

A COVID-19 patient on Friday attributed her recovery to Hydroxychloroquine.

On day three of her hospitalisation at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, Schwing Schwing was given Hydroxychloroquine.

She told the local ABC affiliate that the malaria drug worked.

""I don't know how much of my recovery was due to the cocktail and how much of it was due to the length of the time I was spending recovering, but something certainly shifted,"" Schwing said.

The US till Friday reported 7,380 deaths and at least 276,500 infections due to the deadly coronavirus, the highest for any country in the world.

I'm sorry to report that I am among the growing number of Americans who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Although I am fortunate enough to be cared for at home, this is possibly the worst illness I've ever had, he wrote.

Cross urged his fans to take the global pandemic seriously.

""For those of you who still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is real, or think it is a 'hoax' or part of some conspiracy, my advice to you is to understand right now that this is a deadly illness spreading like wildfire throughout the world. Please make every attempt to stall the spread of the virus, he added.

Since COVID-19 emerged late last year from China's Wuhan city, around 1.1 million people have fallen ill. Almost 60,000 people have died.

184,04-4-20,"Twitter, Mozilla Firefox in tug of war over users' cached data","Twitter and popular browser Mozilla Firefox have locked up horns over users chat data like Direct Messages (DMs) being inadvertently stored in the browser's cache on desktops.

Twitter alleged that it has recently learned that the way Mozilla Firefox stores cached data may have resulted in non-public information being inadvertently stored in the browser's cache.

It means that if you accessed Twitter from a shared or public computer via Mozilla Firefox and took actions like downloading your Twitter data archive or sending or receiving media via Direct Message (DM), ""this information may have been stored in the browser's cache even after you logged out of Twitter,"" said micro-blogging platform.

The Mozilla Firefox browser's cache retention period is set to 7 days and after that time the information should have automatically been removed from the cache, said Twitter, adding that the issue did not impact people using other browsers like Safari or Chrome.

Firefox did not take the allegation lightly, saying why has Twitter only singled out them.

""Why is this just Firefox? The technical details are complicated but the high level is pretty simple: caching is complicated and each browser behaves somewhat differently; with the particular way that Twitter had their site set up, Chrome, Safari, and Edge don't cache this data but Firefox will,"" Firefox Chief Technology Officer Eric Rescorla said in a statement late Friday.

""It's not that we're right and they're wrong. It's just a normal difference in browser behaviour. There is a standard way to ensure that data isn't cached, but until recently Twitter didn't use it, so they were just dependent on non-standard behaviour on some browsers,"" he informed.

According to him, all web browsers store local copies of data they get from servers so that they can avoid downloading the same data over the internet repeatedly.

""If you do share a computer, you can make sure all of your Twitter data is deleted by following the instructions. If you do nothing, the data will be automatically deleted after 7 days the next time you run Firefox,"" Rescorla said.

Twitter said while cache data is only stored locally on Firefox browser users' devices, they have implemented a change so that Mozilla Firefox no longer stores Twitter data in the cache at all.

""We're very sorry this happened"".

""If you use, or have used, a public or shared computer to access Twitter, we encourage you to clear the browser cache before logging out, and to be cautious about the personal information you download on a computer that other people use,"" said Twitter.

185,04-4-20,Google Fi doubles data limit to 30GB in US,"To help people stay connected during the coronavirus pandemic, Google Fi has announced to temporarily increase its limits for full speed data to 30GB per user, for both Flexible and Unlimited Plans.

Google Fi is operated by Google in the US that gives data service on three mobile networks T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular.

After 30GB, one can choose to return to full-speed data for an additional $10/GB for the rest of billing cycle.

""Google Fi is temporarily extending the payment grace period so Fi customers who are having trouble with their bills can stay connected. We're extending our grace period, during which customers will maintain full service, to 60 days from a customer's missed billing date,"" the company said in a statement.

Previously, users on the Flexible plan had 15GB of top-speed data per month and once they used that, the speed would downgrade to 256kbps or asked to pay extra for more gigabytes.

Unlimited plan members ordinarily get 22GB of full-speed data before their speeds are throttled down to 256 Kbps for the remainder of the billing period.

""As a precautionary health measure for our support specialists, we're operating with a limited team, and some support channels may be unavailable,"" the company added.

Meanwhile, Verizon recently announced that it is providing all of its mobile customers with 15GB of extra data, AT&T announced it would waive some late payment fees, and T-Mobile removed mobile data caps for all customer.

186,04-4-20,"Zoom routing video conference calls, keys via servers in China","US-based video meeting app Zoom courted a fresh controversy when security researchers from Citizen Lab at University of Toronto found that that some Zoom calls are being routed through servers in China, along with conference encryption and decryption keys used to secure those calls.

According to the researchers, Zoom appears to own three companies in China through which at least 700 employees are paid to develop Zoom's software.

""Zoom can avoid paying US wages while selling to US customers, thus increasing their profit margin. However, this arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities,' said the team.

During its analysis, the security researchers also identified a security issue with Zoom's Waiting Room feature.

""Assessing that the issue presented a risk to users, we have initiated a responsible vulnerability disclosure process with Zoom. We are not currently providing public information about the issue to prevent it from being abused,"" the team said in a detailed statement on Friday.

While the mainline Zoom app (zoom.us) was reportedly blocked in China in November 2019, there are several third-party Chinese companies that sell the Zoom app within China (zoom.cn, zoomvip.cn, zoomcloud.cn).

Citizen Lab said it has initiated a responsible disclosure process with Zoom over Waiting Room vulnerability.

""We hope that the company will quickly act to patch and provide an advisory. In the meantime, we advise Zoom users who desire confidentiality to not use Zoom Waiting Rooms"".

The rapid uptake of teleconference platforms such as Zoom, without proper vetting, potentially puts trade secrets, state secrets, and human rights defenders at risk.

""Companies and individuals might erroneously assume that because a company is publicly listed or is a major household name, that this means the app is designed using security best practices. As we showed in this report, that assumption is false,"" said Citizen Lab.

A TechCrunch report said on Saturday that Zoom ""mistakenly"" allowed two of its Chinese data centers to accept calls as a backup in the event of network congestion.

""During normal operations, Zoom clients attempt to connect to a series of primary datacenters in or near a user's region, and if those multiple connection attempts fail due to network congestion or other issues, clients will reach out to two secondary datacenters off of a list of several secondary datacenters as a potential backup bridge to the Zoom platform,"" explained Zoom Founder and CEO Eric Yuan.

Yuan has already apologized for the privacy and security issues or ""Zoom-bombing"" being reported in his app that has seen a surge in usage globally as people work from home during lockdowns.

Slammed for the lack of users privacy and security by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and cybersecurity experts, reports claimed this week that the video conferencing app Zoom is also prone to hacking.

The Zoom CEO said that over the next 90 days, the company is committed to dedicating the resources needed to better identify, address, and fix issues proactively to ""maintain your trust"".

In March this year, the use base on Zoom reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid.

193,04-4-20,3 Dharavi cases raise fear of engulfing Asia's largest slum,"Amid reports of three persons testing positive for Covid-19 in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum, authorities are having sleepless night over a possible explosion of Covid-19 in Asia’s largest slum, which is also the most densely populated place in the world.

Of the three cases reported from Dharavi, one is a 56-year-old man with no history of international travel — who tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday and passed away. The second one is a 52-year-old sanitation department worker of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The third one is a 35-year-old doctor who practises near the slum.

The 56-year-old man who died on Wednesday night was the first to test positive from the sprawling shanty town in India’s financial hub.

The incidence of a couple of Covid-19 positive cases in Dharavi should be seen in the light of the fact that it is the most densely populated slum and the community spread of the pandemic in this slum may prove to be disastrous for Mumbai.

The Dharavi cases have raised fears that India may be in community transmission stage of the pandemic despite a countrywide lockdown since March 25.

Located between Western Railway’s Bandra-Matunga and Central Railway’s Sion-Matunga stations in north-central Mumbai, Dharavi is home to over anywhere from 60,000 to 70,000 families. The Mithi River slices through a portion of Dharavi into the Mahim Creek and then onto the Arabian Sea.

Spread over 240-hectare area, Dharavi has remained an ugly face and a dark underbelly of Mumbai — a largest slum which has been romanticised in Indian films over the years.

A mini-India of sorts where people belonging to different faiths live, Dharavi has 28 temples, 11 mosques, six churches, 50 banks, 60 Government schools, a mobile design museum, several slum tourism outfits, thriving criminal groups, and a tiny dilapidated fort.

Dharavi also has a small fort known as the Riwa Fort. Better known as Kala Qilla or Black Fort, it is currently in a dilapidated condition. It was built by the first Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier (1669-1677). It was part of the larger Bombay Castle, and marked the northern portion of British-held Bombay in the 17th century. The castle was also used as a watchtower, guarding the territory against the Portuguese-held (and later Maratha-held) Salsette Island.

At that time, the entire area was a large swamp and primarily inhabited by Koli fishermen who made a living from the waters. As the legend goes, the British built a dam on the Mithi river because of which there was no water to feed the swamp and it dried off. The fishermen and a community of potters moved in here.

In fact they could be called the first settlers of the region.

As Mumbai turned into a hub for textiles in the post Independence era, thousands of men from north India moved in as well and the slum as we know it started to take shape. Slowly since the 60s, migrants - particularly those from south India started moving in - making what Dharavi is today.

Dharavi has several business units -- right from textiles to pottery to fabrication to leather industry. Plastic recycling and garbage segregation too is done here. Mainly a hub of cottage industries, it has an estimated 5,000 business entities and 15,000 single-room factories. Goods produced here go to Middle East, South-East Asia, United States and Europe and several other places.

Dharavi shot to international fame after British filmmaker Danny Boyle made “Slumdog Millionaire” in 2008. Set against the backdrop of Dharavi, the film had many children actually picked up from this slum. The film bagged 8 Oscars.

Following the success of “Slumdog Millionaire”, some people from Dharavi initiated slum tours for international tourists who wanted to see what Asia’s largest slum all about.

197,04-4-20,Dia Mirza shares her COVID-19 concerns as a UN missionary,"Actress-producer Dia Mirza has expressed concern over the COVID-19 outbreak. Along with several other celebrities and entrepreneurs who are advocates and alumni of United Nations (UN) Secretary-General's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), she hopes that aid reaches the remotest corners of the world.

In a statement issued on April 3, Dia, and other SDG advocates like Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba Group), have said that they stand in solidarity with those affected.

The statement calls for urgent global action to protect and support vulnerable countries in ""Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Latin America, and small islands states"". The statement urges that ""leaders, policymakers, and the international community, in particular the G20 and G7, must act quickly and decisively to mobilise the resources needed to stop the spread of COVID-19 in these areas, while also scaling up healthcare support and strengthening social safety nets, including responses to rising levels of domestic violence"".

Elaborating, Dia said that standing up to COVID-19 requires a facilitated global movement with respect to financial and other aid.

""Covid-19 a zoonoses virus doesn't regard geographical boundaries. It is a message from nature. A wake up call for all to work together to protect, secure, restore ecological balance. Because our health is determined by the health of the environment. This is the time for solidarity, unity, humanity to act together to combat and recover from the loss and inequalities caused by this war against a virus,"" said Dia.

""It is also the time for people to collectively acknowledge that in order to achieve the sustainable development goals we must stop destruction of natural habitats and stop all illegal wildlife trade. And most importantly appreciate that there must be a global ceasefire as we fight this war against a virus,"" she added.

The ""Kaafir"" actress further said that ""International, national and local response to the COVID 19 scare must be structured with a focal point to make healthcare accessible to all people, especially those living on the fringes of society, marginalised by economic inequality. Each of us can do our bit by staying home, staying safe and by recognising how fortunate we are that we can, while many struggle to gain access to essentials and the basics to sustain health and life"".",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dia-mirza-shares-her-covid-19-concerns-as-a-un-missionary-2020-04-04.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/dia-mirza-shares-her-covid-19-concerns-as-a-un-missionary.html
198,04-4-20,Healthy baby born to COVID-19 positive woman at AIIMS; first such case in Delhi,"A coronavirus positive woman has given birth to a baby at the AIIMS here, official sources said, adding that the baby is ""healthy and doing well as of now"".

Dr Neerja Bhatla, professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at AIIMS who led the team which carried out the delivery said the baby boy was born on Friday evening, a week early, through C-section and is doing fine so far.

When asked if the baby's sample would be tested for COVID-19, she said, ""We are going to monitor his condition and look out for symptoms. So far the baby is doing fine.""

According to doctors, this is the first baby to be born to a coronavirus infected woman in Delhi.

The baby's mother who was nine-months pregnant had tested positive on Thursday after her husband, a senior resident doctor working in the department of physiology at AIIMS, was found to be infected with the virus. The doctor's brother has also tested positive for the respiratory infection.

The baby is with his mother since he will need breastfeeding. So far, there is no proof that suggests that the virus can be transmitted through breastfeeding, another doctor said.

The doctor said the mother is also fine and though she has tested positive for COVID-19, she is asymptomatic at present.

The AIIMS has already prepared a protocol dedicated to the care of COVID-19 infected pregnant woman patients.

According to WHO, women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to but should practice hygiene during the feeding, where a mask where available, wash hands before and after touching the baby and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched.

Of the total cases, at least 94 are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi, they said.

As many as 21 cases have fully recovered while others are undergoing treatment at various hospitals, Principal Secretary (Medical and Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said.

The state's count on Friday was 174 and two people -- one each in Basti and Meerut -- have died.

There has been a steep rise in the cases in the past two days, primarily because of a number of those linked to the Tablighi Jamaat testing positive, Prasad said.

According to an official bulletin, the total cases testing positive in the state has reached 234, with 60 fresh cases being reported on Saturday.

The number of districts of the state affected by the virus has also gone up to 28, as per the bulletin said.

An aggressive campaign has been undertaken and those showing symptoms are quarantined and their samples sent for testing, Prasad said.

The numbers are rising because of an aggressive strategy that has been adopted by the state for containment of the spread of the virus, he said, adding a total of 57,963 people who have come from abroad to the state were taken into surveillance, out of which 41,506 have completed 28-day quarantine period.

202,04-4-20,NY continues to record highest number of daily deaths from COVID19,"New York State, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, has recorded a staggering 630 deaths due to COVID19 in a 24-hour period, the highest number of fatalities in a single day as the total number of deaths the state crossed over 3,500.

Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his daily COVID19 briefing ON Saturday, deaths in the state saw an “all time increase” to 3,565 as on April 4 from 2,935 on April 3. The daily death toll in New York continues to grow at record numbers daily as the state remains the most impacted in the US from coronavirus.

Coronavirus cases in New York State now stand at 113,704, out of the country's total of 2,87,216. New Jersey, the second most impacted state in the US, has about 30,000 COVID19 cases. New York City alone has 63,306 coronavirus patients and 2,624 deaths.

Cuomo said the apex in the state, the point where the number of infections on a daily basis hits at the high point, is still about 4-8 days away.

“We have been talking about hitting that apex, the high point of the curve. I call it the battle of the mountaintop. That's going to be the number one point of engagement of the enemy,” he said, adding that New York is not yet at the apex but is getting closer and based on the projections, it could be in the 4-8 day range.

""We are not yet at the apex. Part of me would like to be at the apex and just let's do it. But there's part of me that says it's good that we're not at the apex because we're not yet ready for the apex either, still working on the capacity of the (healthcare) system,” the governor said.

The Governor has expressed anger over the short supply of essential medical equipment for healthcare professionals to help them deal with the surge in coronavirus cases across the state and the country.

He said personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gowns and face shields are in short supply in New York as they are across the country and there is need for companies to make these materials.

“It is unbelievable to me that in New York State, in the United States of America, we can't make these materials and that we are all shopping China to try to get these materials and we're all competing against each other,” he had said earlier.

Cuomo said Saturday that the state has 85,000 volunteers, including 22,000 from out of state and he will also be signing an executive order to allow medical students who were slated to graduate to begin practicing, supplementing the state's healthcare professional capacity.

On ventilators, he said the state had ordered 17,000 but there was not enough supply in the federal stockpile to meet this growing demand across the state. “China is remarkably the repository for all of these orders - ventilators, PPE, it all goes back to China, which long term we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don't have the manufacturing capacity in this country,” he said adding that “New York has been shopping in China.”

The Chinese government helped facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive at the JFK Airport in the city, he said as he thanked the Chinese government, Alibaba head Jack Ma, the Jack Ma Foundation and China's Consul General Huang Ping.

In addition, the state of Oregon would deliver 140 ventilators to New York.

Cuomo has signed an executive order allowing the state to redistribute ventilators and personal protective equipment from hospitals, private sector companies and institutions that don't currently need them and redeploy the equipment to other hospitals with the highest need.

Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ny-continues-to-record-highest-number-of-daily-deaths-from-covid19-2020-04-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/ny-continues-to-record-highest-number-of-daily-deaths-from-covid19.html

204,04-4-20,COVID-19 death toll nears 100-mark; Govt says no need to panic as 30% infections linked to Tablighi centre,"The number of COVID-19 deaths inched towards 100 on Saturday along with a significant increase in the number of confirmed infections, but the government assured there was no need to panic as the rate of spread was less than in many other countries and just ""one place"" accounted for 30 per cent of detected cases.

The Health Ministry said the testing capacity has been ramped up significantly to over 10,000 tests per day to detect the deadly coronavirus infection, as it emphasised on continuous compliance to lockdown and social distancing measures, along with personal and environmental hygiene, to win this ""daily battle"".

Officials said at least 1,023 confirmed cases of infection have been found to be linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the national capital last month, but massive efforts by various authorities have led to nearly 22,000 people linked to the religious grouping and their primary contacts getting quarantined.

The Tablighi-linked infections, found across 17 states, including Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, showed that almost 30 per cent of them are from ""one particular place where we could not sort of understand it and manage it"", Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said.

The data shared by Agarwal and other government officials in their daily press briefing showed that an average of one in 25 people tested for the infection have found to be a positive case, while the mortality rate among those testing positive appeared even less at one in 30.

Officials said about 75,000 tests have been conducted so far, with the number of daily tests doubling to more than 10,000 from about 5,000 a few days ago. While the number of government labs has increased to over 100, several private labs have also been roped in, Agarwal said.

Globally, more than 11 lakh people have tested positive so far since the outbreak of this deadly virus in December last, which has left nearly 60,000 dead. The US alone has seen over 2.7 lakh confirmed cases while it recorded nearly 1,500 deaths within 24 hours between Thursday and Friday. Italy has recorded the maximum deaths at nearly 15,000.

Agarwal said a total of 2,902 COVID-19 cases have been reported so far in India, with an increase of 601 in last 24 hours -- the highest for such a period -- with at least 58 of them in critical condition in Kerala, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. In the same time span, 12 more have died taking the nationwide toll to 68, Agarwal said.

However, according to a PTI tally of figures reported by states directly showed at least 94 deaths across the country while the number of confirmed cases of infection had crossed 3,250 as on Saturday late afternoon.

Of them more than 200 have been cured and discharged.

Maharashtra reported a sharp increase in the number of cases to 537, while Rajasthan, Assam, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat also reported rise in infections since Friday night, while more deaths were reported from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka.

Agarwal said the rate of doubling of cases is still very low in India, compared to many other countries, but it must be kept in mind that the country is dealing with a communicable disease and fighting a daily battle.

""We may be successful today, but may not be so tomorrow and to win this battle we need support of everyone including the public,"" he said, while emphasising the need for continuously following the lockdown and social distancing measures, as also personal and environmental hygiene.

""We are as strong as the weakest link in this chain and we can win this battle only with support of everyone,"" he said.

Sharing the age-group analysis of COVID-19 patients, Agarwal said the maximum 42 per cent are of 21-40 years, 33 per cent of 41-60 years, 17 per cent are above 60 years and 9 per cent are of 0-20 years.

The elderly people and those with other medical complications are said to be at higher risk in this pandemic. In Delhi also, five of the six COVID-19 patients who have died were above 60.

At the briefing, government officials said the lockdown is being effectively implemented across the country while supply of essential goods is also going on well, as they expressed confidence we all together will be ""successful in breaking the COVID-19 chain"".

The officials also asked people to refrain from using alcohol-based hand sanitisers while lighting lamps on Sunday night, for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made an appeal to show solidarity in the fight against COVID-19. They also said that apprehensions about a possible grid collapse due to collecting switching off of lights at that time was misplaced.

On the recent advisory about use of home-made face covers, the Health Ministry officials said it was only for conveying the message of personal hygiene measures.

Among various states, Uttar Pradesh reported a significant increase in the number of coronavirus cases to 227, including 94 cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi last month.

Of these, 21 have fully recovered while others are undergoing treatment at hospitals, Principal Secretary (Medical and Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said.

206,04-4-20,"7 lakh jobs gone in 14 days, worst yet to come in US","The worst stage of coronavirus pandemic became visible in the US when the Donald Trump government reported that employers cut over 7 lakh jobs in the first two weeks of March -- close to the May 2009 financial crisis peak of 800,000 job losses.

Most of the job losses were reported from restaurants and bars, followed by retailers. It was the first decline in payrolls since September 2010, CNBC reported.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 per cent - from 3.5 per cent -- the first job decline in a decade, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

The Labor report, however, doesn't capture ""the nearly 10 million laid-off and furloughed Americans who filed initial jobless claims in the past two weeks as much of the nation's economy was shut down to contain the spread of the virus"".

According to a USA Today report, that's because Labor's survey was conducted the week ending March 14, before most states ordered residents to stay at home and nonessential businesses -- such as restaurants, movie theaters and most stores -- to close.

It means the job loss numbers for March will actually be way high.

The US Labor Department on Thursday revealed that another 6.6 million workers filed jobless claims last week.

""The report does capture the first stumble in the economy's historic free fall. The number of workers filing initial jobless claims rose by 70,000 -- the most since 2013 -- to 282,000 in the week of Labor's survey"".

The April jobs report, which won't be released until May 8, could include the nearly 10 million Americans who filed for first-time unemployment benefits as the pandemic forced businesses to close and people to stay at home, CNN reported.

Job losses over the next few weeks will come from a wider range of sectors, according to Daniel Zhao, senior economist at careers website Glassdoor.

""White collar jobs are not safe from this,"" Zhao was quoted as saying.

""If this is an indication of what was happening before the full force of the crisis hit, then it will be hard to come up with the words to describe the numbers in future months,"" added Nick Bunker, economic research director at job search site Indeed.

By comparison, it took about two years for the US economy to lose nearly nine million jobs during the Great Recession.
