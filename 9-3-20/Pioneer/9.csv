0,09-3-20,Relief for civil society,"SC clears foreign funding for voluntary bodies crusading for public causes and civil rights

In a breather in these hyper-choked times of regulated democracy and a big relief to rights-based groups, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Government cannot stop foreign funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that fight citizens’ causes through democratic means. In other words, it spares them from being punished for dissent or protest over declared Government policies that impinge on human rights. Further, it grants them the constitutional right to be heard and conduct their campaigns fairly without fear of hitbacks or clampdowns. Through its consecutive regimes, the Narendra Modi Government has often run down civil rights movements as a conspiracy of the West to besmirch India’s image and present a lopsided view of our rights record. Its crackdown on foreign funding of “unfriendly” non-profit organisations had led to a whopping 40 per cent fall in overseas fund flows by 2017-18, says an industry report by Bain & Co. About 20,000 NGOs were affected. The ruling is significant simply because it re-establishes the primacy of democratic practices at a time when they are under threat of being stifled. The court said that curtailing an NGO’s right to access foreign donations was in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(c) of the Constitution relating to free speech and peaceful protests. Ending two contentious provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 2010, that allowed the Government to clamp down on all dissent and critiques, the court held that if an NGO was not pursuing a political goal or objective, it could not be penalised for supporting public causes through demonstrations and strikes. In other words, the anti-CAA or student protests cannot be legally classified as being foreign-funded. The ruling also ends confusion over what qualifies as “political interests”, an amorphous code that the Government had been using to disqualify movements or groups opposed to it. Earlier, Rule 3 (vi) of FCRA was categorical that any NGO, which used common protest methods like strikes, shutdowns, sit-ins, demonstrations, rail roko or jail bharo agitations in support of public causes, could be declared as an organisation of a “political nature.” This provision gave the Government unguided and limitless powers to label any organisation it didn’t like as mischievous in intent and cancel its foreign funding. Now, as per the court order, the Centre is required to take into account the activities and ideology of the NGO, including its association with activities of any political party, before declaring it as an organisation of “political nature.” While hitting out at the Government, the apex court also restricted other political parties from having front organisations and funnelling funds, saying such outfits would not escape the rigour of the Act if evidence was strong enough.

Many civil society bodies, including the Indian Social Action Forum, TARSHI Delhi, Ford Foundation, Greenpeace India, Amnesty International India and the Centre for Social Justice, have been fighting against the “abuse of legal procedures” and “the use of the FCRA as a tool of repression.” Even India’s top human rights watchdog, the National Human Rights Commission, had issued a notice to the Home Ministry on the issue in 2018. Still, it cancelled the licences of those engaged in rights-based advocacy work. The Home Ministry had time and again justified these actions, saying it had no place for bias but was just focussing on technical violations of the FCRA. Incidentally, the original FCRA came into force in 1976 during the Emergency of the Congress era and prohibited MPs, electoral candidates, political parties, judges and media organisations from accepting foreign contributions. However, the FCRA was amended by the Finance Bill 2016 and those changes made it more severe than its predecessor as it targetted “organisations of a political nature.” The new law also put a 50 per cent cap on the proportion of foreign donations, thereby controlling the way NGOs spent their money and made it mandatory for them to renew their licence every five years. This gave the Government the power to decide whether an NGO could renew its licence or not. In its continued onslaught, the Government had also cut short the term of Nachiket Mor, the country director of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, from the RBI’s central board after the RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch lobbied for his removal. As the Central bank oversees funding for NGOs coming from abroad, Mor was believed to act as a facilitator of liberal interests rather than being a proponent of Government agenda. However, thanks to the judiciary, once again the democratic right to freedom of expression will remain alive and kicking.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/relief-for-civil-society-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/relief-for-civil-society.html
1,09-3-20,Saudi crackdown,"Mohammed bin Salman has detained family members seen as threats to his rule yet again

Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who uses the self-styled moniker of MbS, has been projecting himself as an energetic reformer, a modernist with a deep understanding of and respect for what the people, especially the youth, want. The grandiose plans laid out by him to pull his country back from the dark ages, especially with its dipping oil potential, through a series of economic and foreign initiatives, have received international acclaim. But the fact remains that no matter how benevolent he might want to be seen as, he is an absolutist and autocrat. He has no qualms in stifling criticism over the image he has crafted, locking up not only fellow members of the royal family but activists, religious moderates and even young economists questioning his “Vision 2030” programme. Not to forget the hit he purportedly ordered against columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. So his latest crackdown on his family, including two senior princes, over treason, isn’t shocking. Clearly, this is another move to stamp his authority over the entire kingdom, which until now was headed by powerful branches of the ruling family. The detention of the two princes means there cannot be any more challengers. Clearly, he doesn’t want the ghosts of his controversial ascension to haunt him. Breaking all norms, he was appointed the youngest heir apparent in Saudi history despite being the seventh son. Other members of his family, including the more experienced cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, who has now been detained, were sidelined or placed under house arrest. He may silence the royal house but can he silence the growing criticism over his transformational intent?

When he took over in 2017, Bin Salman at first was carefully progressive, allowing women to drive, cracking down on hardliners, diversifying the country’s oil-based economy, jumpstarting non-oil industries and making technological advancements. In the process, he ensured that the supremacy of the royal house wasn’t diluted, claiming that revolution could come only from the highest seat of power and not from the people. That explains his provocative crackdowns on the the intelligentsia, which has elicited international condemnation. And now that his modernisation and economic uplift are in tatters — oil prices have plunged about 30 per cent since January — Bin Salman has only his strategic worth to fall back upon.

2,09-3-20,Women in STEM research in the age of Coronavirus,"From the perception that few women are found in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, emerges the paradox that the disbalance is by choice rather than any constraint

As the world celebrated another Women’s Day, on March 8, this time under the shadow of the lethal Coronavirus, with scientists and medical professionals across the globe working round the clock to develop a vaccine to counter the virus, it is pertinent to reflect on the rather ambivalent relationship between gender, on one hand, and research and technology, on the other. From the almost unanimous perception that much fewer women than men are found in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) emerges the paradox that the gender gap in science education is the result of choice rather than any constraint. Women, particularly in advanced societies, voluntarily pursue careers in other fields rather than STEM. This paradox needs to be unbundled, especially in the current grim environment wherein men and women need to stand shoulder to shoulder to decimate the killer virus and restore normal life and health in the world.

Traditionally, several scholars and policymakers have pointed out male domination of STEM fields, with historically low participation of women in these professions. The reasons for this gender disparity are reportedly lack of encouragement from parents to daughters for pursuing higher studies in mathematics and science and laboratory experiences and financial resources needed to study these subjects, all of which favour men over women. The fact that the privileged professions with high remunerations in STEM fields are dotted with men is an undisputed corollary of this gender gap.

A 2018 survey conducted by Mastercard and Incite, titled Revisiting Women in STEM, carried out among 136 Indian women, working in both STEM and non-STEM jobs, arrived at some intriguing results. It found that 45 per cent of the women respondents working in STEM jobs were dissatisfied with their current career choice and also did not expect to continue in the job for their entire work life. Regarding the reasons for this discontent, 46 per cent cited the need for constantly updating their skills in STEM careers, 39 per cent were unable to adjust to the long hours and commitment needed in these jobs and 36 per cent were apprehensive of working in a male-dominated office environment. In addition, 24 per cent complained that women were less likely to be paid as much as men in these high-profile occupations. All of these are valid reasons for women to be wary of joining the science and technology bandwagon but they have serious implications for attracting bright, young women into these streams.

The situation is complicated further by the play of discriminatory forces constantly seeking to limit the frontiers of higher education and employment for women, especially in conservative societies across India. Academics and experts in the field of education also argue that the gender gap in India’s technological workforce is an outcome of the lack of both infrastructure and quality teachers in technical institutions of higher learning that fail to accommodate more women students. This discrimination is exacerbated by the persistent male-female and urban-rural divide in India’s pedagogical landscape.

In consonance with these findings, scholars using data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) have also repeatedly asserted that gender inequality in educational outcomes in India is a product of social backgrounds, access to learning resources and cultural attitudes, which lead parents to prioritise their son’s education over daughter’s education.

The IHDS, carried out by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in collaboration with the University of Maryland, in two waves, in 2004-05 and 2011-12, points out that the prevalence of a gendered education system stemming from India’s patriarchal society has created all-round fissures in educational attainments.

This issue is also flagged up in a 2019 paper by leading IHDS researchers at the University of Maryland’s Sociology Department titled, The Emergence of Educational Hypogamy in India. The paper argues that though women today are more likely to be involved in higher education than before, often even being more educated than their spouses, in terms of subjects, they are still more representative in traditionally considered “feminine” fields such as humanities and social sciences, while men are more likely to be in the STEM fields, which generate higher economic returns in the labour market.

Coming back to the Coronavirus, in an article in The Independent last week, Ian Hamilton, lecturer in mental health at the Department of Health Sciences, University of York, takes the discrimination argument further. He claimed that due to differences in the immune systems of men and women, there is a need to develop two different strains of the vaccine as women often have more severe adverse reactions and higher antibody responses to disease. But sexism is likely to prevent woman-centred research.

In such a situation, women may end up receiving sub-optimal treatment, leading to higher mortality. He cites the example of the last global pandemic, SARS, when even the World Health Organisation (WHO) had pointed to the gender gap in data, specifically relating to the serious impact of the disease for pregnant women that was not sufficiently addressed by the SARS vaccine.

“From cancer to Coronavirus, there isn’t an area of health research or science that is not gender-blind. Science, it seems, is institutionally sexist,” fulminates Hamilton. He links this medical sexism to the paucity of women in senior research roles and a gender imbalance in technological laboratories dominated by men who may never be able to fully understand a woman’s health experiences. It is also widely suggested that women may be found aplenty in early-career levels of medical research but their male peers are more likely to ascend the professional ladder and become professors.

However, there is light beyond the tunnel, as women scientists are currently seen to be increasingly pro-active in their fight against the Coronavirus. Among the most prominent of them is an all-women team of four scientists, led by India-born Nita Patel, Director for Vaccine Development and Antibody Discovery at the Novavax Laboratory in the unassuming neighbourhood of Gaithersburg, Montgomery County of Maryland, USA. And there are other women scientists around the world involved in the same pursuit.

Patel and her team are working day and night to isolate the virus and find a breakthrough vaccine against Covid-19 using recombinant nanoparticle technology. When an ABC7 news reporter asked her what signal it would give young girls if the vaccine came from the hands of women, Patel said, “Well, that’s encouraging for young girls to become scientists. You know, I’m a woman (and can say) that’s awesome.” Novavax is aiming at an extremely aggressive timeline, having reached phase-II of development of the vaccine. If they get the next phase of trials right, they could hit the market with a viable vaccine in as little as three months.

However, Patel and her team are not the only women engaged in the grim battle against Coronavirus. Kathleen Neuzil, director of the University of Maryland’s School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development, who co-leads a consortium established by the National Institutes of Health at Emory University in Atlanta, to quickly tackle new infectious diseases, is also working in this area.

Another notable STEM researcher is Lauren Gardner, a civil engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University, who has led a team to build a map based on information collected from various sources in China, the US and elsewhere to track the spread of the virus and locate areas where the virus is taking hold in real time and where it may attack more in future. Surely, these path-breaking endeavours by women would not only provide succour by saving thousands of lives against the killer disease but also influence STEM research and policymaking in the long term. Can we still say that STEM is not for women?

3,09-3-20,Whose history is it anyway?,"Post-revisionism has come to question the cherry-picking of history and the ideological lack of nuance of both orthodox and revisionist historians

It is often said by some historians that Pakistan’s founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, did not have a single, cohesive narrative explaining his idea of Pakistan. This is largely correct. But by citing Jinnah’s inaugural address to the country’s first Constituent Assembly in August 1947 — in which he envisioned Pakistan as an inclusive and pluralistic Muslim-majority State — the liberal intelligentsia insists that Jinnah saw his creation as a democratic and progressive entity. However, those who disagree with this often produce documented quotes in which he speaks about constructing an Islamic Republic. Historiography would define this claim as “orthodox history” and the previous one as “revisionist history.” The truth is he was a sharp politician who adjusted and readjusted his words according to the audience. So, in a Constituent Assembly that had a majority of “Muslim modernists” and also some prominent non-Muslims, Jinnah explained the new country as a pluralistic entity. On the other hand, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while addressing an audience of conservative Pakhtuns, he spoke about a country run by Islamic laws. Then, while talking to the Voice of America, he asserted that Pakistan was not to be a theocracy. Orthodox historians and revisionists have for long fought over his legacy by using his words. But the following is how a relatively new strand of historiography would explain the discourse between them: Both are correct.

This new strand is called post-revisionism. It first emerged in the 1970s in the US as an “objective” response to revisionist as well as orthodox historiographies, which dominated history till the 1950s. It is about history that is formulated by historians and intelligentsia to justify the creation and then existence of a nation-State. The works of Pakistani historian, the late IH Qureshi, are a case in point. His books emphasised the “historical justification” of the creation of Pakistan, by suggesting that the national impulse in the Muslims of South Asia had developed during the 500-year-old Muslim rule in India. He saw it as an evolutionary process that culminated with the creation of Pakistan in 1947. This thesis was adopted by the State and became the country’s orthodox history. But from the mid-1980s, Pakistan’s orthodox history began to be countered by some scholars. KK Aziz, Sibte Hassan and Ayesha Jalal launched a severe critique of the country’s orthodox history by deconstructing it and restoring “facts” which they believe had been distorted/suppressed because they contradicted the origin story of Pakistan.

The works of these historians endeavoured to validate the more liberal sides of Jinnah. They also demonstrated how he had been reshaped as a quasi-Islamic ideologue by orthodox historians. This was revisionist history taking to task orthodox history. In the last two decades, revisionist history in this context has picked up momentum. For example, in August 2015, the Sindh Government decided to include Jinnah’s August 1947 speech in the curriculum. The speech, which was largely suppressed by the State since 1977, also made its way into a 2019 book on Jinnah published by the Inter-Services Public Relations, the media wing of the Pakistan Army.

But there are historians who see some inherent problems in the revisionist school of thought. This gave birth to what came to be known as post-revisionism. It largely emerged from the works of American scholars such as JL Gaddis and Thomas Peterson. While studying the origins of the Cold War between the US and the erstwhile Soviet Union, Gaddis and Peterson claim that both orthodox as well as revisionist historians were heavily invested in defending their respective ideologies in discussions on the Cold War.

For example, while orthodox historians accuse the Soviet Union of starting the Cold War “to undermine US democracy and freedom”, revisionists blame the US for “betraying the Soviet Union after World War-II in a bid to sideline it in the post-war order.” Gaddis and Peterson find this discourse problematic. They lament that historic evidence was cherry-picked to defend their respective ideological dispositions. This made the orthodox and the revisionists miss out the many nuances which greatly contributed to the start of the Cold War. To Gaddis, these economic and political nuances made the Cold War inevitable and no one side could be blamed for starting it. Another problem that post-revisionists have with the revisionists is that, even though the latter want to demystify and deconstruct the ideological edifice of orthodox history, they do this by replacing it with their own set of ideological preferences. It thus becomes a clash between ideologies in which important historical nuances get ignored. Critics of revisionism have also demonstrated that since revisionism is more about critiquing than documenting history, it has given birth to “historical negationism” or “denialism”, which piggybanks on revisionist ideas to claim that horrific episodes of genocide, such as the Holocaust, never happened. Also, since revisionists, just as orthodox historians, are largely driven by political ideologies, there is always the danger that, in the event of their preferred account of history not being accepted, they may end up substantiating the history that they set out to counter. For example, some revisionists want Pakistani liberals to let go of Jinnah’s image as a progressive leader, and accept that the creation of Pakistan as a Muslim-majority country was a mistake. Thus, they inadvertently end up substantiating the image of Jinnah constructed by their orthodox opponents. This is when revisionism ends up eating its own tail.

4,09-3-20,A masterstroke gone horribly wrong,"The then MD and CEO of Yes Bank, Rana Kapoor, thought that he had found his niche by lending to well-known companies who were finding it difficult to get finances from existing lenders. What looked like a good business plan at the time turned out to be the bank’s nemesis

Last week the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of one of the country’s top-five private sector lenders, Yes Bank, and imposed limits on withdrawals. This has triggered confusion and fear among account holders. But was this the first case or do we have a history of bank failures?

Bank frauds and banks in crisis have been an integral part of India’s financial history as between 1935 and 1947, nearly 900 banks failed. This was followed by 665 banks going bust in the period from 1947 till nationalisation of private banks in 1969. In fact, one of the major reasons for the Government’s decision to nationalise the biggest banks in the country was their repeated failures. After 1969, the RBI became highly conservative and no new bank licences were issued till 1994, when 10 new banks were given permits. In the early 2000s, two more banks were given licences, followed by another two in 2014. Since then, only a few special banks like local area banks, payments banks and small finance banks have been licensed.

Why Yes Bank failed: The Yes Bank crisis was a long time coming. The RBI had raised concerns over corporate governance lapses and the deteriorating quality of the bank’s loan books in the last few years. Yes Bank rapidly expanded its corporate loan book by aggressively lending to corporates. Rana Kapoor, then-Managing Director and CEO, is known to be a risk-taker, lending to even stressed companies. The crisis was an accident waiting to happen since 2008, when the global economic recession shook the world. While the world economy tanked and markets went into panic mode, there was absolutely no impact on Yes Bank and all through 2008-2010, Rana Kapoor continued to giving loans to both companies and individuals. In fact, one financial magazine reported, “If nobody will lend you money, Rana Kapoor certainly will. Many an industrialist has lived for a good part of the last decade or more with this unshakeable belief.” Those taking a loan from the bank were required to pay an upfront fee, which in turn was used to run the bank.

A bank that started from scratch and built an asset book of over Rs 3 lakh crore in a little over a decade was signing away cheques to nearly every borrower, who either went bust or turned into a non-performing asset (NPA) within years. Yes Bank gave loans to almost every stressed entity in India, including IL&FS, Dewan Housing, Jet Airways, Cox & Kings, CG Power and Cafe Coffee Day and so on. A foreign banker, Kapoor was a well-known face in the corporate sector and used to cut most of the deals. This route not only gave him a higher interest rate but also helped him secure a collateral against that loan. But when things turned bad, the bank found it difficult to monetise the collateral either. Take, for instance, the shares it had as collateral in some cases, whose value deteriorated because of the slide in the fortune of the corporate entity. Kapoor thought that he had found his niche by lending to well-known companies who were finding it difficult to get finances from existing lenders. What looked like a masterstroke at the time turned out to be the bank’s nemesis. Yes Bank’s stock hit an all-time high in August 2018 and market capitalisation crossed Rs 1 lakh crore. But it began retreating soon after and due to capital erosion, the bank was in dire need of fresh investments. Yes Bank started working on it and Kapoor stepped down in January 2019. Ravneet Gill was appointed as the new CEO and took the reins in March 2019.

In February 2019, the bank announced that a risk assessment report conducted by the RBI did not find any divergence in the recognition of bad debts. A day later, RBI pulled up the bank for selectively disclosing a confidential report. The regulator pointed out that the report had revealed several lapses and regulatory breaches in the bank’s functioning, and the selective disclosure by the bank was a deliberate attempt to mislead.

In December 2019 Yes Bank said two investors, SPGP Holdings and Erwin Braich, were interested in buying stake in it. But after rejection of Braich’s offer, failure was inevitable. The RBI has superseded the board and will take charge of it.

Banking regulations in India: Banks in the country are now governed by both international Basel norms and domestic regulations. The RBI has extensive powers to inspect banks and intervene in their operations. Given the fact that banking regulations have only got stringent over time, all these bank failures are puzzling.

There are four primary issues plaguing Indian banks that come to the fore. These are poor decision-making due to the lack of capacity to judge project quality. Plus, there is a structural asset-liability mismatch due to long-dated assets and short-dated liabilities; a delay in recognising NPAs on the books and outright fraud and the absence of fundamental corporate governance standards.

While the first two factors have received significant coverage and discussion, the last two factors probably deserve even greater attention going forward, given the gravity of the situation. While the first two revolve primarily around the skill and capacity of the lender to assess sectoral, company and project risk keeping in mind the micro-structure of their balance sheets, the last two are to a large extent related to the level of corporate governance. Unless we strengthen corporate governance, we will keep suffering bank failures. The Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order 2020 is also a step towards transparency and accountability.

Protect your money: The issue of protection of bank depositors has stoked frequent debates. However, these remain academic only as we had not seen concrete action on the ground on bank loan defaulters. Whatever might be happening in the banking sector, the tragedy is that the common man is always on the receiving end. The Government, in this year’s Union Budget, announced that the insurance cover for small depositors has been increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh. This means that at the most, depositors will get back Rs 5 lakh if their bank goes out of operation.

Significantly, this is the first time in 27 years that insurance limit on bank deposits has been revised. Deposit insurance commenced in India with a limit of Rs 5,000 in 1968 and was revised to Rs 10,000 two years later in 1970. The next revision happened in 1976 to Rs 20,000. Again in 1980, the limit was changed to Rs 30,000 and the last revision took place in 1993 when it was increased to Rs 1 lakh. A SBI research paper has pointed out that the deposit coverage in India is one of the lowest in terms of per captia income.

Even the revised cover of Rs 5 lakh is not sufficient. Thus, diversification holds the key to safeguarding money. People can try and keep their money in three-four different banks. For instance, a depositor can have one account with a PSB, second account with a private bank and another one with a foreign bank. Also, people can use the services of the nearest Post Office for extra safety. Spreading fixed deposits in various banks and adding exposure to liquid funds or cash funds of mutual funds, are also some safe options. This way, depositors will not be keeping all their eggs in one basket and their nest egg will stay safe.

Debe Sodi (22), Area Committee Member of Katakalyan Committee of CPI(Maoist)’s Darva Division had joined banned CPI(Maoist) in 2012. She was involved in exchanges of fire near Madjum and Churnar villages in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

She was also involved in an exchange of fire near Tulsi village under the Mathili police station of Malkangiri district in 2019.

Moreover, she allegedly killed civilians in Dantewada district in 2019 and 2020.

According to police, Debe Sodi became disillusioned with the Maoist leaders for their behaviour towards women cadres and for creating gender discrimination between male and female cadres.

Women cadres are used only for odd works and also subjected to physical and mental harassments.

Debe realised that the Maoist leaders are moving away from their ideology and doing nothing for development of the downtrodden sections of the society.

7,09-3-20,Prejudice the new normal,"The politics of otherisation has now reached the chambers of our minds with a stamp of officialese, courtesy a regime that predicates religion as not only proof of identity but loyalty

Now that the embers of the Delhi riots are being washed away by an unseasonal rain, drowning the sad memories of how we can become refugees in our own land, there is talk about “heroes.” There are reports of how Hindu families sheltered Muslim neighbours in the city’s northeastern parts as the mob rampaged through their homes and hearths. There have been umpteen reports about Hindu samaritans helping the battered and bruised, rushing them to hospitals, arranging aid supplies and setting up shelters. There was also this report of a Hindu man taking down a saffron flag from atop a desecrated shrine and restoring our faith in humanity. Some would say this represents the syncretism of our civilisational ethos, the fabric of a cultural legacy that can never be torn asunder, the equality of humans as it is meant to be. Others, depending on which side of the discourse they are on, would probably call it the big-heartedness of a triumphalist faith over another. But in the end, it is all about characterising a good deed, even lionising it as one, rather than normalising it that is deeply troublesome. It is this need for categorising our behavioural pattern that represents why “otherisation” has deeply penetrated us at the societal level.

So much so that the majoritarian guilt syndrome is just as consciously executed or recognised as the awareness of minority victimhood. I am glad I grew up in Kolkata, where the cheek by jowl co-existence that we need to define so fervently these days was always a lived experience. During my kindergarten years, it was the Muslim weavers at my father’s jute factory who would drop me to school and back, bicycles on normal days, atop their shoulders on rainy days. My parents thought nothing about me playing with their children in the common playgrounds in front of their staff quarters. I cannot forget Qurbaan, who would buy me clothes from his meagre budget during Eid, along with those for his children. His wife would cook an elaborate feast that he would bring over to the house and we would all partake of the flavours and joys together. He and his family were a constant in my life till the day I got married. Then there was Abdul at my grandfather’s home in Lucknow, who embodied the summer afternoons of my long and lazy vacations, when I would read in the courtyard and he would tell me stories while pounding and mincing meat on his wooden board for the finest kebabs that I could almost swallow. If my grandfather encouraged my reading those afternoons, Abdul would regale me with animated stories and legends of Lucknow nagri, so much so that I am still teary-eyed about this city even when both have gone. Feel it in my pores as the lanes of Qaiserbagh and Aminabad. There were many others, drivers, shopkeepers, the candyman, gardener, the barber and what not, what you would call service-deliverers in today’s terms. But my bond with them was never about a relationship of convenience. Growing up with them was in the normal flow of everydayness. It was never to be screamed out as exception, simply because it was the rule. It was also about an informal but worldly-wise education. Today, in retrospect, such experiences would be labelled as my father’s liberal experiments with classlessness, his brashness in entrusting a significant part of my childhood to strangers who were just about skilled but not educated enough, and along with my missionary education, an erosion of my Hindu mooring. The fact is he had strengthened it in the process.

Nowhere is every puja, be it of Lakshmi, Saraswati or Narayan, solemnised at home with such frequency as it is in Bengal. Be it a bout of jaundice or malaria, my mother would immediately perform a puja for gratitude and fortitude. The home pujas made divinity supreme over rituals and prioritised the personal God over the regimented one. The worship of Durga and her Kali avatars, which the zamindars turned into huge community, all-faith affairs, has historically codified plurality as a socio-cultural-religious credo. In the Bengal that I grew up in, pujas were a matter of people’s pride, an efflorescence of its creative expression, not an emotion to be whisked and shredded to prove a point. By throwing me into this eco-system, my father had never ever betrayed his pain and anxieties over the Partition, of which he was a sufferer. He knew displacement, denial and destruction first hand but chose to resolve it his way like many others, levelling the furrows than upturning them further. He was very particular about not privileging anyone over any other.

He found solace along the river at Dakshineswar, a Shakti peeth dedicated to Kali and her most ardent devotee, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, who embraced a multi-faith approach to divinity as a cosmic essence, soul evolution as the only enlightenment. Swami Vivekananda, who carried on his legacy and who kept Hinduism relevant as a world religion, is sadly only quoted for exhibitionism while his plurality gets trampled day in and day out.

Midway through life now, through its many comedies and tragedies, weddings and funerals, there have been Muslim friends, peers and colleagues who have stood by me as steadfastly as family. Quite naturally. So it bothers me immensely when they question their Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, when they ask whether their parents and grandparents were right in choosing India as homeland during Partition or when they wonder about applying for citizenship or work visas overseas. How does one console them for their systematic marginalisation, the dilution of their stakeholdership in nationhood? There is no explaining to young Muslims how their ancestors fought the elitist Muslim League’s imagined fears of slavery in a majoritarian land, when current truth is stranger than past fiction. Would we have imagined marking the entrance to our homes with religious motifs as a necessity than choice? Or thought about reconverting shrines that are few centuries old than building new ones? Would we have imagined classifying vegetables and meat as Hindu or Muslim? That’s precisely what is happening in Uttar Pradesh, with vendors tagging their religion on their signages. So after identity theft, there is going to be an economic denial. As a “not so god-fearing Hindu,” hosting guests for dinner with decided preferences could now be tricky business.

The politics of otherisation has finally set in. It is an accumulation of prejudices, both latent and overt, simply because it now has a stamp of officialese courtesy a regime which predicates religion as not only proof of identity but loyalty. It has seeped in because of a nationalist thought factory that spins history lessons as a retrospective duel with invasions than learning lessons from them. You cannot blame the fundamentalist fringe like Bajrang Dal or Vishwa Hindu Parishad anymore. For their thinking is mainstream now, accepted by the educated elite in drawing rooms. They may have pushed in from the fringes but it is the porosity of the intelligentsia which has yielded to their osmotic pressure. Because we need an excuse to justify our failures. And an easy one at that. Unlike the economy, global trade winds and poverty that we have no control over, we need an aggressor we can tame visibly. So we have created a new enemy within our own and transferred all our non-functioning abilities to “termites” and “viruses” detected after 70 years of incubation. Mainstream acceptance is the most dreaded monster, for it means obeying handed down guidelines and abjuring any responsibility towards nation-building.

The establishment’s segregatory policies and practices have hurt and alienated the enlightened “Indian Muslims” whom it is so desperate to reassure in public. Not that the latter aren’t trying; if the recent protests over the citizenship law are any indication, then Muslims have emerged as rightful citizens protecting their existence than outsourcing their crusade to either the clergy or votebank politicians. Many elite Muslims, so far confined to their own spheres of excellence, are now stepping up as demanding citizens. Yet they feel vulnerable without the armour of a stereotype. Though there have been no major separatist protests that you would associate with minorityism in other nations, we could see a radicalisation of an unknown kind if justice fails them now. For the “Indian Muslims” have never sought any autonomy or privileges as their co-religionists in Kashmir have, and they have existed pan-India with local sensibilities. They have considered India their holy land.

The public parade of anti-CAA protesters in Uttar Pradesh, some of them proven activists, presenting them in a rogue’s gallery and recovering costs of damage to public property from them, legitimises this hatred as mainstream and taints an entire community with the same brush. There is no room for dissent, just acquiescence. No space for conscience, but extremism.

What we once dismissed as hilarious is dead serious. Consider the diktat warning Muslim men against marrying Hindu girls or women or the toxic masculinity of Hindu men declaring their right to marry Kashmiri women post the abrogation of Article 370. Such claims are finding a ready receptacle in drawing room chatter over evening drinks. A Hindu may not know all stanzas of Vande Mataram but a Muslim unable to recite them — albeit under fear of the gun as seen in the Delhi riots — is a traitor. It is not that Muslims haven’t been ghettoised or targetted before for political gains. They have. But the problem now is that we have cast them away in the poisonous gas chambers of our minds.

perform special pujas and offer their reverence, said Pompa a devotee.

The head of the family observes fast and prays to Lord Krishna and Agnidev. After all the traditional rituals, they smear gulal and offer “bhog” to both Krishna and Agnidev, she said.

Dressed up in saffron-coloured clothes devotees also wear garlands of fragrant flowers, they sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments like Ektara, Dubri, Veena and other musical instruments in a bid to adore the God, said Pompa.

A lucky draw was also held at the end of the programme. At least 20 new rising artists were felicitated during the occasion. The purpose of this event is to preserve our Bengali cultural and festival, said Chandan

11,09-3-20,No machinery in place to check bhang adulterations,"While the Excise Department has imposed a clampdown on sale of illicit liquor and the Food Safety Department has simultaneously put a scanner on adulterated sweets in the wake of Holi, there is no machinery in place to check any form of adulteration in Bhang — locally-grown hemp consumed during the festival as a part of the festivities.

Officials from the State Narcotics Control Bureau said that hemp does not come under their purview, and the bureau has no right to check the quality of Indian weed sold in the open market during Holi. Narcotics Superintendent Suresh Kumar Singh said that the bureau can only check the sale of listed drugs such as Ibuprofen and Benzodiazepines.

“Hemp or Bhang is not listed as drug, so technically, we cannot check the contents of the product that is sold in the market,” Singh said.

Neither the Food Safety Dept, not the Drug Control Directorate has direct authority over checking the quality of Bhang available in the market, officials said. Jharkhand Drug Controller Ritu Sahay said that it was clear as to which body had the power to monitor the quality of Bhang.

For decades, Bhang has been sold in the markets around India as offerings to deities and consumption on festivals like Holi. Many sweet shops also make Barfis and Pedas with Bhang during Holi. Special drinks called Thandai are available across the market on Holi and are readily consumed. However, having no regulatory body to check the quality of Bhang used in these products puts the wellbeing of several consumers at risk, say psychiatrists who have been campaigning against the consumption of Bhang.

Hemp is a form of Cannabis which has an intoxicating effect on consumers. While moderate consumption may only cause mild stimuli in the brain and cognitive behavior for a few hours, overconsumption of hemp may even lead to psychosis and major mental health ailments, warn psychiatrists. “Psychosis caused by hemp abuse is very common. We get many such patients every year. While Cannabis dependency can precipitate into psychosis, even abuse of the weed for a day or two can lead to mental disorders,” said Dr Nishant Goyal, Assistant Professor at Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi.

Incidents of Bhang laced with other intoxicants have also been reported in the past in Ranchi. While the practice of consuming Bhang has gradually reduced with awareness, the production and sale of Bhang still continues to be unchecked. Besides, there is no Government agency that has been handed over the responsibility of checking the quality of Bhang and adulterations in it.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-machinery-in-place-to-check-bhang-adulterations.html

13,09-3-20,District admin seizes huge quantity of adulterated paneer,"The Ranchi District Administration on Sunday seized adulterated paneer and Butter worth more than Rs 15 lakh — a major breakthrough prior to Holi. The consignment of Cheese and Butter was coming from Bakhtiyarpur in Bihar to Ranchi.

The matter came to light during the investigation of buses was going on at Booty More in the State Capital by a team of Food Safety Department of Ranchi District. The team investigated around 35 buses in this morning. Ranchi Sub Divisional Magistrate, Lokesh Mishra informed that more than 4000 kg of adulterated paneer and 15 kg of adulterated Butter was recovered which was loaded on six different buses coming from Bakhtiyarpur of Bihar.

The investigating team found that it was adulterated paneer and then they seized the entire consignment.

“This paneer is not good for the health of the people. In view of the festival of Holi, there will be continuous investigation going on, so that no one can spoil the health of the people of Ranchi in the greed to earn profits. No one could spoil this festival of colours,” said Mishra.

Adulterated paneer and khowa are being supplied on a large scale in the capital Ranchi. This cheese is brought from Biharsharif, Bakhtiyarpur and Ara by buses every day. Cottage cheese is supplied in many shops in the city.

The business of washing and selling spongy Cheese in shops has been going on for years. The consignment of fake Cheese reaches Ranchi at 5am from Bihar Sharif, Bakhtiyarpur and Ara. Cottage cheese laden buses reach Ranchi at many chowks of the city and are distributed at various places. This adulterated paneer is mainly consumed in small hotels because its price is less than half the price of branded paneer.

Many businessmen of the city are involved in this business of adulterated milk powder, maida, white grease, detergent, gum and urea.

Up to 40 kg of paneer can be made in this electric powered machine that looks like a milk can. First of all water is poured into the machine, which is constantly heated. Then milk powder is added to it. After this, the mixture is rotated by mixing urea, detergent, white grease, flour and gum.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/district-admin-seizes-huge-quantity-of-adulterated-paneer.html
14,09-3-20,Security beefed up to ensure peaceful Holi,"The Ranchi District Administration has made special arrangement in the State Capital to ensure peaceful Holi festival beginning on Monday.

The additional security measures are required because the State Capital is sensitive to violence and hooliganism during the festival of colors. Ranchi Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anish Gupta and Sub Divisional Magistrate Lokesh Mishra have reviewed security scenario and issued a joint order for maintaining vigilance to ensure peaceful celebrations like last year.

“Holi is a festival of enthusiasm and color but people should not force others into celebrations especially women who are often subject to vulgar comments and violence. The police officers have been instructed to keep an open eye and check on hooligans who try to disturb the atmosphere during the festival,” said Gupta.

According to the joint order the administration has focused on preventive measures and has asked police stations to keep an open eye on rumor mongers and elements which might fuel communal tension. The police station have been asked to religiously hold meeting with local peace committees involving Hindu Muslims, Police Team and Local people representatives requesting them to ensure peaceful Holi.

SSP Gupta said that every citizen should use social media wisely. “Strict action will be taken on posting objectionable. It is being monitored in various groups of social media. If objectionable posts are being circulated, inform the police-administration immediately,” he added.

The SSP appealed to the people that they should avoid rumors and report it to the competent person. Strict action will be taken if any person or group takes the law in hand, he added. The officials have been asked to identify the places which have a history of violence during Holika Dahan and deploy police forces at all those places when the pyre is lit at night because in some places untoward incident have taken in the past.

The police stations have been asked to gather intelligence inputs of sensitive places where incident of violence took place in the past. The police men have been asked to patrol extensively throughout the two days across the district including residential areas.

A large numbers of home guards will also be deployed across the City to help the State Police. A composite control room will completely coordinate with the police stations, magistrates to monitor deployment and patrol.

15,09-3-20,Examination is the means and end in itself,"Education is a lifelong process. It starts before the birth of a child and continues even after the demise of the person. The Sanatan philosophy emphasises upon imparting holistic education to everyone. The entire gamut of education stands on this adorable foundation.

The present education system gives much importance on examination results. As the results decide the level of intelligence of the learner and also the future proceedings, obviously it has its genuine validation. A plethora of experiments have well enriched the concept. But no standardised method has been universally practised for lack of consensus.

It is pertinent to note that nothing can test the real potentials of a learner. The present method has its own fallacies owing to its numerous aspects. But the system also has many green patches to testify the scholastic prosperity of a pupil.

The pen-and-paper test aims to justify the different stairs of learning within a timeframe. The examinee has to negotiate with more than one challenge during the prescribed process. Though the evaluation pattern is far from foolproof, it still can largely construct the learning pyramid as envisaged by eminent educationists. The onus is certainly on those associated with the entire man-making mission.

The students must be going through a nerve glitch during the period. Mentionable steps have been taken to ease the pressure by various agencies associated with the system and of philanthropic nature. Starting from the educational institutions to the parents, even the boards are adopting measures to ease the burden of the child.

When the activities are not rewarding rather the performances, it is bound to be result-oriented. When at the bottom line the outcome counts, it is sure to put additional weight on the person meant for the acid test. A particular examination can never be considered as the end of road. Simultaneously, the impact can never be subdued either.

It is always advisable to have patience and perseverance during the process which would be the source of determination and dedication. Only eyeing the results may not be rewarding unless it is enriched with hard efforts. Both the end and the means must be ideal to accomplish the real essence of education where examination is a noticeable fulcrum.

Educationists world over differ in many ways regarding the process and outcome of education in general and examination in particular. But all of them unanimously agree upon this notion of means and end. Unlike other genres, both play equally important role in an academic setup.

To culminate the goal and spread the fragrance of education, examination should be safely served as an elixir of noble means and celestial end.

16,09-3-20,"Palamu’s Khatiyan, Register 2 get online rectification","The repositories of land statements — the Khatiyan and Register 2 — got a fresh lease of life here in Palamu when under order of the DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahari a rectification drive was launched online wherein out of a total of 2,200 complaints related to the Khatiyan, around 1,700 were resolved in one day.

Agrahari said, “A special drive was launched in the circle offices here in the district. The errors in the Khatiyan and Register 2 were rectified on the Jhar Bhumi Portal.”

Agrahari said the manual rent receipt and online rent receipt sometimes show glaring discrepancies which were rectified online in this drive.

He said improper recording of land details which is done manually in Register 2 were also rectified.

DC has asked the lower rung revenue officials like rajswa karamcharis and circle inspectors to be extra cautious and careful in matter of land details maintenance.

DC said, “Our administration’s prime priority is to ease the work of mutation and in every Sarkar Aap Key Dwar programme my special thrust has been on the land

revenue stall where comes in the petitions, complaints and grievances with regard to mutation etc.”

He added, “Our additional collector revenue P K Prasad invariably addresses the gathering at the Sarkar Aap Key Dwar programme urging people coming for mutation to avail the facilities then and there on the spot and this strikes a good rapport with the needy people there in this kind of programme.”

A senior police officer refusing to be identified said, “Had mutation and land disputes here in Palamu been addressed properly in the past then there would not have arisen any extremism here as the root of extremism here lies in land.”

The Pioneer for the sake of news chanced upon a Register 2 of a ‘Halka’ of Chainpur circle where on a particular page of this Register 2 there were ample evidences of tampering with land details.

DC agreed that propriety in recording or insertion of land details in Register 2 must be done in all fairness and transparency.

There is a 100 page plus Mutation Law which is the blue book for mutation.

A normal case of mutation where the seller sells land by registered deed has mutation to be done in the name of the buyer within 30 days but where the very sale of land by registered deed called Kebala is challenged then in the event of disputants of the sale of that land for mutation in the name of the buyer can be initiated only when the seller gives an authentic Family Tree of him as no mutation of land is done if there is any lurking dispute over land.

The State land revenue department has show-caused more than half a dozen DCs of the state and 30 COs too for dilly dallying in matters of mutation and other rectification works related to land records where Palamu DC and its COs figure no where to which DC Agrahari said, “We could not be there on the show cause list as right from day one we were too pressing for mutation works to be done at war footing.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu---s-khatiyan--register-2-get-online-rectification.html
17,09-3-20,Govt sets promotion principles for employees,"The State Government has laid down principles to consider promotion of Government servants against whom major penalty proceedings initiated but concluded by completely exonerating or awarding minor penalties.

In fact, the question of the manner and method to be adopted for consideration of promotion of Government servants after exoneration from all charges or awarded with minor penalties on conclusion of disciplinary proceedings drawn u/r 15 of the OCS (CC&A) Rules, 1962 has been under active consideration of the Government for sometime.

Now, the Government has decided that on conclusion of the disciplinary proceeding, if the officer is completely exonerated, he shall be promoted to the next higher grade on notional basis at par with his immediate junior promoted earlier.

The Government servant may be promoted, if necessary by reverting the junior-most employee who has been allowed officiating promotion.

In cases where, after completion of the disciplinary proceedings, an officer has been punished with minor penalties, he shall be given promotion from the date his immediate junior has been given promotion and his pay will be notionally fixed in the time scale of the higher grade with effect from that date.

In cases where an officer has been punished with minor punishment of “suspension” then the officer cannot get promotion with retrospective effect. In such cases, the date of promotion of the officer concerned will be postponed by the period for which he was actually under suspension.

That means he will be promoted from the date on which his period of suspension will be over.

Besides, in cases where the punishment of ‘withholding of promotion’ has been imposed on the officer concerned, then the officer concerned cannot be promoted with retrospective effect.

His case will be taken up in the next Departmental Promotion Committee/ Selection Board/Selection Committee for consideration of his promotion to next higher grade.

Secondly, the State Government has decided that the respective administrative departments shall take immediate steps to frame cadre rules.

As instances have come to the notice of the Government about existence of some cadres in different departments of the Government without having cadre rules to regulate the said cadres as a result of which the employees do not get any promotion and their service conditions are not properly managed, orders have been issued to frame cadre rules immediately.

Where the cadre strength is less than 10 but there is no promotional post and it is not feasible to frame cadre rules to regulate the cadre, the administrative departments concerned may consider upgrading the posts to higher rank by keeping adequate residency period to fill-up the said upgraded promotional posts, said an official.

Similarly, to facilitate promotion, the appointing authorities shall publish the final gradation list of all the employees of the feeder grades latest by November 15 of the previous year in which the DPC sits for consideration of promotion.

A maximum of 15 days time may be allowed for inviting objections from the employees concerned before finalising the gradation list. Now the State Government is harping on timely promotion for its employees as per its 5T charter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-sets-promotion-principles-for-employees.html

21,09-3-20,Use of ‘magic pen’: City bizman duped of money,"A fraudster allegedly duped a shop owner of Rs 22,500 in Bhubaneswar in a cheque fraud using a ‘magic pen’ (pen with erasable ink).

After the shop owner filed a complaint with the Khandagiri police, an investigation was launched.

As per the complaint, the victim Somanath Sahu is a resident of Jagamara area and owns an electronic shop in Bapuji Nagar.

He got a call on March 4 from a ‘representative’ of a private bank identifying himself as Bikash Singh who offered him a personal loan of Rs 1 lakh. As Somanth was in need of money, he gladly agreed to the offer.

A youth reached Somanath’s shop at around 10.30 pm the next day to collect two cheques. He took one cheque of Rs 100 as processing fee from Somnath.

Also, he filled a cancelled cheque with his pen and asked Somanth to put his signature. After collecting both the cheques, the youth assured Somnath that loan amount will be credited to his bank account by 3 pm.

But Somanth got message on March 5 that Rs 22,500 has been withdrawn from his bank account.

After an inquiry with the bank, he came to know that the amount was withdrawn on basis of the cheque deposited by the youth.

A police official said preliminary investigation showed the amount was withdrawn from Somanth’s account by a person with a help of a cheque. The miscreant also provided an Aadhaar number to the bank.

22,09-3-20,Chowkidars in Palamu get motivation in pre-Holi exercise,"Chowkidars in Palamu have been spurred to be active and not to stand like ‘lamp posts’. This motivation was started keeping in view the coming Holi festival wherein village youths consume liquor and cause nuisance.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda told the Pioneer today, “I have given orders that chowkidars will make themselves present for a parade every Sunday in their respective police station.”

He added that the chowkidars are the first extended hands of police in the nook and corner of any village.

Linda said just a week ago, three chowkidars have been appointed on compassionate ground.

Chowkidars are appointed by DC and they get salary from the civil administration but they render their services to police.

On Sunday, SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta had an inspection of chowkidar parade in the Chainpur police station where came more than two dozen chowkidars some in uniform and some in civil dress.

Gupta quizzed every chowkidar about criminals on bails in their villages, movement of any naxal, gambling den, locations of illicit liquor manufacturing and sale, poppy cultivation, locations from where sand is excavated and smuggled, running of stone crushing plant, location of brick kiln, vulnerability of rural roads/ state roads from the point of view of road hold up and lot etc. Gupta said, “Some chowkidars work smartly but some are lazy. We are to spur them into action.”

“Keep small diary in your pocket.” reminded Gupta saying, “those who will not have pocket diary with them will face music.”

The chowkidar parade which SDPO Gupta oversaw had by his side inspector of police Chainpur RR Shahi and officer in charge of this police station Sunit Kumar.

One Chando beat chowkidar stands suspended for over a year following the outbreak of the communal riot there in 2018 winter said Sunit Kumar. Sunit Kumar said this chowkidar had failed to inform police well in time about communal convulsion at Chando which led to his suspension.

Inspector Shahi had a word of praise for a couple of chowkidars who as he said work ‘too good.’

A chowkidar told in the parade that sand smugglers are so strong that they just do not bother if chowkidars ask them not to smuggle sand. Another chowkidar said illicit liquor manufacturers have a similar attitude towards police.

On hearing this, Gupta asked Sunit Kumar to ‘launch a massive raid on sand smuggling and illicit liquor manufacturing units located in villages.’

He said, “Police bust earthen hearths where mahua is fermented and liquor prepared but within hours illicit liquor traders build it easily. It is a never ending illegal trading and police too crack against them at regular intervals.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chowkidars-in-palamu-get-motivation-in-pre-holi-exercise.html

While one suspect has fled from the village, the other is now under the direct vigil of the Health Department. They had come by a flight via Hyderabad and Vishakhapatnam and reached native Totaguda on March 4. According to them, they were not screened at any of the two airports.

Later, the two visited the District Headquarters Hospital where they were examined and their blood samples were collected for Covid-19 test. They were advised to stay in home isolation.

When contacted, CDMO Dr Gunurani Patnaik said, “The two have no symptoms of Coronavirus. Still, we have collected their blood samples and sent for tests as per Government norms.”

He, however, said he has no knowledge of the whereabouts of one of the two suspects. Health officials have kept a vigil on the one who is at home now, he said.

24,09-3-20,S’garh BJD women leaders denied party posts,"BJD supremo Naveen Pattnaik has endorsed a list of 33 organisational district presidents and 80 State executive members. But the party’s women leaders of the Sundargarh district are left disgruntled.

While in two organisational district committee of Rourkela and Sundargarh Sarada Prasad Nayak and Binaya Toppo were assigned as chief, four leaders (Mangala Kissan, Dilip Tirkey, Subrat Tarai and Binay Toppo) of the district were inducted in 80 members State executive committee. But not a single woman leader of the district was inducted in it.

Though many of women leaders are aggrieved with this arrangement but do not dare to protest it openly due to certain reasons. Firstly, they are expecting to be acommodated in forthcoming Rajya Sabha election or any other political rehabilitation in various organisations like Rourkela Development Authority (RDA) or Urban Bank Governing body etc.

Secondly, there is a fear of removal from party if they raise voice against the mood of the party boss.

Despite all this a woman leader on condition of anonymity said, “The party and its boss always talk of priority and privilege to woman but in reality, the women are neglected in party and it is more in Sundargarh district.” She said since the formation of Western Odisha Development Council for the first time a woman leader of the district Padmini Sekhar Deo was appointed as its Chairperson. But before two years of her tenure was complete, she was asked to resign. That time it was expected that Deo might be made a candidate for the Rajya Sabha as election for the 3 members of the Upper House in July 2014. But she was ignored.

Similarly, during 2019 election ticket distribution many local leaders stayed disgruntled. Even, leader Minati Debta had filed the nomination as an Independent candidate for Rourkela and later after the intervention of higher-ups in Bhubaneswar she withdrew. That time it was a talk in the city that she would be engaged as RDA Chairperson as the post became vacant after Sarada Nayak quit to file as a candidate for Rourkela Assembly seat. Though since then the post is lying vacant but no one is appointed. Many more women leaders are in party in the district who deserve for the posts but they have been ignored.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/s---garh-bjd-women-leaders-denied-party-posts.html

32,09-3-20,How to stop hair loss,"Unlike two decades ago, when men constituted 90 percent of patients who sought treatment for balding, now its 60 percent females who come to dermatologists for balding and hair loss.

The primary culprit is and can be a variety of reasons, but mostly a calorie restricted diet, continuous dieting, persistent stress, frequent chemical and heat-based hair treatments like colouring, straightening and even blowdry.

Dr Sachin Dhawan, Senior Consultant, Department of Dermatology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram talks about this lifestyle related problem.

There are two major patterns of hair loss in women .

Female pattern hair loss- a case where mild to moderate shedding takes place but eventually leads to thin (miniature) hair, thinning hair parting and Christmas tree like pattern of balding.

Telogen Effluvium: Sudden onset, massive loss of an excess of 100 hair stands per day eventually leading to loss of hair volume

Trigger factors are a diet which is below 1800 calories, weight loss, major illnesses like dengue, malaria, chikungunya, typhoid. Also, deficiencies of iron, vit B12, vit D and low ferritin can cause hair loss. Hormonal imbalances like PCOS and high androgen (male hormone) levels are often responsible and should be tested. Hair loss impacts women massively both mentally and cosmetically. In women hair loss is treated by adding minerals like zinc and iron, biotin, Amino acids.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/how-to-stop-hair-loss.html

Most of these TWBs, although in a dilapidated state, are still useful for different purposes for local people and for geoenviromental reasons.

“Most of the Bandhas in Khariar town are hundreds of year old. From archeological records, it is found that one of the Bandhas named Tira Bandha was excavated during 13th century AD. Likewise, the Gudelbandha, Nilji Bandha, Bishi Bandha, Mara Bandh, Kamla Sagar, Mukta Sagar, Khangal Munda and Hiramunda are centuries old water bodies excavated by the erstwhile kings, but unfortunately they are in a bad shape after being taken over by the Government due to lack of maintenance and renovation,” says archeologist Jitamitra Prashad Singh Deo.

“The water bodies served all types of water requirements of the people in the past. At the same time, they were instrumental in recharging ground water,” he adds.

It is true that all the water bodies located within Khariar NAC area are totally neglected. Khariar Minor Irrigation Division had submitted a DPR to the Water Resource Department about four years ago for repair, renovation and restoration (under RRR scheme) of some of the traditional water bodies inside the NAC. But the proposal got stuck and no fund was allotted.

The Khariar NAC, subsequently in 2018 October submitted proposals (DPR) for renovation of four of the old traditional structures of Khariar town with an estimated cost of Rs 713.66 lakh to the Housing and Urban Development Department. The DPRs got approved by the Government under Odisha Urban Infrastructure Development Project (OUIDP). However, the department put a condition that the NAC would have to contribute 10 percent of the project cost, which amounted to approximately Rs 80 lakh in total for four projects.

The NAC was given the go- ahead signal for reclamation of Hiramunda in the first phase and the amount sanctioned for the project was Rs 295.25 lakh. However, as the NAC was not in a condition to spend the contribution amount of Rs 29.5 lakh, the work could not be initiated. “We had to remain silent, because it was not possible for us to meet the condition,” said former executive officer of Khariar NAC Kishor Kumar Sahu.

The District Press Club of Nuapada with an objective to make the project effective held a meeting with MLA of Khariar, Adhiraj Mohan Panigrahi on Thursday last and raised the issue of contribution. Panigrahi, after a detailed discussion on the matter agreed to provide fund from MLA LAD to meet the contribution amount.

“I am always ready to extend support to such innovative projects; however such suggestions should come to my knowledge,” said Panigrahi.

The Press Club also drew the attention of the MLA towards problem of water depletion in the traditional water bodies and suggested for linking of the irrigation pipe lines with the water bodies as well as pisciculture tanks (24 in numbers spread over an area 25 acres of land) of Fisheries Department in Khariar. The MLA immediately invited the Executive Engineer (EE) of Lower Indra Irrigation Project (LIIP) and the possibility of linking the irrigation pipes with the tank was discussed. The EE agreed to conduct a feasibility study within a few days and proceed accordingly. He also informed that the department has taken note of the proposal of MLA Panigrahi for cement concrete lining of canals using paver machine.

“It has been assured by the higher authorities to pave all the canals with concrete lining after certification of 20,000 hectares in coming Kharif season. Once it is paved with concrete lining, the water loss will be nil,” said the EE. The MLA has agreed to sit frequently with Press Club to get feedback and suggestions for the development of the area.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/khariar-ponds-to-be-renovated--linked-with-irrigation-pipelines.html

38,09-3-20,CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES,"Since the concluding decades of the 21st century India’s rendezvous with the forces of globalisation has been phenomenal. As Indian economy opened up to the world economy there was also a simultaneous spurt in the urbanisation of the rather countrified Indian society.

However despite the cyclonic pace of urbanisation in India, only about 34 per cent of the total population of the country resides in urban areas presently. It’s almost like a living testimony to the words of Mahatma Gandhi when he said, “The soul of India lives in its villages”.

While globalisation has had innumerable upsides in terms of higher living standards for a sizeable chunk of indigenous populace and countless employment prospects, these benefits have certainly not accrued to all the communities alike. One grossly neglected sector happens to be the much underrated cottage industry of India. This neglect has manifested not just since the economic liberalisation of 1990s but right from the colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent.

The unique traditional artisanship of the rural people manufacturing various handicrafts with the use of simple tools and locally abundant raw materials, has been constantly declining in the face of a market composed of highly sophisticated factory made goods.

Since the historical period the unique silken, wooded and metallic handicrafts manufactured in India were a source of India’s prolific trade with the western and Arab world. This phenomenon which is globally referred to as proto industrialisation today, was pervasive in Indian society of that period.

Whether made for consumption or commercial needs, the locally made handicrafts were not just a source of domestic income but also an important symbol of India’s varied subcultures. In their artistic value they were collective expressions of local geography, lifestyles, religious beliefs, folkways and values of people inhabiting village communities and tribal regions.

The unique motifs, colours, engravings and designs of the handicrafts were a reflection of the culture of the myriad communities and tribes of Indian subcontinent. The sheer variety ranged from woollen products of mountainous belts of north and east India, ivory souvenirs of Mysore to cotton fabrics from Bengal.

The international demand and commercial appeal of these Indian handicrafts was a testimony to the beauty and mesmerising talent of the Indian craftsmen across centuries. However the policy of economic drain of Indian traditional economy practiced by British steadily pushed the Indian artisans into abysmal.

Most groups of craftsmen prolific in their crafts since generations had to flee back to agrarian sector for livelihood. With time the rapidly modernising Indian markets became increasingly addicted to modern and western goods. As a result in contemporary times, the cottage and small household industries in India are on the brink of extinction.

Inspite of being understated, the role of cottage industries in the economic and social development of India is very potent. Varied cottage industries of India including pottery, hosiery tanning, soap- making, toy-making, cutlery, cotton handloom industry, the silk weaving industry and the wool weaving have the capacity to generate employment for unskilled and semi skilled people besides utilising excess labour force.

This is a critical contribution given the magnitude of Indian population and gaps in formal education system. Apart from being an income source for the rural and suburbia poor, the environment friendly and technologically simple nature of cottage industries is an another boon. These enterprises make best possible use of locally abundant natural resources.

A little yet significant contribution of cottage and small scale industries is providing self empowerment to rural women. Given that no formal operational set up is needed for such work it is easier for women to participate in it alongside child rearing.

Women force employed in household enterprises like saree embroidery, jewellery making and papad across various small towns in India have often reported greater participation in decision making in families and communities affairs. A systematic development of cottage industries has potential to ameliorate the living standards and nutritional status of rural women and children.Cottage industry sector in India today faces a variety of problems that blunt their growth and restricts their expansion. Most critical issues nagging their growth are organisational weaknesses, technical deficiency, poor marketing facilities lack of government and private sector support. Modern India has been harbouring the false notion that cottage industries are destined to die in an age of machinery. This is far from the truth and with little attention from the government cottage and small scale industries can do wonders to Indian economic growth.

Mahatma Gandhi echoed the same sentiment when he repeatedly insisted on the development of khadi in modern India. Although the government has taken up a few initiatives for the sustenance of these industries through its 9th and 10th year economic plans, exclusively for the gems, coir and leather sector, it have not made any substantial improvement in their condition. Other important initiatives of the government are - Assistance to Coir Industrial Co-operative Societies, assistance for setting up of industries (Capital Investment Subsidy to SSI Units) and women entrepreneur development programme.

A developing country like India can barely progress without an encouraging aid from cottage industry. A change in mindset of people is as important as government sponsored programmes towards the systematic expansion of cottage industry sector.

Instead of being viewed as technologically inferior, it should be welcomed as engine of growth. Private companies should lend their hand by recruiting items of interior decoration, cutlery and furnishings from the rich and varied cottage industry made products. Development in the real sense of its meaning has to be all inclusive rather then lopsided or exclusionary. Only when the less advantaged and the prosperous grow in tandem can sustainable economic, social and cultural growth become a reality.

39,09-3-20,Scavengers dying in manholes despite law to protect them,"Ramesh Kumar inspects the manhole brimming with filth and soot. He talks in whisper to his friend Suresh, closes his eyes and folds his hands in prayer as he gets ready to enter the manhole.

“I am not sure whether I will come out of the manhole alive or not. Thus, this short prayer,” Ramesh says as a smile floats his face.

Suresh pats his friend’s back as Ramesh enters the manhole to clear a blockage which has turned the area around the manhole into a cesspool.

Ramesh is one of the hundreds of thousands of manual scavengers spread across India who clean septic tanks, gutters and sewer. The job is not only tedious but life threatening. Fatalities are very common. Ramesh and his peer know this. Therefore, every time a scavenger enters a manhole he offers a small prayer for his safety because the contractor, who is supposed to give them safety kits, has denied them the basic equipment like masks, gloves and gas concentration detectors to cut the cost.

“We work with our bare hands and cover our mouth and nose with gamchha (scarf) to save ourselves from the poisonous gases,” said Kallu, another person present there to assist Ramesh at the time of emergency.

“Our life has no value Babuji (sir). This contractor knows that one can die while cleaning the manhole but who cares. The contractor wants to get the work done at the earliest. So, he coaxes and cajoles us to enter the gutter without any safety kit. If we die what will he lose – nothing,” said Suresh Valmiki.

RISE IN DEATH TOLL

The number of deaths while cleaning sewers, manholes and septic tanks has increased over the last few years. The year 2019 saw the maximum number of deaths in the past five years. The officials claim that 110 workers were killed while cleaning sewer lines and septic tanks across India. In 2018, the number of fatalities was 68 — thus in one year there was 61 per cent increase in these deaths.

This is more nauseating because the number of deaths have increased despite the Union government enacting a law for the protection of scavengers in 2013. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act has put to end the practice of any form of manual cleaning, carrying, disposing of or handling of human waste.

Talk about the law and government rules, and Suresh gives a hearty laugh. “What law and kanoon you are talking about, sir. We are working in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people and no one says it is illegal. A government contractor has given us the assignment to clean the sewer line. In other words, this is government work that we are doing. And around 100 metres from here there is a police station. Have you seen police coming here asking us not to enter the manhole because it is illegal?” Suresh Valmiki asks, pointing in the direction of the police station.

“When someone dies while cleaning the sewer, the government officials, contractors and people like you will talk about law and precautions one should take. Then you will hit us with the rule book. Otherwise, we are gripped with sab chalta hai syndrome,” Valmiki, who is also office-bearer of Uttar Pradesh Safai Karmachari Sangh, said.

On August 22 last year, five safai workers had died after inhaling poisonous gases inside an under-construction manhole at Krishna Kunj Colony in Ghaziabad.

Pradeep Chauhan, state general secretary of UP Rajya Safai Karmachari Sangh, said that the government did not give compensation because they were contractual workers.

“The death shatters the whole family because the bread winner dies in the gutter in an attempt to clean it so that others can have a decent life,” he said.

The Government of India has carried out a national survey in 18 states, according to which there were a total of 48,345 manual scavengers working till January 31, 2020. Of this, 29,923 are engaged in manual scavenging in Uttar Pradesh, making it the largest number in any state in India.

CASTE DIVIDE

As more than 50 per cent of the manual scavengers across India are engaged in Uttar Pradesh, one of the most impoverished states of India, the practice is driven by caste, class and income divides. The people who do this work are Dalits. There are many instances in which women and men from the Valmiki caste (the lowest caste in caste hierarchy) are engaged by urban municipal corporations, both directly and through contractors, to manually clean excrement.

This is no secret that lower caste people are engaged by the authorities to do scavenging work. Ramesh, Suresh, Kallu and their like belong to lower caste and they do not hide this fact. “Do you expect man from upper caste will get down into the gutter to clean human excreta? He will never do it. From ages we (Dalits) are made to do this work and now everyone expects that only we will do it,” Suresh Valmiki said.

Kallu interjects to say that like a Brahmin (upper caste) is destined to be a priest of a temple, a Dalit is meant to be a scavenger (the man who clean human excreta).

These people have their own colony. In Lucknow, the manual scavengers can be found in Luv Kush Colony near Indira Nagar. These people do not have permanent job. They work as contractual workers and earn anything between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per day.

“We charge no less than Rs 1,000 to clean the sewer line. Sometimes we get more depending on the ‘seth’. Sometimes they even pay us Rs 2,000. We work in groups of two or three persons and we distribute the money among ourselves,” Suresh said.

They generally clean one to two manhole per day. But during rains this number can go up and they make good money during monsoon.

“We have family to support and need money. But who wants to work in this atmosphere. This is really nauseating. But we have no option as we do not know other work. People of our caste are born to clean the excreta of others and we are doing the same,” he said.

Ashif Shaikh, founder of Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan, a grassroots campaign against manual scavenging, says that manual scavenging is not an employment but an injustice akin to slavery. “It is one of the most prominent forms of discrimination against Dalits and it is central to the violation of their human rights,” he says.

The seriousness of the topic was broken by the a shout from gutter as Ramesh asked for help. The gutter had ankle-deep water and he was asking for some contraption to clear the blocked sewer line. A foul smell had filled the area. They called it sewer gas, which is a complex mixture of toxic and non-toxic gases.

These people are not educated but experience has taught them that these gases are present at varying levels, depending upon the source. They know that if there is a sharp smell of rotten egg they should come out because it is lethal.

The gas these workers are talking about is hydrogen sulphide which is soluble in water and becomes trapped in sewage matter. When the sewage is disturbed, the gas leaks out and causes nausea, delirium and convulsions, which can all imperil self-rescue. It is also a skin and eye irritant.

“We have got gamchha to fight this gas. But sometimes it is not enough,” said Ramesh, who came out of the gutter after it started emanating gas smelling like rotten egg.

GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION

On March 6, the Union government prepared a Rs 1.25 lakh crore National Action Plan to completely phase out manual scavenging and acquire hi-tech machines in 500 cities and major gram panchayats to clean sewer lines without any human interface.

The Group of Ministers headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who also happens to be Member of Parliament from Lucknow, finalised a National Action Plan. The plan being considered has two parts – rehabilitation of manual scavengers and completely phasing out the practice of physically entering sewer lines for cleaning them.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scavengers-dying-in-manholes-despite-law-to-protect-them.html
40,09-3-20,CM: Don’t panic over coronavirus spread,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked people not to get panicky about spread of coronavirus and instead take precautions, saying “prevention is better than cure”.

“The government has set up isolation wards in all districts for suspected patients and there is complete arrangement for their treatment,” the chief minister said while addressing a public meeting during the sixth Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela at the primary health centre in Ahirauli Bazaar in Kushinagar on Sunday.

He congratulated everyone on International Women’s Day.

The chief minister reiterated his government’s commitment to respect ‘matrishakti’ (women) and empower them through Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela at all primary health centres in the state.

“Matrishakti has a great importance in the Indian tradition and they have been respected in every sphere of life. This is the reason that the most ancient society continues its march on the path of continuous progress even while facing all the adverse conditions,” he said.

“A society in which there is discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, religion, gender or on any other issue, cannot progress. Collective efforts should become the basis of our empowerment,” he added.

The chief minister said the Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela was being organised at all primary health centres of the state since February 2 and every Sunday, a team of 3-4 doctors was giving free consultation to the patients at these health centres along with medicines.

He said that in this health fair, essential medicines were being given to patients suffering from TB, leprosy or any other disease along with providing golden cards of Ayushman Bharat and Mukhyamantri Jan Arogya Yojana and nutrition mission was also being promoted.

“If any part of our body becomes weak, the body is not considered complete. Likewise, if a person remains weak in any way in society, then it is a loss to the society and the society has to pay its price. Keeping this in mind, the government is accelerating the nutrition mission,” he said and added that a special nutrition mission was also being launched for 15 days from Sunday under which anganwadi and Asha workers would reach out to every child in every village.

Yogi said that the government was going to build a medical college dedicated to Lord Buddha in Kushinagar and it would provide better health facilities to the local people who would not have to go to Gorakhpur for treatment.

The chief minister inspected the primary health centre before his address.

On the occasion of International Women’s Day, he also honoured 10 women who did excellent work in different fields. They included Manju Lata, Saroj Devi, Gunja Gaur, Roshni, Fatima Khatoon, Vibha Pandey, Neeraj Pandey, Shashikala, Jyoti Singh and Sunaina Devi.

The chief minister inspected the health fair organised at primary health centre in Ahirauli, in Hata block of Kushinagar and also inaugurated the nutrition mission. He also inaugurated the Arogya Mela in Siddharth Nagar primary health centre on Nepal border.

On Sunday, 4.68 lakh patients (1.62 lakh males, 2.22 lakh women, 0.84 lakh children) were benefited by the health fair. As many as 10,280 serious patients were referred to higher medical centres and 32,917 golden cards were distributed. In the fair, 10,164 doctors, 48,403 paramedical staff and 26,436 anganwadi workers rendered their services.

As many as 26.79 lakh patients have been benefited so far in the last five health fairs while over 66,000 serious patients have been referred to higher medical centres and 1.99 lakh golden cards have been prepared.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm--don---t-panic-over--coronavirus-spread.html
41,09-3-20,51L MT paddy procurement in Kharif season,"Amid apprehension of loss to the standing Rabi crop due to unseasonal rains, the Uttar Pradesh government has achieved paddy procurement of close to 51 lakh metric tons from farmers in the current Kharif marketing season.

With this, the state has surpassed its procurement target of 50 lakh MT by 13 per cent. Last year, UP had clocked paddy purchase of a little over 48 lakh MT. The state paddy procurement season had commenced on October 1 and was to officially conclude by the end of February, 2020.

According to official statistics, the state government agencies and Food Corporation of India (FCI) procured foodgrain from more than 7,00,000 farmers, including sharecroppers and contract farmers, for the first time. Wheat is procured from the farmers at the minimum support price fixed under price intervention scheme.

The procurement had been robust due to the high priority accorded by the state for ensuring a hassle-free process and the emphasis it laid on making the fields vacant for enabling early sowing of Rabi crop, including wheat.

The Yogi Adityanath government has been working on doubling farm income by 2024, with high procurement, remunerative prices, prompt payments, and early vacancy of fields among the key elements of the plan. It is also promoting food processing and allied industries to further enrich the farm value chain.

At total of 3,977 procurement centres, including 103 run by the FCI, had been set up across the 75 districts in the state to facilitate direct purchase from farmers.

Meanwhile, more than Rs 9,000 crore had been paid directly into the registered bank accounts maintained by paddy farmers against the procurement.

According to Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi, while under the previous regimes, the state paddy farmers had to wait for months to get their outstanding payments, they were getting their dues promptly under the present dispensation.

In September 2019, the UP cabinet had announced the paddy procurement policy for 2019-20, increasing the minimum support price (MSP) to Rs 1,835 per quintal for Grade-A paddy, apart from provisioning Rs 20 per quintal additional for farmers as transport and other support. This hiked the effective state paddy procurement price to Rs 1,855 per quintal.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) has pegged the aggregate credit potential in the UP agricultural and allied sectors at Rs 2.94 lakh crore for the financial year 2019-20. It is a growth of over 9.7 per cent compared to the figure of Rs 2.68 lakh crore estimated for the current 2019-20 fiscal year by the Nabard. Last year, the state credit potential had grown by 13 per cent.

Meanwhile, Agriculture Director Shoraj Singh said some districts might have suffered 20-25 per cent loss due to rain and hailstorm but a better picture would emerge in the next 10-15 days. He said district authorities were assessing the losses.

Sudhir Panwar, president of the Kisan Jagriti Manch, said wheat, mustard, potato, tobacco and barley crops were damaged across UP. “Preliminary reports suggest 20-25 per cent loss in almost all the regions but in some areas of Mathura, Aligarh, Etawah, Saharanpur and some parts of Bundelkhand, entire crop has been damaged and loss varies between 70-80 per cent,” he said.

Officials said the overall damage had been limited as bright sunshine followed three to four days of rainfall.

The weather office expects clear skies for a few days but another weather system is heading for the hilly states of northern India early next week.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/51l-mt-paddy--procurement-in--kharif-season.html

47,09-3-20,JNV student’s death shrouded in mystery,"The recent death of a Class-XII student of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) at Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh has sent shockwaves across the entire academic fraternity.

The deceased Amit Kumar Bind was found hanging in the toilet of his hostel, with a bottle stuffed in his mouth, raising suspicions of murder.

According to the school authorities, Amit was under immense pressure owing to the Board Examinations. Police have sent the body for postmortem.

It is alleged that JNV, a chain of schools under the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry lack adequate checks and balances within the system. The absence of sanctioned posts for Wardens coupled with overworked teachers has only compounded matters.

The flagrant human rights violation, steep rise in suicide cases and indifferent attitude of the concerned authorities has raised serious questions about the efficiency of officials holding various posts within the organisation.

In the opinion of Navodaya Vidyalaya Employees’ Welfare Association national president Yogendra Sharma and general secretary Ranjeeta Senapati, the Wardens can be highly instrumental in keeping a vigil over students and ensure their well being. Mishap and untoward incidents can certainly be prevented.

Rather than vitiating the atmosphere, a conducive learning system ought to be encouraged in school by the authorities.

Lawyer Dines Pandey said a vigilance court was very much essential in the district without which the lawyers had to run to Sambalpur. There should not be any delay in setting up a vigilance court in the district, Pandey added.

Lawyer Bhupendra Baidya said that without vigilance court, people were waiting for a long time to get justice.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---establish-family--vig-courts-in-j---suguda---.html

56,09-3-20,Positive steps towards people’s police,"In the aftermath of Anti CAA protests and concomitant police action in Delhi and elsewhere, the police as an organization has been vilified and libelled. The media narrative has discredited the functioning of police, called it partial, unprofessional and motivated. The vitriolic exaggeration of police aberrations by social media is unprecedented. 'Khaki' which symbolises 'sacrifice' and 'honour' has been dubbed as belligerent and diabolical. Of late there has been a venomous assault on the credibility of police as an institution. This is not to suggest that previously police enjoyed a flawless reputation but it has been battling the allegations of corruption, civil atrocities and flawed work culture among others.

One the eve of Eid last year at SVPNPA, Hyderabad, I had gone to one nearby Eidgah to offer prayers. Large number of people had poured in. After offering prayers while we were leaving through the only exit, a huge crowd accumulated with almost nobody moving. Suddenly somebody said why aren't the people in front moving. To this somebody from front replied that police is distributing gifts to people at the exit gate and that is why it is taking so long. To which the former replied,"" How come police which cheats and loots people are distributing gifts to public!! and everybody around had a sarcastic laugh. However, this is a less pernicious and a bygone remark considering the current spate of viciousness against the police in the country.

While this goes beyond a doubt that there are many issues in working of police which can be improved upon, but caricaturing the police personnel and bizarre mud-slinging by media won't improve the things. Though, honest leadership, positive feedback and political will can certainly undo various fall-outs. As per 2018 survey of 15,562 respondents across 22 states, the Lokniti team of Centre for study of developing societies (CSDS) found that 25 per cent of Indians trust the police (as compared to 54 per cent for army). A big reason for this distrust is the lopsided narrative generated over police by media and cinema. Even people who have never interacted with police tend to think negatively about them. For augmenting police as an institution an honest attempt of introspection is needed, followed by concerted efforts to change the things.

OWNING THE FORCE ON GROUND

Police is mandated with responsibility of preserving law and order and upholding public peace and bonhomie. To accomplish this, law has given multitude of powers to police to meet out these duties. However, there have been occasions when the police personnel on ground have gone overboard with these powers. At ground level the police force is brazenly ill-equipped and under trained. Sometimes the indifference of senior officers brings in alienation. To carve their own niche, the force on ground tends to affiliate with influential pressure groups, local leaders and seek refuge with them and act so as to fulfill their vested interests. Thus, there essentially is issue of leadership where the senior officers must own up every single person of force and give them a sense of belongingness and hold their hand before anybody else does.

THE TOUGH COP SYNDROME

A culture of machismo still permeates wherein it is believed that a police officer to be effective must be masculine and dominant. Qualities like being soft-spoken and docile are seldom seen in good spirit. However, the roughness of tone and sulky face isn't likely to increase the efficiency in the department. This mindset needs to change. Police can also render services to people not with a puckered face but with a smile. Inducting more women in the force can help. Presence of women personnel in Police station can dramatically change its overall ambience as well as style of interaction with public. Women in country constitute just 7.28 per cent of the police force. In Punjab, the picture is grimmer with just 3 per cent representation of women in entire police force.

OVERWORKED AND UNDER APPRECIATED

As per the Status of Policing in India Report-2019 by Common Cause and Centre for Study Developing Societies (CSDS), a policeman in India on average works for 14 hours a day against the scheduled 8 hours. The irregular and long working hours not only affect the physical health but also contribute to mental stress among police personnel, ultimately impacting the efficiency of force. Long drawn working hours makes a person irritated and short-tempered and deteriorates the work-life balance. Thus working hours need to be regularised In police. The much-debated idea of outsourcing non-core functions can be done.

THE MEDIA FALLACY

In a democratic set up like ours people reserve a right to express their discontent against the government as long as they don’t disrupt the life of the common man or cause damage to public property.

However, a real life situation goes beyond this theoretical proposition and decisions are to be made in fraction of seconds in a hostile and emotion driven scenario, when the thin line appears 'blurred'. While these are the testing times for any officer to maintain grit and patience, however, in case of any aberration, no stone is left unturned to showcase entire police force as biased and corrupt. Such bogus media projection of police has to stop.

Attempts should be made to churn out good relations with public through community policing initiatives.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/positive-steps-towards-people---s-police.html

61,09-3-20,"Lobbying intensifies in BJP, Cong","With the start of nomination process of polls for three Rajya Sabha seats in Haryana, many prominent leaders of BJP and Congress have intensified their lobbying of party nomination.

The election for three Rajya Sabha seats in the State will be held on March 26 in which 2 seats are expected to go to the ruling BJP-JJP alliance while one seat to Congress to the Upper House of Parliament.

According to BJP insiders, there is a strong lobbying among three Jat veterans of the party former Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu, former Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankhar and party state president Subhash Barala from Jat quota.

Former Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma and from MP Sudha Yadav are also making efforts to go in Rajya Sabha from non-Jat quota.

In Congress, state party state president Kumari Selja is trying to go to Rajya Sabha for the second consecutive term. Her closeness to the Gandhi family, particularly, Sonia Gandhi, eases her path. She also led the party successfully in the assembly polls where Congress won 31 seats, surprising its critics and supporters as well.

After losing the election from Kaithal, former minister and Congress national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala and former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda's son and former MP Deepender Singh Hooda are also trying to enter the Rajya Sabha. Surjewala is close to Rahul Gandhi while Deepender too of the young brigade is considered close to the former Congress President and the Waynad MP. Basically it is toss up between Selja, Surjewala and Deepender.

The grapevine in political circles is that JJP too is eyeing the Rajya Sabha seat. However, it remains to be seem if the BJP is willing to accommodate a JJP candidate at this point of time as it also enjoys the support of the Indepndent MLAs and there is no threat on the government at this point of time.

Currently, BJP-backed Subhash Chandra and BJP's DP Vats are representing Haryana in the Rajya Sabha.

In February 2014, Selja of Congress became a member of Rajya Sabha and would complete her tenure in April. Ram Kumar Kashyap, former INLD MP, resigned from Rajya Sabha membership when his tenure was nearing completion and INLD was going through a phase of disintegration. He joined the BJP before the Assembly election last year and was subsequently elected MLA from Indri.

Under Section 151-A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, if the remaining term of the sitting Rajya Sabha member for the vacant seat is less than one year, then in such a situation, the Election Commission does not go for a by-election for that seat.

The Election Commission on March 3 had announced bypoll to a Rajya Sabha seat from Haryana vacated by former Union minister Birender Singh. Singh resigned after he his son Brijendra Singh got a Lok Sabha ticket and won the election from the BJP. As soon as the son got the ticket, he announced that he would leave Rajya Sabha seat. He resigned after his son's victory in the election

Sources said that while members elected in place of Kumari Selja and Kashyap will serve a full term of six years till 2026, the member elected in place of Birender Singh will have a term for his remaining period till August 2022.

In the 90-member Haryana Assembly, the BJP has 40 MLAs while its alliance partner JJP has 10 legislators. The main opposition Congress has strength of 31 members while out of eight independent MLAs, seven have extended support to the BJP-JJP government. The INLD has one member.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lobbying-intensifies-in-bjp--cong.html

63,09-3-20,Essential nature of the human mind,"Mind, which in shloka 15.7 of the Bhagavad Gita has been referred to as the sixth sense, is a person’s faculty of thought and his ability to remember things. It is the seat of one’s ideas, opinions, perceptions, emotions, memory, will etc. One’s thoughts, which constitute the mind, are rooted in his past experiences and likely future events. The mind has immense power, whether for the good or for the evil. Mind can, thus, make or break a person. By its very nature, the mind is very restive. It is always running after one or the other object. That is why it has often been likened to a drunk monkey, which is aimlessly jumping from one branch to another.As stated in shloka 7.4 and 7.5, mind belongs to the material, and not consciousness, nature of the Supreme Lord. Similarly, in shlokas from 13.1 to 13.7, the mind along with other objects of the physical world has been termed as field, the area of activity. All changes such as birth, growth and death take place in the field. The self, knower of the field, is the consciousness which witnesses all the activities of the body and the mind. Mind along with the body is, thus, the doer of all activities and self is the witness of all such activities. The hierarchy of different levels of human existence has been narrated in shloka 3.42 wherein it is stated that the mind is greater than the senses and intelligence is greater than the mind. And that which is greater than even intelligence, is the self.

The nature of mind has been described by Arjuna in shlokas 6.33 and 6.34. It has been stated by him that the mind is unsteady ; and very fickle, restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. These characteristics of the mind make it very unpredictable and difficult to control. As all the functions of the mind relate tomaterial nature, they are transient. The mind is always in flux. It is, therefore, unsteady and fickle. The mind is troublesome mainly because it is outward looking. Instead of being guided by the intelligence and illumined by the self, it is driven by the senses. As stated in shloka 2.67, even one of the senses wandering in its objects can carry away a man’s intelligence if his mind is constantly focussed on that sense. Such attachment with different sense objects creates a web of selfish desires in which the mind gets entangled. As a result, it remains restless.

The restlessness is not overcome even if one gets the object of his desire, because the satisfaction and happiness so obtained is only momentary. The tyranny of endless and ever expanding desires does not let one gain serenity of mind. Constant restlessness ultimately leads to misery. The confusion created by the multiple conflicts arising in the mind from time to time keeps it disturbed. The mind often experiences turbulence due to the disturbances created by vigorous currents of fear, anger, lust and greed etc. A turbulent mind is unable to take appropriate decisions at opportune time. The mind is said to be strong because it overpowers one’s intelligence with the strong impulses produced by attachment with the objects of the senses ; thereby destroying the faculty of discrimination. It clouds one’s power of judgement.

The mind is also said to be obstinate because when it holds a particular view, it refuses to let it go. It continues to hold it firmly inspite of it being obviously false and having harmful effects. In view of these unwholesome and irrational traits, Arjuna feared that to control the mind was more difficult than even controlling the wind. He expressed his helplessness in managing his emotions. Krishna conceded in shloka 6.35 that the mind being restless was very difficult to curb. Yet, He assured Arjuna, nay mankind, that it can be controlled by non-attachment (vairagya) and constant practice (abhayas). When one develops an attitude of non-attachment towards the objects of the senses, then he is not unduly influenced by the glitter of the outside world. Instead, he focuses his mind on the divine within (abhayas). Krishna further stated in shloka 6.36 that though it was not easy to attain evenness of mind for the one whose mind is not disciplined, but the one who is self-controlled and makes sincere efforts through right means, can easily attain

it. In short, one must raise his consciousness level step by step - from senses to the mind, further to the intelligence ; and finally to the self. Non-attachment, constant practice and sincere efforts play an important role in control of one’s mind. But what is most important is the exercise of self-discipline through right means. When one’s mind is controlled and enlightened, he then sees myriad objects and events as different manifestations of the Divine.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/essential-nature-of-the-human-mind.html

The protesters, belonging to ETT-TET Unemployed Teachers’ Union, were protesting against the failure of the government to provide them government jobs in the Education Department. The protesters have cleared the Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) and qualified the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET).

For several months, they have staged a sit-in protest outside the residence of Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla in Sangrur, demanding jobs.

Police asked the marching protesters to disperse but they insisted to go towards the Chief Minister’s residence. As a scuffle broke out between protesters and police personnel, the police had to use force to disperse them. Even as the police detained dozen teachers, the protest continued.

“We were protesting peacefully, but the police personnel attacked us with sticks without any provocation,” said a woman protester Raj Rani.

“The government is advocating promoting a girl child and empowering the women. Contrary to this, it used the force to silent our voices on the day when the world is honouring women on International Women’s Day,” she said with tears rolling down.

Patiala SP Varun Sharma, who lost his cool at the protest, was caught on camera lathicharging the teachers, including women.

Another protester Surjit Kaur said that the police, especially the male cops, were ruthless towards the women protesters. She claimed that the male cops lathicharged them and pulled them by the hair.

Former Education Minister and Shriomani Akali Dal leader Daljit Singh Cheema said that the lathicharge is condemnable, and the “government must find solutions through talks and not by force. There should be action against those involved”.

Patiala’s former MP Dr Dharamvir Gandhi decried the police action. The agitators were heading towards the Chief Minister’s residence just to hand over their charter of demands when the police began the lathicharge, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protesting-teachers-lathicharged.html

70,09-3-20,"Healthy people need not wear masks, says Kejriwal","Following the meeting of the State level task force, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced various measures to control the outbreak of the coronavirus including separate facilities for collection of samples at various hospitals, conducting thermal screening of the passengers at airport among others.

Kejriwal also said that there was no need for the healthy to wear masks, but asked people to wash their hands with soap frequently.

His comments came amid surge in demand for masks and hand sanitizers in the market after three confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in Delhi.

""If a healthy person wears a mask, there are circumstances when one might use their hands to adjust the mask. In such case, you are putting yourself at the risk of getting infected and get exposed,"" the Chief Minister said in reply to a question

Kejriwal, who chaired the meeting of task force, said that airport authorities have been directed to conduct thermal screening of the passengers. The Delhi government has deployed 40 doctors for the same. Those from Delhi are also being monitored consistently for 14 days. Around 1, 40,603 passengers have been screened and put under surveillance,"" he said.

The chief minister said that now 25 hospitals have the facilities where one can submit the samples. Out of the 25 hospitals, six are private hospitals while others are those of the Delhi Government.

""We are making separate facilities for collection of samples and treatment in these hospitals so that if any patient arrives there, they don't come in contact with others,"" he said.

The Delhi government will request the Centre to impose a ban on travel to countries that have recorded a large number of coronavirus cases, he said.

Kejriwal said he will meet Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday to request a ban on travel to countries with a large number of COVID-19 cases.

The Government had set up a task force to take preventive measures against the spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) in the national capital. The task force has representatives from all agencies concerned, including municipal corporations and the Delhi police.

Dr Nutan Mundeja, Director General of Health Services and Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of NCDC who were also present with Kejriwal during press conference, presented a comprehensive overview of corona virus and to elucidate how contagious the disease is.

Dr Mundeja said, ""Corona virus is a respiratory virus and the symptoms of the problem are cough and cold. The virus infection is contagious, which means a person can spread the virus through coughing and sneezing in the form of droplets, which can be at a short range of 1-1.25 meters,"" he said.

""Everyone should cover their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing so that no droplets can reach other persons' eyes, nose or mouth. It is advisable to use tissues or cover your face through elbows instead of cloth handkerchief to avoid transmission of the virus. Second, if the droplets do not reach another person, they settle on a surface, which can then be touched by various people,"" he said,"" adding that these droplets lose their effects in two days on hard surfaces and in 7-8 days on soft surfaces.

""It is very likely for people to touch these surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose, and mouth, which increases the chances of the virus entering the body. This is the reason why we are asking people to wash their hands repeatedly, as well as to not touch unwanted surfaces in public areas,"" he added.

Elaborating it further, Dr Mundeja said ""If a healthy person wears masks consistently for hours, he or she may feel uncomfortable. They will adjust their masks and touch their faces with their hands which may have touched some unwanted surfaces,"" he said.

Explaining disadvantages of wearing mask, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, Director of NCDC, said that wearing masks in the public gives a false sense of security to the people and also develop a false narrative that the person wearing a mask might be infected.

""It is advised to only wear the masks if you are suffering from cold and cough, or if you have returned from outstation and going to get yourself checked for any symptoms that you may notice. In case you notice symptoms, make sure to use private transport instead of public commute,"" he said.

""Everyone wants to purchase an N95 mask nowadays, which is not required. N95 masks are only required for healthcare workers, who are collecting samples for testing in the labs, and doctors who are examining the patients. Other than that, even nurses do not require these masks. Also, markets have been flooded with people asking for hand sanitizers. Washing hands with regular soap and water for 20 seconds is enough,"" he said

The Delhi Government also announced a 24X7 state-district level control room helpline numbers 011-22307145/ 011-22300012/ 22300036.

Apart from the visitors from various parts of India, a number of foreigners also visit this pilgrimage town. In order to ensure that any of the visitors, especially those from abroad do not bring the coronavirus with them, the authorities in Haridwar are keeping an eye on the visitors from foreign countries.

73,09-3-20,Int’l Women’s Day means nothing to ordinary women,"The International Women’s Day was celebrated on Sunday with the usual lectures and felicitations in Dehradun and other parts of the State. Many events were held to felicitate women from different walks of life for their hard work, determination and fortitude.

However, there are several women like rag pickers, vendors, widows and poor housewives who are unaware of what they term the alien concept or insignificant occasion of ‘women’s day’. Though these women are not appreciated and honoured for their struggles and achievements in life, they still live a dignified and respectful life.

On being asked about the International Women’s Day and its relevance, 48-year-old rag picker Sunita said she knew nothing about the occasion. In fact, she started asking various questions like whether women don’t work on this day and if women get inexpensive ration for their kids on the occasion. When she was informed that nothing like this happens on this day she asked, “Then why it is a special day for women? If everything is the same for every woman on this day, then what is the motive behind such a day?” About her life, she said, “Everyday I pick recyclable garbage in the city and earn about Rs 100 to Rs 200 per day.

I have a handicapped husband and seven children of which two daughters have been married. My two younger sons study in a government school here and two daughters stay at home or sometimes help me in the work.” She said that sometimes it becomes hard for her to feed her family with her meager income but she never considers begging like some others. “I and my family can stay hungry for a few days rather than begging to eat,” she said. A roadside vendor near Parade Ground, Reshma also said she knows nothing about this day. Reshma spends her day selling hair clips, earrings and bindis to earn her livelihood. She considers herself an independent woman who can earn her own livelihood. According to her, every day is the same for women like her and the days like Women’s Day do not change anything at least in their life.

According to a widow Deepa Chauhan, “I do not think that Women’s Day is for ordinary women like us. It is for famous people who can organise events and honour well-known women in it. For us, it is like any other day where we get up in the morning and get ready to struggle for our survival.

For me, this day is only for well known city women and not for ordinary women because our struggle and small achievements remain limited to us.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/int---l-women---s-day-means-nothing-to-ordinary-women.html

The Government has issued eviction orders to these retired officers who have not vacated Government flats even after their retirement and warned them that they will be removed along with their belongings if they do not comply with the order.

Last month, the public works department (PWD) had launched a door-to-door survey of all the housing units and asked officials to submit a report by February 24, an exercise that was aimed at finding out illegal occupants of Government flats in the national capital. According to an official, the PWD issued an order on February 25 stating that there were around 27 retired officials who occupied Type-I flats and were asked to pay around Rs 58.16 lakh as their dues.

The official said that the department has directed these 87 retired officials to pay around Rs 3.98 crore as their dues.

""The non-compliance of the order would attract action under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act- 1971 and the eviction proceedings will be initiated and occupants will be removed or evicted along with their respective belongings,"" the PWD said in its order. He said that around 49 retired officials have not vacated their Type-II flats and have been asked to pay dues of Rs 2.19 crore. The official said that there were 11 illegal occupants who have occupied Type-III flats, adding that they have been asked to vacate their government accommodation immediately and pay Rs 1.2 crore.

The move comes days after the Delhi High Court rebuked the Housing Ministry for permitting over 550 accommodation units to be illegally occupied by retired officials and ordered the Centre to get them vacated within two weeks.

On February 5, the court had also said that allowing illegal occupation of Government accommodation for several years amounts to ""connivance and conspiracy"".",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-directs-87-retired-officers-to-vacate-official-flats-immediately--pay-rs-4-cr-dues.html
76,09-3-20,"Women should be respected, honoured throughout year","From awarding women achievers to organising health and other social awareness camps for women, the government and non-government organisations on Sunday organised a slew of events across the Haryana to mark the International Women’s Day celebrations.

The woman achievers -- academician, intellectual, politician and youth who represent growing tribe of modern feminine power despite their ages shared their views about women’s social, political and economical status especially in Haryana and what it means to be true empowerment.

GEETA BHUKKAL

Former Haryana Education Minister Geeta Bhukkal said that women have to undergo struggle at various phases in their lives to achieve their goal and we should congratulate them on the occasion of International women’s day for achieving their goals despite hurdles.

Usually, on International Women’s Day it has become precedence that women achievers who work selflessly are identified and honoured at public function. In India, a ritual of performing Kanya (Kumari) puja is performed each year during Navaratra of Durga Puja. While in remaining days, they are forgotten, harassed mentally and physically or even tortured. We believe that not only a particular day or occasion, our society should honour and respect the women throughout the year. Women share 50 per cent of world’s total population and are playing a very vital role in human progress and prosperity. We should provide them equal social, political and economic opportunities, as well as equal rights and legal protections in the society.

In Haryana, after 70 years of independence, lot of work still need to be done for women’s upliftment. Anemia and malnutrition are common problem among teenage girls despite several measures have taken in this direction.

As per national crime records bureau’s report and state’s crime record, there has been increase in violence and crime against women in the State. We talk about empowerment of women but they are not safe in home and outside.

How women will be empowered if they are not safe and secure? The government of the day should lay emphasis on execution of the schemes which have been launched for their welfare and upliftment of rather than only raising slogans of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme among others.

When asked about additional steps to be taken to ensure women’s safety, the former education minister said, “We should go beyond law enforcement and find out the root cause of the issue. We must sensitize men and boys to respect women. Also, families must be counseled to treat girls on an equal footing with boys. Bhukkal further said that empowerment of women means empowering them socially, politically along with equipping them to be economically independent, self-reliant, in addition to providing positive self-esteem to face any difficult situation.

DR KUSUM LATA

Dr Kusum Lata, assistant professor (History) of Institute of Integrated and Honours Studies, Kurukshetra University said, “This day is very special for all women. Due to consistent struggle of many women’s organisations over a period of time, the condition of women has improved. During ancient and medieval era, condition of women in upper class society was good while in lower class society, they struggled.

During Freedom struggle, women participated actively along with men. On the appeal of father of nation Mahatma Gandhi, women had participated in his movement (satyagrah). Gandhi had advocated respecting, honouring and empowering women on many occasions. At one point of time, Gandhi ji had said giving women a status of mother.

Dr Kusum said that the efforts of women and their very significant contribution to the freedom struggle got them the right to vote and equality with men in the Constitution of India. This was followed by a series of Acts, promoting the cause of women in the 50s and early 60s which legalised inter-caste and interfaith marriages, made child marriage punishable and abortion illegal, outlawed polygamy, conferred the equal right of divorce on both men and women, gave inheritance rights to women in the patrilineal property and prohibited giving of dowry.

She further said that even though the women’s movement continues to face numerous hurdles and challenges, it has not deterred women’s confidence and enthusiasm in bringing about a powerful social change. They are forging a new path toward equality and achieving socio-political and economic empowerment.

Dr Kusum said that a gradual change is now visible in modern-day India, and this can be seen in large cities. Women have found employment in fields that have been traditionally considered male dominated. “So, what has the women’s movement achieved?

The major achievement is of having brought women’s issues centre-stage. Women’s issues are taken up not only by political parties but also various women’s organisations, NGOs, mahila mandals, self-help groups, village-based groups as also college cells and initiatives by individual women. The rising interest in women’s issues has got reflected in education as well. In Haryana, women and girls are coming forward and performing well in education, sports and entertainment among others,” she added.

MAMTA SODHA

Mamta Sodha, an Indian sportsperson, who was directly recruited as a DSP after her successful Everest campaign in 2010 said, “I congratulate all women on International Women’s day. The State government is promoting women and girls to achieve goal of their life. Special attention has been laid for their upliftment by facilitating them in many sectors including education, sports among others.” She said that girls need to prove themselves that they are the best. They should be empowered themselves enough to excel in their life. Girls need to give time for themselves and they need to be mentally and physically tough to solve their concerns. Sodha said, “No one will stop you if you are dedicated towards your goal.”

TANYA SINGH

Tanya Singh, a post graduation (psychology) student of Panjab University said, “We personally believe that it is more important to socialise the children in such a way that they are taught that all genders are equal. Our belief system needs to be made strong.”

Talking about women’s reservation, she said that a legal step towards providing females an equal platform should be taken. “If we all feel that everyone have equal rights then we wouldn't need any reservations,” she says.

Singh said, “At last we would like to say that every day should be celebrated and cherished for thanking all the super women in our lives.”

PREETI BHARDWAJ

Vice-chairperson of Haryana State Commission for Women Preeti Bhardwaj said that International Women’s day is dedicated to the women empowerment and their rights. It is necessary that women and girls should be made economically empowered through skill development. Economically empowered women are actually empowered as they can take any decision of their life. Gender equality and economic empowerment is necessary for the women empowerment. Women of the Haryana have remarkably contributed in the development of the state.

Bhardwaj said that so many women achieved many remarkable successes in every era but the real thing which matters is the actual change that took place in lives of common women. Mindset of the society needs to be changed in this context.

Haryana has number of unique schemes for women welfare that have been initiated during the last few years, but the implementation of schemes needs to be strengthen at, various level. There is a need to notice the bottlenecks and gaps in implementation in the previous years so that these can be removed and an alternative and improved scheme can be formulated. The programmes require expertise, and should be managed by technically qualified professionals. Besides, i feel that formalities for the schemes should be minimized so that rural, illiterate and unaware can also avail these benefits easily.

SUMITRA CHOWDHARY

Sumitra Chowdhary, resident of Hisar, pursuing post graduation (sociology) in Chandigarh said that women play an important role in society as they provide happiness, solution and peace to this world. Women are successful in all areas as men. While there is no denying that women have achieved so much but they still have a long way to go. A woman has to realize her own potential and strength as an equal member of society, and this can come only through empowerment. In cities, the scenario is favourable for women where women are men are equally moving forward. While in rural areas despite having potential, women have limited opportunities to become professionally self independent and self- reliant. On self-defence as a form of empowerment, she pointed out, “Women must learn self-defence techniques, which boosts their confidence levels.

ASHITA MANCHANDA

Ashita Manchanda, an academician from Karnal, said that said that it is clear that being equal to their male counterparts remains a far cry for the Indian women. Not only are they marginal as public figures, an average Indian woman can hardly call the shots at home or outside as our society talks about women empowerment it must begin from home.

Women must feel equally empowered at home as they are at work. She said that a most glaring inequality is in the political participation of women. Women's reservation bill or The Constitution (108th Amendment) Bill, 2008, is a pending bill in the Parliament of India which propose to amend the Constitution of India to reserve 33 per cent of all seats in the Lower house of Parliament of India, the Lok Sabha, and in all State Legislative Assemblies for women in accordance with the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments which reserved the same percentage of seats for women in rural and urban local bodies respectively. It is one of the longest pending Bills in the Indian Parliament.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/women-should-be-respected--honoured-throughout-year.html

80,09-3-20,"Beware of adulterated colours, food on Holi","Despite the precautions being observed by some in view of the coronavirus, the enthusiasm for celebrating the Holi festival is still there among many.

However, as in the past years, the level of adulteration in colours, sweets and other food items being sold in the market should make people think twice before buying such products.

The Society of Pollution and Environmental Conservation Scientists (SPECS) collected 100 samples of various Holi colors from Dhamawala, Paltan Bazaar, Hanuman Chowk, Moti Bazaar, Karnpur, Dakra, Kanwali Road, Patelnagar, Majra, Panditwadi, Premnagar, Sahastradhara Road, Raipur, Jakhan, Rajpur and Krishannagar areas of Dehradun.

Accordint to SPECS secretary Brij Mohan Sharma, laboratory tests show that there are a lot of harmful metals in these colours including mercury sulphite in Red colour, copper sulphate in green colour, chromium iodide in purple colour, aluminium bromide in silver colour and lead oxide in black colour.

These colours are toxic and can cause skin cancer, minamata, eye allergy, temporary blindness, bronchial asthma, allergies, renal failure and learning disability. Sharma said that most colours sold in the market are metal oxide or industrial dyes. When washed, these colours can pollute soil and water systems.

They enter the rivers and the soil and increase pollution. SPECS also checked the so called natural organic colours available in the market and ascertained that 52 per cent of these colours are adulterated. When it comes to sweets, the items available in the market are also marred by adulteration.

SPECS collected 240 samples of food stuff including milk, mava, paneer, milk cake, burfi, Gujia, Batasha, Gulab Jamun, mustard oil and refined oil. Out of 40 samples of Mava, 38 samples were found adulterated with harmful substances. Out of 38 adulterated samples 17 were totally synthetic which contained chemicals like urea, detergent, Arrarot powder and refined oil. Refined flour (Maida) which is used for making gujiyas was also found tobe adulterated.

Apart from the adulterated colours and food items, wastage will also be caused by Holika Dehen. Sharma said that in Dehradun about 500 Holikas are expected to be lit before Holi. It will entail burning of up to 1,250,000 kilogrammes of wood. An average village family uses around four kilogrammes of wood per day to cook food. It means that 3,12,500 families can cook for a day with the wood burnt in a few hours.

Sharma said that for an enjoyable experience on Holi, home cooked food items and actually organic colours made from easily available items used traditionally should be used instead of the products being sold in the market.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/beware-of-adulterated-colours--food-on-holi.html

82,09-3-20,Kumaonis retain traditional celebration of Holi in State,"In these times when the modern ways of celebrating Holi including chemical colours, water, balloons, water guns and loud pop music have gained popularity, traditional Kumaoni Holi is still being celebrated by the people of Kumaon region in various parts of the state.

The Kumaoni tradition of celebrating Holi is more than celebrating Holi just with colours. Unlike the usual celebration, Kumaoni Holi begins from the day of Vasant Panchmi.

The Kumaoni folk songs and dance together with Dhol and Huruk are indispensable part of the celebration.

According to Almora resident Dev Singh Bhandari, “For people in Kumaon region, Holi represents the beginning of the sowing season and the end of the winter season apart from the triumph of good over evil. Therefore, people celebrate it with songs and dance.” Elaborating about the songs, Bhandari said that the songs sung in Holi gatherings are normally spiritual that recount the tales of Lord Krishna and how he celebrated Holi at Mathura with Radha, his family and friends.

“There are few certain folk songs which are sung according to the time in a day due to the Ragas they are based on.

However, people these days do not strictly follow these guidelines though we still try to teach such things to our children so that they can maintain the sanctity of our culture and traditions after us,"" added Bhandari.

Broadly, Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are the two types of traditional Kumaoni Holi celebrations. When the group of women celebrates Holi separately, it is called Mahila Holi.

The local men generally wear white Kurta, Payjama, and Topi whereas the women wear sarees during the celebrations. Talking about the Kumaoni Holi celebrations, Dehradun resident KS Bisht said that Baithki Holi begins from Vasant Panchmi and ends on Dashmi of Phalguna month.

Subsequently, Khari Holi commences from Ekadashi of Phalguna month and ends on Poornima. The day after Poornima is celebrated as the last day of Holi.

In this celebration, traditionally jaggery and Sooji Halwa are offered as in the old times, sweets like Gujiya were not available in the mountainous regions, added Bisht.

On the importance of celebrating Holi in a traditional way, Nainital resident Tej Singh Joshi said,

“These days most of the people do not go out with their families to celebrate Holi outside their neighbourhood.

Therefore, such traditional celebration gives us opportunity to be appreciative to our families, neighbours and friends and share joyous moments with them.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kumaonis-retain-traditional-celebration-of-holi-in-state.html
83,09-3-20,"No relief from illegal stone quarrying, crushers in K’jhar","Even if there are dozens of complaints on illegal quarrying and crushers in Keonjhar district, no one bothers about serious pollution related diseases and the human tolls, collapse of houses, death of cattle in quarry gorges, disappearance of river streams and loss of soil fertility due to ash spread.

The locals have alleged a nexus between the revenue officials and crusher mafias. The affected villagers have drawn the attention of the Chief Minister and the petition committee of the Odisha Assembly to save them as their life is endangered.

The villagers of Khantaghara, Kasibeda, Khahurijuani, Mahulagadia, Tandibeda and Laxmanposi time and again have been complaining to police, revenue and forest officials but to no avail. As every one put a deaf ear to their complaints, at last they have knocked the doors of local political leaders and the CM.

The mafias and hooligans of Khantaghar village in Ghatagaon tehsil have set up crushers with a series of blasting over a vast stretch of land flouting all laws of the land with tacit support of the local Revenue department, said Ishwar Chandra Barik, Sarpanch of Khantaghar Gram Panchayat.

Illegal stone crushers and blasting is a thriving business worth Rs 100 crore in Khantaghara which is a tribal village located in Ghatgaon Block of Keonjhar district. The inhabitants of the nearby villages such as Kasibeda, Khahurijuani, Mahulagadia, Tandibeda and Laxmanposi alleged that their lives were endangered due to illegal granite quarrying, blasting and fast depletion of forest cover and greenery.

The illegal stone quarrying has a great bearing on river Sitanadi in the nearby forest areas which is now dry. Consequently, the villagers of Khahurijuani, Mahulagadia, Tandibeda, Laxmanposi and Khantaghar were facing water shortage, said Iswar Naik, Sarpanch of Khantaghara.

Dambarudhar Palei, a farmer of Khajurijuani village whose land has not yielded any crops for the third consecutive year due to thick layers of dusts of crushers over land, was dejected.

“We are facing a serious environmental crisis,” said Bidyadhar Naik of Tandibeda village with tears in eyes, whose son Akshyaya Naik ( 33) , died some months ago due to pollution related diseases.

Sasmita Naik, a +3 student, too died of similar ailments.

The Indira Awas houses given under Goverment scheme to Harihar Naik, a poor villager in Khantaghar village, Jashoda Naik of Khajurijuani village of Manoharpur gram panchayat and Anita Naik, Naib Sarpanch of Khantaghar gram panchayat, have developed cracks due to blasts in stone quarry.

The Khantaghara Gram Panchayat office is so damaged that it may cave in anytime, Naik told.

“We lost many of our cattle who fell into deep open ponds caused due to blasting and excavation of stones, which look like deep gorges or ponds.The stone blasting

site at Khantaghar is spread over two acres of land and it is only 300 metres away from the NH 20. The wildlife is also under threat,” said Sk Imran,

a villager.

When asked, Sub Collector Ramachandra Kisku assured to take action soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-relief-from-illegal-stone-quarrying--crushers-in-k---jhar.html

Informing this, the PSSSB chairman Raman Bahl said that the arrangements were made on the directions of the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh who has sought completely fair, transparent and merit-based selection of candidates to various government posts.

Bahl said: “Jammers have been installed in all examination centres and candidates have been informed that no electronic gadgets or devices are permitted in the examination hall. Not only cellular phones, electronic watches, and other e-equipment or devices have been prohibited but also analog wristwatches, rings, chains, pendants, bangles, earrings, cufflinks have also been banned in order to check the possibility of usage of unfair means,”.

Triple biometric identification of candidates will be done, said Bahl explaining that the first biometrics-based identification will be done at the examination venue, then at the time of counseling of shortlisted candidates and a final check will be made at the time of joining of the candidate.

“This will help to ensure that candidate, who took the exam and reported at counseling, is very much the same as the one joining the post. This triple biometric identification procedure has been put in place in wake of reports of incidents of fake or dummy candidates taking exam instead of the actual candidates,” he said. There will be thorough frisking of the candidates at the examination centres and police personnel will be deputed to maintain law and order at the examination venues, he said adding that PCS officers will be deployed as observers to oversee exams at each centre besides PSSSB members.

Each centre will have sufficient supervisory staff and the invigilators coupled with officers to watch over the entire exercise as the flying squads. The vigil is strict to the extent that even the supervisory staff of the board will not be permitted to carry cell phones at the examination centres, he said adding that video recording of the entire process will be done.

Giving a word of caution to the candidates, PSSSB chairman said that candidates should avoid any attempt of using unfair means as it will invite the strictest action as per law. He also advised candidates to avoid dressing up in clothes with big buttons and other accessories.

“They will not even be permitted to bring or use their own pens in the exam rather each candidate will be provided a pen by the Board,” he said adding that candidate need to carry just his admit card to the examination centre and an original ID-proof.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/psssb-puts-elaborate-vigilance-measures.html
90,09-3-20,"SAD: Stand vindicted, Govt report proves Sidhu kinpin of drug mafia","Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday said that its assertion that five crore missing buprenorphine tablets had increased drug addiction in Punjab has been substantiated by a government report which stated that 67,000 addicts were now seeking treatment for buprenorphine addiction under the State’s de-addiction programme.

“Now that a government report has proved that diversion of five crore buprenorphine tablets by the state Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu to the drug mafia has increased addiction in Punjab, he had no business to remain in the Cabinet and should be dismissed immediately,” said SAD legislative party leader and Sahnewal MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon.

He said that a Punjab Government’s report, which has surveyed de-addiction centres, found that as many as 17 percent of the total 3.94 lakh patients enrolled in government and private de-addiction centres were taking treatment for buprenorphine addiction. “There cannot be a bigger indication that this. Now addicts want treatment from buprenorphine,” he said.

Stating that all this proved that Balbir Sidhu was the kingpin of the drug mafia in Punjab and that thousands of youth had become addicts due to illegal diversion of buprenorphine tablets under his watch, Dhillon said that a case should be registered against the Health Minister.

He said that Sidhu was not only guilty of diverting tablets worth around Rs 300 crore in the open market but also sheltered private centres which distributed the tablets recklessly to addicts at a high cost.

Dhillon demanded that the State Government should also order an independent inquiry into the case to buttress the investigation being carried out by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad--stand-vindicted--govt-report-proves-sidhu-kinpin-of-drug-mafia.html

109,09-3-20,PWD blames rain for Pataudi flyover collapse,"A portion of a flyover at the Delhi-Jaipur rail line near Pataudi collapsed on Saturday. The flyover was inaugurated by the Haryana Public Wealth Department in September 2019 and collapsed just five months after its unveiling.

Officials of the PWD said that while the investigation will take 2-3 days to conclude, initial inspection suggests that the base structure was weakened due to heavy rainfall. The officials have also called the contractor to launch a thorough investigation.

""It is early to say anything about the issue but prima facie it appears that due to heavy rain over the past few days, rainwater might have seeped inside some pillars and weakened the structure. After an investigation, the actual reason behind the damage will be ascertained,"" said Pradeep Singh Sandhu, SDO of the department.

The locals, however, have blamed PWD for ignoring it. A few months ago, the flyover had developed gaps but the department ignored the alarms raised by the residents.

However, no casualty was reported, the estimated cost of the flyover was Rs 14 crore and was inaugurated by then PWD Minister Rao Narbir Singh in September, 2019.

Soon after the incident, the police sealed the flyover and stopped the traffic movement to facilitate the investigation by the Public Works Department (PWD). PWD officials suspect heavy rains might have caused the collapse.

The village head (sarpanch) reported the incident to the concerned police station and the district administration.

""Around 10 am, we received information that a large part of the flyover has fallen down. We immediately rushed to the spot to investigate. We have sealed both ends of the flyover and deployed four constables to ensure nobody accesses it"" said a police official.

Just a few minutes before the accident, two trucks and few small vehicles had crossed the damaged portion and had a narrow escape. ""Thankfully, it was morning and the traffic was lean because of the weekend,"" said Narender, who was present at the spot.

""The stretch served as a vital link between Gurugram and Rewari. Now that the flyover is sealed, the locals claim that reaching Rewari from Gurugram will require an extra trip of 5 km"", said a villager.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pwd-blames-rain-for-pataudi-flyover-collapse.html

The story revolves around a boy in a village who narrates the story of his father’s death by reconstructing the latter’s suffering during the journey to the city.

The play was directed by Om Trivedi and was performed by the artists of Rang Triveni, Indore.

The play begins with a narration by a young man, who dreams about the monster.

According to the tale, the narrator encounters the creature on his way back home. Scared for his life, he looks at the creature in the eye and puts up a fight. He eventually kills the beast.

While Prasad’s heroic act is appreciated by some, the villagers quickly point out to his son that the beast only dies if it is lit on fire which Prasad did not do. Besides, according to legend, Prasad, who is bitten by the creature, would die in the next 24 hours.

The next day, Prasad, who is on his way to the city for work, is asked by a wise man to eat a wildflower to protect himself from dying.

As the story continues, Prasad begins to feel uneasy, his face swells up and he can barely speak. People refuse to help him and consider him to be insane. Finally, he understands what Tiricch means.

Another play Orcchadheesh was also staged on the same day. It was directed by Anoop Sharma.

116,09-3-20,NIV scientists working hard to ensure smooth testing,"Armed with special protective gear — including safety gowns, spectacles, N-95 masks and gloves — scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) here are working “round-the-clock” to ensure smooth testing of samples for the deadly coronavirus, while hand-holding associate centres spread across the country.

The day at NIV— the country's premier virus testing centre —starts with the scientists going into a huddle to chalk out the strategy, which includes testing fresh cases for COVID-19, reconfirming ones that have already tested positive, and providing support and guidance to other labs, a senior scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.

“In the last one month, we have tested around 4,000 samples across the country. Every day, on an average, 25 samples are being tested at NIV,” Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I), Division of ICMR told PTI.

In the wake of 39 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India so far, the Union Health Ministry has made 52 laboratories functional for testing samples while 57 labs have been designated for helping in sample collection to enhance the capacity for diagnosis and detection of the virus.

As of March 6, a total of 4,058 samples from 3,404 individuals have been tested by the network, officials said.

Gangakhedkar explained that if 10 samples, for example, are received in a day at NIV, five of these come in the morning, three by evening and two around night.

He noted that the workload at NIV may not be very high, however, the researchers have to work round-the-clock to ensure the smooth operations for coronavirus testing.

Gangakhedkar said, so far, the samples are mostly brought to NIV for reconfirmation for the virus which has already killed nearly 3,500 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 countries and territories.

“There are special assignments also. Suppose a group of passengers or patients are brought from Wuhan or Japan, NIV plays a big role in their sample testing as their reports need to be sent back to their respective countries,” he said.

He noted that NIV, being a pivotal institute, is hand-holding associate labs in the country by providing all the support and guidance.

“Every day there is a video conferencing with the associate testing lab centres where the issues are discussed and solutions for the problems are found,” he said.

He added that all the positive samples tested at other centres need to be sent to NIV for reconfirmation.

“As part of the quality assurance and quality control, five per cent negative samples are being sent to NIV for retesting. The objective is to verify any difference in the results,” Gangakhedhar said.

“Suppose they have sent a test result which is negative (for the virus), and it tests positive here at NIV, then it is checked what went wrong in the other lab's procedure,” he added.

The scientist, however, said so far there was no such instance of a mismatch in the results. He also noted that the researchers entrusted to test the samples — which may potentially contain the virus — are equipped with special protective equipment to ensure personal safety while testing.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/niv-scientists-working-hard-to-ensure-smooth-testing.html

The Health department said failure to inform authorities about travel history and symptoms would be considered a crime, while the State police separately said it was “illegal and punishable” if anyone hid such information.

The warnings came on a day when Kerala reported five fresh cases of cornovirus, including three who had recent travel history to Italy but evaded health screening at the airport on their return about a week ago.

The Health department directed that those who come from coronavirus-affected nations should inform it at the earliest.

“Otherwise, it will be considered as a crime. Those who come from abroad should be in-house surveillance for 28 days,” a release from the health department said.

The police said the symptomatic persons should inform the authorities concerned.

129,09-3-20,‘Green’ sanitary napkins disposal bags a must soon,"In a move that will go a long way in better menstrual hygiene management in the country, the Centre has decided to make it mandatory upon the sanitary napkins manufacturing firms to provide bio-degradable disposal bags too from January next year.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday said at an event at Pune on the occasion of International Women's Day on Sunday, “I have observed that despite repeated appeal to sanitary pad manufacturers, they are still not providing bio-degradable disposal bags. From January, 2021, the Union government will make such bags mandatory.”

The move follows concerns that while manufacturers of sanitary napkins take no responsibility for their product or its appropriate disposal, sanitary waste is disposed with household waste, and pickers often handle it with bare hands, to the detriment of their health and well-being. Disposable bags will help better sorting out the soiled pads from the waste and their better disposal.

Thrown in open, landfill sites and drains, many times, animals like cows and dogs too eat them up, almost killing themselves as the plastic in the pads chokes their stomach while drainage system gets blocked. Welcoming the Government's move to ensure that sanitary pad makers provide disposable bags too, Jagdish Kaur, President of the not-for-profit NGO, WILGA (Women's Initiative for Liberation, Growth and Action ) asserted that “focus should be also on manufacture of the eco-friendly and reusable pads to save the environment.”

She felt that a plastic and industrially manufactured sanitary pad requires about 500 to 800 years to decompose, thus posing environment hazards. “These are usually dumped in landfills, thrown in open spaces and ponds or drains thus choking the drainage system. Instead, focus should be on manufacturing reusable pads whose total costs are quite low as compared to the cost of synthetic disposable pads used in a year,” she said.

Sanfe, IIT Delhi-incubated startup has already initiated in this direction. It has forayed into the sanitary napkins segment with the launch of reusable sanitary pads, made with composite banana fiber, which can last upto two years (around 120 washes). Sanfe Reusable Pad is developed by Archit Agarwaland Harry Sehrawat, based on inputs from several IIT Delhi professors.

“The reusable pads are ultra-thin and are highly absorbent with Quadrant True Lock Technology which makes the pad leakproof and avoids creating any rashes. A patent has also been filed for the design.

Under the deal signed with US, WestingHouse Co is to build six reactors of 1208 MW each. GE-Hitachi, another US company, is also to build six reactors at Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh.

France's EDF also has to build six reactors of 1650 MW each. The projects with WestingHouse Co and EDF are at the discussion stage.

“The committee is also aware of the fact that apart from helping India acquire badly needed natural uranium from other countries, the Indo-US nuclear agreement has not yet resulted in new commercial projects with foreign assistance,” the panel which submitted its report on Friday said.

The Committee headed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, also observed that negotiations with American and French companies have been going on for a decade.

“The committee feels that at this point of time it would be better for the DAE to adopt a standardised 700 MW heavy-water reactor and use that standardised design for its expansion programme in an aggressive manner,” the panel added. India has 22 power reactors. Of these two are Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) at Tarapur built with American help in the 1960s, the other two are Russian made Light Water Reactors at Kundakulam.

The rest are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) developed by the DAE at a time when India was under sanctions post the 1974 and 1998 Pokhran tests. The government in 2018 gave approval to build 10 new PHWRs.

The Committee expressed hope that the DAE would be in a position to commission the fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam by the end of 2021. Even though it would have taken almost two decades when commissioning takes place, this is a pioneering initiative of which India can be justifiably proud. It will transform our nuclear energy programme.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-new-power-projects-from-indo-us-nuclear-deal.html

132,09-3-20,TMC nominates 4 ex-MPs for RS polls,"The Trinamool Congress has nominated four former party MPs for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday announced on the Twitter that out of the four candidates two will be women.

She wrote “I am glad to announce that AITC will be nominating Arpita Ghosh, Mausam Noor, Dinesh Trivedi and Subrata Bakshi to the Rajya Sabha. As a part of my constant endeavour towards woman empowerment, I am proud that half of our nominations are women,” reminding that the party’s decision to nominate the women candidates came on International Women's Day.

The four candidates nominated for the March 26 elections are former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, former South Kolkata Lok Sabha Member and TMC Bengal president Subrato Bakshi, theatre personality Arpita Ghosh who was an MP between 2014 and 2019 before losing to the BJP from Balurghat seat and former North Malda MP Mausam Benazir Noor who had crossed over to the TMC before the last year’s Lok Sabha elections only to lose the seat to BJP’s Khagen Murmu.

Bengal will send five MPs to Rajya Sabha this time round out of which four of the TMC are almost certain to win the polls considering the party’s strength in the Bengal Assembly. However the fifth seat that is going to be vacated by expelled CPI(M) MP Ritabrata Banerjee is likely to get a joint Left-Congress candidate.

Though the Left has 28 seats and the Congress has 42 seats in the State Assembly the former is likely to stake its claim on the ground that it had earlier left another seat to the latter.

Whether TMC would field a candidate in the fifth seat will be decided later, party sources said.

The Rajya Sabha seats from Bengal are falling vacant on April 2 following the end of the tenures of Trinamool MPs KD Singh a businessman, former minister-turned-bureaucrat Manish Gupta, painter Jogen Chowdhury, and media personality Ahmed Hassan Imran.

Taking a dig at the Chief Minister for fielding four former MPs who had lost the Lok Sabha elections (save Bakshi) Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday said “it is a shame that the TMC is trying to project all the candidates who were rejected by the people in the general elections.”

The Chief Minister’s bid to “send the rejected leaders to Parliament through ‘back door’ will not be taken well by the people of Bengal who will give a befitting reply” to the ruling outfit in the next year’s Assembly elections, Ghosh said.

Meanwhile in an unrelated development the TMC renewed its campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register for Citizens taking out a huge women’s rally in central Kolkata on Sunday.

The rally was partaken by a number of senior TMC women leaders including ministers Chandrima Bhattacharya, Shahsi Panja who carried handis (metal pots) used for cooking rice even as they raised slogans saying the country did not want CAA but “we want bhaat (bread and butter).”

Bhattacharya said “this is a statement for the central Government which has failed to provide people with their basic needs and now is trying to divide them along religious lines to stick to power.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tmc-nominates-4-ex-mps-for-rs-polls.html
133,09-3-20,Former PDP leader Bukhari lauches Apni Party in J&K,"Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Syed Altaf Bukhari, supported by senior colleagues who too had deserted PDP on Sunday launched his own political outfit, Jammu & Kashmir Apni party (JKAP) in Srinagar.

Apparently propped up by the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) ruled Union Government, majority of founding members of the regional party with national outlook turned out to be members of the council of Ministers of former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti.

Over half a dozen Congress leaders from Jammu region and retired bureaucrats, who remained close aides of NC top brass also embarked on Bukhari's bandwagon.

Making a formal announcement in the company of founding members of his party, who had assembled at his Bukhari Shiekhbagh mansion, Syed Altaf Bukhari told reporters, ""this party will be a different party. A party not floated by a family"". “This party is by the commoners, for the commoners, of the commoners,” Bukhari said. He said they will be choosy in admitting people into the party and that a president once elected will never be permitted beyond two times.

After reading from a draft statement, Bukhari interacted briefly with media persons and soon winded up the session saying that there will be many occasions to interact in future. He along with senior party leaders also unveiled the party flag on the occasion.

Earlier, Bukhari told reporters that he had been waiting for the last seven months hoping that National Conference and the PDP would come out and raise the issues confronted by the people.

“Unfortunately, they have not come out. Political parties don’t cease to exist once their leaders are arrested. Now, most of their leaders have been released, if not the presidents of the parties. We believed they would talk about issues, but they chose silence. We thought it necessary to flag issues,” Bukhari said.

He explained, the present circumstances warranted formation of a new political party comprising of those who all along had identified and related themselves to the social needs of multiple strata and factions of our society. A party that can respond to rational aspirations of people without promising them moon or stars. We are not here to sell dreams or fantasy to our people and instead shall always be pragmatic, honest and fair in our approach"", he added.

Referring to the contentious issue of Abrogation of Article 370, Bukhari said, ""we have, but to wait for the verdict of Supreme Court in any case"".

However, restoration of statehood, domicile rights on land and jobs, beside a holistic and an equitable development of all the regions and sub regions of Jammu & Kashmir forms our core agenda.

In January, Bukhari-led delegation presented a memorandum to the Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu listing measures for the revival of political activities in Jammu and Kashmir.

The launch party was attended by a number of former lawmakers and leaders. These included former PDP lawmakers and politicians Ghulam Hasan Mir, Mohammad Ashraf Mir, Javed Ahmad Beg, Raja Manzoor, Zafar Iqbal Manhas, Abdul Majid Padder, Rafi Ahmad Mir, Choudhary Zulfiqar, Mohammad Dilawar Mir, Noor Mohammad Wani and Abdul Raheem Rather.

Former Congress leaders Usman Majid, Shoaib Lone, Aijaz Khan and his brother Mumtaz Khan, Farooq Andrabi, Irafn Naqeeb, Krishan Arora, Vikram Malhotra and Manjit Singh also attended the function.

Syed Asgar Ali who had recently migrated from PDP to NC was also present along with former Chief Secretary Vijay Bakaya who had resigned from NC.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/former-pdp-leader-bukhari-lauches-apni-party-in-j-k.html
134,09-3-20,Anti-CAA stir: HC objects to putting up of roadside banners,"The Allahabad High Court on Sunday termed as ""highly unjust"" the putting up of roadside banners with photographs and information of people asked to pay compensation for damage to property during anti-CAA protests, and hoped that they will be removed, but the Uttar Pradesh Government asserted that it was a ""deterrent"" action and the court should not interfere in such a matter.

The court, which had on March 7 taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and asked the district magistrate and divisional commissioner of Lucknow to inform it about the law under which such posters/hoardings were put on the streets of the state capital, on Sunday reserved its order till March 9.

Taking up the matter on Sunday, a bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha termed the action of Uttar Pradesh authorities as ""highly unjust"" and said it was an absolute encroachment on personal liberty of individuals.

It later adjourned the matter till 3 pm as Additional Advocate General Neeraj Tripathi informed the court that the Advocate General would represent the State Government.

As the bench rose, it expressed the hope that ""good sense would prevail"" on the State and it would remove the hoardings before 3 pm and apprise the court about this at that time.

When the hearing resumed, Advocate General Raghvendra Pratap Singh contended that the court should not interfere in such matter as a public interest litigation, as those involved have damaged public and private property.

The Advocate General termed the act of the state government in putting up the posters of alleged CAA protestors as a 'deterrent' so that such incidents of violence are not repeated in future.

The court then reserved its order till 2 pm on March 9, 2020.

The state police has put up several hoardings across Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in December last year.

The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused are listed in the hoardings and they have been asked to pay for the damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration.

Many of these people said they fear for their safety.

Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar had termed the move as unethical and vowed to take legal recourse.

""How can we be publicly humiliated for something that has not yet been proved in court,” she said.

“This is not Afghanistan. Legal issues cannot be brought into public like this. Our bail order says there is no adequate evidence against us,” Jafar told PTI.

She was arrested after the violence in Lucknow and later granted bail. ""We are not absconding,” she said, adding that they have appeared before the court and police whenever asked.

Former IPS officer, S R Darapuri claimed that the move is illegal.

""Our life, property and freedom have been put in jeopardy by putting up these posters and our reputation has been damaged,"" he had said.

Darapuri had said that he was writing to the state home secretary, director general of police and police commissioner, telling them that if they faced any trouble because of the posters, it would the administration's responsibility.

""We will challenge it in court collectively and demand the immediate withdrawal of the posters as well as action against the officials responsible for it,"" he had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/anti-caa-stir--hc-objects-to-putting-up-of-roadside-banners.html
135,09-3-20,Night curfew lifted from Shillong,"Night curfew which was in force in Meghalaya capital Shillong for more than a week has been withdrawn following improvement in the law and order situation, officials said on Sunday.

Night curfew was imposed in Shillong and nearby areas after violence erupted in East Khasi Hills district on February 28 following the death of a Khasi Students Union (KSU) member during an anti-CAA rally at Ichamati that also demanded the implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP).

""Night curfew has been totally lifted in the whole of Shillong and its adjoining areas with effect from Sunday,"" Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIGP) Gabriel Iangrai said in a statement here. Not a single incident of violence has been reported from anywhere in the state and the situation has become normal, the AIGP said.

However, night curfew imposed in Shella, Sohra and Ichamati under Sohra sub-division will remain in force, he said.

At least two persons have died in separate incidents at Iew Duh market in Shillong and Shella when unidentified miscreants attacked them following the death of a KSU member Lurshari Hynniewta on February 28 during an anti-CAA rally at Ichamati.

Eight persons were arrested in the case and mobile internet was shut for seven days in six Khasi and Jaintia Hills district since the night of February 28.

138,09-3-20,‘Good governance via institutional lift’,"A parliamentary panel has recommended several changes for ensuring good governance through improved quality of civil servants and filling up of vacancies in critical agencies like IAS, Courts at different levels, CBI, CVC, CIC, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal etc.

Voicing concern over shortage of 1,494 IAS officers, the Committee called for addressing the problem of deficit of bureaucrats afflicting the Indian administration quickly.

Noting that 'Lateral Entry' of civil servants brings in qualified human resources, domain expertise and new ideas, the Committee suggested promotion of such lateral entrants to the next higher level based on their performance.

Referring to 1281 vacancies in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) at various levels, the Committee noted that such a huge shortage of personnel may increase pendency, hamper the quality of investigation and ultimately reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the agency.

Referring to 397 vacancies of High Court Judges accounting for 37% of the sanctioned 1079 and 5146 vacant posts of judicial officers in the subordinate courts accounting for 21% of the total 24,018, the Committee called for avoiding delays in finalisation of names recommended by the collegium at all stages.

The Committee also expressed serious concern over the huge vacancies in the higher and lower Courts leading to delay in justice delivery. Referring to 'India Justice Report, 2019' the Committee noted that judicial delays cost 0.50 percent of the GDP of the country.

The Committee noted with concern the increase in

the pendency of cases by 8%, 29% and 21% in the Supreme Court, High Courts and subordinate Courts respectively since 2018.

Detailed recommendations in this regard were contained in the two Reports of the Department Related Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law & Justice on Demands for Grants for 2020-21 that were presented to Rajya Sabha on Friday. The Committee with 28 members from Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha is headed by Bhupender Yadav of Rajya Sabha.

The Committee has recommended grouping of ministries into clusters like Rural Cluster, Social Cluster, Financial Cluster etc. and assigning civil servants cluster-wise based on their knowledge, competence, interests and inclination to enable them acquire skills, expertise and professional excellence in a particular domain.

Referring to the advantage of 360 degree performance appraisal of civil servants based on the assessment by an expert committee and feedback from various stakeholders and juniors, the Committee, however, cautioned that such feedback should not harm the honest and deserving civil servants who enforce discipline and performance.

Noting that globalisation has brought about radical transformation in governance and public administration requiring the civil servants to deliver under trying circumstances and with inadequate resources, the Committee has called for reorienting the training curriculum to make civil servants 'Emotionally Intelligent'.

The Committee also noted that 48,000 cases are still pending disposal in Central Administrative Tribunal due to the twin problems of human resource and infrastructure deficit and recommended institutionalising a pre-litigation conciliation mechanism to resolve the grievances of Government servants.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---good-governance-via-institutional-lift---.html
139,09-3-20,Black carbon emission can trigger melting of Gangotri glaciers,"Black carbon emitted due to indiscriminate burning of paddy and sugarcane stubble has not only put the National Capital Region (NCR) under severe stress of pollution but because of its light-absorbing nature can also trigger melting of the Gangotri glaciers in the high altitude eco-sensitive Indian Himalayas in India.

Scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, (WIHG) an autonomous institution under Department of Science and Technology in their study conducted at Chirbasa station (3600 m) near Gangotri Glacier in 2016 found that black carbon concentration changed from 0.01?gm?3 in winter to 4.62?gm?3 during summer, ie spiked by 400 times during summer.

This is for the first time, measurements on ambient black carbon mass concentration were made at such a high altitude site in the Indian Himalayas.

The study suggests that seasonal cycle of black carbon was significantly influenced by the emissions resulting from agriculture burning (in western part of the country), forest fires (along the Himalayan slopes) in summer, and to some extent the contribution from long range transport of pollutants in winter, depending the prevailing meteorological condition as the reason behind this seasonal increase.

The research led by Dr PS Negi from WIHG was published in the scientific journal Atmospheric Environment.

It was revealed by investigating the occasional high values of black carbon extricated, that the seasonal cycle of increase was significantly influenced by the emissions resulting from agriculture burning (in western part of the country), forest fires (along the Himalayan slopes) in summer, and to some extent by the contribution from long-range transport of pollutants in winter, depending the prevailing meteorological condition.

This can trigger glacial melt because of the light-absorbing nature of black carbon, said the study, “Black carbon aerosols in the ambient air of Gangotri Glacier valley of north-western Himalaya in India.”

“The monthly mean concentration of black carbon was found to be minimum in August and maximum in May. The observed seasonal mean concentrations of black carbon indicated a pristine glacial source and absence of black carbon sources in the locality,” said the study.

The Equivalent Black Carbon (EBC) aerosols contribute significantly towards global warming due to its light-absorbing nature. Their presence in the eco-sensitive zone, such as the Himalayan glacier valleys, is a matter of serious concern and needs to be meticulously monitored. However, baseline data on BC is rarely available from most of the glaciated Himalayan region, said the 0study.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/black-carbon-emission-can-trigger-melting-of-gangotri-glaciers.html

The Upper House failed to transact any substantial business due to Opposition demands for a discussion on the communal violence in northeast Delhi last month.

Besides, almost 50 per cent Members of Parliament did not attend Parliamentary Standing Committee meetings on the Demands for Grants with over two dozen of them not attending a single meeting.

According to sources, 57 per cent of TMC MPs, 36 pc of BJP MPs, 15 pc from Congress and 50 pc from other parties did not attend any meeting of the eight committees of Rajya Sabha on Demands for Grants. These meetings were held between February 12 and March 1, the recess of the two-phase Budget Session of Parliament.

Sources said Rajya Sabha lost around 26 hours of the scheduled 28:30 hours due to disruptions, as it witnessed uproarious scenes by protesting Opposition members demanding a debate on the violence. The second part of the current budget session resumed last Monday after a three-week recess for consideration of demands for grants for 2020-21 of various Ministries by the department-related standing committees (DRSCs).

During the first week, the Rajya Sabha could sit only for 2 hours and 42 minutes as against the total scheduled time of 28 hours and 30 minutes.

The House lost 25 hours and 48 minutes due to disruptions and forced adjournments, leading to productivity of only 9.50 per cent, officials said.

141,09-3-20,Modi Government shedding crocodile tears: Congress,"Citing proposals to hike life and vehicular insurance premiums and the decision to cut EPF interest rate, the Congress on Sunday accused the Narendra Modi Government of shedding “crocodile tears” for the common people while pursuing policies which will “break” their back.

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi aid that productivity, employment and the rupee have fallen, while inflation, social division along with the government's arrogance have risen. “This government has failed on all fronts,” he said.

Regulators have proposed more than 20 per cent hike in third-party insurance premiums, Singhvi said, adding this will impact most two-wheelers and three-wheelers besides four- wheelers under 1500 cc category. A similar hike has also been proposed by regulators for life insurance premiums, he added.

The Government has enough powers to stop these decisions which, the Congress leader said, will adversely affect the middle and lower-class the worst.

“Decisions taken by this Government or rather allowed to be taken by this Government without interference, restraint and injunction despite having the power to control and stop is directly impacting three Ps of the common man: purchasing power, planning for future and preparation,” he said.

The Government has allowed regulators to take these decision while shedding crocodile tears, Singhvi said, adding this indicates a “sinister plan” to break the back of the common man. Food inflation has been steadily rising and the government recently hiked LPG cylinder price by Rs 144 that will help it pocket over Rs 44,000 crores, he claimed.

It may be noted that the increase in LPG price is not applicable to subsidised quota. A household is entitled to 12 subsidised gas cylinders.

The EPF interest rate was recently reduced to 8.5 per cent from 8.65 per cent.

Delivering his address at the inaugural of iWIN (International Women Network) on the occasion of Womens Day here, he said, ""It was the duty of each one of us to see that no girl was left out of school.""

An educated woman would possess skills, self- confidence and could become a better parent, an official press release quoted Naidu as saying.

She would also provide better nutrition and hence ensure that her children are healthy, he said.

In this aspect, the Vice-President expressed happiness over the tremendous impact of Beti Bachao, Beti Padao on increasing the gross enrolment ratio of girls across all levels.

Calling for a change in mindset, the Vice-President said there was an urgent need to make boys respect girls from a young age.

He said women were always given a respectable place in Indian culture and traditions and we need to go back to our roots.

Noting that life always needs women, Naidu, in his trademark style, said- First, it is Vidya (education), then Lakshmi (wealth) and finally it is Shakti and Shanti (peace) Describing spiritual symbols, the Vice-President said, ""Whether we chant the Gayatri (mantra) or read the Gita (epic), or we do Vandana, Puja or Aarti with Shraddha towards God to pray, we are still with women.

Maintaining that the greatest human values are feminine, Naidu said, When we grow older we want Karuna (compassion) or Mamta (love). From those who are angry with us we want Kshama (forgiveness). It is a womans world, he said.

Observing that even after seven decades of Independence, there were still reports of gender discrimination, atrocities and violence against women, the Vice-President stressed that there should be zero tolerance towards such social evils.

He called for meting out swift punishment to those who commit crimes against women and said that political will was required to curb crimes against women rather than merely bringing a new bill.

On the need for a special emphasis on education and empowerment of rural women, the Vice-President said promoting literacy among rural women and nurturing the spirit of entrepreneurship among them would pave the way for their economic empowerment.

He also called for giving equal rights to women in ancestral property, including that of the agriculture land and said that there was an urgent need to bring in uniformity in laws across the country in this regard.

Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was among the dignitaries who were present.

Earlier in the day, the Vice-President attended the Womens Day calebrations organised by Durgabai Deshmukh Mahila Sabha (Andhra Mahila Sabha) here.

Addressing the gathering at the event, he called upon the youth to draw inspiration from the life of visionary leaders such as Durgabai Deshmukh who dedicated her life in the service of nation at a tender age of 12.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/educational--economic-empowerment-is-vital-for-women--v-p.html

Speaking at the NITI Aayog-organised ‘Women Transforming India Awards"", he said it is the priority of the Modi government to further empower women in armed forces.

The increasing presence of women in workforce is contributing to the economic growth of the nation and the society develops with their upliftment, he was quoted as saying in a statement.

148,09-3-20,Gulf shares slump after OPEC fails to agree virus action plan,"Shares in the energy-dependent Gulf plunged to multi-year lows Sunday after OPEC’s failure to agree on a coronavirus action plan prompted fears of an all-out oil price war.

OPEC and its allies failed to clinch a deal on production cuts that would have offered support to energy markets, sending prices tumbling to four-year lows on Friday.

The OPEC+ meeting was expected to agree to deeper cuts of 1.5 million barrels per day to counter the effects of the novel coronavirus, but Moscow refused to tighten supply.

Fears of a price war were stoked as Saudi Arabia — the world’s top exporter — quickly responded by making significant cuts to its oil price.

All the seven bourses in the Gulf were in the red amid a panic sell-off over fears that energy prices, the mainstay of public revenues in the region, could collapse.

The Saudi stock market, the largest in the region, dived by 8.3 per cent at close on Sunday, the first day of the trading week. It was the lowest closing since November 2017.

Shares in oil giant Saudi Aramco dropped below their IPO price of 32 riyals ($8.5) for the first time, losing some 9.1 per cent to 30.00 riyals.

The world’s biggest company launched on the bourse to much fanfare in December in a record-breaking initial public offering, but since then its market value has slipped from the IPO value of $1.71 trillion to $1.6 trillion.

The slide on the Saudi market also came amid accounts of high level arrests among the ruling family that sent shockwaves around economic circles in the region.

Multiple sources told AFP that Saudi authorities have detained three princes, including King Salman’s brother and nephew, for allegedly plotting a coup, in a move that signals Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s tightening grip on power.

149,09-3-20,Default by some NBFCs on secured debentures pushes Sebi for reforms,"A spate of defaults by some NBFCs has forced capital markets regulator Sebi to come out with a new set of measures to secure the interest of debenture holders and shore up their confidence in the regulatory mechanism to check any wrongdoings.

In a new consultation paper, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed a detailed review of the regulatory framework for Corporate Bonds and Debenture Trustees (DTs).

As per the consultation paper, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will now be required to create an identified charge on the assets, as the pari-passu floating charge in case of recent defaults of NBFCs in secured loans has created confusion as to whether the debentures are really secured.

According to the regulator, creation of an identified charge by NBFCs will enable liquidation of asset and

150,09-3-20,"Exempt telcos with under 15% market share from floor price norms: BSNL, MTNL to Trai","State-owned BSNL and MTNL have told the sector regulator Trai that tariff fixation should be applicable only on telcos with more than 15 per cent subscriber base in a service area, while those with lower or negligible user base should be exempt from the purview of minimum floor price.

It is pertinent to mention here that Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) - which operates telecom services across India except Delhi and Mumbai circles - has about 10.3 per cent market share in all India mobile subscriber base. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), present in Delhi and Mumbai, has 0.29 per cent mobile market share, as per the latest Trai data.

Reliance Jio leads the India mobile subscriber market with a share of 32.1 per cent, while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have 28.43 per cent share and 28.89 per cent share on an all India basis, respectively.

In their suggestions to Trai, the two public sector operators have acknowledged that the telecom industry is facing heat due to sudden and unexpected entry of “capital rich telecom service providers” offering free and ultra low tariffs, leading to closure of many players and that the situation has got compounded by companies required to make huge Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) payouts after the Supreme Court order.

“...The telecom industry needs a helping hand - at least in the immediate short term - from the authority to survive ,” the two companies have told Trai in nearly identical submissions.

The two have batted for fixing of floor prices by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) but with a rider.

“...The fixing of floor price should be limited and applicable to Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) having a minimum subscriber base of 15 per cent in that LSA (Licensed Service Area) otherwise floor price may wipe out the prospective new TSP/TSP having small customer base from the telecom business altogether,” BSNL and MTNL have said.

They added that to mitigate the present stress and to ensure adoption of future technologies, BSNL and MTNL both support the regulatory intervention for tariff fixation of the Trai with condition that operator with 15 per cent or less market share in that LSA be exempt.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/exempt-telcos-with-under-15--market-share-from-floor-price-norms--bsnl--mtnl-to-trai.html
151,09-3-20,Leaders don't believe climate change is real: Manipur activist who turned down PM's honour,"Eight-year-old climate activist Licypriya Kangujam, who turned down Prime Minister Narendra Modi's honour of joining the #SheInspiresUs campaign, said that she rejected the offer because nobody paid heed to any of her demands over the years.

Speaking to PTI, Kangujam said that initially she was both happy and sad to learn about the honour, but eventually decided to turn it down since politicians never take the issue of climate change seriously.

""Over the years they haven't listened to any of my demands despite protesting continuously in front of the Parliament and many other places across the country with thousands of children and youths,"" she lamented.

She recalled, in June last year, seven MPs of the Rajya Sabha after her protest in front of the Parliament House, moved a Calling Attention Motion on the issue, but the minister of Environment and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar said that India would not bow down to international pressure on climate change.

The minister's response was not up to her expectations, she said. Kangujam is known as Indian 'Greta', after being compared to award-winning Swedish teenage environment activist Greta Thunberg, for her passion towards the fight against climate change.

Ever since her foray into climate activism, Kangujam, who was conferred the Rising Star by the Washington DC-based Earth Day Network last year, made her demands clear -- that the government should enact a climate law to regulate carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases.

Such a law will bring in transparency, she said. She also demanded that climate change should be made a compulsory subject in schools because she believes that it will help in the fight against climate change from the grassroots level.

""It will also help in educating our leaders as they would learn about the issue from their children and grandchildren,"" she said, adding that the leaders just cannot believe that science and climate change is real.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/leaders-don-t-believe-climate-change-is-real--manipur-activist-who-turned-down-pm-s-honour.html
152,09-3-20,‘Women workforce down to 18% from 37% in 13 years',"Women workforce in the country fell to 18 per cent in 2019 from 37 per cent in 2006, non— government organisation Azad Foundation said on the International Women's Day on Sunday.

The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report this year ranks India at 149th position out of 153 countries on economic participation and opportunity, the organisation said and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take create gender-sensitive infrastructure.

According to the Foundation, the Global Gender Gap Report estimates that raising women's participation in the labour force can increase India's GDP significantly.

""The declining women's labour force participation (from 37 per cent in 2006 to 18 per cent in 2019), gender pay gap (23 per cent), high rates of informal work (93 per cent) with lack of social security are seen as impediments to the goal of gender equality and empowerment of women in India,"" the Azad Foundation said in a statement here.

Azad Foundation believes that infrastructure and norms play a crucial role in impeding women's entry and sustenance in the workforce.

""We appeal to the Prime Minister and Minister of Women and Child Development for their attention and positive action towards creating gender sensitive infrastructure,"" Azad Foundation Founder and Executive Director Meenu Vadera said.

The gender-sensitive infrastructure included full-time creches for children, affordable and safe working women's hostels, and basic public provisions such as piped water, she said in the statement.

The organisation also suggested hygienic washrooms at public places and safe public transport for enabling women to access decent and dignified livelihood opportunities.

153,09-3-20,Alleviating hunger is earning good karma for Chennai’s Sneha,"Annad Bhavanti Bhutani, says Lord Krishna in Bhagawad Gita. This literally means that all creation is sustained due to food. Helping to assuage a person’s hunger will win you good karmas in this world and the in the next.

Hence there is nothing surprising in Sneha Mohandoss, a Chennai-based social worker, feeding the poor a mission in her life. She had heard the adage ‘Annadanam Mahadanam’ mentioned in Indian scriptures from her mother Amutha Mohandoss, who used to cook one or two extra meals daily to be given to the poor and needy.

“That’s all we could do with the limited resources available at our disposal. But over the years, I took it up as a challenge to alleviate poverty and hunger among the poor whom I come across in my daily life. I too started cooking extra meals and many friends and colleagues joined me in my endeavour . We opened Food Bank, a collective to offer free and nutritious food to the poor and needy,” Sneha told The Pioneer on Sunday.

What made her the cynosure on Sunday was that Sneha has been featured in the social media handle of India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had dedicated the same to women on International Womens Day. Sneha is one of the women who has inspired the country’s top political boss.

The Prime Minister’s Office had informed Sneha that she would be featured in the twitter handle of the Prime Minister. While her colleagues and associates are in cloud nine, Sneha remained unperturbed and went on with her daily routine of feeding the poor. “It is yet another Sunday for us. We are all busy visiting the hunger spots earmarked by us for feeding the poor,” said Vipin, an IT specialist and associate of Sneha. The old and infirm, physically handicapped persons, mentally challenged ones and those who could not move around due to ailments are all taken care of the Food Bank which has account holders ( donors as well as volunteers).

Hunger and poverty are universal problems. While international agencies break their head in conference rooms and seminar halls with five course lunch and cocktail dinners to find out an ever lasting solution to at least bring down the world hunger index, here is an ordinary woman going around Chennai feeding the needy. “Yes, together we can do it provided you think about the ones who go to bed without a nutritious meal. The look of satisfaction on the face of the person whom you have fed is the “punya” which we need,” said Sneha.

There are many Snehas in and around Chennai working to resolve the issue of hunger. Vijayashree Ramesh, a lawyer-cum-activist cooks Tamil Nadu’s staple food Curd Rice every Tuesday and goes in search of persons who could not get food for the day. Who said the world has become a bad place to live? Snehas and Vijayasrees are God’s blessing to this country.

‘They remain happy all the time because the Indian saying is Annadathaa Sukhee Bhava”, said Unnikrishna Panickar, Sanskrit scholar. (The one who donates food always remains happy).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/alleviating-hunger-is-earning-good-karma-for-chennai---s-sneha.html

155,09-3-20,Rahul most suitable to lead Cong: Partymen,"Amid uncertainties over the leadership issue, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Ajay Maken has said it is high time Rahul Gandhi comes back as party president as he is the most acceptable leader.

The former president of the Congress’ Delhi unit, Maken, in an interview to PTI, also batted for veterans to gradually make way for younger leaders, saying if parties do not change their leadership with time, then people change parties.

Vouching for Rahul Gandhi as Congress chief, he said there is no other face as acceptable as Rahul who also has good intent at heart, zero baggage and consistently takes an aggressive stand in fighting against the might of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Maken also argued for a long-term advisory role for interim president Sonia Gandhi saying her experience and expertise in handling Congress affairs would be much needed by the new president.

The party constitution can be amended to ensure that, he said.""I think it is high time Rahul Gandhi came back. I am saying this with very strong conviction and strong reasons behind this. Rahul Gandhi is universally acceptable in the Congress party. There is no other face who is as much acceptable as Rahul Gandhi is,” Maken said.

“So, a person who is universally acceptable, no baggage, good intent at heart and who has been consistent and most aggressive against the BJP and Modi, and has been the voice amplifier of farmers, Dalits and minorities. I think, he single-handedly deserves to be Congress president,” he said.

Asked about what would be the right time for Rahul Gandhi to return, Maken said, “the sooner, the better, because it will end uncertainty.”

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are deeply wary of the unwavering conviction and fearlessness with which Rahul Gandhi has taken on the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

""Rahul Gandhi has adequately proved his mettle. Time has come to rise above the parochial issues of regional leadership and work towards strengthening and rebuilding the Congress. Needless to add that Rahul Gandhi is the obvious and only choice to lead the Congress,"" he said.

Maken noted that the country needs a person with ""good intent at heart, not good content in speech"".

""We have seen the country is paying the price to just follow good content in speech and the present situation where our country is in, the economy is in doldrums, there is a social strife, the riots going on in the national capital and the government not doing anything, is just because the people voted for good content in speech of Narendra Modi. They never saw the intent at heart of the leader,"" the Congress leader said.

Commenting on the old versus young debate in the Congress, Maken strongly argued for gradual change of guard in the party and said parties must change their leadership in time.

“I am among the biggest supporters for change, but it has to be gradual. It can’t be in one big sudden change. But it has to be there. That change is required because if the parties don’t change their leadership in time, then the people change the parties,” he said, adding that the electorate wants change.

On whether Congress veterans will be given an advisory role, he said it should be voluntary and not be imposed on them, as has happened in the case of party veterans in the BJP.

On voices backing organisational elections in the Congress, Maken said elections to the post of party president and working committee members alone would not help, and an overall organisational poll from bottom to up is needed.

“Only elections for the president or the working committee will not empower the workers,” said Maken. He noted that Rahul Gandhi has championed holding elections not only for the working committee, and president, but a series of elections at all levels in a transparent manner.

“That is what Rahul Gandhi has always stood for. He has wanted transparent elections throughout and even ticket distribution should be held through primaries and elections, where workers should decide who should be given the ticket,” Maken said.

On the Congress suffering two general election setbacks under Rahul Gandhi, he said as far as winning and losing elections is concerned, this is part of the process.

“How many elections under Atal Bihari Vajpayee did the BJP had win. In the 1990s the Vajpayee-Advani duo always used to lose election. The BJP never threw their leaders out of the party, as it was, they who got the BJP into power,” the former Union minister said.

Maken also called for spelling out clearly the Congress’ ideology on issues of social, economic and nationalism, to avoid leaders speaking in different voices in public on key issues.

""We should have firmly laid down our ideological stand on key issues, as this would end any kind of confusion and it would also help Congress workers to have their loyalty and allegiance towards a particular philosophy or ideology,"" he said.

Maken also said the Congress lost ground in Delhi because it stopped attacking Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal starting January 2019.

“BJP’s polarisation agenda also helped the AAP,” he said, rejecting the widely held belief that the Congress, under a deliberate electoral strategy, vacated the Delhi turf for the AAP.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rahul-most-suitable-to-lead-cong--partymen.html

According to doctors, he was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough and cold.

Though test results of his blood and swab samples for novel coronavirus were awaited, it can be said that Janarul Haque died probably of diabetes, Director of Health Services Ajay Chakraborty told PTI.

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had appealed against an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

In its plea, the DoT raised the issue as whether licence/spectrum to run a telecom company could be subject to moratorium during the insolvency proceedings or not.

However, a three-member bench of the NCLAT held that the petition filed by the DoT was time barred under the provisions of Section 61 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

Under the IBC, any appeal against order passed by the NCLT could be filed before the appellate tribunal within 30 days and the delay which can be condoned for reasonable cause in the NCLAT is only 15 days.

“This appeal was presented on February 20, 2020. Even giving the longest rope, if we calculate the period from December 20, 2019, the appeal is presented consuming 61 days. This being so, the appeal is time barred and for want of jurisdiction, we cannot entertain the appeal,” said NCLAT.

“The appeal is dismissed as time barred,” it said.

The order was passed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on November 27, 2019.

The NCLT order had come over the plea filed by the resolution professional of the company over apprehension that its license and spectrum could be suspended after DoT issued demand notice

Though, the NCLT in its order accepted that licence and spectrum is an asset of DoT and Aircel has no right of ownership but said that clauses of moratorium are “squarely applicable on this Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process Proceedings, hence need not be interrupted or hampered by any authority.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nclat-dismisses-dot---s-plea-in-aircel-licence-moratorium-matter-citing-delay-in-appeal.html
159,09-3-20,"ArcelorMittal fears sales, profitability getting impacted in 2020 on coronavirus spread","Amid deepening coronavirus crisis across the world, global steel giant ArcelorMittal has expressed apprehensions of its sales and profitability getting impacted in 2020 in case the virus spreads widely through Europe, particularly in Italy.

The Luxembourg-headquartered company is the world’s largest steel producer with steel-making operations in 18 countries on four continents, including 46 integrated and mini-mill steel-making facilities. It recently completed acquisition of debt-ridden Essar Steel in India for about Rs 42,000 crore and has announced plans to ramp up its finished steel producing capacity in India to 8.5 million tonnes per annum by the end of 2024.

“The recent increase in cases outside China is worrying and increases the risk of a global pandemic and a much larger negative impact on global GDP. The Company is monitoring the situation closely and in particular in Italy, as should the virus spread more widely through Europe this will likely have a material impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in 2020,” the steel behemoth said in its latest annual report.

In Italy, the epicentre of Europe’s outbreak, death toll has climbed to more than 230, and its confirmed cases to 5,800, third behind South Korea and China, where the virus was first detected in December.

The company said the epidemic may affect ArcelorMittal’s operations in certain regions and cited examples of how its projects were impacted in Liberia in 2014 and 2015 during the Ebola virus disease epidemic.

“There can be no assurance that other epidemics, including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China, will not adversely affect ArcelorMittal’s ongoing operations, production targets and expansion plans, if any, in other markets in which it operates,” the company said.

The ADB has predicted global losses due to the deadly coronavirus outbreak at about $156 billion, of which China may account for $103 billion.

ArcelorMittal said it expected Chinese steel demand to grow in 2020 within a “range of +0.0% to +1.0% (versus estimated growth of +3.2% in 2019) driven by robust real estate activity and given the Company’s current view on the Coronavirus. This may be revised downward due to the impact of the Coronavirus on Chinese demand and the knock-on impact elsewhere.”

It said the precise impact of the coronavirus is unknown but it has had a negative impact on Chinese prices and spreads, and the situation could continue if inventories keep rising at mills in China, putting downward pressure on pricing.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/arcelormittal-fears-sales--profitability-getting-impacted-in-2020-on-coronavirus-spread.html

The only exception to not hearing the coronavirus message is when a user has subscribed to a particular tune, they said.

All telcos were asked to incorporate the coronavirus ringing tone but so far only state-owned BSNL and Reliance Jio are in full compliance. The other telcos have cited technical issues for part implementation, they said.

The DoT had on Friday sent email instructions to all telcos to make the coronavirus audio clip as the ‘ring back tone’ to help disseminate information to masses.

The order asked telcos to “incorporate audio clips in ring back tone of each subscribers on urgent basis from today till further orders”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-audio-message-as-mobile-caller-tune-on-dot-orders.html
161,09-3-20,"Markets to remain under pressure, say analysts","Markets are likely to remain under pressure in the holiday-shortened week ahead with investors tracking the Yes Bank crisis and the coronavirus outbreak which have cast a shadow over trading sentiment, analysts said.

Equity markets would remain closed on Tuesday for ‘Holi’.

Several key macroeconomic data announcements are also scheduled during the week. Industrial production and retail inflation rate will be released on Thursday and WPI inflation on Friday.

“Given the volatility and fearful psychology, market participants are likely to drift away and reduce their exposure to equities till clarity emerges on financial distress (Yes Bank and Covid-19),” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote said.

Markets are expected to remain low with subdued interest and little activity from active investors, he added.

“Indian equity market continued its sharp slide for the second consecutive week on fears of fast spreading coronavirus cases outside China and Yes Bank crisis and its repercussions on the financial system. Till we see a semblance of normalcy returning, markets are likely to remain under pressure and highly volatile. Fluctuations in FII equity flows can also add to volatility,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Religare Broking, VP - Research, Ajit Mishra said, “We continue to maintain our cautious view on Indian markets and expect volatility to remain high in the near term. The updates on spread of coronavirus cases would be the single biggest factor dictating global markets going forward. On the domestic front, updates on resolution plan for Yes Bank along with spread of coronavirus cases would be actively tracked by traders and investors.”

During the last week, Sensex plunged 720.67 points or 1.88 per cent.

The Sensex had plummeted 894 points on Friday as regulatory curbs on Yes Bank triggered broad-based selling.

Yes Bank tanked over 55 per cent on Friday after the RBI placed the lender under a moratorium, capping deposit withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month and superseding its board.

Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate on Sunday arrested Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor under money laundering charges.

“Another bank bites the dust. This time its Yes Bank - one of the large private sector banks. RBI has stepped in and leading state-owned institutions are patching up a bailout plan for the bank and more importantly, safeguard the interest of depositors. However, the already weak sentiments have been dented further.

“The series of accidents in the Indian financial sector sends out a very poor message to the foreign investors. The negative bias is expected would sustain in the near term,” said Gaurav Dua, Senior VP, Head — Capital Market Strategy & Investments, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

On the global front, equity markets have tumbled on fears that the coronavirus epidemic will tip the world economy into a recession.

“The market sentiments could revive only if global markets settle down and fears of global slowdown recede soon,” said Deepak Jasani, Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/markets-to-remain-under-pressure--say-analysts-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/markets-to-remain-under-pressure--say-analysts.html
162,09-3-20,Oil crashes after Saudi Arabia launches price war,"Oil plunged over 20 per cent Monday after top exporter Saudi Arabia launched a price war in response to a failure by leading producers to strike a deal to support energy markets.

The two main contracts both lost about a fifth of their value in morning Asian trade, with West Texas Intermediate sliding to about USD 32 a barrel and Brent crude to about USD 36 a barrel.

Saudi Arabia launched an all-out oil war Sunday with the biggest cut in its prices in the last 20 years, Bloomberg News reported, after a failure by cartel OPEC and its allies to clinch a deal to cut production.

A meeting of main producers was expected to agree to deeper cuts to counter the impact of the new coronavirus -- but Moscow refused to tighten supply.

In response, the Gulf powerhouse cut its price for April delivery by USD 4-6 a barrel to Asia and USD 7 to the United States, with Aramco selling its Arabian Light at an unprecedented USD 10.25 a barrel less than Brent to Europe, Bloomberg said.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said that ""Saudi Arabia seems intent on punishing Russia.

""Oil prices... Will likely be capped over the next few months as coronavirus stalls economic growth, and Saudi Arabia opens the pumps and offers huge discounts on its crude grades.""

Global markets had already fallen heavily in recent weeks due to fears about the coronavirus, which has killed thousands and has spread around the world since emerging in China late last year.

Tokyo stocks were hit heavily hit at the open Monday on fears over the virus and the plunge in oil prices, with the dollar down against the yen.

Just after markets opened, crude prices briefly dropped as much as 30 per cent before gaining back some ground -- the biggest fall since the Gulf War in 1991, Bloomberg said.

The new developments are reminiscent of the oil price war that erupted in 2014 and sent oil prices crashing to less than USD 30 a barrel.

The price fall then battered revenues in the Gulf countries, forcing them to resort to austerity measures and borrowing to plug budget deficits.

On Sunday, shares in the energy-dependent Gulf plunged to multi-year lows after the failure to clinch a deal on production cuts, with all seven bourses in the region in the red.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oil-crashes-after-saudi-arabia-launches-price-war-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-crashes-after-saudi-arabia-launches-price-war.html
163,09-3-20,"Working to restore all services, says Yes Bank administrator","RBI-appointed Yes Bank administrator Prashant Kumar on Monday said the lender is working to restore all banking services for its customers as as soon as possible.

""I think for us, the first priority is the customers and how to provide the seamless business to our customers and like you must have seen on the very first day, all our ATMs were up for the customers,"" Kumar said in an interview to a TV channel.

He said, since Saturday evening even the ATMs of other banks were available for customers for cash withdrawal.

""And in our branches, our staff is reaching out to customers. They are dealing with their issues. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our customers who have really cooperated with us, who have shown lot of patience. And I think this is the faith in the brand of Yes Bank,"" Kumar told CNBC TV 18.

Yes Bank customers have been restricted with a cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 till April 3 ever since the Reserve Bank superseded the board of the bank on March 5, 2020 and appointed Kumar - a former SBI executive - as its administrator.

Kumar also assured that for the remaining days of the moratorium on Yes Bank, the bank staff is working hard so that all banking services could be restored at the earliest.

The RBI restriction on Yes Bank has also severely impacted other financial market transactions such as forex, credit card, digital payment, among others.

""All of us are working so that the entire banking service is available to our customers as soon as possible,"" Kumar said.

Even before the RBI action, the Mumbai-headquartered lender had deferred announcement of its earnings for the third quarter of 2019-20 to March 14 or before.

""I think we are going to declare our results on March 14th,"" Kumar said.

In an exchange filing on Saturday, Yes Bank had said, ""the administrator will consider and take on record the unaudited financial results of the bank, for the quarter and nine months ended on December 31, 2019 along with limited review report thereon by the statutory auditors of the bank on Saturday, March 14, 2020.""

To a question that the bank's capital requirement is much higher than what SBI will bring up with its 49 per cent stake buy in the bank for Rs 2,450 crore, Kumar said the clarity would come with the board meeting when it announces the earnings for the third quarter.

""What SBI has shown interest is of 49 per cent..Definitely there would be more requirement. We are in talks with like minded investors. SBI is also doing that part.

""So we are quite hopeful that in a couple of days the issue about the capital requirement will be taken care of,"" Kumar said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/working-to-restore-all-services--says-yes-bank-administrator-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/working-to-restore-all-services--says-yes-bank-administrator.html

European benchmarks also plunged up to 6 per cent their morning sessions.

Volatility was also fuelled by the sharp plunge in crude oil prices after top exporter Saudi Arabia launched a price war in response to a failure by leading producers to strike a deal to support energy markets.

168,09-3-20,RBI reiterates depositors’ money safe in banks,"Allaying concerns raised by many after Yes Bank fiasco, the Reserve Bank on Sunday reiterated that depositors’ money is safe and it is closely monitoring all banks.

The RBI further said that concerns about the safety of deposits in banks are based on a flawed analysis.

“Concern has been raised in certain sections of media about safety of deposits of certain banks. This concern is based on analysis which is flawed. Solvency of banks is internationally based on Capital to Risk Weighted Assets (CRAR) and not on market cap,” the central bank said in a tweet.

“RBI closely monitors all the banks and hereby assures all depositors that there is no such concern of safety of their deposits in any bank,” its second tweet said.

Earlier, echoing similar sentiments, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said Indian banks are well capitalised and there is no reason to worry, adding that it is a wrong method to assess a lender’s health based on the ratio of deposit to m-cap (market capitalisation).

“What I want to emphatically state that the m-cap ratio is a totally incorrect metric for assessing the safety of the banks. No banking sector expert or banking regulator uses this measure,” Subramanian said.

A day after imposing a 30-day moratorium on Yes Bank and capping withdrawal limit at Rs 50,000, the RBI on Friday evening had issued a draft reconstruction scheme for the private sector lender.

As per the RBI’s draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India will pick up 49 per cent stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-reiterates-depositors----money-safe-in-banks.html
169,09-3-20,"Indian banks well capitalised, no reason to worry, says CEA","Allaying concerns over banking sector health in the wake of Yes Bank fiasco, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian on Sunday said Indian banks are well capitalised and there is no reason to worry.

He further said that it is a wrong method to assess a lender’s health based on the ratio of deposit to m-cap (market capitalisation).

“What I want to emphatically state that the m-cap ratio is a totally incorrect metric for assessing the safety of the banks. No banking sector expert or banking regulator uses this measure,” Subramanian said while addressing a select mediapersons at his office here.

After what all unfolded about the crisis-hit Yes Bank recently, top government functionaries including Finance Minister Sitharaman, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and the chief economic advisor have been trying to assuage panicked investors.

The CEA said that no banking sector experts or regulators use deposit/m-cap ratio as a measure to gauge resilience of banks rather it is the capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) and other such metrics that can rightly gauge the health of banks.

“What banking sector experts and regulators use is what is called the CRAR. It is important to keep this in mind that the international norms for CRAR is 8 per cent and Indian banks on an average have a CRAR of 14.3 per cent.

“So, 8 per cent is the mandated minimum norm and our banks on the average have 14.3 per cent (CRAR). Now 14.3 per cent versus 8 per cent almost translates into 80 per cent greater capital than the international norms,” he said.

He further said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates the Indian banks to keep CRAR at 9 per cent.

“Even compared to that our banks have 60 per cent more capital. So this is something that is very important.”

Giving reasons as to why the deposit/m-cap ratio is an incorrect measure to assess the health of the banks, he said the m-cap ratio is essentially the ratio of the deposits that a bank has to its market capitalisation.

“Now if you compare for instance any bank lets say a private sector bank with the State Bank of India, State Bank of India would have an order of magnitude of higher m-cap ratio.

“But the State Bank of India is as safe as the any other bank in the world. In fact it is the only Indian bank to be the part of the top 100 banks internationally.”

So this ratio does not really capture the safety of a bank because it is actually affected by the market capitalisation. “As you all know the stock price of a bank can change minute to minute, as a result the m-cap ratio will also change minute to minute but the solvency cannot change minute to minute,” Subramanian said.

He also emphasised that the Indian banks on an average have a CRAR of 14.3 per cent, which is way more higher -- about 80 per cent greater than the global measures.

“So our banks on an average are very-very well capitalised, so there is absolutely no reason to worry. Also, the Government has increased the limit for deposits that are insured to up to Rs 5 lakh, which covers a large majority of the deposits.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-banks-well-capitalised--no-reason-to-worry--says-cea.html

174,09-3-20,"Biden, Sanders enter key phase in Dems’ race","Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders on Saturday began what amounts to a fresh campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, as the septuagenarians prepare to go head-to-head at the polls for the first time since the field narrowed to two credible candidates.

Biden, the 77-year-old former vice president, spoke to a large crowd of supporters in Missouri, one of six states that will hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, one week after the “Super Tuesday” elections brought about a dramatic reversal of fortunes in his favor.

Standing on an outdoor stage on a sunny day in St Louis, at times wearing his signature aviator sunglasses, the politically moderate Biden savored his spectacular revival in the race for the White House.

“What a difference a day makes,” he exulted. “This time last week I was in South Carolina and the press and the pundits had declared Biden’s campaign dead.” “But South Carolina had something to say about that, and then came Super Tuesday.

And today there are 11 victories behind us and we’re leading both in delegates and national votes.” With the monumental Gateway Arch -- a symbolic entryway to the American West -- in the background, the former vice president mentioned Sanders only indirectly.

Biden, having gained key backing from erstwhile rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg, said he was best positioned to “unite this party,” promising not to turn “this primary into a campaign of negative attacks.” “That will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route,” he said. Sanders, speaking to an equally enthusiastic crowd in Chicago, underlined his differences with Biden, without directly attacking him.

“Joe Biden is a friend,” he said. “I have known him for many years. But we have records, we have a different vision. The American people will hear about it.” With the primary now “down to two people,” the progressive Vermont senator said, “it is important for the American people to understand the differences between us -- in terms of our record, in terms of our vision for the future.” Sanders is a democratic socialist who wears his uncompromising positions -- government-run health care for all, higher taxes on the wealthy and free university tuition -- proudly on his sleeve.

Biden is a centrist who prides himself on his ability to work with Republicans. He is more middle-of-the-road on key issues like health care, where he favors expanding existing insurance programs, and less punitive additional taxes on the wealthy.

In addition to Missouri, Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota and Washington will hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday.

The state of Illinois, where Sanders was speaking, does not hold its primary until March 17.

That falls two days after the next Democratic debate, to be held in Phoenix, Arizona.

Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still on Democratic ballots, but trails so badly that she has not qualified for the debate.

That would leave Sanders and Biden in their first head-to-head encounter of the long campaign season.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/biden--sanders-enter-key-phase-in-dems----race.html
175,09-3-20,Kamala Harris endorses Biden for US President,"Indian-origin California Senator Kamala Harris on Sunday endorsed Joe Biden for president, asserting that there is no one better prepared than him to steer America through “turbulent times” and she would do “everything” in her power to help elect the former US vice-president.

In less than a week, Harris on Sunday became the fourth Democratic presidential aspirant to support 77-year-old Biden in his third bid at the White House.

The three others being Senator Amy Klobucher, former Mayor from Indiana Pete Buttigieg, and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

“There is no one better prepared than Joe to steer our nation through these turbulent times, and restore truth, honour, and decency to the Oval Office,” Harris said in a statement.

“I believe in Joe Biden and will do everything in my power to help elect him the next president of the United States,” she said. The California Senator had dropped out of the Democratic presidential race even before the start of the primaries.

She had made an impressive performance against Biden during the first Democratic party presidential debate last summer. However, she could not keep up the momentum and her poll numbers started dropping.

Biden is kind and endlessly caring, and truly listens to the American people, Harris said.

“You can see in his eyes how he takes to heart the experiences of mothers and fathers working to make ends meet and worrying about whether their children can be safe in their classroom, or young people who fight tirelessly to tackle climate change as they ask for a fair shot at the future in front of them. And with a lifetime in public service, Joe has a proven track record of getting things done,” she said.

Widely being speculated as a potential vice presidential candidate, Harris said that the US was at an inflection point and the decision voters make this November will shape the country and the world “our children and grandchildren will grow up in”.

176,09-3-20,Saudis’ arrest of 2 princes called a warning to royal family,"Saudi Arabia’s King Salman was shown in state media on Sunday in apparent good health and working, just days after the arrest of two senior princes triggered speculation about a possible coup attempt or a sudden deterioration in the king’s health.

Two people close to the royal family said Saturday that the two princes were under arrest for not supporting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated control of all major levers of power inside the kingdom with the support of his father, King Salman.

The arrests of the king’s younger and beloved brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdelaziz, and the king’s nephew and former counterterrorism czar, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, came after what one person in Saudi Arabia with knowledge of the arrests described as an accumulation of behaviour that was provocative to leadership.

The source added that the arrests sent a message to anyone in the royal family feeling disenfranchised: Stop grumbling and toe the line, because if Prince Ahmed can be arrested, any prince can and will be. Prince Ahmed was seen as a person who royals could look to when feeling vexed with the crown prince’s grip on power, the person said.

The reports of a crackdown emerged early Friday. In the king’s first appearance since then, state media showed the 84-year-old king on Sunday standing and greeting two Saudi diplomats being sworn in as ambassadors. He was previously seen Thursday meeting with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in Riyadh.

The arrests came as a surprise, given that Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 60, was widely known to be under close surveillance since he was shunted out of the line of succession by the king’s son in mid-2017, a person close to the royal court said. The arrest of Prince Ahmed, 78, was also unexpected since he is the king’s full younger brother and also a senior member of the ruling Al Saud family.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/saudis----arrest-of-2-princes-called-a-warning-to-royal-family.html
177,09-3-20,Senior Al-Shabaab commander dies in US strike: Africom,"A senior Al-Shabaab commander was killed in a recent US air strike in Somalia, the director of US African Command (Africom) said Sunday.

“Bashir Mohamed Mahamoud was a senior operational leader responsible for exporting terror in Somalia as well as attacks into Kenya,” said Africom director Colonel Christopher Karns.

“He has been a senior al-Shabaab member for more than a decade.”

Bashir was killed in a February 22 airstrike, said Karns, describing him as an “individual (who) had a role in planning and directing terrorist operations in Somalia and on the Kenya border region”.

Bashir also was suspected of having had a role in a January attack on a US-Kenyan military base in southeastern Kenya in which three Americans were killed, he added.

General Roger Cloutier, commander of US land forces in Africa, recently declared al-Shabaab to be “one of the biggest threats on the continent”.

Some analysts have questioned the effectiveness of the US campaign in Africa.

Amnesty International said in a 2019 report that US air strikes sometimes hit civilians as well as Shebab fighters, killing farmers, workers and children.

The US military has generally denied the charge, though it did admit responsibility for civilian casualties in one attack that killed a woman and a child near the central town of El Buur in April 2018.

Colonel Karns described al-Shabaab as “the largest and most kinetically active al-Qaeda network in the world”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/senior-al-shabaab-commander-dies-in-us-strike--africom.html

“I will have a meeting with European Union officials tomorrow (Monday) in Belgium,” Erdogan said during a speech in Istanbul on Sunday.

He added he would discuss the migration issue after Turkey opened its borders.

“I hope I will return from Belgium with different outcomes.” Turkey repeatedly rails against what it describes as unfair burden-sharing, since around four million mostly Syrian refugees live in Turkey.

In 2016, Turkey and the EU agreed a deal in which Brussels would provide billions of euros in aid in exchange for Turkish authorities preventing the flow of migrants.

But Ankara has repeatedly accused the bloc of not fulfilling promises made as Europe suffered the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.

Over a million people fled to the continent in 2015.

Erdogan’s top press aide Fahrettin Altun has said one of the unmet conditions was that the EU would take in refugees from Turkey.

Shortly after midnight, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree affecting 16 million people in the country’s prosperous north, including the Lombardy region and at least 14 provinces in neighbouring regions. The extraordinary measures will be in place until April 3.

“For Lombardy and for the other northern provinces that I have listed, there will be a ban for everybody to move in and out of these territories and also within the same territory,” Conte said.

“Exceptions will be allowed only for proven professional needs, exceptional cases and health issues.”

188,09-3-20,Kyrgyz police arrest dozens at Women’s Day march,"Police in Kyrgyzstan on Sunday arrested dozens of protesters — most of them women — at a rally to mark International Women’s Day after masked men attacked them and tore up their placards.

An AFP correspondent saw dozens of women detained and placed in police vehicles in the centre of the capital Bishkek where women’s groups had begun to rally against gender-based violence.

The detentions came after the men wearing face masks and pointed national hats attacked the crowd, tearing up their posters, popping balloons with toy pistols and throwing eggs at the women before fleeing the scene.

Erlan Atantayev, deputy head of the Sverdlovsky police department where the women were taken, told AFP that the protesters had been detained for their own safety and because police had not been warned about the rally.

“Clashes began between the demonstrators and men wearing the face masks,” said Atantayev.

“We detained (the women) for violation of public order.” Atantayev said that some of the demonstrators could face fines for resisting police.

Police also detained three male assailants but did not chase after those who ran away.

Journalist Nurjamal Djanibekova said that one of the attackers broke her telephone to prevent her filming the attack.

190,09-3-20,"Hardik, Bhuvi return to face SA","Bruised and battered in New Zealand, India’s ODI squad on Sunday got a major boost as a fit-again Hardik Pandya returned for the three-match series against South Africa, having successfully recuperated from a back surgery.

Along with Pandya, opener Shikhar Dhawan and seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar will also add depth to the 15-member squad, selected under the chairmanship of Sunil Joshi.

However, it could be curtains for veteran Kedar Jadhav as Shubman Gill’s return in the white-ball fold is a good enough indictor.

Vice-captain Rohit Sharma is yet to fully recuperate from his calf muscle injury and is expected to return to action during the Indian Premier League later this month. Thus, Prithvi Shaw retained his place in the ODI squad, while Mayank Agarwal, after a dismal New Zealand tour, had to make way for Dhawan.

The Mumbai duo of Shardul Thakur and Shivam Dube paid for their shoddy showing in New Zealand as Pandya and Bhuvneshwar rightfully got their places back.

Bhuvneshwar, on the other hand, had a sports hernia surgery but has successfully completed his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy.

But the biggest news was Hardik’s comeback, which, though, was on predictable lines.

Pandya’s performances at the DY Patil Corporate Cup was not about the 150 odd he scored or the wickets he took but was about how fit he looked out there in the middle.

At the same time, the soon-to-be-35 Jadhav, who has literally stopped bowling in ODIs and is also not doing well batting at the No 6 slot, has been finally dropped from the side.

With the next 50-over World Cup in 2023 when Jadhav will be 38, it is highly unlikely that he will add to his 73 ODIs.

Shardul, who did improve as a batsman, leaked runs during the T20s as well as ODIs. Bhuvneshwar’s experience as a swing and seam bowler was sorely missed in New Zealand conditions. With Mohammed Shami rested for this series, Bhuvneshwar’s presence will also be a bit of respite for Jasprit Bumrah, who himself is going through a rough patch.

191,09-3-20,Afghans take T20 series,"Teenage spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman took three wickets to help Afghanistan beat Ireland by 21 runs and claim an unassailable 2-0 series lead in the second Twenty20 international in India on Sunday.

Afghanistan won the toss and elected to bat, but started sluggishly before skipper Asghar Afghan's 49 off 28 balls lifted the team to 184 for 4 from 20 overs.

Mujeeb struck early in Ireland’s innings to claim the wickets of openers Paul Stirling and Kevin O'Brien, and finished with 3-38 to earn the man of the match.

Captain Andrew Balbirnie (46) and Harry Tector (37) mounted a recovery but it was not enough, with Ireland finishing on 163-6.

“Happy to win the series. We focused on some strike rotation before going for quick runs,” Afghan told Cricinfo after the match.

Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie said his team needed to build on its strong starts.

“We started pretty well but you have to be good for the whole 20 overs... The series is now gone but it’s a big year and we need to focus on the third game,” Balbirnie added.

192,09-3-20,Our guys know how to get Pujara out: Wriddhiman,"Wriddhiman Saha is confident that Bengal’s unheralded bunch of bowlers have seen enough of Cheteshwar Pujara on television to plot his dismissal when they take on Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy final.

This is the first time in his 13-year-old first-class career that Saha will be playing a national final and Akash Deep, Mukesh Kumar and Ishan Porel will only benefit from his advice on how dismiss Pujara on a track wher he has played some of his marathon innings.

“Whoever fights till the end will win. They (Bengal teammates) all watch international matches. They know how to get Pujara out,” Saha was reticent as usual bit surely put across a point.

“Earlier, the past teams reached the knock-outs on the basis of performance of a few players. For example, Ashok Dinda used to take (bulk of) wickets without much support from the other end, the team was stuck in a way. Now everyone is contributing,” Saha said.

“The bowlers are also contributing with the bat. Match-wining performances have come in the batting department. There is good camaraderie too which helps,” the veteran of 102 first-class games said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/our-guys-know-how-to-get-pujara-out--wriddhiman.html
193,09-3-20,Saurashtra poised for Ranji glory,"Saurashtra, led by the inspirational Jaydev Unadkat, will back themselves to win an elusive Ranji Trophy title at home but a buoyant Bengal will be no pushovers in what promises to be an absorbing final beginning here on Monday.

Both the teams are desperate to go all the way with Saurashtra reaching their fourth final in eight seasons while Bengal has not tasted success in the premier domestic event since the 1989-90 triumph.

While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest at the SCA Stadium, which is also the venue for the final.

There will also be star power on display with Test regulars Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha joining the Saurashtra and Bengal squads respectively, having returned from New Zealand.

In fact, Pujara was very much Saurasthra’s 12th man with Unadkat being in constant touch with his senior teammate during the hard-fought semifinal. Now his physical presence in the all-important game will be a big boost to the side.

Saurashtra would not have ended up on the right side of the result against Gujarat if it wasn’t for Unadkat, who has had a sensational run this season with 65 wickets at an average of 12.17 and is three shy of the all-time record of 68 scalps, set by Bihar spinner Ashutosh Aman last season.

The left-arm pacer single-handedly led his team to victory on day five earlier this week with a seven-wicket haul on a flat surface, including the scalps of a set Parthiv Patel and Chiragh Gandhi, who had brought Gujarat back in the game from a hopeless 63 for five while chasing 327.

Unadkat’s stellar performances over the course of the season has put him back in national reckoning but in his own words, they would count for little if the team doesn’t go all the way.

Not just with the ball, he also inspired with his captaincy and one example of that was when he promoted number 11 Chetan Sakariya, who shared a crucial 90-run stand with Arpit Vasavada (139) after the hosts collapsed to 15 for five.

The skipper is leading from the front but will expect more from his fellow pacers who have not done much to write home about this season.

Besides Pujara, the team’s leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson will be expected to shoulder the batting responsibilities.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saurashtra-poised-for-ranji-glory.html
194,09-3-20,Everyone was little on edge: Lanning,"Meg Lanning on Sunday hailed her team after captaining Australia to their fifth ICC Women's T20 World Cup title here.

The skipper has been at the helm for many an Australian success but took that to a new level at the MCG with an 85-run victory over India for their first crown on home soil.

But it was far from an easy journey to the top for Lanning, with a group-stage victory over New Zealand and the semi-final success against South Africa among her most stressful cricket moments.

“This tournament was always going to be massive, we had our ups and downs throughout and everything was thrown at us. To be able to come through and have the complete performance on the biggest stage, it’s something that’s pretty amazing,” she was quoted as saying by the ICC.

“The New Zealand game and the semi-final, that's the most nervous and sick I've felt playing cricket. To get through that, coming in to the final, everyone was a little on edge but it just happened.”

Such was the magnitude of the Melbourne final, Lanning struggled to settle at all prior to the match.

Never before has the women's game seen a crowd comparable to the 86,174 that packed into the MCG on the International Women’s Day.

But the 27-year-old was calm when it mattered the most — largely thanks to her Australia teammates holding back their own nerves on the big day.

“This day is incredible, we couldn't have dreamed of this. When the organisers said they wanted to get that many people for the Final, I must admit I was a bit sceptical.

“But you wanted to be there and be involved. There was such a big build-up, all the outside pressure and expectation -- we wanted to come and win this tournament but it was something else.

“The way we were able to react and deal with that was testament to the group — this day is certainly the best of my career so far.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/everyone-was-little-on-edge--lanning.html

Mandhana believed India are a transformed team in the shortest format, and she attributed it to head coach WV Raman.

“T20 was never our best format, one-day was definitely the preferred format. Now we’re playing each format equally well. That is one thing the coach has helped us with and we’ve developed massively,” she said.

“The youngsters coming in have totally changed the set-up and the best part of the tournament was it was a complete team performance. That’s one thing Raman has done — developing us as a team not just one or two players. Today, it didn't work out but we've grown as a team, not just as one or two players.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/team-needs-to-be-left-alone--time-to-introspect--mandhana.html
196,09-3-20,You too?,"Director Priyanka Banerjee tells Chahak Mittal how she was inspired by Jean Paul Sartre’s classics while writing her latest short film, Devi, where she unites diverse women with a commonality of abuse

A 17-year-old school girl struggles with the TV remote and flips through channels in the corner of a hall, which is shared by a few other women — each one distinct from the other. Three old Maharashtrian women peel vegetables while a woman in a burqa waxes her legs quietly on the floor. Another woman in her mid 20s, wearing a shiny jacket apt for a party, pours herself another glass of vodka and gulps it down in one swig. Next to her is her friend who seems to have just returned from a high-profile corporate meeting in her office. At the other end of the hall, a young student, engrossed in her studies, sits at the dining table wearing her white lab coat, certainly prepping for a medical exam. A woman in sari emerges with a pooja ki thaal and serves prasad to everyone in the room. While each personality looks different from one another, they all have one thing in common — they have been assaulted. And they are dead within.

This is what director Priyanka Banerjee’s 13-minute short film Devi brings to the fore. It brilliantly brings women from different walks of life, age, community and class together and points out that when it comes to crimes against women, no one is spared. The director, by placing them under one roof and making these women confront the differences, points out yet again that none of these matter. The film finally conveys to the audience a simple message — what it is like to be a woman?

How did you conceptualise the film?

I’ve been a student of theatre since I was 17. Hence, I’ve always been involved in playwriting. I am drawn to some kind of surrealism or the absurd mixed into a realistic situation. Jean Paul Sartre’s play, No Exit, is one of those classics that every theatre kid knows and I think the idea of deceased people discussing their lives in a purgatory state was inspired from that. I also remember an illustration showing two rape victims chatting in heaven. I remember thinking then that it might be an interesting idea to see what a group of women, who have shared a similar fate, would say to each other if we kept them incredibly human and realistic. The idea emerged from this line of thinking.

How did you conceptualise such an idea of putting women from different social strata in the same room? The film showcases how women need to live in communal harmony and have each other’s back at all costs...

I tried penning the characters I had seen around me. I’ve been around working women my entire life. My mother has always worked. I’ve seen my house-helps and the backgrounds they come from too. When you go to a salon, the fish market or a hospital, these women are all around us. The diversity wasn’t as intentional as it was natural. It just happened while I was writing. I’ll credit my theatre background once again here because you tend to act out parts as you’re writing and that helps give a real voice to each character. The bickering, debates and more come from that.

What is your take on how such films are able to bring about a change in society?

Especially in India, where filmstars are seen as close to deities, films have a great social impact, too. I would still use the word impact because it is unfair to expect art or films to change society or the way people think. We can offer food for thought but the real change is a long drawn out process involving many other ground realities.

Also, how do you think society is reacting to content-driven and realistic films, which are now the trend?

I think it’s incredible that now content is the true king. It’s not just a phrase thrown around for effect. Given the recent success of so many content-driven, realistic films, where the power lies in the script, it’s evident that the audience is reacting very well to honest storytelling.

There have been many films that talk about sexual assault on women at length. How do you think Devi is different?

I hope that the film is seen as different because it doesn’t preach a message forcefully. We have tried our best to just present reality as it is and these women, as flesh-and-blood characters, have quirks and flaws just like the rest of us. I think this film may be perceived differently because we have tried to make the characters familiar. We wanted to make the pain of what happened to them felt more deeply by the audience.

Why did you name it Devi?

I would credit our producer Niranjan Iyengar for this. We wanted a single word title that would capture the essence of the film. This immediately clicked with everyone when he titled it. It’s because I guess this word has such a subconscious significance for us and to think of it in this context is very moving.

Do you think a short film limits the creativity of a director? Had it been a big screen film, how would you have played it out?

Not at all! Short films do not limit you in the least. It is a different genre altogether. It allows you to tell a story or say something complete in itself in a short period of time (usually less than 45 minutes). It’s a unique challenge and I don’t think it should be confused with a mini feature film. Features have their own beauty because they allow for a long drawn out explorations of the plot and the characters. An audience can feel like they have lived a lifetime watching a feature. Shorts, to me, are just about leaving someone with a feeling. I don’t think Devi could have been a feature, at least not if I’m writing it because I wouldn’t know how to make it like that. I feel the thought lends itself to this short format and this makes the most impact on maximum people.

197,09-3-20,Trend Blazer,"Randeep injured on sets of Radhe

Actor Randeep Hooda has dislocated his knee on the sets of the forthcoming Salman Khan-starrer Radhe. The actor is currently recuperating.

Randeep took to Instagram to inform his fans about his condition. Posting a selfie, he wrote, “A selfie after a good run... trying to rehabilitate my dislocated knee that got busted on the sets of #radhe #saturdayselfie #action #movie #fitnessmotivation #fitness #health #healthylifestyle.”

Fans responded to his post wishing him a speedy recovery.

Directed by Prabhu Deva, Radhe stars Salman Khan and Disha Patani. The film is Salman's Eid release this year, and is scheduled to hit theatres on May 22.

‘Crimes against women have been happening since a very long time but we never gave the issue enough attention. Now there is much more awareness among people. The law is stricter. Social media has helped in creating movements out of incidents that have happened. Everyone is answerable.’

—Kirti Kulhari

It is a good idea to celebrate a day honouring women but what about the other 364 days in a year, wonders actor Kiara Advani.

“Everyday should be Women's Day. Why just one day? I feel every single day belongs to us!” Kiara said.

Celebrating just one day for women hardly makes sense unless discrimination and crimes against women are curbed and we learn to respect the female gender, but Kiara is happy that at least a conversation has started.

‘Being in love is exhausting’

Singer Camila Cabello finds being in love with beau Shawn Mendes is ‘exhausting’.

Cabello got into a relationship with Mendes last year, and this has inspired her latest album, Romance.

She said that being in a relationship takes it out of you. Asked if she was planning more musical collaborations with her beau, she said, “I want more, we want more but honestly we're being in our twenties,” hinting speculation that their schedules were too busy to book studio time.

She added, “No, not even like that. Just like being in love is exhausting. We can't even go to the studio. We're trying to calm down.”

The couple's last collaboration was the hit Senorita.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-03-09.html
198,09-3-20,Closing in on the mirage,"Director Nandan Saxena’s film Mrigtrishna will look at a widow who goes to Vrindavan, a place which she later finds claustrophic

He insists that both narrative and documentary filmmaking have the same components and its just the retake that separates them. ""Well, they have actors while we shoot real people. What is paramount is the skill to tell a story. Moreover, I’ve never believed in this false divide, as the documentaries we make tend to cross it frequently. However, at this point of time, I feel its time for us to work on a narrative,"" says three-time National Award filmmaker Nandan Saxena (along with his filmmaker wife Kavita Bahl), who is now all set to make a feature film titled Mrigtrishna (The Mirage).

Saxena who already has a French producer and is looking for an Indian one, has signed Himanshu Joshi (of Indian Ocean) for the lead character and is now planning to approach Alia Bhatt with a bound script to play the character of a young woman who loses her husband and goes to Vrindavan. “But that place imposes its own set of rules which are very regimented and claustrophobic. She finds herself in a glass menagerie and doesn’t know what to do with her life anymore. Amidst women in white floating around like ghosts in a timeless mist, can she find love, and more importantly herself?” he says.

And the film is the reason the couple shifted base from Delhi where they had been living for more than 50 years, to Mumbai. “Delhi just doesn’t have that kind of energy, ethos and culture. Out there, everybody is an island in himself. Despite so many of documentary filmmakers living in the Capital , we would meet only during festivals organised in places like Goa, Dharamsala and Mumbai. In Mumbai, we do an ‘addabazi’ of filmmakers, theatre artists, painters and musicians at least twice a week,” he smiles.

Known for his documentaries like I Cannot Give You My Forest, Candles in the Wind and Cotton for My Shroud which he co-directed with Behl — all of which won the National Award, the filmmakers recently completed a character driven documentary for Films Division titled Laxman Rekha which centres around Laxman Singh of Rajasthan, who has been instrumental in charging the water table of around 50 villages between Jaipur and Ajmer Sharif. Singh floated the organisation eGramin Vikas Navyuvak Mandal that encourages villagers to revive ponds in order to recharge the water table.

Saxena elaborates, “This film too has been entered for the National Award. When Singh started doing it in his Lapodia village years ago, everyone took him for a fool. But after he and his friends repaired the village pond with help of some volunteers, the dried up wells got recharged and the villagers were able to cultivate two crops in a year instead one. He then spread the movement to other villages. Interestingly, he got the idea after reading Anupam Mishra’s book Aaj Bhi Khare Hai Talab.”

With an oeuvre spanning domains of ecology, livelihoods, development and poetry films, and despite multiple National awards, funding still remains an issue. “Awards are recognition that you’re doing good work and they make it easy for our films to travel. People don’t take pangas much, don’t stop screenings, as they know we have a Censor certificate and a National Award. However, getting funds for a documentary is a constant struggle, and of course then comes the lack of a distribution network. Features still have commercial model. All other countries support documentaries more than feature films. In India, people are yet to realise that documentarians are chroniclers of the times. If we don’t keep the facts alive, then tomorrow, any narrative, far from truth will emerge and nobody would be able to counter it.”

Mentioning how their films are distributed by unions, activists and farmers’ association across the country including Andhra Pradesh, South India and Punjab, and he asserts, “We give them the prints to make copies, and also allow them to keep the money that comes from the sale. It is important that a large number of people get to know the ground situation. We have worked on the plight of cotton farmers, issues of widows of farmers who brought about the green revolution, and those who committed suicide. In so many families, there are double and triple suicides. We walked in villages in several districts of Punjab and shot the plight of suicide survivors. Believe me, Kavita and I felt that we would become depression patients.”

Despite the OTT revolution. Saxena does not feel that the platform is ready for the kind of content they produce. “We did speak to some senior at major platforms. They said they were following our work, but needed time. Frankly, what interests them at this point is travel and food, and of course sensational and racy documentaries produced by some outlets. As far as people like us, who work on human rights are concerned, well... The government calls us anti-national and urban naxals while corporates feel we are out to destroy them,” he says.

While most governments in the west support documentary filmmakers considering, the filmmaker feels that in India, it makes sense not to expect anything.

“Here, we don’t have pride. Now look at China, which is investing heavily in art and culture because they realise its potential. After filmmakers Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan, and critic Aruna Vasudev praised our work at different forums, the PSBT approached us. We made a film with them for Doordarshan for which they gave us six lakhs, while it costed us four times more. Do I say more?”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/closing-in-on-the-mirage-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/closing-in-on-the-mirage.html
199,09-3-20,Robotic assistant,"Researchers led by an Indian-origin scientist have developed helpers to do tough tasks by observing

Humanoids or robots are in news for taking up certain chores like in restaurants or as cleaners but researchers led by an Indian-origin scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are now working on robots that can learn new tasks solely by observing humans.

The team has designed a system that lets such types of robots learn complicated tasks that would otherwise hinder them with too many confusing rules.

One such task is setting a dinner table under certain conditions. At its core, the system gives robots the human-like planning ability to simultaneously weigh many ambiguous — and potentially contradictory — requirements to reach an end goal.

In their work, the researchers compiled a dataset with information about how eight objects — a mug, glass, spoon, fork, knife, dinner plate, small plate, and bowl — could be placed on a table in various configurations.

A robotic arm first observed randomly selected human demonstrations of setting the table with the objects. Then, the researchers tasked the arm with automatically setting a table in a specific configuration, in real-world experiments and in simulation, based on what it had seen.

To succeed, the robot had to weigh many possible placement orderings, even when items were purposely removed, stacked, or hidden. Normally, all that would confuse robots too much. But the researchers’ robot made no mistakes over several real-world experiments, and only a handful of mistakes over tens of thousands of simulated test runs.

“The vision is to put programming in the hands of domain experts, who can programme robots through intuitive ways, rather than describing orders to an engineer to add to their code,” said first author Ankit Shah, a graduate student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro) and the Interactive Robotics Group.

That way, robots won’t have to perform preprogrammed tasks anymore. “Factory workers can teach a robot to do multiple complex assembly tasks. Domestic robots can learn how to stack cabinets, load the dishwasher, or set the table from people at home,” Shah added.

Robots are fine planners in tasks with clear “specifications,” which help describe the task the robot needs to fulfill, considering its actions, environment, and end goal.

The researchers’ system, called PUnS (for Planning with Uncertain Specifications), enables a robot to hold a “belief” over a range of possible specifications. The belief itself can then be used to dish out rewards and penalties.

“The robot is essentially hedging its bets in terms of what’s intended in a task, and takes actions that satisfy its belief, instead of us giving it a clear specification,"" Shah noted.

The researchers hope to modify the system to help robots change their behaviour based on verbal instructions, corrections or a user’s assessment of the robot’s performance.

“Say a person demonstrates to a robot how to set a table at only one spot. The person may say, ‘do the same thing for all other spots,’ or, ‘place the knife before the fork here instead,’” Shah added.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/robotic-assistant-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/robotic-assistant.html
200,09-3-20,Boost your immunity,"Dr Ravikumar Reddy shares practical ways based on Ayurvedic healing to strenghten body resistance against various viruses like the Covid-19

Once the summers start approaching, our immune system weakens slightly due to the change in weather and the environment. It becomes very important to invest in building your immunity during this time. The ancient science of Ayurvedic healing can build a stronger immune system as we combat various strains of air borne viruses like the Covid-19.

Here are a few powerful herbs prescribed in Ayurveda that can help build your all round immunity.

Amrut or Giloy

Amrut pacifies all three doshas (forces that create the physical body), bio energies in the body and is therefore, safe for everyone. An important Ayurvedic concept is the doshas that represent the five great elements in nature that make up the matter. How these doshas manifest in an individual, determines his/her unique physiological and mental constitution called prakruti.

Giloy is one of the most powerful immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalise the immune system), which is why it is immensely useful in treating autoimmune conditions. The root is known for its anti-stress, anti-leprotic and anti-malarial activities. It is known to be a rich source of trace elements (zinc and copper) that act as antioxidants and protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals.

One must continue ingesting the herb over a long period of time to see cumulative effects.

Basel OR TULSI

One of India’s most virtuous herbs has leapfrogged from adorning front yards and delicate China cups to becoming one of the best medicinal herbs on the planet. Known as the queen of herbs and the elixir of life, tulsi is a useful adaptogen which are agents to help the body cope with stress, enhance physical and mental health and promote longevity, too.

It is no surprise that tulsi also features as one of the main herbs that can help you build immunity. It has a unique combination of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and other actions that combine to help the body adapt and cope with a wide range of infections. It works as an anti-inflammatory herb and promotes detoxification. It can modulate the immune system and protect the liver from environmental toxins.

Amla

In conversations around immunity-building foods today, the home-grown amla is a major contender. The Indian gooseberry is a superfood that comes packed with a whole lot of nutrients.

It has high levels of Vitamin C, B-complex and carotene, along with macronutrients such as protein and carbohydrates. It is also rich in calcium, iron, phosphorus and sodium. It is a powerful antioxidant that is effective in reducing cell damage and the free radicals that can cause diseases in the body. Also, amla doesn’t lose its properties when processed, pulped or dried as much as other fruits do.

Consuming an amla a day in any form is one of the best things you could do for boost your immunity. A single tiny fruit is equivalent in vitamin C content to two oranges.

Turmeric and Pepper

One of the reasons why turmeric is so freely sprinkled in all Indian dishes is because it is a nutritional powerhouse and a gift for our body’s immunity. Curcumin, present in turmeric, has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and antibacterial properties. It’s best to combine turmeric with a pinch of pepper, as curcumin shows increased bio-availability in the presence of peperine, which is one of the active compounds of black pepper.

Food for immunity

You can have cheese or yogurt for stronger gut immunity, along with black pepper, broccoli, sprouts, citrus fruits. Avoid foods that are cold, sweet or too fried.

As more cases of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) come to light, it is quite natural to feel anxious. Crossing borders, the virus hit a milestone, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide. Government and the health ministries are stepping up to the challenge and have already come up with various steps to increase effectiveness against the viral infections. The basic preventive measures include:

You are encouraged to wash your hands often as these are the most common carriers of the virus potentially because of common contact.

Don’t touch your face repeatedly (eyes, nose and mouth specifically).

Maintain social distance (lest you come directly in contact with someone who is displaying the symptoms).

Practice respiratory hygiene.

Symptoms include dry cough, cold, fever and shortness of breath.

Most importantly, get yourself tested if you are experiencing any of the symptoms or you have doubts.

Stay hydrated.

201,09-3-20,Future-ready,"The change will come by building a sense of self-respect and confidence in women to fight gender discrimination, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Isn’t it ironical that on one hand, people worship goddesses, observe fasts during nine days of Navratris and invoke Laxmi during Diwali, while on the other, these very people indulge in barbaric acts of molesting girls and dishonouring women?

One wonders how we have become so deceitful? Well, a very simple answer to this lies in the terms — sexism and gender discrimination. Yes, it’s a shame because even after investing years in development and progress, society’s patriarchal attitude remains unchanged. Since centuries, the attitude that has prevailed in society is that a wife is the property of her husband and therefore, he can do anything with her, which he finds appropriate. As a result, over a millennia, more than one quarter of women in many countries have been subjected to physical abuse and a large number of them have gone through the pain of emotional and psychological torture. In order to control these atrocities and give women their basic right to live with dignity, a large number of women’s organisations have come up in the last 50 years or so.

As a result of their efforts, many countries have set up women’s commissions to legally help those who are suffering. There is no doubt that all this has definitely benefitted some women but one needs to ponder deeply whether this would solve the basic problem of gender discrimination and hence, crimes against women. Will greater and active participation of women in social, political, financial, administrative, legislative and other fields give us a peaceful society? Will awareness about their rights and teaching them self-defence techniques stop barbaric acts like rape and eve teasing?

I am sure each one of you while reading this would answering the negative. Rightly so, because deep down we all realise quite well that the real problem is rooted in the attitude and beliefs of people, who think it is justified to control women and their lives.

So how does one change this attitude and behaviour? We need to first eradicate the concept of ‘abla naari’ (helpless woman) because they have been looked upon as weak and powerless since centuries. We need to remember that things would not change by merely giving women authority and making them incharge of some department or corporation. The change will come by building in them a sense of self-respect and self-confidence and emancipating them.

So all the men out there, let’s make a resolve to make women ‘sabla’ (empowered). Now, it’s upto us whether we want a weak generation for the future or an empowered one.

202,09-3-20,Small but better,"Sustainable gardening includes many eco-friendly practices

Sustainable is one of gardening’s trendiest buzzwords, yet it carries a range of definitions. Just what does it mean in practical terms and how important is it to the average gardener? Very important, according to a recent plant trends study by horticulturalists with the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS). It found strong interest in native plants, re-wilding gardens, growing edibles and going easy on wildlife, among other concerns.

“More and more people are supporting sustainability, where the social, environmental and economic factors balance,” said Mark Tancig, a horticulture agent with University of Florida Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension. “That means planting things that don’t require as much water or fertiliser. Using plants that resist disease and insects. Choosing native plants in mixtures that attract wildlife. “That not only saves you money but they look good, too,” Tancig said. “They’re restorative to the environment.”

Sustainable isn’t necessarily the same as organic, noted Erica Chernoh, an Oregon State University Extension horticulturist. “Organic’ has become legally recognised,” Chernoh said. “Sustainability is more of an open book, combining ecological, sociological and economic factors.”

Ross Penhallegon, a horticulturist emeritus with Oregon State University Extension, said sustainability requires that we all look at our garden and ask what we can do to reduce carbon imprint, reduce irrigation and use less products.”

Some simple sustainable gardening goals, he noted in a fact sheet, include:

— Starting compost piles rather than throwing away yard debris. “Composting keeps all the nutrients stored in yard debris in your garden on site and feeds the soil,” he said. “It also saves you money since buying compost isn’t necessary.”

— Shifting from standard sprinklers to drip irrigation or soaker hoses. “You can reduce your water use by up to 80 per cent,” Penhallegon said. “Also, consider using drought-resistant plants to save water.”

— Lessening pesticide use by planting large seedlings that withstand pests and diseases better than small ones.

— Growing your own food by saving seeds from some of your healthiest plants for use the following year.

— Fighting bugs with Integrated Pest Management, which uses the least toxic methods, minimising risks to humans, animals, pollinators and other beneficial insects. “If you must use a pesticide, use a low-toxicity one,” Penhallegon said.

Gardeners operate on a smaller scale than farmers but still can have major impacts, Chernoh said. “They can do that by not over-fertilising, by eliminating any spraying that isn’t necessary. Their size may be unlike farmers’, but their goals are the same,” she said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/small-but-better-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/small-but-better.html
203,09-3-20,Can't blame Shafali for defeat: Harman,"Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Sunday backed beleaguered 16-year-old Shafali Verma after her dropped catch of Alyssa Healy cost India dear in the Women’s T20 World Cup final against Australia here on Sunday.

Shafali dropped Healy in the first over when the Australian opener was on nine. Healy went on to smash a 39-ball 75 and, along with Beth Mooney (78 not out off 54), added 115 runs for the opening wicket to power Australia to 184 for four.

“She (Verma) is only 16, she’s playing her first World Cup. She did really, really well and performed for us. For a 16-year-old kid, it’s difficult to keep thinking positively and stay in the game,” said Kaur.

“It’s a learning lesson for her but it could happen to anyone. We can’t blame her because there were others also in her position.”

Left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad also wasted a caught and bowled chance of Mooney early in the Australian innings, and Kaur rued the two dropped catches.

“We gave chances to batters in great form and it's difficult for bowlers to come back when that happens,” she said.

Kaur denied that her side were overwhelmed by the occasion as they were playing in their maiden final in front of a record 86174 spectators at the iconic MCG, the most in a women's cricket match.

“We weren’t feeling under pressure but unfortunately we were unable to create those chances. It’s a lesson for all of us, we have to be at 100 per cent when we’re fielding because that's the most important part of cricket.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can-t-blame-shafali-for-defeat--harman.html
204,09-3-20,Manchester is Red,"Ole’s men beat defending PL champions City 2-0; Liverpool now just two wins away from English title

Manchester United completed a first Premier League double over Manchester City for 10 years as Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay punished two errors from visiting goalkeeper Ederson for a 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Victory keeps United hot on the heels of Chelsea for a top-four finish in the Premier League just three points behind the Blues in fifth place, which could be good enough for Champions League football next season.

Outgoing English champions City are banned from European football for the next two years pending an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and on this display seem to already be concentrating on completing a treble of cup competitions this season.

A seventh league defeat of the campaign for City means Liverpool are now just a maximum of two wins away from claiming a first league title in 30 years.

City dominated possession early on, but lacked their normal potency without the injured Kevin De Bruyne as United created the better chances on the counter-attack.

The January signing of Bruno Fernandes has been key to United's 10-game unbeaten run and the Portuguese's first impact in the game put Daniel James through, but the Welshman fired too close to Ederson.

Martial also allowed the Brazilian to make a comfortable save with a clear sight of goal after outmuscling Fernandinho.

City's defensive deficiencies have allowed Liverpool to streak 25 points clear. But it was an uncharacteristic error from Ederson that gifted United the lead.

Fernandes was the creator again with a scooped free-kick to pick out the Frenchman and his shot squeezed under Ederson's right hand and crept in at the near post.

VAR intervenes

Confidence was now flowing through United as Fernandes headed wide at the end of an excellent team move before Fred was controversially booked for diving when he appeared to have been taken down inside the area by Nicolas Otamendi.

United fans were frustrated VAR did not intervene on that occasion and when it did early in the second half, City were nearly the beneficiaries.

Sergio Aguero was flagged offside long before he fired past David de Gea, but the Argentine was only fractionally off when the move was reviewed.

Moments later Ederson escaped gifting another goal as a routine backpass rolled under his foot and the former Benfica stopper needed to produce a last-ditch tackle on Martial to deny United breathing space.

City then slowly started to up the pressure. Phil Foden's long-range drive forced De Gea into a fingertip save.

Raheem Sterling then could not stretch to get a good connection on Riyad Mahrez's cross and De Gea got down well to deny Gabriel Jesus.

However, where United may have buckled earlier in the season, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men held firm to record a third win in four meetings with City this season.

McTominay sealed the three points deep into stoppage time when he strode onto a wayward throw by Ederson to steer the ball into an unguarded net.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/manchester-is-red-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/manchester-is-red.html

206,09-3-20,"No change of stance on Dhoni's future, he","The addition of two new members, including the chairman, in the national selection committee has not changed the panel's stance on M S Dhoni, who will ""have to perform"" in the upcoming IPL to be considered for T20 World Cup selection, a top BCCI official told PTI.

The Sunil Joshi-led selection panel met for the first time in Ahmedabad on Sunday to pick a rather ""straightforward"" squad for the three ODIs against South Africa beginning in Dharamsala on March 12.

Fit-again Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shikhar Dhawan made their way back into the side.

Joshi's predecessor MSK Prasad had made it clear that the team has moved on from Dhoni and he has to first play to be considered for selection.

Dhoni, who has not played since the World Cup semi-final loss to New Zealand in July, will be making his highly awaited comeback in the IPL beginning March 29.

""It was a pretty straightforward selection meeting and since Dhoni was obviously not in the reckoning this time (for South Africa series), there was no formal talk about his future,"" a BCCI source told PTI.

""He will be back in the reckoning only if he has a good IPL. And why only him, there are so many senior and young players who will play in the IPL. If they do well, they are ought to be considered too. So, you could see some surprise inclusions,"" he said.

The T20 World Cup will be played in Australia in October-November and the games India play after the IPL leading up to the mega event will also be a factor in the final squad selection.

""But the performance in the IPL could be the clincher,"" the source added.

Head coach Ravi Shastri too has hinted that Dhoni could be back after a good IPL but his future remains a subject of intense speculation as he has not played a game in more than seven months.

With his heir apparent Rishabh Pant not setting the world on fire and K L Rahul being groomed into a full-time wicketkeeper-batsman, Dhoni's comeback cannot be ruled out.

His countless fans will finally get to see him in action when he leads Chennai Super Kings against defending champions Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener at Wankhede Stadium on March 29.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-change-of-stance-on-dhoni-s-future--he--has-to--perform-in-ipl-for-india-comeback-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-change-of-stance-on-dhoni-s-future--he--has-to--perform-in-ipl-for-india-comeback.html

Mooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. She has topped the rankings for the first time in her career.

New Zealand's Suzie Bates (750 points) remained in second position in the list that also features the Indian duo of Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues in the top ten.

While the India vice-captain Mandhana, who had a forgetful tournament, moved down a spot to be ranked seventh, Rodrigues remained static on ninth.

Mooney's opening partner Alyssa Healy has risen two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semifinal against Australia.

India's Deepti Sharma advanced 10 slots to reach 43rd position among batters and is among the top five all-rounders for the first time.

Deepti, Radha Yadav and Poonam Yadav occupied the sixth, seventh and eighth sports respectively in the bowlers ranking led by England's Sophie Ecclestone.

Australia's Megan Schutt and South African Shabnim Ismail occupy the second and third place respectively among bowlers.

While Australia left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen reached a career-best 728 points and fifth place, her best position since a career-best fourth ranking in November 2017.

Her team-mates Sophie Molineux and Delissa Kimmince have advanced 10 places each to reach joint-16th and 31st places respectively.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shafali-loses-top-spot-in-icc-t20i-player-rankings--slips-to-third-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shafali-loses-top-spot-in-icc-t20i-player-rankings--slips-to-third.html

210,09-3-20,Senior Congress leader Hansraj Bhardwaj dies,"Former Union law minister and Congress veteran Hansraj Bhardwaj died after a cardiac arrest at a hospital here on Sunday evening. He was 83.

Bhardwaj breathed his last around 6.30 pm at Max Hospital, Saket, where he was admitted since Wednesday due to kidney-related ailments, his family told PTI.

The cremation will take place at Nighambodh Ghat on Monday at 4 pm, his son Arun Bhardwaj said.

He is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. Bhardwaj celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary on February 29.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP leader and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury condoled Bhardwaj's death.

""Anguished by the passing away of former minister Shri Hans Raj Bhardwaj,"" the Prime Minister's Office tweeted quoting Modi.

""My thoughts are with his family and well-wishers in this hour of grief. Om Shanti,"" the tweet said.

Prasad recalled his association with Bhardwaj in Parliament.

""Deeply condole the sad demise of Shri Hansraj Bhardwaj who for long years served as the Law Minister of India. We were together in the Parliament. May his soul Rest In Peace,"" Prasad posted on Twitter.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury remembered the leader as an ""encyclopedia"" on the Indian judicial system.

""Sad news about Shri Hans Raj Bhardwaj ji's demise. Worked with him as an MP when he was a minister & shared the urge to safeguard our constitutional values. He was an encyclopedia on the Indian judicial system. Will miss him,"" Yechury said in a tweet.

Born in Garhi Sampla village in Rohtak district of Haryana, Bhardwaj was a Rajya Sabha member for five terms from April 1982 to June 2009.

He was the law minister for 14 years and served under the prime ministership of Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh. During his stint as the governor of Karnataka between 2009 and 2014, he sternly dealt with the mining mafia active in the state.

It was during Bhardwaj's tenure as law minister that Bofors-accused Ottavio Quattrocchi was given a clean chit by then UPA government in 2009.

Sources said he fell out with Congress party leadership after he became the governor and criticised it.

Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, former prime minister H D Deve Gowda and opposition leader in the assembly Siddaramaiah also mourned the demise of Bhardwaj.

""In his death we lost a good legal expert and administrator. May his soul rest in peace and may God give strength to his family to bear the loss,"" Yediyurappa said in a condolence message.

A tussle between Bhardwaj and Yediyurappa over mining and land scams drew everyone's attention during his second stint as chief minister.

Gowda said Bhardwaj will always be remembered for his exceptional service to the nation, while Siddaramaiah recalled him as as a tough man against immoral practices during power struggle.

""His contribution to Karnataka during his tenure shall always be remembered. He was tough against immoral practices of power struggle. My deepest condolences to his family members & well-wishers,"" Siddaramaiah tweeted.

Bhardwaj held a Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) degree and did his schooling from GBC High School, Rohtak, and college in BM College, Shimla. He also studied at Agra University and Panjab University.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/senior-congress-leader-hansraj-bhardwaj-dies-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/senior-congress-leader-hansraj-bhardwaj-dies.html
211,09-3-20,Southern stars shine so bright,"India saved their worst for the last as a brutal Australian side outclassed them by 85 runs for an unprecedented fifth T20 World Cup triumph in a final that promised much but delivered very little here Sunday.

Batting first after the coin landed in Meg Lanning's favour, Australia came out in scintillating fashion with their openers Alyssa Healy (75 off 39 balls) and Beth Mooney (78 off 54 balls) laying the foundation with a 115-run partnership in double quick time.

Stirred up by the grand occasion, their onslaught fired Australia to a formidable 184 for four in the stipulated 20 overs.

Overwhelmed by the occasion, India crumbled to 99 all out in front of a turnout of 86174 at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, a record in women's cricket history.

What worked in the home team's favour was that their openers easily neutralised the threat posed by the in-form spinner Poonam Yadav (1/30 in 4 overs) with percentage game while taking the likes of medium-pacer Shikha Pandey and Deepti Sharma to the cleaners.

On the day, Pandey was smashed for 52 runs in her four overs.

Half the battle was won there for the formidable Australians, who, in stark contrast to the India, saved their best for the last.

The manner and magnitude of the defeat, including a few sub plots, were reminiscent of the 2003 men's World Cup final when Ricky Ponting's Australia thrashed Sourav Ganguly's India in an anti-climactic title clash.

Like Zaheer Khan in his opening over at the Wanderers against Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, Deepti Sharma was all nerves when up against Mooney and Healy, who blasted massive sixes as the beaming husband Mitchell Starc watched from the stands.

The match was as good as over when India were 18/3 in the fourth over, which became four for 4/30 when skipper Harmanpreet Kaur departed and 58/5 when Veda Krishnamurthy was taking the long walk back.

From India's point of view, the final outing was a far cry from their campaign opener when the same team humbled the hosts.

“The first game was very good, it gave us a lot of confidence. We spent a lot of time together, unfortunate for us not to win today,” Harmanpreet said after the game.

“Sometimes, we are not able to give our best.”

Triumphant captain Lanning said, “To put this kind of performance on the biggest day is outstanding and something that I'm really proud of.”

Earlier, Mooney and Healy rode on dropped chances to smash blistering fifties and power Australia to a challenging 184 for four.

Mooney top-scored for Australia but it was Healy, who took to the attack after being dropped in the fifth ball of the innings by Shafali Verma off Deepti Sharma.

Healy’s 39-balls innings was laced with seven fours and five hits over the fence.

Healy and Mooney shared 115 runs in 11.5 overs for the opening wicket to give Australia a flying start after opting to bat first.

Just like Healy, Mooney too cashed in on a dropped chance — caught and bowled opportunity by Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the fourth over — to punish India by reaching her fifty in 41 balls.

Mooney struck 10 boundaries in her 54-ball unconquered knock.

Despite losing to India in the tournament opener, defending champions and four-time winners, Australia entered the final as favourites because of their big match temperament and experience.

And the Meg Lanning-led side proved their billing as Healy tore apart the hapless Indian attack with her power-hitting from ball one.

Healy’s entertaining knock finally came to an end in 12th over when she was holed out at the long-on boundary by Veda Krishnamurthy off left-arm spinner Radha Yadav.

After Healy’s dismissal, Mooney took charge and added 39 runs with skipper Lanning before Deepti’s double strike in the 17th over pulled things back for India to some extent.

While Lanning (6) was caught by Shikha Pandey in the second ball, Ashleigh Gardner was stumped by Taniya Bhatia three balls later.

Rachael Haynes (4) too failed to deliver as she played on a Poonam Yadav delivery in the 19th over.

But Mooney took up the responsibility and remained unbeaten in the company of Nicola Carey (5 not out) to take Australia close to the 190-run mark.

The Indian slow bowlers — Deepti (2/38), Radha Yadav (1/34) and Poonam Yadav (1/30) did well to restrict Australia under 200, which looked easily achievable when Mooney and Healy were going great guns.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/southern-stars-shine-so-bright.html
212,09-3-20,5 boxers book Olympic place,"Four Indian boxers, including the seasoned duo of Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Pooja Rani (75kg), secured Tokyo Olympic berths on Sunday by advancing to the semifinals of the Asian Qualifiers with contrasting quarterfinal victories here.

Rani, Krishan (69kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Ashish Kumar (75kg) became the first set of Indian boxers to qualify for the showpiece scheduled in July-August this year.

While fourth-seeded Rani notched up a facile 5-0 win over Thailand’s Pornnipa Chutee, Krishan endured a tough one against third-seeded Japanese Sewonrets Okazawa before also prevailing in a unanimous verdict against the Asian Silver-medallist.

In the evening session, two-time world Bronze-winner and second seed Borgohain eased past Uzbekistan’s Maftunakhon Melieva to enter the semifinals. Also through to the last-four stage was Asian silver-medallist Kumar with a 5-0 win over Indonesia’s Maikhel Roberrd Muskita, the bout being tougher than what the final scoreline might suggest.

""I managed to execute whatever I had planned. I wanted to fight from a distance and counter-attack, which I could do. Just qualifying is not enough, I want to now win a gold medal,” a jubilant Borgohain, who hails from Assam, said after her bout.

However, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) went down in a split decision to China’s national champion Daxaing Chen in his quarterfinal bout.

But he remains in the hunt for an Olympic berth if he can win the two-bout box-off between the losing quarterfinalists. The top five boxers in his category will get a spot in the Tokyo Games.

While Rani, Borgohain and Kumar secured their maiden Olympic spots, Krishan will be making his third successive appearance at the quadrennial showpiece, scheduled in July-August.

“I had never fought against this girl before today and honestly, I was a bit scared. I had told my coaches about it before the bout. They instilled confidence in me and I could pull off a one-sided result. I am happy,” said the 29-year-old Rani.

Rani will next face the reigning world and Asian champion Li Qian of China, who has the top billing in the 75kg category. Qian had no trouble beating Mongolia’s Myagmarjargal Munkhbat 5-0 in the opening bout of the day.

Taking full advantage of her longer reach, Rani outpunched the inexperienced but determined Chutee. The Indian is a three-time Asian medallist besides being a Bronze-winner at the 2014 Asian Games.

Krishan, however, had to slog hard against a brilliant boxer, whose performance was eye-catching despite the loss. Okazawa, a Gold-winner at the Olympic Test Event last year, kept Krishan on his toes and his right jabs were particularly effective.

What worked for the Indian was consistent straight punches to the body, which fetched him the bulk of the points.

Awaiting Krishan in the semifinals is second-seeded Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist and a former Asian Silver-winner. Zhussupov defeated Thailand’s Wuttichai Masuk in a unanimous verdict.

Krishan is making a comeback in the amateur fold after taking the professional plunge after the 2016 Rio Olympics. He had an unbeaten run in the circuit before a back injury changed his plans.

Upon his return to the amateur boxing last year, he won a Gold medal at the South Asian Games in December.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/5-boxers-book-olympic-place.html
213,09-3-20,Williams takes ATK to final,"Two-time champions ATK relied on a David Williams brace to script a spectacular turnaround and storm into the final of the Indian Super League with a 3-2 aggregate win over holders Bengaluru FC here on Sunday.

In the driver’s seat after winning the first leg 1-0, Bengaluru FC struck in the fifth minute for a vital away goal advantage through Ashique Kuruniyan, his first of the season, from a counter attack.

Up 2-0 on aggregate, Bengaluru had one foot in their third consecutive ISL final.

But ATK produced a stunning recovery in front of a 50,000-plus crowd, which included many Mohun Bagan members, who were given complimentary tickets. Mohun Bagan and ATK have merged for the next season.

Captain Roy Krishna (30th) brought ATK back into the game before Williams' 63rd minute penalty made it 2-2 on aggregate. Williams then struck a brilliant header in the 79th minute to seal the issue 3-1 in the second leg with local lad Prabir Das setting it up.

Das was exceptional in the midfield and had set up the first goal as well.

Bengaluru FC, however, started the match on a rousing note.

It was their latest recruit Francisco Borges Nili who started the move in the midfield and played a wonderful outside-of-the-foot pass for Kuruniyan breaking down the right.

Kuruniyan showed brilliant control and skipped away from the challenge of Sumit Rathi for a one-on-one against Arindam Bhattacharja before sliding past the ATK custodian, which brought the crowd to a standstill.

Under pressure, ATK goalkeeper Bhattacharya pulled off a stunning save in the 17th minute as Bengaluru FC pressed hard with back-to-back attacks. In the second attack, Kuruniyan's left footer missed the target narrowly as ATK survived.

In the 23rd minute, ATK launched a fine attack but the India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu kept Williams at bay, diving low to his left.

Finally, ATK brought on the equaliser with Roy Krishna doing the rescue act.

A cross-field ball was played towards the right where Prabir Das delightfully played a one-two with Williams to get on into the final third on the right flank.

Against the run of play, ATK was awarded a penalty when Williams was brought down by Suresh Singh Wangjam in the box.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/williams-takes-atk-to-final.html
214,09-3-20,Milan lose as Serie A survive,"Zlatan Ibrahimovi’s late goal couldn’t prevent AC Milan losing 2-1 to relegation-threatened Genoa as Serie A soccer matches resumed in eerily empty stadiums on Sunday - after even more of a delay.

Italian soccer was thrown into further confusion on Sunday after calls from Italy’s sports minister and the players’ association president to suspend the matches in the top division.

The game between second-place Juventus and third-place Inter Milan is set to go ahead later Sunday.

Ibrahimovi?, who had two other good chances, scored from close range 13 minutes from time to set up a tense finale after first-half goals from Goran Pandev and Francesco Cassata for Genoa.

The result added to Milan’s troubling week. It fired chief football officer Zvonimir Boban on Saturday.

The voices of players and coaches could clearly be heard as the match had to be played in an empty stadium following last week’s decree from the Italian government that all sporting events in Italy must take place without spectators until April 3.

That led to Thursday’s decision that the Italian soccer league would resume in full this weekend, starting with the matches that were postponed last round because of the virus outbreak in Italy.

Milan remained seventh, while Genoa climbed out of the relegation zone, although it remained level on points with 18th-place Lecce.

Parma-Spal, the first match of the day, kicked off after a 75-minute delay inside an empty stadium as officials considered an appeal from sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora minutes before the scheduled start. Spal won 1-0.

Sampdoria moved one point above the drop zone after it came from behind to beat Hellas Verona 2-1.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/milan-lose-as-serie-a-survive.html
215,09-3-20,Bayern go clear at top,"Thomas Mueller scored as Bayern Munich opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over Augsburg at the Allianz Arena on Sunday, while the spread of the coronavirus threatened to curtail the season.

Bayern lacked fluency in the opening stages despite scoring 13 goals in their previous three Bundesliga games, but did enough to edge closer to an eighth straight title.

Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 15 games despite starting slowly.

It was not until near the end of the first half when the home side looked like troubling the scorers, with Mueller shooting over the crossbar with just the keeper to beat.

Mueller made no mistake in the 53rd minute however, collecting a long ball from Jerome Boateng and side-footing into the net.

The goal, reminiscent of the prolific Mueller of a decade ago, continued his recent strong form under manager Hansi Flick.

Since Flick took over, Mueller has scored six Bundesliga goals and assisted 12 more in 15 games.

Augsburg had several chances to equalise on the counter. Their best opportunity came when Florian Niederlechner had two bites at the cherry just two yards from goal in the 80th minute.

He had his first effort saved by Manuel Neuer and was unable to take advantage of a fortunate bounce from the rebound, shooting straight into the desperate Bayern defence.

Niederlechner found the back of the net in the 89th minute, but the goal was later ruled out for a marginal offside near the halfway line.

Leon Goretzka put the game beyond doubt with a goal in second-half stoppage time after being expertly fed by Serge Gnabry before dribbling the ball past keeper Andreas Luthe.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bayern-go-clear-at-top.html
216,09-3-20,Ankita shines with two wins as India creates Fed Cup history,"The Indian Fed cup team created history by progressing to the play-offs for the first time ever with Ankita Raina leading the side to a 2-1 win over Indonesia, here.

Ankita on Saturday night pulled off a crucial singles win against talented Aldila Sutjiadi to lock the tie 1-1 after Rutuja Bhosale suffered a crushing defeat against an unranked Priska Madelyn Nugroho.

Up against the 16-year-old Indonesian, who is ranked 15th on the ITF junior circuit, Rutuja lost 3-6, 6-0, 3-6 in one hour and 43 minutes in the opening singles.

Ankita, who lost her previous two singles, demolished the challenge of Sutjiadi 6-3 6-3 in the second rubber.

She then combined with seasoned Sania Mirza to beat Sutziyadi and Nugroho 7-6(4) 6-0 to seal India's place in the play-offs where they will take on either Latvia or the Netherlands in April.

They overcame a sluggish start as they were trailing 1-4 but regrouped to dominate the decisive set.

India finished second in the six-team Group with four wins in a row after losing the opening tie to China, who remained unbeaten in the tournament.

Since earning their place back in Asia/Oceania Group I in 2016, India has remained in the regional group.

With the rise of Ankita, things began to improve.

Rutuja also played a key role as she provided winning starts in a few ties, sharing the burden with Ankita.

Sania’s return to Fed Cup after four years also helped as her inspirational presence and guidance helped the side immensely.

India’s non-playing captain Vishal Uppal is delighted with the result.

“It’s a historic moment and to be part of it feels surreal. I am proud of each and every member of our team — the players, physio, coach, manager. We all came together and worked towards a common goal,” Uppal told PTI.

“The key was to do the fundamentals well and keep it simple on court. As a team everyone stepped up one day or the other which is very important. I hope this win will give a big boost to women’s tennis in India.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ankita-shines-with-two-wins-as-india-creates-fed-cup-history-ankita-shines-with-two-wins-as-india-creates-fed-cup-history.html

But at least it (order) sets a precedent for the future, so that they (government) do not repeat it for others. Hence, I treat it as a landmark judgment,"" she said.

When contacted, S R Darapuri said, ""We welcome the judgment because it proved that in UP, the rule of law will prevail, not the anarchy (aarajaktaa) of the Yogi (Adityanath) government. This is a victory of democracy and defeat of dictatorship.""

He added that earlier he had written to the DGP and the home secretary that if any untoward incident took place because of the ""illegal actions"", then they ""will be responsible for it"".

He said around six posters featuring him were put up in parts of the state capital.

The Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the Lucknow adminstration to remove posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests in December.

The bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha also directed the district magistrate and the Lucknow police commissioner to submit a report in this regard by March 16.

The court, which had on March 7 taken suo motu cognisance of the issue, on Sunday had termed the move ""highly unjust"" and said it was an ""absolute encroachment on personal liberty of individuals"".

The posters bearing photographs, names and addresses of those accused of vandalism during the anti-CAA protests had come up at major road crossings in Lucknow late on Thursday night on the directions of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, an official had said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-name-and-shame--posters--former-ips-officer-darapuri--activist-politician-sadaf-jafar-hail-hc-order-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/-name-and-shame--posters--former-ips-officer-darapuri--activist-politician-sadaf-jafar-hail-hc-order.html

224,09-3-20,MP govt in crisis?: Scindia and 17 MLAs 'untraceable',"In a curious political development Amid reports of infighting in the Madhya Pradesh Congress and allegations of poaching, senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and at least 17 MLAs who are believed to be supporting him suddenly became 'incommunicado' on Monday ahead of the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections.

The development came against the backdrop of the ruling party accusing the BJP of trying to poach its MLAs to topple the Kamal Nath-led government, which enjoys a wafer thin majority in the House, and imminent expansion of the state Cabinet.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath who was in Delhi earlier in the day has returned to Bhopal after cutting short his visit, sources said.

While calls made to Scindia by PTI remained unanswered, mobile phones of at least six ministers who are supporters of the Guna royal are switched off.

The ministers whose mobile phones are switched off included health minister Tulsi Silavat, labour minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia, transport minister Govind Singh Rajput, women and child development minister Imarti Devi, food and civil supplies minister Pradyumna Singh Tomar and school education minister Dr Prabhura Choudhary.

When contacted for his reaction on the development, a Congress spokesman said there is nothing ""serious"".

Earlier in the day, a section of Congress leaders demanded that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be nominated from the state for the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls.

Scindia and Nath have fallen out over the post of the state Congress president, which is currently held by the chief minister.

Nath had left for Delhi on Sunday night to meet top Congress leaders to discuss the current political situation in the state and nominations for the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled on March 26.

The Rajya Sabha terms of Congress veteran Digvijay Singh, and BJP leaders Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya will end on April 9.

As per the arithmetic in the 230-member Madhya Pradesh Assembly, the two parties are sure to win one Rajya Sabha seat each, but a tussle is likely for the third seat.

While the Congress has 114 MLAs, the opposition BJP has 107 legislators.

Four Independent MLAs, two lawmakers of the Bahujan Samaj Party and one legislator of the Samajwadi Party are supporting the Congress-led state government.

Two seats are vacant following the demise of a Congress and a BJP legislator.

The political drama in the state began last week when ten Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh went 'missing'. The party pointed fingers at the BJP, which denied any role in it.

Since then, eight of the 'missing' legislators have returned and expressed their support to the ruling party in the state.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mp-govt-in-crisis---scindia-and-17-mlas--untraceable--2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/mp-govt-in-crisis---scindia-and-17-mlas--untraceable-.html

DHFL is alleged to have had siphoned off Rs 31,000 crore out of total bank loans of Rs 97,000 crore using a web of multiple shell companies.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday had imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

With no let up in the coronavirus cases which rose to 39 on Sunday, with five new cases in Kerala, India is pulling out all stops in fight against the deadly pathogen.

While the Centre has asked the States to enhance community surveillance and augment isolation facilities in hospitals across, Arunanchal Pradesh suspended issuing of Protected Area Permits (PAP) to foreigners whereas Kerala warned of taking stringent action against those hiding travel history and symptoms of the infection.

Last week, the Sikkim Government had suspended issuing Inner Line Permit (ILP) to foreign nationals.

The Kerala Government’s move to warn the citizen followed after it reported five new cases on Sunday— a couple in their fifties and their 24-year-old son — who had flown in from Italy last month and evaded airport screening.

Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja said the State has been put on high alert in the wake of the new cases, reported more than a fortnight after India’s first three coronavirus patients — medical students from Wuhan—were discharged from hospitals in the State.

The Minister said all the passengers who travelled with the infected family in the Venice-Doha Qatar airlines QR 126 flight on February 29 and Qatar Airlines flight QR514 from Doha to Kochi that arrived at 8.20 am on March 1 should get in touch with health authorities.

The Kerala Government, however, has decided to go ahead with “Attukal Pongala,” one of the largest all-women religious congregations to be held on Monday, while issuing fresh guidelines including asking those coming from abroad especially from the affected countries to make the offering in their hotels itself.

The number of COVID-19 cases in India, which was just six till last Tuesday, stands at 39, including 16 Italians. The figure includes the three Kerala patients who have recuperated.

Meanwhile, a diabetic man died in the isolation ward of a hospital in West Bengal's Murshidabad on Sunday, a day after he was admitted there with suspected symptoms of coronavirus following his return from Saudi Arabia. Though test results of his blood and swab samples for novel coronavirus were awaited, it can be said that Janarul Haque died probably of diabetes, Director of Health Services Ajay Chakraborty told PTI.

Globally, the number of coronavirus cases stood at over 105,800, including 3,595 deaths, across 95 countries.

China, where the epidemic emerged in December, had 80,695 cases, of which 3,097 were fatal.

It is “learnt that the spread of the coronavirus in India is primarily from visitors who had history of travelling abroad recently or through tourists who have visited India,” the Arunanchal Pradesh government order said. “In order to prevent the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) in Arunachal Pradesh, it has been decided to temporarily suspend issuing Protected Area Permit (PAP)...,” it added.

The Union Health Ministry has asked the AIIMS administration in New Delhi to designate a part of the new emergency wing for setting up of isolation beds for suspected COVID-19 patients while six other AIIMS have been directed to keep an isolation bed capacity between 12-15 for coronavirus patients, which can be scaled up to 30 if need arises, an official said.

Besides, the ministry has asked the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar, Haryana to augment its isolation bed capacity to 125 from the existing 25. Also, the Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry has been asked to keep aside 13 beds for isolating patients.

The Delhi government has ordered DTC and cluster buses, metro and hospitals to be disinfected on a regular basis as a precautionary measure to deal with the novel coronavirus, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday.

234,09-3-20,Drinking alcohol will not protect you from COVID-19: WHO,"With 31 individuals diagnosed with the deadly novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in India, everyone seems to be going into a state of panic.

And as a fallout, people are believing just about anything and everything they are coming across on the internet. Among several pieces of information, there is one that asks people to 'drink alcohol to stay safe and kill the deadly virus', which, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) is not true.

Busting myths, misconceptions and misinformation about the deadly coronavirus, the WHO said: ""No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.""

According to the global health agency, spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or eyes and mouth.

""Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations,"" the WHO said.

The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water, according to the organisation.

The WHO also revealed that taking a hot bath does not prevent the new coronavirus disease and cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting COVID-19 cases.

So far, the deadly novel coronavirus has now infected more than 100,000 people around the world and taken more than 3,000 lives globally.

235,09-3-20,"Swapping red meat for plant protein, dairy may help people live longer: Study","Eating more protein from plant sources or dairy while cutting down red meat consumption could help people live longer, new research claims.

In a study of over 37,000 Americans with an average age of 50, those who ate the most plant protein were 27 per cent less likely to die of any cause, according to the researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the US.

As many as 29 per cent participants were less likely to die of coronary heart disease compared to people who ate the least amount of plant protein, they said.

The team found that replacing 5 per cent of daily calories from total animal protein with the equivalent number of calories of plant protein was linked to a nearly 50 per cent decrease in the risk of dying of any cause, including coronary heart disease.

Replacing 2 per cent of daily calories from processed meat protein with an equivalent number of calories from plant protein was associated with a 32 per cent lower risk of death.

""It isn't enough just to avoid red meat -- it is also about what you choose to eat in place of red meat,"" said Zhilei Shan, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

""Healthy plant proteins like nuts, legumes and whole grains contain more than just protein -- they include other beneficial nutrients such as healthy fats, antioxidant vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals (compounds derived from plants), which have been associated with lower risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers,"" said Shan.

Substituting one serving per day of red or processed red meat with foods, such as nuts, legumes, whole grains or dairy, was associated with up to a 47 per cent lower risk of having coronary heart disease in men, the researchers said.

Replacing one daily serving of any type of red meat with an equivalent amount of nuts -- without increasing the number of calories a person ate -- was linked to a 17 per cent lower risk of dying of a heart attack, they said.

The researchers said replacing one serving of red meat with whole grains resulted in a 48 per cent lower risk of dying of heart attack in men.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/swapping-red-meat-for-plant-protein--dairy-may-help-people-live-longer--study-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/swapping-red-meat-for-plant-protein--dairy-may-help-people-live-longer--study.html

237,09-3-20,Coronavirus: China reports 22 more deaths; closes makeshift hospitals as virus cases plunge,"China has reported 22 new deaths from the deadly coronavirus, the lowest number of fatalities in more than a month, taking the death toll to 3,119, while the new confirmed cases hit a record low to 40, prompting authorities to close 11 temporary hospitals at the virus epicentre in Wuhan.

China's National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Monday it received reports of 40 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, the lowest number of fresh cases since it started reporting the data in January, and 22 deaths on Sunday on the Chinese mainland.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,735 by the end of Sunday which included 3,119 people who have died so far, 19,016 patients undergoing treatment and 58,600 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Among the deaths on Sunday, 21 were in Hubei Province and one in Guangdong Province.

Meanwhile, 60 new suspected cases were reported taking the total to 421 people, it said.

Also on Sunday, four imported cases (people coming from abroad) of novel coronavirus infection were reported on the mainland, all of which were in Gansu Province. By the end of Sunday, 67 imported cases had been reported, the NHC said.

By the end of Sunday, 114 confirmed cases, including three deaths have been reported in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), 10 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 45 in Taiwan including one death, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Meanwhile, China has begun dismantling a host of temporary hospitals built-in big public places like auditoriums and sports complexes in Wuhan set up during the massive surge of virus cases in January and February.

China has built two makeshift hospitals with 2,300 beds capacity in just about 10 days' time in early February and later started converting public buildings into hospitals to meet the rush of patients.

Two makeshift hospitals were suspended on Sunday in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province and the heart of the novel coronavirus outbreak, as the number of patients continued to drop, local officials said.

The city has suspended the operation of 11 makeshift hospitals, which were converted from public facilities for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms in the city, the report said.

One of these two hospitals, converted from a sports venue, had 1,000 beds with more than 1,000 medical and other staff. A total of 1,056 patients have been treated here since February 12, with no medical staff infected.

Another hospital, covering over 6,100 square meters treated 990 patients with 996 beds since February 17.

The medical staff in these hospitals will be on standby.

The provincial health commission said earlier that Hubei will gradually shut down temporary hospitals and cut the number of hospitals designated for the disease while maintaining strict prevention and control measures.

Hubei province and its capital Wuhan continued to be in lockdown since January 23 with all public and private transport banned. Officials say the restrictions would be gradually eased keeping up with the trend of the COVID-19 slowdown.

According to the daily situation report on the COVID-19 released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Sunday, seven more countries have seen local transmission of the virus, bringing the number of countries and regions where local transmission emerged to 53 in addition to China.

The seven countries are Cambodia, Austria, Hungary, Egypt, Peru, Bulgaria and Maldives.

A total of 105,586 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 have been reported worldwide as of Sunday, an increase of 3,656 infections from the previous day, including 3,610 new cases outside China.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--china-reports-22-more-deaths--closes-makeshift-hospitals-as-virus-cases-plunge-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus--china-reports-22-more-deaths--closes-makeshift-hospitals-as-virus-cases-plunge.html
238,09-3-20,US virus cases pass 500 as California readies for cruise ship arrival,"The number of US coronavirus cases soared past 500 Sunday, including two further deaths, as California braced for the arrival of infected cruise ship passengers and saw a major tennis event canceled.

The surge came as President Donald Trump defended his administration's ""perfectly coordinated"" response to the epidemic, after heavy criticism over health cuts and strategic blunders that have failed to stem its rapid spread.

Some 30 US states have been hit by the novel coronavirus, with Oregon the latest to declare an emergency, and 60 million people in California and New York are under crisis measures.

Two more deaths linked to a virus-hit care home near Seattle were reported Sunday, bringing the nationwide toll to at least 21.

A Johns Hopkins tally put the number of confirmed US cases at 554 by Sunday evening, with newly diagnosed patients in states including Pennsylvania, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Medical officers headed for a virus-hit cruise ship stranded off San Francisco to begin screening passengers for an ""unprecedented and difficult"" landing operation. The Grand Princess, with 21 confirmed coronavirus infections among 3,500 people on board, is due to dock in nearby Oakland Monday.

The operation to move passengers ashore will take two to three days, said Governor Gavin Newsom.

Carolyn Wright, a passenger on the ship, told AFP that people without symptoms were allowed to leave their cabins for the first time since Thursday.

Once ashore, ill passengers will be moved to hospitals, while Americans not requiring treatment will be quarantined at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia for 14 days.

Foreign passengers will be repatriated, while crew will remain quarantined on board.

The State Department warned vulnerable people including the elderly ""should not travel by cruise ship."" Several public events have been canceled across the US in an effort to contain the epidemic.

The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells was called off on Sunday just days before it was due to begin.

Officials said they opted to cancel after the health department of California's Riverside County declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley -- in the desert east of Los Angeles -- after a confirmed case of COVID-19 locally.

The tournament is one of the biggest outside the four Grand Slams and draws more than 400,000 fans each year.

Trump has defended his record after accusations he peddled misinformation on the outbreak, blaming the media for trying to make his government ""look bad."" ""We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus,"" he tweeted.

""We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. Is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!"" But Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, criticized Trump, telling NBC the president ""hasn't communicated the way I would, and the way I might like him to.""

Fellow Republican Ted Cruz, a US senator, revealed he had shaken hands at a conservative conference with a person who later tested positive.

""I have decided to remain at my home in Texas this week, until a full 14 days have passed,"" he wrote on Facebook, adding he had no symptoms.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence also attended the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington last month.

Trump has been heavily rebuked for repeatedly contradicting the advice of his administration's experts in his public pronouncements about the coronavirus.

He has downplayed the threat posed by the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,500 people since emerging in China, suggesting cases were ""going very substantially down, not up."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said federal health authorities had been ""caught flat-footed"" and had ""handcuffed"" the ability of individual states to respond.

""Their messages are all over the place, frankly,"" he told Fox News.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Fox News that the possibility of following Italy's example in locking down large sections of the population could not be ruled out.

""You don't want to alarm people but, given the spread we've seen, anything is possible,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-virus-cases-pass-500-as-california-readies-for-cruise-ship-arrival-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-virus-cases-pass-500-as-california-readies-for-cruise-ship-arrival.html
239,09-3-20,North Korea fires 3 projectiles: South's military,"North Korea fired three unidentified projectiles into the sea on Monday, Seoul's military said, the second such weapons test by Pyongyang in a week.

The three devices were fired in a northeasterly direction from the Sondok area in South Hamgyong province, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without further details.

""The military is monitoring for additional launches and maintaining readiness,"" it added.

A spokesman at Japan's defence ministry said North Korea launched what appeared to be ""ballistic missile(s)"", adding there had been no indication of anything coming down in Tokyo's territory or exclusive economic zone.

Analysts say the North has been continuing to refine its weapons capabilities during its long-stalled nuclear discussions with the US, which have been at a standstill since the collapse of the Hanoi summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump more than a year ago.

Three projectiles fired successfully from a single Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) would be ""a new milestone"" for the North's short-range ballistic missile programme, tweeted Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.

Vipin Narang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology added: ""Kim continues to test, improve, and operationalize his force.""

After last week's launch the North's state media said Kim had overseen a ""long-range artillery"" drill, carrying images of multiple launch rocket systems and several of a larger calibre rocket being fired in a forest.

South Korea said that launch appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles -- which the nuclear-armed North is banned from testing under UN Security Council resolutions.

Monday's launch came days after Kim sent a personal letter to the South's President Moon Jae-in, offering ""comfort"" for the rapid outbreak of the new coronavirus in the country.

South Korea has one of the world's largest infection totals outside China with more than 7,300, while Pyongyang insists it has not had a single case. That message had followed an unprecedented statement by Kim's younger sister Yo Jong, when she berated Seoul for its condemnation of Pyongyang's weapons test last week was a ""truly senseless act"" and ""perfectly foolish"".

The North carried out a series of weapons tests late last year, the last of them in November, which it often described as multiple launch rocket systems although others called them ballistic missiles.

It also conducted static engine tests, most recently in December. Pyongyang set Washington a unilateral deadline of the end of 2019 to offer it fresh concessions on sanctions relief, and at a party meeting in late December Kim declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

He also threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon. Pyongyang is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes from the United Nations Security Council, US, South Korea and others.

Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress was made.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/north-korea-fires-3-projectiles--south-s-military-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/north-korea-fires-3-projectiles--south-s-military.html
240,09-3-20,Empty streets and paranoia as northern Italy goes into lockdown,"The sun shone on deserted squares in Milan and empty gondolas in Venice on Sunday as a quarter of Italy's population came to grips with being cut off from the rest of the country, under new rules strictly limiting movement in and out of the new red zone.

While some packed their bags and fled, most in northern Italy stayed to brave a lockdown imposed by the government on some 15 million people, as it ramps up the fight against the deadly coronavirus.

The country on Sunday recorded the second-highest coronavirus toll in the world, after reporting a sharp jump in deaths -- from 133 to 366 -- and overtaking South Korea on infections.

Italy's interior ministry said anyone flouting the lockdown risked at least three months in jail or a 206 euro (USD 233) fine.

Only people with a ""serious"" reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zones, which cover Lombardy and 14 provinces in four other regions.

Passengers departing on flights in the lockdown areas will need to justify themselves -- apart from people who had been in the area temporarily, who are allowed to return home. All arrivals will need to justify their travel.

Police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people's temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, the ministry said in a statement.

Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the Renaissance city allowed to disembark.

Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate.

The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open.

Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was ""bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia"".

""I'd like to know if I'm infected... It would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,"" she said.

With 366 fatalities, Italy has recorded the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak began in December.

The new rules came shortly after the news that the number of people infected had jumped by over 1,200 in a 24-hour period.

The plan was leaked to the media on Saturday, infuriating Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who slammed it as ""unacceptable"", saying it had created ""uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion"".

Expert Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who managed to identify the Italian strain last month, told AFP it had been a ""disastrous communication error"" and ""absolute idiocracy"".

Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as ""pure madness"".

""The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,"" he said on social media.

Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, told AFP ""many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan.

""This is going to test the Italians' ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they've been failing. There's been an exodus"". Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said ""you can feel the anxiety in the air"".

The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was ""a big blow"".

""First the city was hit by record floods, now this. Venice is very fragile right now,"" he said.

Italy has found itself at the forefront of the global fight against the virus, with more than 5,800 infections recorded in the past seven weeks. The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south.

The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown -- which include the cities of Parma and Rimini -- to ""stop and turn around"".

""Get off (the train) at the first station, don't get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don't bring the epidemic to Puglia,"" he said on Facebook.

""You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/empty-streets-and-paranoia-as-northern-italy-goes-into-lockdown-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/empty-streets-and-paranoia-as-northern-italy-goes-into-lockdown.html

243,09-3-20,Rana Kapoor in ED custody,"Yes Bank founder’s shell firms, Rs 2K cr investments under ED lens; CBI files FIR

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday arrested Yes Bank’s founder and former chairman Rana Kapoor (62) on charges of money laundering. The arrest, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), comes after 30 hours of intense questioning. Kapoor is accused of receiving kickbacks from various corporate entities on disbursal of loans and mismanagement in the operations of the private bank.

The ED produced Kapoor before a holiday court in Mumbai which remanded him in the probe agency’s custody till March 11. He was arrested by the ED around 3 am on Sunday as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe. The ED is also recording the statement of Kapoor’s wife and daughters.

Meanwhile, the CBI has begun a probe into the Yes Bank affairs as officials started collecting documents in the matter. According to CBI sources, the agency is looking into aspects of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption. The sources refused to elaborate on the nature of the probe — preliminary enquiry or an FIR — or people arraigned, but affirmed that a formal investigation has begun. The relations between the scam-hit DHFL and Yes Bank are understood to be under the scanner of the CBI with some questionable financial transactions involving a third company, sources added.

The ED contended before the court that Yes Bank bought debentures worth Rs 3,700 crore of DHFL. In lieu of the same DHFL sanctioned a Rs 600 crore loan to DoIT Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, a company in which Kapoor’s daughters are directors. The said loan was given without adequate collateral.

“DHFL’s Kapil Wadhawan and Kapoor entered into a criminal conspiracy to defraud public money,” ED counsel Sunil Gonsalves contested before the court. The agency has pegged the proceeds of crime in the case at Rs 4,300 crore. The ED told the court that role of some companies run by Kapoor’s family members needs to be established and they need to confront all these people with the accused.

According to a PTI report, the investigating agency is probing the source of funds which were used by the family members of Rana Kapoor to acquire assets in London. The report added that under investigation are investments over Rs 2,000 crore, 44 expensive paintings and a dozen alleged shell firms. Kapoor sold almost all his stake in YES Bank in November last year but for 900 shares. This came after the YES bank co-founder had boastfully declared that he would never sell his share in YES bank and that “diamonds are forever”. Authorities also recovered some documents that indicate that Kapoor’s family has assets in London, which is now under the Indian agency’s scanner.

Meanwhile, allaying concerns raised by many after Yes Bank fiasco, the RBI on Sunday reiterated that depositors’ money is safe and it is closely monitoring all banks. “Concern has been raised in certain sections of media about safety of deposits of certain banks. This concern is based on analysis which is flawed. Solvency of banks is internationally based on Capital to Risk Weighted Assets (CRAR) and not on market cap,” the central bank said in a tweet.

“RBI closely monitors all the banks and hereby assures all depositors that there is no such concern of safety of their deposits in any bank,” its second tweet said.

During the hearing, the defence lawyer, however, said Kapoor has been selectively targeted by the ED and he is cooperating with the probe agency. “We are ready to cooperate and submit all the documents that the agency wants. I have fully cooperated with them,” Kapoor said in the court. Kapoor was one of the fastest self-made billionaires. Kapoor stated in the court that the DoIT company is in name of his two daughters — Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor. Yes Bank had given around Rs 3,700 crore loan to triple-A rated DHFL company, and later about Rs 600 crore was borrowed by DoIT Company from DHFL, he said.

The DoIT company is still repaying the loan and it is not an NPA (non-performing asset), Kapoor said. “From the last few days I was not well, hence my family members took me to Breach Candy Hospital, but still I am cooperating with the ED,” he told in the court.

However, the ED told the court that it wants to conduct a through investigation and “many people are under the scanner”.

The crisis began to unfold after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noticed under-reporting of NPAs by the bank. The banking regulator cut short Kapoor’s tenure to January 31, 2019. The ED began action against the banker by raiding his upscale residence in south Mumbai on Friday and is investigating Kapoor, his wife and three daughters over a Rs 600 crore fund received by a firm allegedly “controlled” by them from an entity linked to the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL).

Meanwhile, Indiabulls Housing Finance on Sunday said Yes Bank owes Rs 662 crore in the form of bonds to the company and it has no term loans outstanding from the lender. “We wish to inform that Yes Bank owes to Indiabulls Housing Finance Rs 662 crore via additional tier 1 (AT-1) bonds,” it said in a regulatory filing. The investments in AT-1 bonds of Yes Bank were made in 2017, as part of its treasury management of over Rs 20,000 crore of cash and when the bank was worth over $10 billion in value, it said. “Indiabulls Housing Finance has no term loans outstanding from Yes Bank,” it said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rana-kapoor-in-ed-custody-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rana-kapoor-in-ed-custody.html
244,09-3-20,"BJP, Congress get into slanging match","BJP links Yes Bank plight with Cong first family; Opp wonders if PM, FM were complicit

A war of words broke out between the BJP and the Congress on Sunday over the Yes Bank crisis with the ruling party seeking to link it with the Gandhi family, while the Opposition wondered if the Prime Minister and Finance Minister were “complicit” as the bank’s loan book grew manifold.

Posting on Twitter a clip of a news channel report that Rana Kapoor, the arrested Yes Bank founder, had bought a painting from Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, BJP’s information and technology wing in-charge Amit Malviya alleged that every financial crime in India has “deep links” with the Gandhis.

Congress termed the charge “fake”. It said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had sold an MF Hussain painting of her father Rajiv Gandhi to Kapoor for `2 crore, and the entire amount was disclosed in her income tax return of 2010.

Malviya tweeted, “Every financial crime in India has deep link with the Gandhis. Mallya used to send flight upgrade tickets to Sonia Gandhi. Had access to MMS (Manmohan Singh) and PC (P Chidambaram). Is absconding. Rahul inaugurated Nirav Modi’s bridal jewellery collection, he defaulted. Rana bought Priyanka Vadra’s paintings.”

Rubbishing the allegation, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it was a “diversionary” tactic by the Government. He noted that the bank’s loan book rose from `55,633 crore in March 2014, the year Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, to `2, 41,499 crore in March 2019.

“Why did the loan book rise by 100 per cent in two years after demonetisation i.e from `98,210 crore in March 2016 to `2,03,534 crore in March 2018? Were the PM and the FM sleeping, ignorant or complicit?” he asked.

The entire amount Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had received was in cheque and was fully disclosed in the income tax return, Singhvi said. Kapoor was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Mumbai after charges of alleged financial irregularities and mismanagement in the bank’s operations surfaced and the RBI and Union Government initiated action to control its affairs.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp--congress-get-into-slanging-match-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bjp--congress-get-into-slanging-match.html
245,09-3-20,7 women share epic success stories on PM’s social media ac,"Taking the lead in paying tributes to women on the occasion of International Women’s Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over his social media accounts on Sunday to seven women achievers of different fields to share their success stories.

The women chosen to use Modi’s accounts included Sneha Mohandoss, who works to eradicate hunger; Malvika Iyer, who survived a gruesome bomb blast that blew off her hands and damaged her legs when she was 13 and is now a motivational speaker, disability activist and model; and Arifa Jaan from Kashmir who promotes traditional crafts of Kashmir.

Others were Kalpana Ramesh, a water conservator; Vijaya Pawar, who promotes handicrafts from the Banjara community of rural Maharashtra; Kalavati Devi of Kanpur, who collects money to build toilets; and Veena Devi, who is from Munger in Bihar and made her name by growing mushrooms under her bed due to lack of space. Social media was eagerly waiting to know who were all selected by the Prime Minister, as he had declared to hand over his Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube accounts to women achievers last week.

Before handing over his accounts, the Prime Minister on Sunday morning shared brief videos of the women on his Twitter and Instagram pages and their achievements on his Facebook page. The achievements were shared under #SheInspiresUs. Sneha Mohandoss, inspired by her mother, started an initiative called Foodbank India. She works with volunteers, many of whom are outside India, to eradicate hunger.

“We have over 20 chapters and have impacted several people with our work. We also initiated activities like mass cooking, cooking marathons, breastfeeding awareness drives,” she wrote on Modi’s Twitter account. Before operating PM’s Twitter account, she tweeted from her account that she is going to operate PM’s account on Sunday.

Malvika Iyer survived a gruesome bomb blast at the age of 13 that blew off her hands and severely damaged her legs. “Giving up is never an option. Forget your limitations and take on the world with confidence and hope,” she wrote on the Prime Minister’s handle.

Iyer is a motivational speaker, disability activist and a model. Arifa Jaan from Kashmir had always dreamt of reviving the traditional crafts of Kashmir as, according to her, this was a means to empower local women.

“I saw the condition of women artisans and so I began working to revise “namda” craft... When tradition meets modernity, wonders can happen. I experienced this in my work. It is designed to suit the modern day market,” she wrote. Introducing herself, Kalpana Ramesh, a water conservator, said, “be a warrior but of a different kind. Be a water warrior”.

“Small efforts can make a big impact... Contribute by using water responsibly, harvesting rainwater, saving lakes, recycling used water and creating awareness,” she wrote. Vijaya Pawar promotes handicrafts from the Banjara community of rural Maharashtra. “I have been working on this for the last two decades and have been assisted by a thousand more women,” she wrote.

Kalavati Devi of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh collected money to build toilets. She said if you want to achieve something, do not look back and ignore the bitter words of people. “The place where I used to live, had filth all around. But there was a strong belief that through cleanliness we can change this situation. I decided to convince people. Collected money to build toilets,” she said.

Veena Devi of Munger in Bihar proved where there is will, there is a way. She did not allow lack of space to create hurdles in her plan to cultivate mushrooms and grew the crop under her bed. “Everything can be achieved by will. My real recognition came from cultivating one kilo of mushrooms under the bed. This not only made me self-sufficient, but gave a new life by increasing my confidence,” she said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/7-women-share-epic-success-stories-on-pm---s-social-media-ac-s-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/7-women-share-epic-success-stories-on-pm---s-social-media-ac-s.html

248,09-3-20,Indian Wells tennis cancelled over coronavirus fears,"The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, has been cancelled over concerns about the outbreak of the new coronavirus, making it the first major sporting event in the US to be scrubbed due to health concerns.

The tournament, one of the biggest outside the four Grand Slams, was cancelled just days before it was due to begin.

Officials said in a news release on Sunday that they opted to cancel after the health department of California's Riverside County declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley -- in the desert east of Los Angeles -- after a confirmed case of COVID-19 locally.

No further details of the case were given.

Days earlier, organizers had said they planned to go ahead with extra health measures in place such as hand sanitizing stations, beefed up cleaning protocols and gloves for ball kids, volunteers and food workers.

The ATP and WTA had also issued virus-related guidelines, telling players not to accept items from fans to be autographed.

Even before the cancellation the tournament, which draws more than 400,000 fans each year, had offered refunds to anyone who bought tickets but did not want to attend.

Many of the players have already arrived in Indian Wells for the event with qualifying matches scheduled to start on Monday and the main draw set to kick off on Wednesday.

""We are very disappointed that the tournament will not take place, but the health and safety of the local community, fans, players, volunteers, sponsors, employees, vendors, and everyone involved with the event is of paramount importance,"" said tournament director Tommy Haas.

""We are prepared to hold the tournament on another date and will explore options,"" Haas added.

The number of American coronavirus cases is now at over 500 and involves some 30 US states.

California officials are also battling to contain an outbreak on a cruise ship off the coast where 21 people have tested positive for the virus among the 3,500 people on board.

'too great a risk'

""There is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,"" said doctor David Agus, professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California.

""It is not in the public interest of fans, players and neighboring areas for this tournament to proceed. We all have to join together to protect the community from the coronavirus outbreak.""

Indian Wells lasts two weeks and draws some of the largest crowds for a tennis event in North America. The number of competitors and lucrative prize money being offered for the men and women has helped earn it the nickname ""Fifth Slam"".

There is also a men's and women's tournament schedule for Miami later this month but there was no word on any changes to that event.

Following Miami, the tours head to Europe for the beginning of the clay court season. The run up to the French Open includes the ATP and WTA event in Rome, Italy, the hardest hit European country with 366 deaths from the virus.

The virus now known as COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, late last year and quickly spread across the globe.

The illness affects the respiratory tract and can be transmitted through coughing, sneezing and contact with those infected or with surfaces where the virus is present. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.

In Italy, the Serie A football season has descended into controversy because of match cancellations and player resistance to competing in empty stadiums.

Among other sports disruptions worldwide, the start of Japan's J-League has been postponed. The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix was cancelled and the Bahrain Grand Prix is set to be held without spectators.

In the United States, the NBA has warned teams to prepare for the possibility of playing games in empty stadiums.

The NHL is also monitoring the outbreak and indicated it wouldn't object if teams choose to limit access to players by media in the locker room.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-wells-tennis-cancelled-over-coronavirus-fears-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/indian-wells-tennis-cancelled-over-coronavirus-fears.html

He reportedly plans to dedicate to his kids in future by adding their handprints inside each circle.

""Ed comes from a large Catholic family and he wants to have a house full of kids. He has had five intertwined circles put on his back that look a bit like the Olympic rings. He wants to put a tattoo of a palm print into each circle,"" said a source.

The 29-year-old star's tattoo artist, Kevin Paul, had previously admitted that he thinks a lot of his famous client's inkings are ""s**t"" but understands they are personal to Sheeran.

Talking about Sheeran's body art, he said: ""I agree with most of it, his tattoos aren't very good. And I take the p**s out of Ed all the time, when I'm with him, that they are s**t. They are!

""The couple has always had love and respect for one another but took a break last year because they both had so much going on. They couldn't fully focus on what it took to make the relationship work,"" a source told etonline.com.

""Firstly, 90 per cent of the action sequences are performed solely by Akshay sir. During the helicopter sequence, Akshay sir performed the stunt of jumping on a helicopter from the bike that he was riding without the support of harness, which quite shocked me and the rest of the crew,"" Shetty said.

""Initially, we had kept a cut in between the sequence of jumping on a helicopter from the bike, so we can fit the harness to him. But we didn't know when this man spoke with the pilot as he supported him in continuing the action sequence without the support of harness,"" he added.

The director spoke about the cop film during the shooting of an episode of ""The Kapil Sharma Show"".

During the show, host Kapil Sharma asked Akshay about his expectations from ""Sooryavanshi"" as his last film ""Good Newwz"" had also done well at the box office.

""I don't believe in this. 'Main tikey rahu, wohi important cheez hai' (sustaining is the only important thing), kyuki (because) to get a break in a film is easy whereas it is a very difficult task to sustain yourself and maintain consistency in the industry,"" replied Akshay.

254,09-3-20,PhonePe transactions back to normal after Yes Bank fiasco,"As the Yes Bank fiasco hit UPI-based transactions last week, PhonePe that was solely using Yes Bank's services worked overnight with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and ICICI bank to ensure all its services were up and running within a day.

PhonePe, with close to 20 crore users, saw an extended service outage, which started immediately after the RBI moratorium on Yes Bank on March 5, lasting for nearly 24 hours.

The company worked with the NPCI and ICICI bank, its new UPI partner.

All merchant payment settlements were restored by Friday noon and all consumer wallet, credit and debit card payments were restored by 3 pm, the company said in a statement.

All UPI services were restored by Friday night, with PhonePe users continuing to use their UPI @ybl handles.

""Friday was an extraordinarily difficult situation with little precedence. We are grateful to the RBI, NPCI, Yes Bank, and ICICI for working collectively to ensure that millions of our customers and merchants were not inconvenienced a minute longer than necessary,"" said Sameer Nigam, Founder and CEO PhonePe.

PhonePe employees had to work for 36 hours straight to achieve this.

The platform processed transactions of over Rs 4,000 crore in 24 hours and saw its largest ever volume of user traffic in a single day (with over 70 million app sessions).

Several petrol pumps rejected most of the UPI-based transactions over the weekend, including Paytm, PhonePe, and GooglePay.

Even BharatPe, which deploys QR codes at small merchant outlets, stopped functioning.

Millions of users failed to make or receive payments because of curbs imposed on Yes Bank.

256,09-3-20,Coronavirus to cause first annual decline in oil use in decade: IEA,"The world is set for its first annual decline in oil consumption in more than a decade due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the IEA said on Monday.

In its latest report -- which did not take into account an oil price war after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree to continue production cuts -- the International Energy Agency chopped its current demand forecast by 1.1 million barrels per day (mbd) in its base case scenario as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world.

That would make for a small annual drop of 90,000 barrels per day, the first since 2009.

That forecast, however, is based on the assumption that China brings the outbreak there under control by the end of the month and that containment measures elsewhere have less of an impact on demand.

Oil consumption tanked in February, with the IEA estimating it fell by 4.2 mbd from the same month last year, of which 3.6 mbd was in China.

While the IEA did not provide specific monthly consumption figures, that is likely a drop of around 4.5 per cent.

""The coronavirus crisis is affecting a wide range of energy markets -- including coal, gas and renewables -- but its impact on oil markets is particularly severe because it is stopping people and goods from moving around, dealing a heavy blow to demand for transport fuels,"" IEA chief Fatih Birol said.

""This is especially true in China, the largest energy consumer in the world, which accounted for more than 80 per cent of global oil demand growth last year,"" he added. China has imposed quarantines in large swathes of the country, with many factories shuttered and millions of people in lockdown. While some factories have resumed production, global supply chains have already been badly disrupted in some industries.

Travel has also been hard hit, with international airlines slashing services to areas affected by outbreak, both in response to restrictions imposed by authorities and to a decline in customers.

The IEA also provided a more pessimistic scenario where there is no quick recovery in China's economy -- in that case, demand could drop by 730,000 barrels per day.

""While the repercussions of the virus are spreading to other parts of the world, what happens in China will have major implications for global energy and oil markets,"" said Birol.

Oil prices fell by as much as 30 per cent at one point early Monday after Saudi Arabia launched an all-out price war on Sunday with the biggest cut in its prices in the past 20 years after OPEC and Moscow failed to clinch a deal to reduce output.

Deals to restrain output by Saudi-led OPEC and a handful of other producers including Russia have kept oil prices from crashing in recent years as US shale producers ramped up production, undercutting cartel oil.

The IEA also provided a medium-term outlook, which sees a strong rebound next year, but then growth in demand slows as consumption of transportation fuels grows more slowly.

By 2025 demand will increase by 5.7 mbd but output capacity is forecast to rise by more than that, at 5.9 mbd, with most coming from non-OPEC sources.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-to-cause-first-annual-decline-in-oil-use-in-decade--iea-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus-to-cause-first-annual-decline-in-oil-use-in-decade--iea.html
257,09-3-20,"Both virality, fatality rate of COVID-19 overstated: Elon Musk","After his controversial tweet that the ""coronavirus panic is dumb"", Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made an attempt to explain why he thinks so.

In his replies to a Twitter user, Musk on Sunday said that both the virality of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and fatality rate are overstated.

""Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO reasoned.

Globally, coronavirus infections crossed 100,000 while killing over 3,500 people. In the US, the number of infections has exceeded 500 and the death toll due to the virus reached 22.

""Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high,"" Musk said.

In reply to the tweets, some users asked Musk to do more research.

However, Musk's contention that the coronavirus panic is dumb has drawn severe criticism from several quarters.

Responding to Musk, mathematician Nassim Nicholas Taleb tweeted, ""Saying the coronavirus panic as dumb is what's dumb.""

Taleb is the author of the Incerto, a five volume philosophical essay on uncertainty published between 2001 and 2018 of which the most well known books are ""The Black Swan"" and ""Antifragile"".

Another Twitterati found Musk's tweet ""senseless"".

""Billionaires should not exist. And this kind of senseless disregard for the well being of vulnerable members of our society helps prove why,"" wrote the user.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/both-virality--fatality-rate-of-covid-19-overstated--elon-musk-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/both-virality--fatality-rate-of-covid-19-overstated--elon-musk.html
258,09-3-20,Italy says lockdown aimed at saving economy from virus,"Italy on Monday said its month-long lockdown of northern regions responsible for 40 percent of overall production was designed to save the rest of the economy from falling victim to the new coronavirus.

But the Italian Stock Exchange -- propelled by broader declines linked to the oil market's collapse -- took little comfort from the government's move, falling almost 10 percent by the early afternoon.

Italian leaders had been watching in anguish as COVID-19 kept killing dozens of people daily in areas around the tourist hotspot Venice and the financial capital Milan.

The toll shot up by 133 on Sunday to 366 -- the largest outside China itself.

The government had by then decided to ring-fence more than 15 million people who live in the industrial heartland of Lombardy and surrounding areas until April 3.

Italy's economy and finance ministry openly conceded Monday that an effective quarantine of the northern quarter of the population would deliver a short-term shock.

But it also argued that this was the bitter pill Italy had to swallow for its economy to survive.

""A temporary downturn in some sectors or areas of the country is preferable to a longer crisis that could spread to the whole economy via demand and supply effects,"" the ministry said a statement.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gloomily cited the wartime firesides chats of Britain's Winston Churchill as evidence that great nations persevere when the going gets tough.

""These days, I have been thinking about the old speeches of Churchill -- it is our darkest hour but we will make it,"" Conte told La Repubblica newspaper.

Churchill coined the ""darkest hour"" phrase to describe an early moment during World War II when Britain had no allies to fight to Nazis.

Italy is preparing a 7.5-billion-euro (USD 8.6-billion) package aimed at helping out the devastated tourism industry and other sectors especially hard-hit by disruptions in global supply chains.

""Support measures will be adequate to the difficult circumstances and aimed at preventing lasting damage to the supply side of the Italian economy and permanent employment losses,"" the Italian economy and finance ministry said.

Yet some analysts doubt that cash injections can help an economy suffering from the consequences of a global epidemic.

""The world is facing a medical emergency that monetary and fiscal policy cannot fix,"" Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding wrote.

Schmieding also questioned whether the Italian lockdown -- seemingly less restrictive and less punitively enforced than the one China imposed on Wuhan -- would actually work.

""With luck, the Italian response can at least help to slow down the advance of the virus,"" said Schmieding.

""However, beyond the direct impact on activity, the Italian measures... Are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence near-term.""

Berenberg revised down its second quarter forecast for Italy to a decline of 1.0 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

It had project a fall of 0.3 per cent between April and June.

The economy and finance ministry admitted that its measure will ""particularly impact sectors tied to transport, lodging, food and drink, entertainment and social life."" The government is shutting down pubs and museums nationwide in an effort to limit crowds.

Everything from the Colosseum and Vatican Museums to Mount Vesuvius near Naples are closed for the coming four weeks.

The tourism sector's 13 percent contribution to Italy's GDP is expected to shrivel up.

But the economic and finance ministry looked for the silver lining in its efforts to calm the markets.

""It should be emphasised that the core sectors of the economy and the public administration will remain open for business even in the restricted areas of the country,"" it said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/italy-says-lockdown-aimed-at-saving-economy-from-virus-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/italy-says-lockdown-aimed-at-saving-economy-from-virus.html
259,09-3-20,UK supermarkets impose limits to stop virus stockpiling,"British supermarkets have started imposing limits on the purchase of certain goods after shelves were emptied because of coronavirus fears.

Toilet paper, anti-bacterial hand gel, tinned food, soap and paracetamol have been in short supply both in stores and online because of panic buying.

The situation has been fuelled by recommendations last week by health authorities for Britons to ""plan ahead"" in case they are forced to self-isolate for several weeks.

But the country's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said he believed there was ""absolutely no reason"" for the public to panic buy.

Tesco last weekend introduced measures to limit purchases to a maximum five items for products including pasta, anti-bacterial hand-wipes and gels, and long-life milk.

The supermarket giant, which has nearly 3,500 stores in Britain, is so far the only supermarket chain to have imposed restrictions on food items.

Others such as Waitrose have limited the online sale of some wipes and soaps, while Walmart subsidiary Asda is only allowing the purchase of two anti-bacterial gels in stores and online.

Last week, pharmacy chain Boots limited the sale of disinfecting hand gel, after sales skyrocketed because of the spread of the virus.

Sales have more than tripled in recent weeks in Britain, which as of Sunday had 278 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including three deaths.

Liquid soap sales increased by seven percent and household cleaning products by 10 percent in the four weeks to February 23 compared with the same period a year earlier, retail research company Kantar said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-supermarkets-impose-limits-to-stop-virus-stockpiling-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-supermarkets-impose-limits-to-stop-virus-stockpiling.html
260,09-3-20,Blasts heard as duelling Afghan leaders swear themselves in,"Afghanistan lurched deeper into political crisis on Monday as the rivals for the country's leadership had themselves sworn in at simultaneous ceremonies that were interrupted by at least two blasts.

The bitter feud between President Ashraf Ghani and his former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah has raised fears for Afghanistan's fragile democracy as the US prepares to leave the country following an agreement last month with a strong and largely unified Taliban.

Polls were held in September, but repeated delays and accusations of voter fraud meant that Ghani, the incumbent president, was only declared as winner of a second term in February -- sparking a furious response from Abdullah, who vowed to form his own parallel government.

On Monday Ghani, dressed in traditional Afghan clothing and white turban, arrived at the presidential palace to be sworn in, surrounded by supporters, senior political figures, diplomats and foreign dignitaries including US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.

Minutes earlier, in another corner of the sprawling presidential palace compound, a suit-clad Abdullah inaugurated himself as president, vowing to ""safeguard the independence, national sovereignty, territorial integrity"" of Afghanistan.

As hundreds of people watched Ghani's ceremony, two loud explosions were heard prompting some people to flee.

""I have no bulletproof vest on, only my shirt,"" Ghani told those who stayed behind as sirens wailed.

""I will stay even if I have to sacrifice my head.""

An AFP reporter saw many of those who fled return to their seats after Ghani's refusal to leave the podium prompted cheers and applause.

The game of thrones has strained the patience of the international community and Afghans alike, with Washington warning earlier that the bickering posed a risk to the US withdrawal deal, which requires the Taliban to hold talks with Kabul.

Widening divisions among Afghan politicians would leave the insurgents with the upper hand in those negotiations.

The row has left many Afghans despairing for their country's future.

""It is impossible to have two presidents in one country,"" said Ahmad Jawed, 22, who urged the men ""to put their personal interests aside and only think of their country instead of fighting for power"".

He told AFP that ""instead of holding oath-taking ceremonies they should talk to each other to find a solution"".

Afghans have shown little enthusiasm for Abdullah, Ghani or the election process in general. Most of them abstained in last year's lacklustre poll that saw candidates pitch few ideas or policies.

Unemployment is high, and even university graduates like Jawed are struggling to find work, while violence has continued unabated, except for during a week-long partial truce ahead of the US-Taliban deal.

In the deadliest attack to hit Afghanistan in weeks, Islamic State group gunmen shot dead 32 people and wounded dozens of others at a political rally in Kabul on Friday.

The Taliban, who have slammed the electoral process as ""a fake and foreign-run"" affair, have also ramped up attacks on Afghan forces and civilians.

The insurgents' spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP the competing ceremonies showed that ""nothing is more important to the slaves than their personal interests"".

Security appeared to have been tightened for the ceremonies, with road closures and multiple checkpoints set up in Kabul hours before the two men were due to be sworn in.

Experts say the infighting is likely to cost the government, which is already under pressure after being shut out of the Doha negotiations for the US-Taliban deal.

According to the agreement signed in Qatar, foreign troops will withdraw from Afghanistan in 14 months, in return for various security commitments from the Taliban and a pledge to hold talks with Kabul.

Political analyst Atta Noori said the squabbling would ""gravely affect the government's position in the upcoming intra-Afghan talks"".

""Unity is the only way (forward) if they want to win on the negotiating table,"" he told AFP.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/blasts-heard-as-duelling-afghan-leaders-swear-themselves-in-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/blasts-heard-as-duelling-afghan-leaders-swear-themselves-in.html
261,09-3-20,Couple exploiting anti-CAA stir for terror attacks held,"Kashmiri couple is part of ISIS’ Khorasan module, arrested from Okhla Vihar: Police

The Special Cell of anti-terrorist unit of the Delhi Police on Sunday arrested from Okhla area in Delhi a Kashmiri couple, having inks with Islamic State (IS) Khorasan module, for engineering protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and inciting young Muslim men to conduct terror strikes all across India.

The accused have been identified as Jahanjeb Sami and his wife Hina Bashir Beg, said Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).

The police have seized four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard-disc and other incriminating materials from their house. According to sources, the couple also instigated the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act agitation in Shaheen Bagh. Police said the couple were planning a suicide attack in Delhi, and was persuading youths to join the ranks of the ISIS.

From the interrogation, it has been found that they had created several anonymous Ids on several social media platforms such as Telegram, Facebook, Threema, Sure spot, Instagram, Twitter, and propagating the ideology of the terror group ISIS.

Investigation by the Delhi Police and central agencies has found incontrovertible evidence of the involvement of ISIS in engineering the protests against the contentious citizenship law and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The couple was under the surveillance of the agencies. They were found to be in regular touch with the senior ISIS handlers in Afghanistan’s Khorasan province.

They were specifically tasked to exploit the ongoing anti-CAA agitation and incite instigate Muslim youths carry out terror strikes all over India, police sources said.

A team of the Special Cell took the couple Jahanjeb Sami and his wife Hina Bashir Beig into custody on Sunday morning from their C-4, 2nd Floor, Okhla Vihar home. They were found in possession of certain sensitive items and were confronted but they could not give any satisfactory answer.

It has been revealed that Jahanjeb Sami used to work in a private company. The couple also ran a social media platform called “Indian Muslims unite”, which worked towards mobilising support against the CAA and the NRC.

Intelligence officials say that Jahanzab had been in touch with Islamic State’s Khorasan wing Pakistani commander Huzaifa al-Bakistani, who played a key role in efforts to radicalise Kashmiri youngsters to join the terror group. Huzaifa had first joined the Lashkar-e-Tayyeba before upgrading to the ISIS. Huzaifa was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan.

Shaheen Bagh in Southeast Delhi has been witnessing a massive protest against the CAA, where hundreds of women have been conducting a sit-in since December 15.

The riots in Northeast district that singed the national Capital and took the lives of 44 persons (unconfirmed figure is 50 as six more bodies are yet to be identified) and injuring 298, had started as clashes between the anti-CAA protesters and those supporting the law.

The Centre has repeatedly insisted that the protest against the CAA is conspiracy by forces inimical to the interest of the country. The BJP used it extensively during its campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections, held on February 8 this year.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/couple-exploiting-anti-caa-stir-for-terror-attacks-held-2020-03-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/couple-exploiting-anti-caa-stir-for-terror-attacks-held.html
