0,14-1-20,Market blues,"Is Walmart’s decision to lay off senior executives a symptom of economic slowdown? Or is it to do with digitisation?

The news that American retail giant Walmart has laid off 56 senior and mid-level executives from its corporate headquarters in Gurugram has sent shivers down the economy watchers. They feel this is just a further confirmation that the Indian economy is in a turbulent phase. Following the news that British telecom giant Vodafone may quit its operations in the country, this isn’t something that would please the honchos in the Finance Ministry. But is the situation really as bad as it sounds? Walmart’s huge investment of $16 billion to capture online retailer Flipkart in 2018 proved beyond doubt that it means business. But it intends to focus on the digital side of the operations. What is hurting Walmart in India though is the brick-and-mortar sector, where a slowdown in consumer spending, coupled with the fact that it has been able to grow its wholesale business far too slowly, is hurting it. Many of those laid off are from the sourcing end.

The ruling BJP’s opposition to introducing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail when the Congress was in power is hurting it today. However, with a large part of its core base being small and local traders, it finds itself locked into this unsustainable and undesirable position. India needs to rapidly improve its consumer retail process and catch up with the rest of the world. For better or worse, the advent of modern retail will help producers, both farmers and factories, as well as consumers. It will also give a fillip to domestic production and improve the way food reaches the plate, thus reducing wastage and improving yields. The fact that the BJP changed its tune on implementing Goods and Services Tax (GST) might have given hope to those who thought they would change their stance on FDI in multi-brand retail. However, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political capital being used up in the implementation of GST after the public relations disaster of demonetisation, this was a step too far. Digital promotion aside, the neighbourhood shop is going nowhere. The Government must find a way to modernise Indian retail even though there will be a cost for the kirana store because it will improve efficiency. This should not be done to protect the interest of foreign multinationals but even Indian companies that are facing difficulties in establishing a proper network of modern stores. In fact, a unique approach can be devised by working with the local kirana stores who have assets and access in neighbourhood markets. They can be given access to sourcing back-end and better customer management at the front-end. Hopefully this is just a blip in the radar for Walmart and nothing more than a business decision.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/market-blues-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/market-blues.html
1,14-1-20,Harness the demographic dividend,"All stakeholders must engage in educating the population about sexual and reproductive health and highlight the multi-sectoral approach that will be necessary for improving adolescent health and breaking inter-generational cycles of disease

Investing in adolescent health is essential to realising multiple sustainable development goals set by the UN, to be achieved by 2030. Given that India houses more than 253 million adolescents, it is pertinent to realise that neglecting their health may have enormous implications for the universal healthcare agenda. A recent Observer Research Foundation and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare workshop discussed the possibility of scaling up best practices to address issues of adolescent sexual and reproductive health amidst the continued challenges of early marriage, teenage pregnancies and high incidences of maternal mortality. It is understood that an adolescent’s health status will be carried forward into their adulthood. Therefore, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) global strategy for investing in their health aims to operate on three targets: Survive, Thrive and Transform. These targets of putting an end to preventable deaths, ensuring health and well-being and expanding an enabling environment, although tangible, require a concerted effort on behalf of both the Government as well as civil society.

Challenges concerning adolescent health in India are ever-mounting and have been progressing at an alarming rate. Currently, it is among the top ten countries with the largest burden of teenage pregnancies, with nearly 27 per cent girls reported getting married before the age of 18 and 31 per cent giving birth by 18. Teenage pregnancies at the current rate have become a national emergency that needs to be addressed as a priority. Issues of inequality, lack of choices, interpersonal and sexual violence and child marriages are all underlying factors that have contributed towards teenage pregnancies and incidents of maternal mortality. In this scenario, it becomes important for us to understand the extent to which teenage pregnancies can impact the health and nutrition of our future children, as multiple studies have associated them to child undernutrition. The possibility of teenage mothers being anaemic, underweight and having lesser access to healthcare services is also largely reported.

In order to address the concerns of adolescents, it is important that they are represented in the dialogue. All stakeholders must engage in educating the population about the subject of sexual and reproductive health education and highlight the multi-sectoral approach that will be necessary for improving adolescent health and breaking inter-generational cycles of disease. Although there is a significant change in the nutritional status in terms of being overweight and obese between NFHS 3 and 4, with a relative change of 75 per cent among girls and 182 per cent among boys, we still need to echo its importance. In terms of teenage pregnancies, only 57 per cent adolescents get registered during the first trimester and only four per cent receive ante-natal check-ups; showing that not only is there a pattern of early pregnancies but there is a setback in access to necessary services. There are situations where only 11 per cent boys and three per cent girls aged between 15 to 24 report premarital sex.

An early intervention at the inception of adolescence, that would steer the progress of their health, should be carried forward to when they conceive, subsequently to when they bear a child at an age that is physically and emotionally mature. The high incidences of substance abuse, deaths due to Non-Communicable Diseases and complications during pregnancies and childbirth, are all reasons for us to re-evaluate our approach.

Investing in adolescent health has to be taken up with a multi-sectoral and multi-dimensional approach. The notion of the policymakers, executioners and civil society working in silos and their comfort zones needs to be trumped as it nullifies the process and progress that comes out of sharing knowledge and communicating, and makes the working of the comprehensive plans redundant.

Schemes like the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, that envisions child health screening and early intervention services, will only prove fruitful when there is a convergence amongst schools, social welfare departments, State health departments and Integrated Child Development Services to ensure that children continue to receive their benefits even after leaving school.

On the other hand, Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), has made huge strides in working towards adolescent health as it has expanded its scope by reaching out to boys and girls, both married and unmarried, in rural as well as urban areas, and those who drop out of school and belong to marginalised groups. The programme also incorporates nutrition, violence, substance abuse/misuse, mental health and non-communicable diseases. The preventive, curative and routine check-ups at the primary level and general care at secondary and tertiary levels, are provided under the scheme. Realising the importance of family care and community-based interventions, RKSK has been driven with involvement of counselling, outreach programmes, and adolescent-friendly health centres.

There must be an acceptance about the naivete and the challenges of physical, cognitive, emotional and societal change adolescents face while growing up. Family care plays a huge part in easing the process of growth and streamlining the strides that need to be made towards their education and health. Furthermore, the longer girls stay in schools, the lesser the chances of early marriages and unplanned pregnancies. This will have a positive impact on the female labour force and the economy in the long run. There is an urgency with which we must combat the deeply-entrenched evils of child marriage, the conflict of medical termination of pregnancies and the haste to prove fertility.

Putting in place a system that manages knowledge about menstruation, substance misuse, while equally reaching out to boy and girls, with family and community-based interventions has now become an absolute necessity. A collaborative structure among the stakeholders that allows customisation for a localised approach to region-specific problems, needs to be adopted for better service delivery.

It is not just a technical reform that is required but a societal and political one as well, as the issues are not just limited to structure of the policy but to the structure of the institutions formulating and implementing them as well.

Recently, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh launched the Saathi and Super Saathi programmes, which seek to empower rural women and communities through increased access to digital resources that help in generating awareness about health, education and sanitation. By this measure, our focus needs to be on curtailing the current trends of teenage pregnancies, revamping schemes like RKSK to allow suitable customisation in order to resolve ground-level region-specific problems and make adolescent health services accessible outside medical centres.

2,14-1-20,"Lko, Noida switch to police commissionerate system","With the aim to make policing more effective, the Uttar Pradesh government introduced police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar (Noida) districts, an announcement of which was made by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath after the state cabinet’s approval to the proposal on Monday.

ADG (Meerut) Alok Singh and ADG (Prayagraj) Sujit Pandey have been appointed as the first police commissioners of Noida and Lucknow, respectively.

Lucknow and Noida become the 72nd and 73rd cities of the country spread over 16 states to get the commissionerate system of policing.

Making the announcement after the cabinet meeting, the chief minister said that the new system would give more teeth to the police for controlling crime as the government had the “political will” to deal with every situation.

“We have appointed two woman police officers in both the cities to deal with crime against the fairer sex. They will be entrusted with the task of monitoring the pending cases of women atrocities,” Yogi said and added that a special police officer would also be deployed for controlling traffic system.

In Lucknow, the police commissionerate would cover 40 police stations while in Noida it will cover around 25 police stations of both Noida and Greater Noida.

As per the Police Act, a city with over one million population can introduce the police commissionerate system. But in Lucknow, the population is around 40 lakh when as per 2011 Census it was 29 lakh . In Noida, the present population is around 25 lakh against the figure of 16 lakh in 2011.

Though the chief minister did not mention anything about the other big cities where this new policing system would be introduced in future, officials said that Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar had been taken up on an experimental basis and after the success of the system there, it would be introduced in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Agra and Meerut.

The police commissionerate system was discussed first during the Mayawati regime in 2010 but the move was derailed by the powerful IAS lobby.

The chief minister said the new system would enable the senior police officers on the ground to handle the situation better while specialised units would monitored by senior levels thereby increasing their efficacy.

Besides posting police commissioner in Lucknow of ADG rank, the government would also post two joint commissioners of police (of IG rank) and nine additional commissioners of police (ACPs) of DIG rank. While the first JCP would look after law and order front, the other will manage the administration.

In Noida, it would be a bit different as along with the police commissioner, there would be two ACPs of DIG rank and five police officers of SP rank.

In both the cities, there would be two separate woman officers of the rank of SP and ASP who would be in-charge of crime against women.

Besides, a separate SP would be deployed for managing traffic.

The police commissioner will be vested with absolute powers regarding law and order, magisterial authority besides 15 other powers. However, the issuance of arm licence would not be in the purview of the police commissioner.

This system gives more teeth, including magisterial powers, to IPS officers of IG rank and above, posted as commissioners.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lko--noida-switch-to-police--commissionerate-system.html
3,14-1-20,"Present, former DGPs welcome police commissionerate system in Lko, Noida","Uttar Pradesh’s Director General of Police OP Singh as well as many of his predecessors on Monday hailed the state cabinet decision to implement police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida.

“Till now police have to depend on the district administration for its work. The way in which urbanisation has increased and scenario has changed, the need was felt for quick decision,” DGP OP Singh told reporters soon after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced the decision to introduce police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida here on Monday morning.

“That’s why we felt that commissionerate system is needed. It will help in smart and sensitive policing,” the DGP said, adding that it would also be helpful in totally integrated policing.

“It is evident that the police will now have the rights of a magistrate,” commented former DGP Brijlal while thanking Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the bold decision.

He said a myth had been broken that the police commissionerate system could never be implemented in Uttar Pradesh.

He said this system was already in force in 71 metro cities of the country.

The former DGP congratulated Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on behalf of the people of the state, bureaucracy, police officers for this decision.

He said this decision reflected the strong will of the chief minister, adding that in this new system, the police had got direct powers for ensuring law and order and controlling crimes. “It (police) will be able to provide relief to the people by taking quick decisions. The law and order of Uttar Pradesh is already very good, it will improve further and the people of the state will benefit from it,” he added..

Former DGP AK Jain praised the Yogi government for implementing the police commissionerate system. He said that “we are moving towards smart policing and this is a good move for a change in policing beyond the scope of the Police Act, 1861,”

“Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has taken a strong political step. Over the decades, many governments have taken steps in this direction but had pulled back because of lobbying. This system will not only improve law and order but will also prevent crime against women, he added.

Former DGP Vikram Singh said that the implementation of the police commissionerate system in Lucknow and Noida was no less than a revolutionary step.

Congratulating Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for this, the former DGP said that the entire state and police department was very grateful to Yogiji for taking this initiative.

He said that after Independence, lots of efforts were made towards implementing the system. He said the Dharmveer Commission strongly recommended this in 1977 but it could not be done.

“This system is already running successfully in 71 districts in 15 states across the country but it had not been implemented in Uttar Pradesh for some reasons. The present government has implemented it with its strong will,” he said.

Former DG KL Gupta called this decision a bold step of the state government.

He thanked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and said that this issue was pending since 1977 and had been implemented by the UP government today.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/present--former-dgps-welcome-police--commissionerate-system-in-lko--noida.html

5,14-1-20,Govt proposes to rename Ghaghara in UP as Saryu,"Extending the religious status of the river Saryu, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to rename the river Ghaghara from Gonda to Rewalganj border of adjoining state of Bihar as ‘Saryu’.

The UP cabinet which met here on Monday gave it approval to change the name of Ghaghara from village Chandapur Kitauli in Gonda to Rewalganj bordering Bihar as Saryu.

The government spokesman said that as rivers were national property, changing name of any river required the permission of Central government.

“The cabinet approval will be sent to the Centre for its assent,” the spokesman said.

In another decision, the government has decided to demolish 63 buildings of police department, including residential houses, barracks, hospital colony and dilapidated administrative offices. As these buildings are not required by other government departments and are not of use for private companies, it has been decided to demolish them.

The PWD has been made the nodal agency for the demolition work and has been asked to deposit Rs 10 crore after deducting value of scrap of these buildings.

The government has also asked the UPSIDC to provide land free of cost to Dahi police station under Sadar Kotwali in Unnao district so that it could be upgraded to a modern police thana.

The spokesman said that the district magistrate of Unnao, in his letter dated August 10, 2019, had said that the land around Dahi police station that belonged to UPSIDC was enough to upgrade the Dahi police station to a modern police station.

Accepting the suggestion, the government has decided that the UPSIDC would give the land free of cost to police to upgrade Dahi police station in Unnao.

In a similar decision, the cabinet has approved government decision to give land of Bareilly Nagar Nigam and jail free of cost to Transport department for construction of a bus stand near mini bypass at Central Prison, Bareilly.

The cabinet has also approved proposal for widening of Sanauli-Nautanwa-Gorakhpur-Deoria-Ballia road on State Highway 1 at Gorakhpur.

6,14-1-20,UP starts process to identify refugees,"Uttar Pradesh, the first state to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 , has identified over 32,000 refugees in 21 districts of the state.

The process to identify refugees was initiated soon after the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill by both Houses of Parliament to prepare list of people eligible to get Indian citizenship under the new law.

The districts from where the first list has arrived included Sahranpur, Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Rampur, Pratapgarh, Pilibhit, Lucknow, Varnaasi, Bahraich, Lakhimpur, Rampur, Meerut, Agra.

The government has, however, not revealed what procedure was followed for the identification of the refugees eligible of citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act which came into force through a gazette notification on January 10.

The rules for implementation of the Act are yet to be framed.

“We are not hurrying through this. We have just about started the process. Once the Act has been notified, we need to get moving,” said Shrikant Sharma, UP minister and government spokesperson.

“This is an ongoing process, we will keep on updating the figures. All district magistrates have been asked to carry out surveys and keep on updating the list. We are in process of sharing this list with the Union Home Ministry also,” the minister added.

A chunk of those identified so far appear to be from Pilibhit, a district about close to Uttarakhand and India’s border with Nepal.

The district’s government official said that 37,000 refugees who came here from Bangladesh had been identified in the “initial survey” and the names had been sent to the state government.

Initial investigations have revealed that these people came to Pilibhit because of persecution in their countries. No explanation has been provided for the discrepancy in figures quoted by the state government and he district official.

Official sources said the refugees were happy that after decades the government had decided to adopt a favourable approach to their plight. It has generated a lot of hope among the people from Bangladesh.

Most of the refugees had fled Bangladesh in 1960s when it was East Pakistan. They had to shuttle between Maharashtra and West Bengal and were finally rehabilitated in Pilibhit in 1984.

Uttar Pradesh is one of the states that have seen the most violent protests over the new citizenship law. Last month, 21 people died in clashes between the police and protesters, while more than 300 policemen were injured. Union Home Minister Amit Shah has made it clear that the new citizenship law will not be rolled back.

The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, for the first time, introduces religion as a criterion for granting citizenship. Under it, only the persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, namely Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Pasris and Christians from these countries qualify for Indian citizenship.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-starts-process-to--identify-refugees.html
7,14-1-20,Solve a contentious issue,"The unabsorbed input tax credit dilemma in the Goods and Services Tax is something that the Council needs to address urgently

In the backdrop of the collection under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) not coming up to the expected level and the consequential inability of the Central Government to meet its obligations towards compensation to the States as committed under the GST Compensation Act, 2017 (it provides for compensation for five years i.e. till 2021-22 to be calculated as the difference between actual collection and the revenue it would have got with growth at four per cent over the 2015-16 level), the GST Council is undertaking a comprehensive review of the existing rate structure and the implementation mechanism.

Meanwhile, a contentious issue that mandarins in the GST Council will need to urgently look at relates to the treatment of the accumulated input tax credit which does not get automatically set off against output tax liability. At the core of the GST architecture is a feature that allows a producer/supplier to claim credit for the tax paid on inputs across the value chain. This helps in eliminating the cascading effect of tax-on-tax, thereby reducing the cost of products to the consumer (the erstwhile dispensation of central excise, value added tax [VAT] and a host of local duties that were afflicted by the cascading effect).

An anomalous situation may arise if the producer/supplier does not have corresponding output tax liability to provide for setting off accumulated credit on input purchase. Indeed, this anomalous situation is currently faced by telecom companies. They have made heavy investment in augmenting the infrastructure (needed to provide speed and quality services) even as there has been a steep drop in their revenue; courtesy tariff plummeting to record lows due to the intense competition after the entry of Reliance Jio in 2016.

This increased accumulated credit on their input purchases and reduced their GST payments to the Government (primarily due to low tariff/sale price), thereby reducing and eliminating the potential for automatic offsetting of dues. They are unable to claim refund of the taxes paid on inputs as the GST law mandates corresponding output tax liability which is insufficient. The unabsorbed input tax credit works out to a whopping `36,000 crore. The situation in fertilisers is broadly similar. Given the critical role of fertilisers in ensuring food security, the Government controls their maximum retail price (MRP) at a low level, unrelated to the cost of production and distribution and reimburses the excess as subsidy to the manufacturers. In case of urea, the MRP is 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the cost whereas in the case of non-urea fertilisers, the price is 70 per cent to 75 per cent. The balance amount is given to farmers as subsidy.

Coming to the tax structure, fertilisers attract five per cent GST, even as the tax on raw materials and intermediates used in their manufacture is much higher. Natural gas (it accounts for about 90 per cent of urea production) is at present “zero rated” under GST implying that it continues to attract excise duty (ED) and VAT as in the past. Even as ED on gas is “nil”, VAT varies from State to State with a low five per cent in Rajasthan and 21 per cent in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, some States impose local levies. For example, the “purchase tax” in Gujarat applies to that portion of inputs used for making urea that is sold outside the State. Nearly, one-third of gas consumption by fertiliser plants is imported as LNG (liquefied natural gas) attracts customs duty (CD) at 2.5 per cent. Imports of ammonia, phosphoric acid and sulphur — raw materials and intermediates used in manufacture of non-urea or phosphate and potash fertilisers — attract CD at five per cent (on rock phosphate, it is 2.5 per cent). On the other hand, ammonia and phosphoric acid attract GST at 18 per cent and 12 per cent respectively (initially, GST on phosphoric acid was 18 per cent but was brought down to 12 per cent in January 2018).

The process of fertiliser manufacture is power-intensive. Electricity generation and distribution is also excluded from the ambit of the GST. However, it is exempt from levy of Central VAT (CENVAT) and VAT. Further, under the Constitution, entry 53 in the State list of the Seventh Schedule empowers States to impose tax (or electricity duty) on sale and consumption of electricity, except when consumed by the Union Government or the Railways.

Let us now look at the implications of the above tax structure for input tax credit. First, gas being virtually outside GST, gas companies viz. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India Limited (OIL) and so on, can’t claim credit for the taxes paid on their purchase of inputs, consumables and equipment leading to higher price. The price of gas to fertiliser producers (delivered at factory gate) further increases due to VAT (which in some states such as UP is 21 per cent) besides a host of local levies wherever applicable.

In case of electricity — it being outside GST and exempt from levy of CENVAT and VAT — this results in a situation whereby power companies don’t get any credit for taxes paid on inputs viz. equipment, stores and so on, used in its generation and distribution. This results in higher cost of electricity, that is further exacerbated by electricity duty imposed by States for which no offset is available. We thus have an anomalous situation, whereby on one hand taxes paid on inputs (primarily gas and electricity) used in the manufacture of urea are high with a built-in cascading effect. On the other hand, the tax liability on the output (urea) is low not just because of much lower GST at five per cent but also due to lower MRP. Likewise, tax paid on raw materials and intermediates (mainly ammonia and phosphoric acid) used in the making of non-urea fertilisers is high even as tax on output is low for the same reason. This inevitably results in unabsorbed input tax credit as output tax falls far short of input tax.

Considering the adverse effect of reimbursing the unabsorbed input tax credit on tax collection, particularly at the current juncture when the exchequer is facing a huge shortfall, the Government may not be inclined to sanction it (in case of telecom service providers) or delay as for fertiliser manufacturers. But, the adverse impact of rejection/delayed release on service providers/manufacturers can’t be brushed aside either. What then is the way forward?

Ideally, the Government should maintain tax on the final product at the same rate (or higher) than the rate on raw materials/intermediates so that there is sufficient tax liability on the former to enable automatic neutralisation of the tax paid on the latter.

Accordingly, it should levy GST on gas (by removing the current zero rate status) and bring electricity under GST and tax both at five per cent, i.e. the same as on fertilisers. GST on ammonia and phosphoric acid should also be brought down from the existing 18 per cent and 12 per cent respectively to five per cent on each. While making these changes may take some time (particularly in view of resistance from States), in the meanwhile, the Government should take steps to promptly release pending un-availed input tax credit to fertiliser manufacturers. The position in case of telecom service providers, however, is different.

Here, the output tax liability is insufficient to fully offset the input tax mainly because of the rock bottom tariff due to “unhealthy” and “destructive” competition (this was not mandated under any law or Government regulation) unlike fertilisers where as matter of conscious policy, the selling price is controlled at a low level to make them affordable to farmers. Nevertheless, it can’t be denied that service providers have incurred excess input tax credit and not refunding the same will go against the very spirit of GST.

The pending excess input tax credit of `36,000 crore may be refunded to the telecom service providers. With tariff being increased by all service providers and even the sector regulator Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) contemplating a floor tariff (to bring a semblance of discipline to the market) hopefully, such a situation may not unfold in the future.

In fertilisers with the changes in tax structure — as proposed — and move towards direct benefit transfer (DBT) of fertiliser subsidy which will lift the MRP, the output tax liability will be in sync with tax paid on inputs.

Notwithstanding the above, situations of mismatch can’t entirely be ruled out. To address these, the Government should consider amending GST law to allow refund of excess input tax credit and eventually match the output tax liability. Meanwhile, it should intensify efforts (including use of data analytics) to identify and crack down on fake claims of input tax credit to shore up its revenue.

8,14-1-20,The loss of leadership,"It is unfortunate that in their greed for money and power, leaders have forgotten the values as preached by our forefathers. Roots of social cohesion and religious amity have been weakened

Independent India’s first few years saw a unique kinship among political leaders and the people. The former had an aura of sacrifice behind them. This is why people adored them and had high expectations from them. Mahatma Gandhi was the cult figure, who was remembered with respect and affection in every home. In schools and colleges, young people animatedly talked about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Khudiram Bose, Veer Savarkar, Jayaprakash Narayan, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel among others. Even in remote villages and towns, people were aware of the Azad Hind Fauj and were convinced that Netaji would return.

One could say it from personal experience that in spite of the tragic Partition, life had returned to normalcy in the villages of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as also elsewhere. There were no visible traces of Hindu-Muslim discord and children witnessed bonhomie in social, religious and cultural events as they grew up in a multi-religious society. They were learning to live together naturally, not under any planned initiative or project. Isolated instances of communal skirmishes were there but they did not impact the thread of social cohesion as people trusted and had faith in the leadership of the day.

However, gradually, things began to change. Those who tasted power and perks that also came associated with pelf, began to shed the values the Mahatma had persistently preached. They started ignoring his great words: “My Life is My Message.” Social scientists and other learned scholars had their own interpretations about the change that began with the infusion of debilitating elements inherent in democratic procedures, practices and parties. Gradually, people realised the fallacy of the promises made by leaders. They also began to comprehend the machinations involved to garner votes on the basis of caste, creed, religion and other such factors that would create divisions among them. Social equations and equanimity began to change and that, too, swiftly. Worse, it deliberately created distrust among communities.

The new generation of leaders that gradually emerged a couple of decades after independence realised how lucrative it could be to be at the seat of power through politics and elections. Hence, they decided to focus on winning polls. Icons of the freedom struggle were no more; secularism was swiftly being converted into a mighty political weapon; and no wily politician was concerned about how disastrous even a small dent in social cohesion and religious amity could indeed be. They ignored the possible damage to the hallowed tradition of equal respect for all religions that was in practice for ages and for which the country was admired globally.

Such developments were not unexpected. The rise of caste-based parties contributed significantly to the erosion of pre-independent values that had the strength to sustain social and religious cohesion. Gandhi was indeed prophetic when he mentioned in a letter written in April 1922 that Swaraj or self-rule would not bring happiness to our people as four things would weigh heavily on them and they would begin to say that the earlier (colonial) system was better. The four things included defects in the election system, injustice, administrative burden and treachery of the rich.

Today, systematic defects in the way elections are conducted appear to be beyond control. For all that matters is money and nothing else. News reports in the last week of May 2019 that out of 539 winning Lok Sabha MPs, 233 had declared criminal cases against them did not surprise anybody. The way elections are won at every level has led to serious aberrations in the way public affairs in our country is conducted. It would be rare exception if someone with a pure record of selfless service wins a panchayat-level election. Social kinship stands shattered because elections are now being politicised.

Can anyone think of any election that has been fought and won within the limits on candidate expenditure as set by the Election Commission of India? So, now our leaders need money and more of it to be and remain in politics. A ray of hope did appear under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan during the 1977 elections when several candidates won without any resource, purely on the basis of their clean image and contributions made to the public. But all of it disappeared after 1980.

People have witnessed not only the rise of caste-based parties but more than that, they have seen how assets of some leaders have galloped at an unprecedented pace within years. Obviously, in such a scenario, there is little space for value-based politics. And when there are no compunctions about values and principles, why care about means? Gandhian values in politics were slowly and silently erased by those who inherited power. Loudly and unashamedly, they declared themselves as the only political heirs of the Mahatma. People trusted them and this continued for decades.

To ensure “permanency” in power, they quietly created a minority (read Muslim) vote-bank, gave them false assurances and convinced them that everyone else was against them. They gave their own interpretation of secularism, divided Hindus and Muslims up to the level of village panchayats unhesitatingly and during election time, gave tickets to candidates based purely on caste and communal considerations. It did not matter if the aspirant was suitable, meritorious or deserving. Did he really serve the people with honesty, sincerity and commitment? Leaders even preferred bahubalis (strongmen) without winking an eyelid.

The imposition of the Emergency in June 1975 and its continuance till March 1977 made the people realise how they were being taken for a ride by those very people they had trusted. By this time, the roots of social cohesion and religious amity were considerably weakened.

Consequently, the trust between two major communities came under serious stress. For electoral gains, the history of India, including the freedom struggle, was politicised. The writing of history textbooks and research was totally entrusted to the Leftists, who are known for their dislike for all that was Indian. The great Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was built in a closed citadel of Left hegemony. It even refused entry to all “those who did not think alike” in their campus. Had that not been the case, today’s outburst would not have happened.

What we are witnessing today is the culmination of deliberate politicisation of age-old Indian traditions of acceptance of diversity, which have a deep philosophical basis. This is the only prophetic vision that can save the very existence of planet Earth. Think of the turmoil being faced in Europe in the wake of rapid demographic, social and cultural changes taking place there whether the Europeans like it or not. Why should it not be appreciated that it was the impact of ancient Indian culture that while Hindus paid jazia to their rulers, they never disrespected the religious places of Muslims.

Even after Partition, India could have restored its age-old religious amity had our leaders shown maturity, futuristic vision and the urgency to bring both communities together. This was the core requirement for marching ahead on the path of growth, progress and development as Jayaprakash Narayan realised. For him, everyone was acceptable if willing to come together for the nation’s cause. The merger of the then Jan Sangh in the Janata Party was the culmination of the efforts of a great visionary, who thought only of India, the welfare of its people and their future.

The violence that has occurred in a couple of universities and some other places must not be viewed in isolation. In fact, it must be seen in context with the seeds that have been sown in post-independent India by vested interests and those for whom self-interest is the only interest. Their numbers are few but institutions are invariably taken to ransom by elements who have no academic interest and are prone to prodding from unethical and anti-social elements. For those who are interested in finding solutions, one would like to submit the following from a letter Albert Einstein wrote to Gandhi and which was quoted by APJ Abdul Kalam in one his books: “You have shown through your works that it is possible to succeed without violence even with those who have not discarded the method of violence.” Was JNU not expected to strengthen this philosophy? It’s depressing that JNU, with all of its much-publicised achievements, never seriously tried to listen to those who did not think alike. It has an obligation to the nation to encourage, nourish and nurture the great dialogical tradition of the country. It must become a place of intellectual interaction. India needs leadership institutions that promote social cohesion and religious amity.

9,14-1-20,"Shift to EVs, E2Ws is inevitable","But it must be done gradually by giving the industry time to develop competitive products and the country to set up charging infrastructure

A vast majority of Indians depend on two-wheelers to fulfil their mobility needs. As per the 2011 census, 37 per cent people in India using motorised modes to commute to work relied on two-wheelers compared to 33 per cent for buses and eight per cent for private cars. These numbers on use of two-wheelers would have gone up by now, given that their sales have been going through the roof. In 2017, India became the largest two-wheeler market, leaving behind China and in 2018-19 a whopping 21.1 million items were sold in the country, constituting 80 per cent of total domestic automobile sales. The Government has been encouraging the adoption of Electric Vehicle (EV) technology; and the Budget also announced a bouquet of incentives for them. The NITI Aayog proposed a ban on internal combustion engine (ICE)-powered two-wheelers (below 150cc) and three-wheelers by 2023-24. While a shift towards cleaner technology is inevitable, the key to transitioning to EVs will be to develop a plan palatable to consumers, industry and policymakers alike.

The current electric two-wheeler (E2W) users are technology and environment enthusiasts who use them for leisure. However, ICE two-wheeler use is associated with low and middle-income individuals. ICE technology-users point to the lack of charging infrastructure, high battery cost and unreliable battery life for not opting for E2Ws. Currently, the base price differential of ICE two-wheelers and similar-performing E2Ws is almost three times. Despite current policy incentives that help in reducing this gap to two or 1.5 times, this is still a barrier for E2W uptake. Analysis shows that home and work charging will remain the most popular modes of recharging E2Ws. Public charging stations are a feasible option for personal use, while battery-swapping stations are expected to find adoption only for high utilisation commercial applications. While the impact of EVs on power demand may not be substantial, managing peak hour loads will be critical to support their use.

As the upfront cost of E2Ws remains prohibitive, the opportunity lies in the fact that their operational cost is nominal. In fact, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for some high vehicle utilisation applications like parcel/food deliveries is lower than ICE two-wheelers from the start. Easy financing options with low down payment can easily accelerate the adoption of E2Ws for commercial applications. For personal use, high upfront cost and battery replacement make the E2Ws financially unattractive. However, attractive business models or financing options covering both battery replacement and upfront cost can make E2Ws attractive for personal use too.

Lack of high-performance EVs is a key challenge. One of the few EV products that can compete with Honda Activa is the Ather 450, available only in Bengaluru and Chennai. Currently, Ather Energy has an installed capacity of 20,000-25,000 units but this is expected to expand to 500,000 units by 2020. Even then, it will form a small proportion of the 20 million-plus two-wheeler market. The technology adoption curve shows that typically technology mainstreaming follows an S-shaped trajectory with adoption growing faster over time. Also, the time taken for mainstreaming and mass adoption of technologies has been shrinking over time. While it took around 35 years for refrigerators to become mainstream, cell phones took just 15 years. EV penetration in India lies where cellphone adoption was in 1995 and it might easily take another decade for EVs to go mainstream.

Given the existing financial viability, E2Ws should be promoted for high-utilisation commercial applications through easy financing with low down payment requirement. As financial viability is established for commercial operations, the Government should issue E2Ws procurement mandates for commercial operations later. India would be shifting to BSVI vehicles from 2020. Automobile-makers, auto-part makers and oil refineries have made huge investments for this transition. A time period of three-four years should be provided to them to recover investments through the sale of BSVI vehicles. Majority of the announced and existing E2Ws models in India can compete with vehicles in less than the 125cc segment only, whereas the customers are more inclined towards the 125-250cc segment in motorcycles. More time will also allow two-wheeler manufacturers to develop competitive products, expand E2W production and allow time for supply chains to evolve to support after sales service and skeletal public charging infrastructure. Cities should take strong action to encourage the use of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) and location-specific mandates should be developed. During this time, India should push for 100 per cent E2Ws adoption for commercial applications and for personal use. Eventually, highly-competitive E2Ws would be available in the domestic market and there will be a disruptive adoption of this technology. Transitioning to EVs is inevitable but it must be done gradually by giving the industry time to develop competitive products and the country to set up charging infrastructure, EV supply chains and business models.

10,14-1-20,"Cong bungles, again","Miffed allies and federal parties stay away from its meet on CAA-NRC, unwilling to yield the Opposition space

The Congress, for some reason, continues to lull itself into an arrogant assumption of its natural leadership of the Opposition, expecting all federal parties to unify under the notional idea of its national role and identity. Perhaps, it is still at pains to reconcile with the fact that its State allies are shoring up its prospects or that its talk points are being gifted by them. Or after the failure of the mahagathbandhan, a grand umbrella of regional parties, at the Lok Sabha polls last year — which it torpedoed wilfully since it didn’t get the vote of leadership — it feels it alone is qualified to be the face of Opposition unity. Yet if widespread and continued protests over the contentious citizenship law and a proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) are any indication, then students and civil society have clearly filled up the vacuum left by the Opposition. And now that dots of agitations have assumed a pan-India momentum, the Congress has rushed in, knowing full well that the movement can never be of consequence till it gets political sanctity. Problem is the champions of the movement would rather continue leaderless than trust the Congress, which is still looking to reap the benefit of the groundwork done by others. So an all-Opposition front meeting on CAA-NRC called by it ended in a whimper, far from the show of strength it had intended it to be. And this failure of the Congress to downsize its ego and wisen up, despite the circumstances that are actually most favourable to the Opposition now, will only end up helping the ruling BJP during the Budget session of Parliament. For the BJP had certainly not bargained for such a hitback to its policies within six months of winning a mammoth verdict. The Congress grandstanding fizzled out as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi and even its allies in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, the DMK and Shiv Sena, stayed away from the meeting. Clearly, the State leaders have still not forgiven the Congress for not making common cause with them during the Lok Sabha elections last year. And are now best placed to chew it up rather than let the party chew on them. Besides, they have realised that in the absence of a monolithic leader from their midst, it would be better for them to reclaim their States, consolidate their hold on them and unitedly voice their stand against the BJP at the Centre. That would be far better than chasing national ambitions.

This is particularly true of Banerjee, who has burnt her fingers as an architect of the mahagathbandhan and loosened her grip over her State as she pursued national ambitions. She is hell bent on steadying her own ship. Besides, she has been among the first Opposition Chief Ministers to lead a crusade against the Government’s policies and expose the regime’s exclusionary intent regarding Muslims by linking the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with the NRC. She doesn’t want her cause hijacked yet again. Besides, she has to justify her politics at the State level, which she has built in opposition to both the Left and the Congress and, therefore, cannot afford any hypocrisy. It is the same reason why AAP is staying away as it has to fight both the BJP and Congress in the Assembly elections. It is maintaining an equidistance and pitching its own performance record of integrity as a believable counterpoint. And that strategy seems to be working as three Congress leaders joined it over the last few days. DMK chief MK Stalin and the Shiv Sena, like Mamata, want their undiluted take on CAA to be heard. The BSP, upset by the Congress poaching its MLAs in Rajasthan, isn’t keen to be part of a need-based arrangement with the national party either. So it is rather naive of the Congress to bet on its traditional style of politics. Besides, the party leadership was tepid and cautious when the first wave of protests broke out, with Rahul Gandhi in hibernation. Priyanka Gandhi was the only one consistent about siding with the cause, but that had more to do with nursing the party back to health in Uttar Pradesh than scripting an Opposition strategy. However, India’s youth have birthed new leaders and do not need to rely on the “youthful” face of the Congress leadership, which has sadly been reduced to an apparition that tries to be conscientious. If the Congress wants to avoid further misadventures, it should take a risk with a new strategy, issues and leadership.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cong-bungles--again-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/cong-bungles--again.html
11,14-1-20,DGP OP Singh may get 3-mth extension,"After making a rare achievement of facilitating police commissionerate system in Uttar Pradesh, Director General of Police OP Singh, who is set to retire this month, is likely to get a reward from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the form of three months’ extension.

Sources said that though the hunt for the top UP cop had started, but the state government surprised everyone when it sent a file to the Department of Personal and Training under Union Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi, recommending a three-month extension to DGP OP Singh.

Senior officers were not ready to speak on the issue.

Singh, is set to retire on January 31.

Earlier, sources had said that OP Singh, an IPS officer of 1983 batch, was going to complete two-year tenure on coming January 23 just before his retirement and was likely to be appointed as new chief information commissioner of the State.

12,14-1-20,Chandigarh BJP to get new president on Jan 17,"The Chandigarh Bharatiya Janta Party is all set to get its new president on January 17.

The current president Sanjay Tandon’s loyalist Arun Sood, a BJP councilor and former mayor has emerged as the front runner to succeed him.

The longest serving Chandigarh BJP’s president, Tandon has remained on the post since president January 18, 2010. His first term was from January 18, 2010 till January 15, 2013.

Tandon’s term was later extended to 2016 which was his second term as the president. His term was extended for the third time in 2016 in view of Municipal Corporation elections during that year.

Sources said that four party leaders namely Arun Sood, Ramveer Bhatti, Davesh Moudgil and Satinder Singh have been shortlisted for the past after former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held meetings with core committee members, former party presidents and other senior leaders here in December.

The BJP national leadership is likely to declare the name of new president in a couple of days.

Following this, the party would be focusing on having a consensus on the declared candidate.

The declared candidate will file nomination papers for his unanimous election, sources said.

Councillor Arun Sood remains the frontrunner for the top post as he enjoys support of both Sanjay Tandon and city MP Kirron Kher. On the other hand, ex-MP and senior BJP leader Satya Pal Jain had recommended former mayor’s Davesh Moudgil’s name.

Ramveer Bhatti is stated to have backing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh while Satinder Singh’s name is again suggested by MP Kirron Kher.

The new president will be facing a major challenge to keep the party united and end the factionalism.

While Sanjay Tandon’s tenure as BJP city president has remained successful with two consecutive victories in Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019 and victory in civic body polls held in the year 2016, the party state unit remained in the limelight for factionalism.

The party city unit is mainly divided in two camps with each headed by Sanjay Tandon and MP Kirron Kher.

Infact, during Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year, differences between the two camps were visible. As Tandon was also in the race to get party’s ticket, the Central leadership had to delay the announcement of the candidate’s name to prevent a possible rebellion in the party.

Recently, the infighting and rebellion by ruling party councilors had also raised concerns among the party leaders for the January 10 mayoral polls. While the BJP managed to win all three posts including mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor this time with two-third majority, the previous mayoral polls had brought forth the infighting in the party city unit.

Last year, the then BJP councillor, Satish Kainth, had rebelled against the party and fought against the BJP’s official nominee, Rajesh Kalia.

In 2018, the then outgoing mayor Asha Jaswal rebelled against BJP candidate Davesh Moudgil, although she later withdrew her nomination.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chandigarh-bjp-to-get-new-president-on-jan-17.html

A stretch of 50 km of the Mahanadi was covered by 12 census units comprising over 60 volunteers for counting of water-birds. The teams surveyed the Mahanadi and as well as wetlands and water-bodies located on both sides of its bank and counted the birds in a synchronized manner.

Well-known wildlife conservationists Nanda Kishore Bhujabal, retired Conservator Suresh Kumar Mishra, 'Wild Orissa' joint secretary Sudhanwa Dash along with other members from 'Wild Orissa', Kalinga Birds, Mahavir Pakshi Surakshya Samiti, research scholars and students from North Odisha Unversity, Utkal University, Berhampur University, OUAT, Centurion University, BJB College, BK Arts College, Ravenshaw University, Rotary Club New Horizon Bhubaneswar were part of the enumeration drive. The census was coordinated by Wild Orissa, Bhubaneswar Chapater governor Suchitra Sahoo.

The 2020 water-bird Census figure of 28,569 is recorded as the highest number compared to counts in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The figure of species (71) is also the highest as last highest number of 58 species had been found rin 2018.

The census preliminary findings revealed that the Mahanadi River ecosystem is extremely rich in avi-faunal diversity and needs to be protected under appropriate legal regime of the country. During the census, many rare and endangered bird species like Black Bellied Tern, Oriental Darter, Great Thick Knee, River Lapwing and River Tern were marked.

17,14-1-20,Adityapur Industrial Area faces labour crisis,"Asia’s leading industrial hub at Adituapur is facing shortage of the workers owing to the Tusu and Makar Sankranti festival. About 80 per cent of the workforce in the industrial area is on leave for celebrating the State’s most popular festival.

“It is similar situation like every year during the time of tribal festival. We are facing shortage of workers due to which production has been hit. Even fiscal incentives to check the workforce deficit won’t matter as the workers so dedicated towards their festival,” said a young entrepreneur.

According to industry sources, for atleast one week from today the production in small and medium enterprises will come down to 30 per cent, as most of the labourers went on leave to their native places for celebrating Tusu ( a harvest festival) and Makar Sankranti ( which falls on January 15).

A section of industrialists had even offered incentives to workers to draw them to work . "" We are facing tough times these days.

We have launched special incentives to retain the workers during the festival. Even then production gets hampered as there are very few who accepts the incentives,"" said Bikash Mukherjee, an industrialist and managing director of Auto Profile, an ancillary unit of Tata Motors.

Officials of Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA), a leading industry outfit of Kolhan region said that production loss during the festival is expected to be several crores.

"" Many small units would remain closed for the next 3-4 days while those units which are open will manage production with skeleton strength,"" said an official of ASIA.

Notably, the strength of workers in Adityapur industrial area will be around 30,000 including contractual labourers. The number of small, medium and large scale industries would be around 900.

The point is most of the workers are outsiders and during the festival season (Tusu) they visit their families and relatives and stay home for at least, five to seven days at stretch, added the industrialist representative.

He also said that it becomes difficult to make alternative arrangement for the short time. “There are few companies whose daily turnover is nearly rupees 10 crore so, one can understand the loss the companies in total make in Adityapur between January and February particularly,” remarked the industrialist.

It may be noted that the sprawling Adityapur Industrial Area houses 900 units- including 11 large-scale, 64 small scale and 166 tiny industries. A few important industries that has global presence are Usha Martin Group, RSB Group, Tata Steel Growth Shop(TGS) etc., too situated in this industrial belt, situated in Seraikela-Kharsawan.

The Meteorological department has predicted heavy snowfall in Shimla, Kullu, Kinnaur, Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba districts till Wednesday.

Shimla and its nearby tourist spots such as Kufri, Fagu and Narkanda, which are still marooned with last week's snow cover, are likely to get more snow, Met officials said

Manali and its uphill Solang ski slopes and Kalpa, 250 km from the state capital, saw fresh spells of snowfall in the past 24 hours. The higher reaches have been experiencing moderate to heavy snowfall since Sunday, while mid and lower hills recieved rainfall.

Meanwhile, a Himachal Police advisory has asked tourists to keep track of weather alerts when in the state. In a Facebook post, Shimla police stated that the MeT department has issued orange warning for January 13 and yellow warning for January 16 of heavy rain and snow

Kullu police also advised local residents and tourists to not travel up to the higher reaches and snowbound areas of the district.

Kullu Superintendent of Police Gaurav Singh said the Shimla Meteorological Centre forecasts heavy rain and snowfall in the district from January 12 to 19. He added that people should avoid travelling to the higher reaches as it might prove fatal.

In posts on Facebook and Twitter, Kullu police has asked people to call 1077, a toll free number in case of any emergency.

According to data provided by an official of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), 455 roads including 317 in Shimla zone are still blocked due to snow. Around 409 machines, including 362 earth movers, 16 excavators and 31 dump trucks were working to clear the snow off the roads, the official added.

Newly appointed State president Nafe Singh Rathi addressed the party workers and said that the State Chief Minister had said in the Assembly that Haryana would soon be made free from illegal drugs, but it is unfortunate that while Punjab's name used to come first in the case of intoxication, now Haryana has moved two steps ahead.

Moreover, the Chief Minister and his home minister Anil K Vij have been deliberately making contradictory statements on their department so that public attention can be diverted from all the problems of the state including de-addiction and paddy scams.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/inld-lashes-out-at-bjp-jjp-govt-for-not-fulfilling-promises.html

28,14-1-20,The way forward,"Before we delve into the strategy particulars for Jharkhand, let us examine a general definition of strategy given by Quinn :

“A strategy is a pattern or plan that integrates an organization’s major goals, policies and action sequences into a cohesive whole. A well-formulated strategy helps marshal and allocates an organization’s resources into a unique and viable posture based on its relative internal competencies and shortcomings, anticipated changes in the environment, and contingent moves by intelligent opponents.”

If we discount the aspect relating to ‘contingent moves by intelligent opponents’ since the definition was written in reference to a competitive business environment, Jharkhand can learn a few important points from this:

Declaring of major goals and sustainable policies to achieve those goals

Integration of major goals and policies

Unique strategy formulation for Jharkhand keeping in view its inherent strengths ? Defining the internal competencies and shortcomings

Environmental assessment and its impact on the plan and policies

Recommended Strategy for Jharkhand decision makers

In view of the above the following factors should be accorded importance while deciding the strategy mix for Jharkhand:

Long-Range/Perspective Plan – The State should work upon a Long Range / Perspective Plan along with road map for at least ten years. If the State has to leap-frog from its present state to the desired state, the same cannot be possible without meticulous planning.

This planning should not be a political agenda or manifesto but rather a blue-print for the States’ progress on a firm footing. It should be prepared by a select group of competent bureaucrats, economists, academicians and practicing managers from leading business houses.

The plan should be a comprehensive growth plan with specific mention of the basic growth items to cater to the continuously burgeoning population such as drinking water, 24 x 7 electricity provision, housing, sewerage and drainage system, parks, municipal amenities, public toilets, garbage removal and disposal system, primary health and sanitation, town hall, library etc.

Health & Sanitation – Jharkhand lacks miserably in health and sanitation facilities. There has to be a proper focus on medical facilities, basic health-care and Amritanshu Prasad Page 2 of 4 sanitation. It also lacks super-specialty facilities and many patients have to travel to other locations for treatment.

Jharkhand has to make all efforts to improve doctor to population ratio and get good specialists/ surgeons and give a fillip to medical facilities, health and sanitation in the State. Introduction of people-friendly systems and institutions are required to let the medical benefits percolate to the needy masses.

Education & Learning – Jharkhand has some leading institutes in the country for primary and higher education area. There are some distinguished schools, Technical Institutes and IIM identified as Centres of Excellence.

To cater to the education needs of the brilliant children of the State there is ample scope for proliferation of such Centres of excellence.

The gap between demand and supply is huge making the children opt for other states for technical or professional education. Such potential can be tapped in Jharkhand to a large extent. Besides this, the basic and primary education also needs a boost. The main issue, however, is providing education for the poor, illiterate masses, ensuring the three Rs (Reading, Writing and Arithmetic) for the people who never had access to this and teaching the girl child. This is a major challenge.

Infrastructure strategy - The State should invest on providing best possible infrastructure of roads, bridges, energy generation, transmission and distribution, civic amenities, water, housing, canals & waterways, public buildings, tourism infrastructure.

Infrastructure is the first aspect that catches the eye. Good road & railway network and air connectivity go a long way in improving the accessibility, image and economy of a place.

Exploitation of mineral wealth – Jharkhand is the mineral destination having nearly 40% of the country’s mineral wealth. Hence, all efforts should be made to make proper utilization and exploitation of minerals like coal, iron-ore, copper, bauxite, uranium, kyanite, mica, etc. Govt. bodies like Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation (JSMDC) who have good mines including those of ironore and coal have ample scope to generate revenue for the State by opting for joint-ventures with the private sector and expert Mines Developers to exploit the mineral reserves for the benefit of the State.

Despite coal and other mineral deposits in abundance, there has not been a push to extract and utilize the minerals. New thinking should go in this area for the development of the State.

Metal based industry- Considerable scope exists in Jharkhand to start new metal based industry or expand the already existing ones. The incentive schemes of the State government need to be relooked and implemented vigorously to instil confidence in the industry.

Many industries which were closed should be restarted for increasing employment in the State.

Water and Environment Management – Jharkhand receives an annual rainfall of about 1400 mm which can fulfil the needs of the State if the same is properly harnessed, stored and distributed.

Water is an area of concern since the hilly Amritanshu Prasad Page 3 of 4 terrain of Chhotanagpur plateau makes a large part of the rain evacuate quickly into the Bay of Bengal leaving irrigation potential unexplored in the absence of adequate water harnessing structures, dams and canals. Conservation of ground water has to be taken up in a big way. Aggressive and properly planned management of water resources and water harvesting is required for providing water and arresting depletion of water table in the State.

Along with this strict Forest Conservation must be implemented so that the environment is not endangered with the increased accent on growth and industrialisation.

Employment generation and skill–development - The need to develop skills has already been recognized by the Government of India. Skill development has been identified as a focus area by the Govt. of India.

Jharkhand should capitalize on this opportunity and must work on employment generation in the traditional areas as well new technology areas. Considerable training is to be provided for the new industries being set-up in the State.

Storage and marketing of local produce – Fruits and vegetables are grown in abundance in Jharkhand but in absence of proper cold-storage facilities, the shelf life being limited, many of the perishable items do not see the light of day. The farmers are unable to find a buyer or tap the opportunities that exist in the metro cities where people are prepared to spend lavishly to consume such high-quality variety of fruits and vegetables. Pisci-culture (fishery) has been a success in Jharkhand. The same needs to be stepped up with cold storage and transportation improvement.

Tourism Industry – Jharkhand has tremendous potential in the tourism sector but has not tapped this potential adequately.

It has a host of scenic spots, religious destinations, healthy resorts, lakes, ancient temples, wild-life, water-falls which are popular tourist attractions. Providing safe and comfortable tourist destinations with good transportation, food and beverage facilities will boost the tourism industry manifold and generate employment and income.

The top priorities for the government should be education, health, irrigation & agriculture, infrastructure development, reviving mining and manufacturing, providing social justice, preserving ecology and Jharkhand Culture and giving a fillip to services sector for maximum value creation.

Jharkhand is at cross-roads today having completed nearly nineteen years of existence and formation. It should bench-mark against Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand who have commenced their developmental journey simultaneously and have already made their mark. India Today magazine in its special issue did not rate Jharkhand very highly in the ranking of the Indian States.

To reverse this perception and enhance its image in consonance with the potential that it enjoys, Jharkhand decision makers need to think seriously for forging a single minded plan for the betterment of the State. It is time to embark upon a new well-considered and surefooted journey to vindicate the aspirations of the people of the State.

While the Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha-the youth wing of BJP organized a pro-CAA human chain from Kutchery Chowk to Albert Ekka roundabout, a social organisation organised a seminar at Xavier Institute of Social Service (XISS).

The BJYM human chain, which was organised from Kutchery Chowk to Albert Ekka was attended by senior BJP leaders including Ranchi MLA and former Minister CP Singh, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar, Hatia MLA Naveen Jaiswal, Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra, along with large number of BJP leaders including Aditya Sahu, Pratul Shahdeo, Subodh Singh Guddu among others.

On the occasion, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth said, “The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is to give citizenship to migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, but some political parties (Congress and Left) are creating confusion on CAA with an aim to divide the Country.” Seth claimed that Congress and Left parties are frustrated after the BJP Government successfully passed the Bill abrogating Article 370 from J&K, paving way for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya among others and so they have decided to oppose BJP on CAA.

Echoing the views of Seth, BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar said that in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan there is religious intolerance with minority population as they have to face threat from majority population.

Poddar said, “The minority population in these countries which comprise Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians are victim of forceful conversion, mass murder, rape and forceful occupying the properties of these minority population.

These minority populations are taking shelter in India as they are subjugated to various types of atrocities.”

Ranchi MLA and former minister CP Singh who too was present on the occasion said that Congress and Left parties always follow the policies of appeasement.

He said, “These parties are partners with Tukde Tukde gang that had raised slogans in support of Afzal Guru, but these parties should understand that the people of these country have understood their divisive politics.”

Singh claimed that JNU has become the hideout of anti-national forces as the historians from these countries have distorted the history giving much importance to Mughals.

Addressing people during human chain organiSed in support of the CAA, State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that some political parties that follow the policy of appeasement have tried to incite the feelings of minorities in the name of CAA, which is an issue of national interest and should not be viewed from a political perspective.

All State governments also have a Constitutional obligation to implement this. Shahdeo said, BJP will act to unleash the anti-national forces that are conspiring to incite people against the CAA.

Addressing the gathering of activists Dreze said that the CAA is an anti-national law. “The Central Government is not able to curb the rates of inflation, GDP is falling day by day, starvation and unemployment is at the peak but the Government is bringing such a law to disturb people. Due to such kinds of laws most of the population of this Country is angry and unrestrained. All the student organizations are saying that they are running non-cooperation movement across the Country,” he added.

“The fight is long, the battle is not going to stop and CAA along with NRC can’t be implemented. Our fight is not against the Government but we want to say the Constitution of India should not be tarnished. This is not the matter of Hindu or the Muslims but it is issue of entire society that the Central Government is trying to deviate people’s attention from burning issues like inflation and unemployment,” said Dreze.

Speaking on the occasion Students Federation of India Secretary, Mehul Kumar said that it is just beginning; a large number of people are joining the movement across the Country. “The protests have broken out across the Country. The Act seeks to amend the illegal immigration for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. It discriminates against Muslim and violates the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution,” he added.

Kumar further said that the basic structure of the Constitution cannot be reshaped by any Government and yet the Government maintains that it does not discriminate or violate the right to equality.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/social-activists-hold-meet-against-caa--nrc.html

45,14-1-20,"Govt will implement poll promises, says Rameshwar Oraon","Chief Minister Hemant Soren will complete his Cabinet expansion after January 15 as Chief Minister is in Delhi giving final touches to his Ministry.

Sources said that after the Cabinet expansion Soren Government in phasewise will go for implementing the poll promises of alliance partners. State Congress president and one of the Ministers in Soren Cabinet, Rameshwar Oraon said, “Congress believes in delivering its promises unlike the jumlebaz BJP. We will fullfil all promises that the party or alliance partners made in its manifesto.”

Oraon, a former IPS officer, claimed that starting with this the party will first increase the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of paddy. At present the MSP of paddy is Rs 1,850 per quintal, while the Congress and JMM in their manifesto had promised to increase the MSP upto Rs 2,500 per quintal. The Congress like Chhattisgarh Government had promised to increase the MSP upto Rs 2,500 per quintal, while the JMM had promised to increase the MSP from Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,700 per quintal.

Oraon said, “Apart from increasing the MSP the other concern for Government is that people are reluctant to sell their paddy in Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) due to lots of inconvenience at PACS. The Government will ensure that the farmers don’t face any type of difficulties while selling their produce in PACS.”

The Congress president also claimed that the Government is also studying the mechanism under which farmers’ loan will be waived. Waiving farmers loan was one the poll promises of both Congress and BJP.

Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi during his election campaign in Jharkhand had promised to waive farmers’ loan like the Chhattisgarh Government. The Bhupesh Bhagel Government in Chhattisgarh had waived small and medium loans of farmers.

Apart from increasing the MSP and waiving farmers loans, the other things which are in pipeline of Soren Government includes increasing reservation for Other Backward Caste (OBC) — numerically stronger in tribal State Jharkhand.

In election all major political parties from national to regional level have promised to increase OBC quota in their manifesto. The Congress had vowed to increase OBC reservation limit to 27 per cent from existing 14 per cent.The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), had pledged to provide 67 per cent reservation to STs, OBCs and SCs.

51,14-1-20,"‘Child marriage, teenage pregnancy huge barriers to youth empowerment’","On National Youth Day, a new report titled ‘The Situation of Adolescents in Jharkhand’ identified that child marriage and teenage pregnancy continue to be the two key challenges for unlocking the potential of the young population in Jharkhand.

Dasra Adolescents Collaborative conducted a survey of 15,963 adolescents and youth (10-21 age group) across Jharkhand to study growth areas of their lives including education, sexual and reproductive rights (SRHR) employability, media access and early marriage.

In a one-of-its-kind exercise to understand multidimensional challenges faced by adolescents in India the survey was conducted across 41,393 households in 325 villages and urban wards of Jharkhand.

Shailja Mehta, Associate Director, Dasra, said, “In NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2019, Jharkhand is in the aspirant State category which needs to accelerate their performance towards SDGs. Rapid progress on SDGs can be achieved by nurturing young population to their fullest potential.

The ‘The Situation of Adolescents in Jharkhand’ report recommends that the government and non-profit organisations need to focus on better implementation of the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) in the area of health, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan in the area of education, the National Skill Development Mission and Tejaswini programs in the area of skilling and employability, and, the SAG programme, the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan, and the community based activities of the RKSK in the areas of empowerment and building leadership.”

The report shows high prevalence of child marriage in Jharkhand where 4 per cent of girls aged 15-21 were married before the age of 15, and one third of those aged 18-21 were married before the age of 18 confirming the findings of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -4 .

The data also suggests that early marriage is resulting in early child birth. While hardly any (<1%) of the girls aged 15-21 had given birth before the age of 15, as many as 12 % of girls aged 18-21 had given birth in childhood (below the age of 18), and almost two in five (39%) of those aged 20-21 had given birth in adolescence (below the age of 20).

Lack of awareness of contraceptives and health matters is making adolescent girls more vulnerable to Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and teenage pregnancy.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---child-marriage--teenage-pregnancy-huge-barriers-to-youth-empowerment---.html

In the past, acid was sold without any restrictions in shops and no legal document or license was required for this. No information was collected about the person buying the acid.

This was one of the reasons why acid attacks were carried out in the past. Actor Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Ranaut suffered an acid attack in 2007 while studying in Dehradun.

Other women were also targeted in a similar way in other parts of the country. Considering this, the Supreme Court had issued an advisory and issued strict guidelines. According to the Supreme Court guidelines, a license was mandatory for those selling acid.

Further, the name of the person buying acid was to be entered in the register of the vendor along with a copy of the buyer’s photo identity card.

In this regard, Joshi received information that acid was being sold openly or without license at some places in the district in violation of the Supreme Court guidelines.

Taking serious cognisance of this, Joshi has ordered the in-charge of all police stations to explain clearly to all beat constables and Cheetah police and conduct raids in all possible sites where acid is being sold without observance of the Supreme Court guidelines.

The in-charge have been told to also visit sites in plain clothes and identify vendors violating the Apex court guidelines and selling acid without license. Strict action should be taken against such vendors, stressed the SSP.

In this regard, Joshi has directed that a proper campaign be undertaken in the district against sale of acid in violation of Supreme Court orders. All the police stations in-charge have also been ordered to submit a daily report of the action taken in this regard.

After the said campaign, if acid is being found sold openly in any area, the police station in-charge will be held responsible and strict action will be taken against him/her.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-to-campaign-against-unrestricted-sale-of-acid.html
77,14-1-20,MCD prepares for Swacchata Survekshan 2020 inspection,"A team from Central Government is likely to arrive in Dehradun on Tuesday for Swacchata Survekshan 2020. Considering this, the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) has deployed an increased number of sanitation workers and vehicles to pick up the garbage and transport it to make the city cleaner.

Recently, the MCD also stepped up the work of night sweeping and awareness programmes about the significance of sanitation. According to municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey, “The survey by the central team remains secretive and no officer meets anyone from municipal corporation.

They examine and analyse the cleanliness of the city. We have instructed sanitation inspectors and supervisors to pay special attention in their area.

Besides, more sanitation workers and vehicles have been deployed to step up the task of cleaning in the city. Sanitation workers are working in the night too.” As per the previous rankings of Swacchata Survekshan, Dehradun was ranked 267 in 2018 while the rank fell lower to 384 in 2019.

However, according to Mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama, “The ranking fell down in the past surveys because our Solid Waste Management Plant was not completely functional but the situation is different this time. Three hundred metric tonne garbage generated in the city is getting disposed of in the waste management plant situated in Sheeshambada.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-prepares-for-swacchata-survekshan-2020-inspection.html

79,14-1-20,Urja Ganga gas project hits hurdle in State,"Local resistance and bureaucratic indolence are stalling ambitious Urja Ganga project in Odisha.

With the GAIL India covering nearly 800 km in Odisha for laying gas pipeline, the State owned PSU has approached the Odisha Government to help out as it is facing hurdles in implementing the massive project.

Resistance from the local people in Sundargarh and Jharsuguda is delaying the project though they have accepted payments from the authorities.

The resistance of the villagers in Chendipada tehsil of Angul district has resulted stoppage of work, though route has been changed, said sources.

While for private land, hurdles are posed by local people, unauthorized occupation of Government land is also an obstacle for the project, said officials.

Though permission for laying pipelines on Government land was applied in 2017, permissions were not given by the district authorities, alleged officials.

Bureaucratic indolence was, therefore, posing hurdles in this regard and project implementation was delayed.

The GAIL is implementing ‘Urja Ganga’ project, which is a major gas pipeline project covering more than 770 km in the State in 13 districts. The Maharatna company of the Government of India is laying gas pipeline infrastructure of Jagadishpur-Haldia-Bokaro-Dhamra Project and implementing City Gas Distribution Network in twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.

From Dhamra to Angul, it is covering 401 km and from Bokaro to Angul, 367 km is being covered by GAIL.

The districts of Sundargarh, Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Deogarh, Angul, Dhenkanal, Jajpur, Bhadrakh, Kendrapara, Jagatisnghpur, Cuttack, Khurda and Puri are covered by the gas pipelines. While major industries will be benefitted by the pipeline project, people in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack will be able to get cooking gas in pipe and vehicles will get CNG in a smooth way, thanks to initiative of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Major steel makers like SAIL, Essar Steel, Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless , Visa Steel, Aarti Steel Bhusan Power and Steel, Vedanta Nalco and Aditya Aluminium will be benefitted though the gas pipeline. These industries will be provided with natural gas in the pipelines and the investors are expecting early completion of the project.

Similarly, Cuttack and Bhubaneswar City Gas Distribution Network will be beneficial for the people to use Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and vehicles will use Compressed Natural Gas(CNG).

Under this backdrop, the GAIL authorities have requested the State Government to provide all permissions through a Single Window clearance, so that time will be saved and project will be implemented in a time bound manner. Senior officials of GAIL are in constant touch with the State Government and requesting for resolution of the issues, which are stalling the ‘Ganga Urja’ Project in Odisha.

Sources said Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan would take up the matter with Chief minister Naveen Patnaik soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/urja-ganga-gas-project-hits-hurdle-in-state.html

85,14-1-20,Dhindsas being used as ‘pawns’ by Cong: SAD,"As signs of revolt became more apparent, Shiromani Akali Dal on Monday said party MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son Parminder Singh Dhindsa were suspended as they were being used as ""pawns"" by Punjab Chief Minister and Congress leader Capt Amarinder Singh to weaken the 'panthic' party.

The Dhindsas, who have publicly criticised SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, were suspended on Saturday for ""anti-party activities"".

On Sunday, three Punjab ministers slammed the Akali Dal leadership alleging the opposition party ""had been reduced to the personal fiefdom of the Badals"".

SAD leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Prem Singh Chandumajra claimed the Congress leaders who supported the Dhindsas after the sacking were ""working as per a fixed game plan.""

""The cat is out of the bag. The Dhindsa faction, which consists of Dhindsa, his son Parminder and son in law Tejinderpal Singh Sidhu only, are being feted and supported by Congress with the sole aim of splitting the panthic votes,"" they said in a statement.

Stating that the Congress party was living in a ""fool's paradise"", the senior Akali leaders said the entire rank and file of the SAD was solidly behind party chief Sukhbir Badal.

""The truth is that no one had left the SAD to join the Dhindsa faction. As many as 11 SGPC members from Sangrur and Barnala are standing rock solid with the SAD.

Even the four circle presidents nominated by the Dhindsa family recently have chosen to side with the SAD,"" they said.

Akali leaders said instead of trying to form a broad alliance with the Congress to take on the SAD, Sukhdev Dhindsa should first explain his own conduct to the people.

""Isn''t it a fact that Dhindsa has won only one election in the past 35 years? Hasn''t the SAD under the leadership of Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal rewarded him with plum posts by nominating him to Rajya Sabha besides making him a central minister,"" they asked.

The SAD leaders said Dhindsa senior was seeing Badal''s resignation as SAD president after the party lost the assembly election but was silent about his own accountability.

""Why didn''t you ever offer your resignation as secretary general of the SAD, a post which is only second to the president? Did you ever say you won''t ask for a Rajya Sabha berth,"" they asked.

The Akali leaders said the Dhindsa family was ""used to taking all decisions in a dictatorial manner"". ""However when party workers started questioning their actions and demanded transparency in the functioning of Sangrur and Barnala units, they were the first to go against panthic ideals by aligning with the Congress party which was behind the stage-managed revolt.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dhindsas-being-used-as----pawns----by-cong--sad.html
86,14-1-20,"Claiming rights over ‘hukamnama’ a sacrilegious act: Cong, AAP","As a private TV channel has claimed exclusive rights over the telecast of ‘Hukamnama’ and ‘Gurbani’ from the Golden Temple, the Congress and the Aam Admi Party (AAP) on Monday dubbed it as a sacrilegious act while seeking “action” against the Sikh code of conduct.

Punjab Panchayats and Rural Development Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa asserted that “claiming rights over Hukamnama and Sarb-Sanjhi Gurbani, telecasted live from the Golden Temple, amounted to sacrilege that called for action as per the Sikh code of conduct against the culprits”.

“Gurbani, as revealed through the Sikh Gurus, is universal and the Sikhs as a collective are its custodian, but not the owners and as such, none can claim ownership over the daily Hukamnama. The TV channel owned by Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal and his family has committed brazen sacrilege by claiming exclusive rights over Hukamnama that is telecasted live from the Golden Temple as the claim is a brazen violation of the very message that Gurbani emanates,” he argued.

He said that the Sikhs all over the world wait for hukamnama from Darbar Sahib every morning over which none had any exclusive rights.

Bajwa questioned the authority of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee to hand over rights over the telecast of Gurbani from the Golden Temple as its duty is to carry it to every corner of the world and not authorize any other agency that would be interested only in profits.

He alleged that this amounted to the commercialization of both Gurbani and the Golden Temple from where it is being telecast. “The channel could at best be the facilitator for spreading the message of the Gurus through Gurbani and nothing more,” he said.

The Minister alleged that the Badal family had treated the live telecast of Gurbani as yet another business and pressurized the SGPC to give rights to the channel which had made payment to the SGPC like any other business under the head of the education fund.

He appealed to the Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to go into the very basic issue of being facilitator in the transmission of Gurbani to spread the message across the globe on the one hand and claiming rights over it on the other.

Bajwa pointed out that the live telecast of Gurbani from the Golden Temple had been long-cherished dream of the Sikh community dating back to the seventies and its commercial exploitation is its anti-thesis.

“The SGPC was supposed to install its own equipment when the era of cable TV started and this is on record. It was the signal that was to be distributed to the channels that made the commitment to follow guidelines. However, this proposal was abandoned. The Akali Dal should go through its manifestos for election to the general house of the SGPC where such arrangement had been promised,” he said.

Bajwa also appealed to Akal Takht Jathedar to make public the deal between the SGPC and the Badal family-owned channel and make transparent arrangements for spreading the message of Gurbani with the channels acting as facilitator.

He pointed out that the Punjab Assembly had passed a resolution to this effect on November 6, 2019. He recalled his own letter appealing to Akal Takht Jathedar as follow up to take action as per the wish of Punjab reflected articulated through the Assembly resolution.

He said that his only purpose of taking up the issue was to put an end to commercial exploitation of Gurbani and the Golden Temple.

Meanwhile, AAP MLA from Kotkapura Kultar Singh Sandhwan described the claims of ownership on relay of the holy Sarb Sanjhi Gurbani from Sri Darbar Sahib by any company or an individual, as “an act tantamount to sacrilegious act”.

Sandhwan lamented that the Badal clan, which had ruled the State for longer spans of time, had virtually demolished the rich Sikh traditions, and had undermined the authorities of the iconic Sikh institutions, like Akal Takht Sahib and the SGPC.

He demanded that Akal Takht Jathedar should direct the SGPC to initiate action against the individual or company, which was trying to monopolize the broadcast of Sarb Sanjhi Gurbani as their personal property and let the mammoth ‘sangat’ enjoy the divine renderings of the Gurbani unhindered.

“The act not only amounted to disrespect to the scared Gurbani but has also deprived the common Sikh and other nanak naam leva sangat of listening to the divine hymns at their convenience,” he said adding that the apex body of the Sikh should initiate action against the political who’s who, committee honchos, office-bearers and the members involved in the sacrilegious act.

“The SGPC management should be freed from the Badal caucus and entrusted to those who could restore the apex body of the Sikh to its old glory,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/claiming-rights-over----hukamnama----a-sacrilegious-act--cong--aap.html

98,14-1-20,New hunger strikers replace duo taken to hosp by police,"The police carried away Anganwadi worker Shashi Thapa to the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital on the fourth day of her protest fast unto death on Monday. Earlier, on Sunday, the police had taken away another hunger striker Savita Sharma to the GDMC hospital.

In the meantime, two other Anganwadi workers Neelam Paliwal and Manorama Nautiyal have started a fast unto death in support of the demands of the Anganwadi workers. Paliwal has been experiencing high blood pressure since Sunday, said the Anganwadi workers association president Rekha Negi.

Talking about the claims of the State minister for Women and Child Development, Rekha Arya that government had initiated talks with the protesting Anganwadi workers, Negi said that the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had never called them personally to meet him. “We met him only through our rally and even then he said that he would meet us after the Vidhan Sabha session but the meeting hasn’t happened yet. Why did they not call us after that? Are we so irrelevant?We have at least six working hours but minister Rekha Arya is saying that we work just for three hours. Also about being the only state to pay the highest allowance in the country, the geography of our region is different than other States and cannot be compared with the states like Uttar Pradesh or others. This means our struggle is different than the Anganwadi workers in other states.” She also added that there is no political agenda behind our protest. “There is no one from any particular political party involved in our protest. We are protesting for our rights and not against the current Government. We have also protested and been on hunger strike for fifty two days at the time when the then Chief Minister Harish Rawat was heading a Congress government in the state.

At that time, our protest had led to the increment of Rs 1,000 in our allowance. We also told the current government that if they will increase our allowances, we will take out a victory rally in honour of the BJP government,” said Negi.

As per the other Anganwadi workers, they will keep fighting for their rights and will not budge from their protest until the government changes its attitude and responds to them. It is pertinent to mention here that Anganwadi workers have been protesting for more than a month now in support of their demands.

The workers are demanding payment at par with the Anganwadi workers of Delhi and Haryana and benefit of Provident Fund (PF) and medical reimbursement as provided to state government employees.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/new-hunger-strikers-replace-duo-taken-to-hosp-by-police.html

He demanded that the Chief Minister tell in the public as to when he would fill up the OBC Commissioner post, which is lying vacant for long.

“Constitutionally, OBC Commissioner is the empowered person to deal in issues relating to social and caste rights and security of the backward class people. If the Chief Minister had any interest for development of backward class people, he would have appointed OBC Commissioner long before,” pointed out Harichandan.

He said SEBC people are also being deprived of different Government schemes as the State Government is preparing list of beneficiaries on political lines.

He demanded that the Government soon implement the 27 reservation for SEBC and OBC candidates or else his party would take to the streets.

Addressing a Press meet, party leader Satya Prakash Nayak said if the State Government was serious for development of SEBC and OBC people, it would have not kept the post of OBC Commissioner vacant for long.

“The State Government made the OBC Commissioner’s post defunct by violating all norms in 2006. Again, the Government also didn’t appoint a OBC Commissioner despite the High Court issued an order in this regard in 2011. From this, it is evident that the State Government has no concern for the Socially and Economically Backward Class people,” alleged Nayak.

120,14-1-20,HC to hear stretch opening PIL today,"The Delhi High Court on Monday agreed to hear on Tuesday a PIL seeking to open Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch which has been closed since December 15, due to ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The plea was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar which listed it for hearing on Tuesday.

The road closure is causing huge inconvenience/ hardship to lakhs of commuters everyday and they are compelled to take different routes for last one month, it said.

The petition, filed by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni, sought direction to the Delhi Police Commissioner to withdraw the closure of Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh Stretch and Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15, 2019 for ongoing protests against CAA and National Register of Citizen (NRC). It was a temporary measure but has been extended from time to time.

The Kalindi Kunj stretch is quite crucial as it connects Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh) and commuters who use these roads are forced to take alternative routes Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Expressway and Ashram, which is causing hours of traffic jams and wastage of time and fuel, it said.

The plea said children, who take that route, are compelled to leave home two hours prior to school timing.

It claimed that the authorities have failed to take appropriate action to give relief to the residents of the locality and lakhs of commuters of Delhi, UP and Haryana.

Sahni said he has given representation to the authorities on January 3 but no action has been taken till date.

Besides Delhi Police, the plea has made the Centre and the Delhi government as parties, seeking from them requisite assistance to the police in addressing the issue.

Due to the heavy traffic on alternative routes, it takes 15-20 minutes for people to cross just one traffic signal at Ashram, it said.

Citing several news reports, it said that on an average, Ashram Chowk is used by around 30,000 vehicles every day. With the Kalindi Kunj road closure, an additional 1 lakh vehicles are flowing through the intersection.

The high court, on January 10, had refused to entertain another plea seeking directions for removal of demonstrators protesting the CAA at Shaheen Bagh here in order to clear road blockages that are causing traffic congestions at the DND route.

In December, 2019, a plea was filed in the high court by advocate Bajrang Vats seeking to remove physically challenged protesters from the periphery of Mandi House and direction to open roads affected by their demonstrations for general traffic.

The court had directed that the petition be treated as representation by the authorities and to be decided in accordance with law, keeping in mind the permissions given by the police to the protestors, effect on the traffic and inconvenience caused to the public at large.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-to-hear-stretch-opening-pil-today.html

The DDA in a statement said ""The DDA meeting in this regard was also attended by representatives of Delhi Government on December 21, 2017. They had no problem with the costing and it was not raised by them so far. Raising the issue at this time is not clear,""

""The people had to pay the registry charges twice first to DLF and then to DDA. DDA sent a letter to Delhi Government on February 9, 2018 and subsequently on May 25, 2018 requesting it to waive off one side of this registration fee. However no call was taken by the Government on this matter,"" it said.

However, Sanjay Singh said that the way the BJP leader, Union Minister Hardeep Puri and DDA officials reacted after his expose, it makes it clear that they all were involved with this scam. He said that this is a huge scam and officials of the DDA and ministers are also involved in this scam.

Addressing the media, Singh said, ""The Minister said that he has no information about the 772 EWS-category flats dismissing the allegations as baseless. But, I will prove that the allegation is true and I am also shocked to see that Puri, a respectable minister is speaking lies on this matter. ""There is a legal notice that the allottees of EWS category have sent to a number of authority including Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Office of the PMO, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and Hardeep Puri.""

Earlier on Sunday, Singh claimed flats should have been made available for Rs 6.90 lakh and Rs 11 lakh in easy installments. ""(But) after years of struggling, those beneficiaries are told to arrange Rs 19 lakh and Rs 24 lakh, which means three times more than they claimed and promised."" ""My question is when you (DDA) put out advertisements of the scheme and claimed the flats are ready, then why should anyone pay Rs 19 lakh, 20 lakh and 15 lakh,"" he asked. ""My other question is why did beneficiaries not get their flats for Rs 6.9 lakh?

Notably, a disrespectful reference to Bhil tribe in the MP Public Service Commission’s question paper where Bhil community was described as ‘drunkards and criminal-minded’, came to fore on Sunday.

The Bhil is a major tribe in Madhya Pradesh and has sizable contribution to the freedom struggle. Population wise, Bhils have 60 lakh strong presence in Madhya Pradesh.

Meanwhile, Dangore who took up the exam as a candidate in Khandwa said that besides being a teacher and Bhil community member he is aware of rich history of his community and vital role in the struggle to freedom of the country. It’s shocking to see the derogatory reference in the MPPSC question paper about the community, said Dangore, an MLA from Pandhana.

The question paper offered an unseen passage based on socio-economic status of Bhils calling them under the grip of liquor and claiming that the community engages in unlawful and immoral activities after failing to repay dues out of limited income.

The MLA also claimed that GK section of the exam cited a reference of visually impaired cricketer Sonu Golkar who is a Bhil and Vikram awardee.

Seeking action against the paper setter, Dangore affirmed he would lodge a complaint with police under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Act).

132,14-1-20,"Rivals AIADMK, DMK join hands to defeat BJP in local election","Strange things are happening in Tamil Nadu politics as the traditional rivals, the AIADMK and the DMK came together to defeat the BJP candidate in the presidential election in Rajakkamangalam Panchayath Union in Kanyakumari District.

The BJP had emerged as the largest party by winning six seats in the union where 15 wards were at stake. The AIADMK and the DMK finished with four and three seats respectively. Interestingly, there was no pre-poll alliance between the BJP and the AIADMK. The presidential election saw the DMK extending support to the AIADMK candidate who went on to win the election with the support of others.

‘“This is an interesting development and we may have to give a lot of attention to this trend,’” said Maalan, Tamil Nadu’s politics commentator while speaking of the poll prospects of the AIIADMK and the DMK in the assembly election which is expected to take place in early 2021. ‘“It is not easy to forecast what is in store for the 2021 assembly election based on the local body election held in December 27 and 30, 2019,’” said Maalan.

Though it was believed that the DMK may make a clean sweep in the local body poll in 27 districts based on its performance in the Lok Sabha election, it was not to be as the honours were shared evenly by the traditional rivals.

The DMK and the AIADMK won 13 districts each while the Shivaganga district panchayath election threw out a hung house with no clear winners.

What has happened in the panchayath unions was that though the DMK won more number of councillors, the election to the posts of president and vice-presidents held in indirect manner saw the AIADMK making some inroads. ‘“This could be due to horse trading, cross -voting or even poaching. There were some instances of Congress and the DMK fighting it out in the open,’” said Maalan. He also forecast that an interesting bout was in store during the 2021 election.

According to Maalan, there are no clear winners as on date. ‘“But I feel DMK holds a slight edge due to the anti-incumbency factor. The AIADMK has been in power since 2011 and it is natural that the anti-incumbency factor would set in. The AIADMK has to work hard and Ill not write them off,’” said Maalan who described as the scenario in Tamil Nadu as a football match in which both the contenders are equally poised to win.

But Kolahala Srenivaas, veteran political commentator is of the view that voters in Tamil Nadu are a confused lot. ‘“Previously, local body election was held immediately after the Assembly election . But the DMK managed to get the election delayed by filing cases after cases in the Madras High Court as well as Supreme Court.

The trend in Tamil Nadu was that people would vote for the party in power at Chennai to ensure speedy development works.

But this time, the local body election was held towards the end of the AIADMK’s tenure and this has resulted in the split verdict which we see.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rivals-aiadmk--dmk-join-hands-to-defeat-bjp-in-local-election.html

The ‘“Wanga’” breed of foxes are tied using ropes and chased across the streets by the villagers on ‘Kaanum Pongal’, the last day of the annual harvest festival, on the lines of the popular bull taming sport jallikattu, according to a forest official.

The villagers in parts of the district, including in Chinnamaikenpalayam and Vadukathampatty, observe this practice as they believe the Wanga foxes bring good fortunes and copious rains. The foxes are sent back to the forest later.

‘“Kannum pongal’” this year falls on Friday.

In a bid to prevent harassment of the animal, the forest department here has launched an awareness campaign against the practice and warned the villagers that those causing harm to the foxes could face punishment. ‘“We have issued advertisements across the district asking people not to engage in such sport. We have warned them that it is punishable offence and the foxes come under Wildlife (Protection) Act’”, the forest official said. During the coming days, the campaign would be stepped up, the official added.

135,14-1-20,Protest erupts near Bengaluru over planned 114-foot Christ statue,"Right wing organisations on Monday held a massive protest at Kanakapura near here against the proposed 114-foot statue of Jesus Christ, allegedly at a Government land, sponsored by local legislator and senior Congress leader DK Shivakumar.

The protesters said the demonstration was also against the larger issue of alleged religious conversion that was taking place in the region.

Hundreds of people clad with saffron scarf took part in ‘Kanakapura chalo’, organised by ‘Hindu Jagaran Vedike’, holding saffron flags in their hand marched from Aiyappa swamy temple at Kanakapura to

Tahsildar office, shouting slogans ‘“Bharat Mata ki Jai’” and ‘“Jai Sri Ram.’”

Protesters accused Shivakumar of trying to turn ‘“Kapalibetta’” or ‘“Muneshwara betta’”, the hill on which the proposed statue is to come up, into ‘“Yesu betta.’”

BJP leader and former Minister CP Yogeshwar, who took part in the protest, accused Shivakumar of trying to instigate communal violence for his ‘“politics.’”

He said, this fight is against the ‘“oppressive politics’” of Shivakumar and his brother- Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh in the region.

Hindutva ideologue and RSS functionary Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who addressed the gathering, said their agitation was not against Jesus Christ, but against the religious conversion in his name.

Questioning Shivakumar, whether he was doing it for the sake of vote and thereby to gain notes, he said ‘“...What is your intention? You want to sell this country to foreigners once again; Hindu community is warning you...This is also an act of treason.’”

He further declared that ‘“Muneshwara betta will remain Muneshwara betta...’”

Later responding to reporters questions, Bhat said ‘“if they are still adamant on going ahead with the statue, we will show the strength of Hindu community, we will fight against any activity against Hindu community.’”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/protest-erupts-near-bengaluru-over-planned-114-foot-christ-statue.html
136,14-1-20,BJP distances itself from book,"Under severe flak from various political quarters, an embarrassed BJP on Monday distanced itself from a controversial book “Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi”, penned by the party’s Jai Bhagwan Goyal, likening the current Prime Minister with Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

On a day when Maharashtra Congress threatened to launch a statewide agitation against the controversial book, BJP’s National Media co-head Sanjay Mayukh said through a video statement: “Whatever that been written in the book is the author’s personal point of view. It is neither our party publication nor are we connected with it in any manner”

“The writer has clarified that it is his personal writing. He has also said that if the book has hurt anybody’s emotions, he is withdrawing the book. We would like to clarify again that it is not a party publication,” Mayukh said.

The book “Aajke Shivaji: Narendra Modi” has been criticised by the leaders of all the non-BJP parties — especially the ruling constituents of Shiv Sena-led Maha Vilas Aghadi (MVA) in the State, ever since it was released at an even held at the BJP’s headquarters in New Delhi amid fanfare in New Delhi on Sunday.

Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president and senior State Minister Balasaheb Thorat announced that his party would launch a state-wide protest against the BJP “cheap” attempts to compare Modi with Chhatrapati Shivaji.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot be compared to Shivaji Maharaj at all. Modi's divisive politics and communal policies like CAA and NRC, his autocratic nature of running the Government stands no comparison with the secular approach through which Swarajya was established by the Chhatrapati Maharaj,” Thorat said.

“The BJP should morally not even take the name of Shivaji Maharaj after the large scale corruption in the Shivaji Memorial project in its government,” he said.

The Congress is organising the first protest against the BJP sponsored controversial book on Tuesday morning at Tilak Bhavan at Dadar in north-central Mumbai.

Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut, who was to ignite a controversy over the book drawing comparisons between Modi and Shivaji, demanded to know from the descendents of the Marathi warriors – most of whom are with the BJP—to come out with their stand on the book and resign from the principal ruling party at the Centre.

Talking to media persons in Mumbai, Raut said: “We respect Chhatrapati Shivaji’s descendents like Udyan Raje and Shivendra Raje from Satara dyanasty, Chhatrpati Sambhaji Raje from Kolhapur. They should also speak out on the book”. “Chhatrapati Shivaj is revered by us all. He cannot be compared with anyone. Narendra Modi is our Prime Minister. We respect him. But comparing Modi with Chhatrapati Shivaji is totally wrong,” Raut said.

Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha member and descendent of Shivaji from Kolhapur Yuvraj Shamburaje Chhatrpati urged BJP President Amit Shah to ensure that the controversial book does not hit the market for sale.

Shamburaje, who is a presidential nominee in the Upper House of Parliament, said: “ I have respect for Modi. He has contributed hugely to the country. But, that does not mean that he should be compared with Chhatrapati Shivaji. No one can be compared with Chhatrapati Shivaji. The BJP’s president should ensure that the book does not hit the market for sale”.

Hitting out at the BJP to liken Modi with Shivaji, NCP state President and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil said: “Tall and vast as the Sahyadri mountain ranges, my king (Chhatrapati Shivaji) cannot be compared with anybody. Keep this in mind, or else… You have to face (music from across) Maharashtra”.

NCP’s Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad wondered if the BJP had lost its mind?”. On his part, Congress General Secretary Sanjay Dutt demanded to know as why the BJP or its Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis have not yet condemned the development and were keeping silent.

Maharashtra’s Minorities Development Minister and senior NCP leader Nawab Malik demanded that the “offensive” book be banned immediately, while State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the book was “an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s philosophy”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-distances-itself-from-book.html
137,14-1-20,‘11 Raj districts facing worst locust attack after 26 years’,"Eleven Rajasthan districts are facing the worst locust attack after 26 years with control measures being taken on 3.70 lakh hectare affected land and an official urging international cooperation to deal with the menace.

The last locust outbreak was reported in 1993 when the State’s Agriculture Department had carried out preventive measures on 3,10,482 lakh hectares affected land, whereas control measures on 3.70 lakh hectare land have been done till January 12 so far, he said.

‘“It is one of the worst locust attack that Rajasthan is facing this time. Locust attack started this year from May 21 and is still continuing. So far, control measures have been done on 3.70 lakh hectare affected land by spraying 2.60 lakh litre melathion. This is a problem which requires immediate international cooperation,’” Suwa Lal Jat, Joint Director (Plant Protection), said.

He said that locust attack generally starts in June-July and lasts till October end or November-mid but it has been eight months from now that it is still continuing, adding that the presence of locust population has been seen on the international border with Pakistan, which still poses danger.

The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), headquartered in Jodhpur, said locust attack is the biggest and longest running phenomenon.

‘“It is the biggest locust attack in the last four or five decades. Last big attack was seen in 1993 and the affected area span has already surpassed it this time. It is a challenge for the coming months as well because the presence of locusts in the Gulf countries, including Iran and Pakistan, is alarming and summer breeding of locusts is also approaching,’” LWO Deputy Director K L Gurjar said. The 11 affected districts where control measures have been taken include Jaisalmer 2 lakh hectare, Barmer 80,000 hectare, Bikaner 80,000 hectare, Sriganganagar 5,000 hectare, Jalore 1,500 hectare, Hanumangarh 800 hectare, Nagaur-Churu 500 hectare each, Pali-Sirohi 400 hectare each and Dungarpur 50 hectare.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had written a letter to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, seeking the Centre’s assistance on the matter.

On December 30, Gehlot had announced to conduct girdawari (survey) for the assessment of loss caused to crops due to locust attack in Western Rajasthan.

On Saturday, the chief minister had asked officials to start distribution of compensation to farmers on loss to crops due to locust attack. Jat said the unusual phenomenon is being investigated by the scientists of five agriculture universities of the states who are taking samples in the affected areas.

‘“The teams of scientists are taking samples in the affected areas to study locust habitats. They are examining whether the reason is climate change or global warming or anything else,’” he said.

He said that 54 teams of the Agriculture Department are surveying and monitoring the situation, 450 tractors with mounted sprayers are being pressed into service to control the menace, besides an additional fleet of 500-700 tractors received per day with the support of people.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---11-raj-districts-facing-worst-locust-attack-after-26-years---.html

He alleged that the way the AAP is using children for its election campaign, it is clear that AAP and its workers are insensitive and playing with the heart of children to get applaud.

Speaking on the occasion, Kejriwal said ""There used to be only two major political parties in Delhi, the BJP and the Congress. People were fed up with the politics of both these parties because they did not deliver on promises made and having no other choice, voted them alternatively.

But then five years ago, the people of Delhi initiated a new phase of self determination in politics and set an example for the rest of India when a fledgling party, comprising common people, offered hope and managed to win 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly, almost reducing existing political powers, to a naught, Kejriwal said.

Verma, the West Delhi MP said the token charge will be to honour the self respect of the residents of the national capital.

Verma said he has given this suggestion to the party's manifesto committee and it could be one of the poll promises of the BJP for the assembly elections slated to be held on February 8.

""People feel they have given back to the Government if some token charge is taken. When our Government will come, we will not go for zero (bill), we will take a token charge of Rs 1 so that self-respect of the people is maintained,"" he said in reply to a question.

Verma also accused the Delhi government of ""betraying"" the residents of the national capital on its promise of infrastructure development.

He cited 70 promises of the Aam Aadmi Party before coming to power in 2015, saying the party allegedly failed to fulfill its promises of coming up with a power plant, constructing 500 schools and 20 colleges, building primary health centres and water augmentation measures, among others.

The decision of Justice Anita Sumanth, who was one of the leading lawyers in tax related issues before her elevation to the Madras High Court comes in response to a request made by the lawyer representing the Income Tax Department in the case.

The Income Tax Department had filed a petition in the Madras High Court against Karti Chidambaram, his wife Srinidhi and mother Nalini Chidambaram for non-disclosure of Rs 1.35 crore which he had received as payment for selling a plot of land at the scenic Muttukadu near Chennai.

The case was filed based on documentary evidences seized from the residence of Karti and office Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd in which it is alleged that he has stakes.

The advocate appearing for the Income Tax department told Justice Sumanth that she had represented Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd as a lawyer before her elevation to the Bench. He also asked the judge to transfer the case to the bench of another judge.

Anita Sumanth immediately agreed to ask the chief justice to allocate the case to another bench.Interestingly, Dr Sumant Raman, spouse of Anita is one of the most sought after panellists in discussions in TV channels and he is known for his support to the Chidambarams.

Last Tuesday, a special court in Chennai had dismissed the petition filed by Karti asking for quashing of the tax evasion case against him since he had filed all relevant tax returns and he was not a member of the Lok Sabha at the time. The Special Court is the one which hears cases related top MLAs, MPs and other public servants.

The court had also asked the Income Tax Department to frame charges against Karti and his wife and had also asked them to be present in the court on January 21.

The Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation) Chennai had filed a complaint against the duo in September 2018 before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court (Economic Offences) under sections 276(c)1 and 277 of the Income Tax Act. The case was later transferred to the special court for trail of MLAs and MPs. During the hearing, the Income Tax Department told the court that Karti received Rs 6.38 crore in cash while his wife received Rs 1.35 core in cash for the same of the land. It was also alleged that Nalini Chidambaram (Karti’s mother) received the payment in the form of cheque while the son and his wife received cash.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-karti-case-after-i-t-plea.html

On Friday, an Army soldier and two others were arrested by the Punjab Police for allegedly smuggling drugs and weapons from across the India-Pakistan border using GPS-fitted drones in collusion with their Pakistani accomplices, the Punjab Police had said.

The two seized drones were purchased from a Ghaziabad-based firm but were delivered in Pune. The Punjab Police has arrested Indian Army Naik Rahul Chauhan.

“At least five other persons and a few army personnel are under the radar of the security agencies and they may be arrested soon by the police,” an Intelligence official said.

Besides the drones, the Punjab Police had on Friday seized 12 drone batteries, some custom-made drone containers, an INSAS rifle magazine, and two walkie-talkie sets, besides Rs 6.22 lakh in cash from the arrested accused. The seized cash is suspected to be the proceeds from the sale of smuggled drugs. However, drugs was not seized from the possession of the arrested accused.

“Now we have come across a module in which three people were arrested and where they were launching drones from India to across the border (Pakistan) and they were to bring back drugs payloads,” Director General of Punjab Police Dinkar Gupta had said.

The arrests and seizure came months after a large number of drones, including with the capability to drop payloads, were sighted on Punjab’s border on a daily basis following abrogation of Article 370 and reorganization of the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories on August 5.

Meanwhile, the Aviation Ministry on Monday announced a scheme providing a window up to January 31 for voluntary registration of all drones and their operators against the backdrop of killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US drone attack.

Those who fail to register will face action under the Indian Penal Code and the Aircraft Act. In a notice, the Ministry said, “The presence of such drones as well as drone operators has come to the notice of the Government which do not comply with the CAR (civil aviation requirements).”

“In order to facilitate the identification of civil drones and drone operators, a one-time opportunity for voluntary disclosure of such drones and drone operators is being provided... All persons in possession of drones are required to complete the process (of online registration) by January 31, 2020,” it added.

The number of illegal drones in India is likely to be between 50,000 and 60,000, co-chair of a FICCI committee on drones, Ankit Mehta, had said on October 22 last year.

149,14-1-20,"To TMC's rejoice, Bengal BJP infighting comes to fore","Apparently giving a cause for the Trinamool Congress to rejoice the intra-house feud in the BJP’s Bengal unit came out in the open when State party president Dilip Ghosh on Monday reiterated his stand on shooting the hooligans like dogs if they would vandalise public property and said it was the party president Amit Shah who would decide on the policy matters and not Babul Supriyo who objected to him making such statements.

He was referring to a tweet from Union Minister Babul Supriyo who rejected Ghosh’s fiery statement as his personal one adding as a party BJP never believed in politics of bayonet and so did the Governments in Uttar Pradesh and other states that were run by it.

The immediate trigger for the open spat between the two senior leaders was a public speech by Ghosh who told an audience at Nadia late on Sunday evening that Bengal had 2 crore infiltrators who held the state to ransom after the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by destroying public property worth crores.

“They have torched property worth crores. Whose property is this? Is it their paternal property? This is my money. This is your money... they went on a rampage and still, not a lathi was charged not one bullet was fired. No FIR was registered. Not even an arrest was made,” he said adding in States like Assam and Uttar Pradesh, “our Government has shot these protestors like dogs. They were arrested and cases were also filed against them.”

Ghosh was referring to the last month’s violent protests post enactment of the CAA that saw violent mobs torching trains and damaging other central government properties worth crores at Murshidabad, Malda, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and elsewhere.

While opposition Trinamool Congress immediately lapped up the issue Babul Supriyo intervened to control damage saying whatever Ghosh had said was his personal opinion and the party had nothing to do with it.

“BJP, as a party has nothing to do with what Dilip Ghosh may have said. It is a figment of his imagination and the BJP Governments in UP, Assam have NEVER EVER resorted to shooting people for whatever reason whatsoever. Very irresponsible of Dilip Da to have said what he said,” the Union Minister said.

Supriyo’s tweet notwithstanding the Bengal BJP chief on Monday stuck to his stand saying “I still stick to what I have said,” before wondering “who is the party president? Who will decide on the party’s internal matters? Amit Shahji or him Babul Supriyo)? I believe you got the answer.” Later clarifying his stance he said his statement was Bengal specific and he only wanted to hammer home the point that BJP was strict in its policies. “It is unfortunate” he said referring to the Minister’s criticism adding “all I would like to say is that in Assam, UP and Karnataka, the state governments punished those who damaged properties and took law in their hands.

Police firing took place and case was also filed… Everyone knows what happened. It only underscores our party’s policy on governance. It’s our party stand to deal strictly with trouble-makers in BJP-ruled states.

Damaging public properties and holding the entire state to ransom cannot be tolerated.”

Taking a dig at the BJP a senior TMC leader and Minister said “though it is their internal matter one can only say that it is all about who will become the next State president.”

CPI(M)’s Sujan Chakrabarty said, “BJP is like this. These are smaller leaders.

Besides the CJI, the bench comprises Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, MM Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, BR Gavai and Surya Kant.

“It is a painful job, a painful duty,” said a Bench, comprising Justices Arun Mishra and MR Shah, after it was informed by the State Government that the top court’s order has been complied with and the buildings demolished.

“We will not dispose of this (petition) now. You will have to remove the debris. There are reports that some portion of debris has fallen in backwaters. You have to restore the area,” the Bench told the State’s counsel. One of the advocates representing some of the Maradu flat owners said that the apex court has ordered a “fine balance” and has given interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh to each of them.

The lawyer said the top court has also granted liberty to flat owners to approach civil court to initiate appropriate proceedings against the builder.

When the lawyer said nothing was happening against the officials who had permitted the illegality, the Bench said, “Something is happening in this. Let us wait for that”.

The counsel said there were some flat owners who had more the one flat in the demolished buildings but the one-member committee, which was set up pursuant to the order of the apex court to oversee demolition and assess total compensation payable to affected buyers, has said that compensation would be paid for one flat only.

“You file a proper application about this,” the Bench said. Regarding other issues, including setting up of one court to deal with pleas filed by buyers to initiate appropriate proceedings against the builder, the court asked them to file proper applications.

153,14-1-20,Parliamentary committee starts work on legislative impact assessment,"A parliamentary committee has started working on legislative impact assessment, days after Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu pitched for it, official sources said on Monday.

Legislative impact assessment is an informed law-making process under which social, economic, environmental and institutional impacts of legislative proposals are made.

It helps in realising the stated objectives of various laws. Naidu is of the view that informed legislation will help in realising the stated objects of various laws.

It requires a detailed impact assessment of legislation at the stages of both pre-legislation and post-legislation.

Now, the department-related parliamentary standing committee on law, justice and personnel, headed by BJP leader Bhupender Yadav, has started working on the issue and would come out with a report on ways to assess the impact of a law on people, society and economy before and after it is framed, the sources said. A similar move to have judicial impact assessment on laws could not take off in the past.

Based on the directions of the Supreme Court, a task force was set up in 2008 to study Judicial Impact Assessment. But various experts had claimed that assessing judicial impact of a law was not practical.

Later, a committee of experts was constituted in September, 2013 to examine the issue of implementing the methodology of Judicial Impact Assessment and suggest further action.

The Act, passed in early December, specified that ""every communication proposed to be made by the Chancellor to any state-aided university shall be routed through the (higher education) department and the VCs have to intimate the department before taking any important decision.""

It was quite clear that the proposed meeting will fall through, the JU office-bearer said.

Dhankhar, after being stopped from attending the annual convocation of Jadavpur University last month, had said ""there is a policy paralysis. Universities are in captivity and caged by the state government"".

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said the Opposition’s resolution demanding withdrawal of the law must have made Pakistan happy.

The Minister also said the Opposition ended up “unnecessarily” attacking the Modi Government in the process and that their unity stood “exposed”.

“Opposition unity stands exposed as major parties like SP, BSP, TMC and AAP kept away (from a meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi). The resolution is neither in national interest nor in the interest of security. It is also not in the interest of those minorities who fled neighbouring countries to escape persecution,” Prasad told reporters.

164,14-1-20,SAT to hear NSE's co-location matter today,"The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday will hear the NSE's co-location case, wherein brokers are alleged to have received preferential access to the trading systems of the bourse.

The tribunal will hear the matters, involving the Sebi order in the NSE case, its former MD Ravi Narain and ex-CEO Chitra Ramakrishna and other executives -- Deviprasad Singh and Nagendra Kumar, as per the tribunal's cause list.

Also, the SAT will hear case involving brokers OPG Securities, GKN Securities and Way2Wealth, it added.

In September, the tribunal had asked NSE officials, including Ramakrishna, to file rejoinders within four weeks in their pleas against Sebi penalising them in the co-location case.

After an extensive probe, the Sebi in five separate orders running into 400 pages, had on April 30, last year, asked the NSE to disgorge Rs 1,000 crore, including 12 per cent interest for its alleged culpability in the case.

The order has scuttled the IPO plans of the bourse as it was banned from accessing the markets for six months or launching any new derivative products. The ban ended on October 31.

Sebi also asked Ramakrishna, Narain and two others to pay back 25 per cent of their salaries from June 2010 to March 2014. The scam came to light in 2015.

Following this, the nation's largest bourse and the people penalised for the case had challenged the order in the SAT in May 2019, seeking interim relief and full relief, saying that the Sebi orders not made a case that any trading member got any advantage because of preferential access.

The co-location case dates back to 2015, when a whistleblower wrote to Sebi alleging NSE was giving a few high-frequency traders/brokers preferential access to its servers by allowing them to place their servers in the NSE premises that benefitted both the parties at the cost of others.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sat-to-hear-nse-s--co-location-matter-today.html

In a monetary suit filed on January 10, the bank sought dismissal of Kochhar's petition and stated that the issue can be decided in a commercial suit.

""ICICI has filed a suit seeking recovery of amounts towards the claw back of bonuses given to the petitioner (Kochhar) from April 2006 to March 2018 pursuant to the termination of the petitioner's services,"" the bank said in its affidavit.

A clawback is a provision in which incentive-based pay, like a bonus, is taken back from an employee by an employer following misconduct or declining profits. The affidavit was submitted in response to a petition filed by Kochhar challenging her sacking, months after she voluntarily left the second largest private sector lender.

""On December 8, 2016, Kochhar executed a claw back agreement with the bank pursuant to which ICICI is entitled to a return of the previously paid variable pay or deferred variable pay from the petitioner in the event of a determination of a gross negligence or an integrity breach by Kochhar.

167,14-1-20,"Sebi extends deadline to April 2022 to split roles of chairman, MD","Markets regulator Sebi has deferred by two years to April 2022 its directive for listed companies to split the roles of chairman and managing director in view of demand from corporates, and to keep compliance burden lower in the wake of the current economic scenario.

Under the Sebi norms, the top 500 listed entities by market capitalisation were mandated to comply with the requirement of separation of the roles of chairperson and managing director (MD) or chief executive officer (CEO) with effect from April 1, 2020.

The norms were aimed at improving corporate governance structure of listed companies. Now, the date of implementation of the regulatory provision has been deferred to April 1, 2022, according to a gazette notification dated January 10.

While the notice did not specify any reason for the move, sources said that the decision to defer the implementation has been taken in view of demand from corporates and also to ease the compliance burden amid a slowing economic growth rate.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has been receiving various representations with respect to the regulatory requirements including from industry bodies like Ficci and CII. The representations highlighted the present levels of unpreparedness of listed entities to comply with the directive.

Data from stock exchanges reveal that presently, only around 50 per cent of the top 500 listed entities are in compliance with the regulatory provision.

Currently, many companies have merged the two posts as CMD (chairman-cum-managing director), leading to some overlapping of the board and management, which could lead to conflict of interest and consequently the regulator in May 2018 came out with its norms to split the post.

The norms were part of the series of recommendations given by the Sebi-appointed Kotak committee on corporate governance.

A large number of big companies including Reliance Industries, BPCL, ONGC, Coal India, Wipro and HeroMotoCorp have a single person holding the twin post of chairman and managing director. Industry body Ficci has welcomed Sebi's decision to extend its deadline for splitting Chairman and MD posts by two years to April 2022.

""This was part of multiple representations made by Ficci and we appreciate that Sebi has extended the deadline, the industry body's President Sangita Reddy said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sebi-extends-deadline-to-april-2022-to-split--roles-of-chairman--md.html

A model of Rafale fighter jet will also be showcased as part of the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s tableau on Republic Day.

In October, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had participated in the official handover ceremony in France for the first Rafale combat jet acquired by the IAF.

During the parade, the IAF will also showcase its might and glory, with its tableau depicting scaled-down models of five systems recently added to its inventory — Rafale aircraft, indigenously developed Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Light Combat Helicopter (LCH), surface-to-air guided weapon Aakash missile and Astra missiles.

Flt Lt Shrikant Sharma will lead the 144-strong IAF contingent on Rajpath for the second time in a row. While Warrant Officer Ashok Kumar, an accomplished Drum Major, will lead the IAF band, officials said.

“The Republic Day flypast will comprise 41 aircraft of the IAF and four helicopters of the Army’s aviation wing. The aircraft types include 16 fighters, 10 transport aircraft and 19 helicopters. The flypast will be conducted in two phases,” a senior IAF official said.

Leading the ceremonial parade would be the ‘Ensign’ formation comprising four Mi-17 V5 helicopters in an inverted ‘Y’ formation, also referred to as the ‘wineglass formation’. They will flypast the dais, trooping the national flag and the ensigns of the three services. They will be followed by ‘Dhruv’ formation, comprising four Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH) of the Army Aviation.

The second and the main phase will commence after the end of the ceremonial parade. This will be led by ‘Rudra’ formation of three ALH Mk-IV WSI helicopters of the IAF, flying in ‘vic’ formation, they said.

The ‘Chinook’ formation will comprise three newly-inducted transport helicopters in ‘vic’ formation. Following the Chinooks will be the ‘Apache’ formation consisting of the latest attack helicopters of the IAF. The five attack helicopters would be flying in ‘arrowhead’ formation, the official said.

The Chinook, twin-engine, tandem rotor is a multi-role, vertical-lift platform, which is used for transporting troops, artillery, equipment and fuel. Equipped with night vision devices, the helicopter can carry out military operations not only during the day but also at night.

Four of the US-made heavy-lift helicopters —Chinooks — were inducted into the IAF in March last year.

Eight US-made Apache stealth attack helicopters were inducted into the IAF in September last year, significantly boosting the force’s firepower capability at a time when India faces complex security challenges, including cross-border terrorism.

Leading the fixed wing formations this year would be Dornier formation consisting of three Dornier aircraft in ‘vic’ formation. After this, the three C-130J Super Hercules ac will fly in ‘vic’ formation. This will be followed by the ‘Eye in the Sky-Netra’ formation, comprising a single AEW&C flanked by two Su-30 MKIs, they said.

Thereafter, a formation of three C-17 Globemasters, in ‘displaced trail vic’ formation called ‘Globe’ formation will flypast the dais, showcasing the IAF’s heavy lift capabilities.

170,14-1-20,Antioxidant foods can reduce Alzheimer’s health risk: Study,"Indian scientists have found that consuming antioxidant foods like green tea, guava leaves, apples, cherries, pears, black berries can minimise the potential health risk due to toxic metal lead-induced Alzheimer’s disease.

Toxic metal lead is found in a number of commonly used materials in homes such as paints, cosmetics, batteries, glass and low grade toys among many others.

While studying that there is possible link between Alzheimer’s disease and heavy metal lead, scientists from the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) also found that therapeutic potential of natural compounds such as catechins, especially, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) present in foods like green tea, guava leaves, apples, cherries, pears, black berries is protective against lead toxicity and can effectively decrease neuronal cell death resulting in neurodegenerative condition.

These foods contain antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metal chelant properties, to effectively permeate brain and modify several cell survivals, said ICMR- NIN’s senior scientist Dr Suresh Challa.

Talking about another study, conducted by them which showed possible link between the heavy metal and the neurodegenerative disease, he said the molecular mechanism behind both lead and beta amyloid peptide induced toxicity by investigating the molecular mechanism involved in the development of lead induced Alzheimer’s disease through in vitro studies have been unravelled.

“In fact, alzheimer’s disease has a complex pathophysiology which involves initially; formation of beta amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain. In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation are known to be involved in the progression of the disease, with loss of memory and neuronal cell death. In this scenario, our study investigated the basic molecular mechanism behind the involvement of lead in Alzheimer’s disease,” Dr Challa said.

He explained that they simulated brain cells in vitro with beta amyloid peptides like in Alzheimer’s disease and the effect of lead exposure was then studied. “It showed increased cell death and increased levels of pro-apoptotic marker proteins. Further, the proteins involved in neurodevelopment and regeneration have depleted. Such effects led to decreased expression levels of synaptophysin, finally leading to loss of memory as in Alzheimer’s disease,” the scientist added.

Dr R Hemalatha, Director, ICMR-NIN talked about the health hazards of Lead exposure to a woman during pregnancy saying that it can cause developmental reprogramming which can lead to higher risk and early onset of Alzheimer’s disease in later life of the child.

“Since lead exposure is an important public health concern, the current findings could be another piece in solving the puzzle towards understanding the intracellular mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease. Such findings may as well help in developing preventive and management strategies for elderly,” she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/antioxidant-foods-can-reduce-alzheimer---s-health-risk--study.html
171,14-1-20,J&K DSP may be stripped of gallantry award,"The nexus between a decorated Jammu & Kashmir Police officer and the terrorists is likely to ruffle many a feather as the past of the Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Devinder Singh is going to haunt the intelligence agencies for long.

Following his arrest on Saturday, the Jammu and Ksahmir Police has apprised the Ministry of Home Affairs about the arrest, and the Home Secretary has been briefed on the Kulgam encounter.

Singh, who had joined the counter-insurgency Special Operations Group (SoG) of Jammu and Kashmir Police as a sub-inspector and he rose quickly to the rank of a DSP in addition to earning the prestigious police medal for gallantry ostensibly for his anti-militancy duties, will now be interrogated by Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing and Military Intelligence teams.

There are chances that Singh will be stripped off of his Presidents Gallantry Medal award, sources said, adding that the process was under consideration.

Singh's name first appeared in the grey zone after Parliament attack convict, Afzal Guru levelled serious allegation against him during his defence in the trial court. But back then both the state police and the intelligence agencies had dismissed those allegations as a figment of a terrorist's mind.

Guru had alleged in his defence that Singh tortured him and threatened to kill his family unless he carried out his directions.

Guru alleged in a written affidavit and through statements carried in the local media that Singh had forced him to carry the Parliament attack terrorists to Delhi, hire a flat there and also buy a second hand white ambassador car for the use of the terrorists.

It was this white ambassador car that the terrorists used during the Parliament attack in 2001.

After his disgraceful arrest on Saturday, while he was carrying a dreaded terrorist Naveed Baba of Kashmir's Shopian district to Jammu in his private car, Singh has told interrogators that he had harboured the terrorist in his Srinagar residence before the travel.

Naveed Baba was wanted by the police for the murder of 11 civilians, who included non local labourers, truck drivers and fruit merchants, after the abrogation of Article 370.

Police told IANS that Devinder Singh had been harbouring terrorists in his home in Jammu and also in his ancestral home in Tral town of Kashmir's Pulwama district.

The operation is being seen as a huge success for J&K Police, DGP Dilbagh Singh, IGP Vijay Kumar and DIG Atul Kumar Goel. ""For the heinous crime of carrying the terrorist to Jammu, he had taken Rs 12 lakh from the terrorist. He has been booked as a terrorist and he will be dealt as such,"" Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir zone told reporters on Sunday.

Davinder Singh was taking the two militants — Naveed Babu alias Babar Azam, a resident of Nazneenpora in South Kashmir's Shopian district and his associate Asif Ahmad — to Chandigarh for providing them accommodation there for a couple of months.

Sources said that a civilian Irfan Ahmad Mir was driving the vehicle when they were caught by the police at Al-Stop on National Highway in Kulgam district yesterday.

""Mir has travelled to Pakistan five times on passport and police is now investigating whether Singh and Mir were helping the two militants in ex-filtration or planning an attack somewhere in mainland,"" sources said.

They said that besides recovery of one AK-47 rifle, two pistols and two grenades from Singh's residence, lakhs of rupees were also recovered.

They said that militants had struck a deal of Rs 12 lakh with Singh for transportation, providing them accommodation and other related issues.

Sources further said that Singh was providing hideout to militants in Jammu during winters for last several years for which he was getting handsome amount of money.

They said that police was tracking DSP Davinder Singh when he reached Shopian few days back to pick up Naveed and Asif. ""The trio including Mir stayed at Singh's house in Srinagar for the night and police had laid nakas at Airport and NH-44,"" sources said.

Given the high security sensitive nature of Devinder Singh's activities in mind, the National Investigative Agency (NIA) has decided that after being interrogated by the state police and the intelligence agencies, it will take custody of both Singh and Naveed to find out their links with the terror funding cases being investigated by it.

For how long has Devinder Singh been hunting with the hound and running with the deer? This is going to be the most embarrassing question for his seniors in the Jammu & Kashmir Police.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/j-k-dsp-may-be-stripped-of-gallantry-award.html

The semi-autonomous city has an independent, British-style judiciary — viewed as one of the bedrocks of the financial hub’s identity and a key factor differentiating it from mainland China.

Its courts have been overloaded during seven months of sometimes violent democracy protests that have seen more than 6,500 people arrested, of whom around a thousand are undergoing or have completed legal proceedings.

Since the protests began, “many commentaries have been given as to the work of the courts and many views have been expressed regarding our judges”, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma said.

“A lot of these have been fair, but unfortunately, some have proceeded on misconceptions and misunderstandings,” he added in a speech to mark the opening of the legal year.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/top-judge-in-protest-hit-hong-kong-defends-legal-system.html
179,14-1-20,"Ahead of impeachment trial, Trump suggests not having it","President Donald Trump says the Senate should simply dismiss the impeachment case against him, an extraordinary suggestion as the House prepares to transmit the charges to the chamber for the historic trial.

The president is giving mixed messages ahead of the House’s landmark vote that will launch the Senate proceedings in a matter of days, only the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.

Trump faces charges that he abused power by pushing Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress.

First Trump was suggesting his own ideas for trial witnesses, then he said almost the exact opposite Sunday by tweeting that the trial shouldn’t happen at all. “Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial” over charges he calls a hoax, Trump tweeted, “rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have.

The comments came after a second night of demonstrations in Tehran against the authorities over the air disaster, according to videos shared on social media.

The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 was shot down shortly after it took off from Tehran before dawn on Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board.

The Kiev-bound airliner was brought down hours after Iran had launched a wave of missiles at US troops stationed at Iraqi bases in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general.

The Islamic republic initially denied Western claims based on US intelligence that the passenger plane had been struck by a missile before admitting it on Saturday.

“In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities,” said Government spokesman Ali Rabiei.

185,14-1-20,"No plan to exit India, says Walmart","World's largest retailer Walmart Inc on Monday said it has sacked 56 of its executives in India, including eight from senior management level, as it restructures its business in the country.

In a statement, Walmart India President and CEO Krish Iyer said the company ""remains committed"" to growing its wholesale retail business in India.

Most of the sacking was in Walmart's real estate division that is responsible for store expansion, implying the firm was facing challenges in expanding its wholesale business.

Walmart operates 28 wholesale stores in India, selling goods to small shopkeepers but not to retail consumers because of government rules aimed at protecting Kirana stores do not allow such sales.

""We are also looking for ways to operate more efficiently, which requires us to review our corporate structure to ensure that we are organized in the right way. As part of this review, we have let go of 56 of our associates across levels at the corporate office,"" Iyer said in the statement.

All of the 56 impacted associates, eight in the senior management and 48 in the middle as well as lower management, have been offered enhanced severance benefits and outplacement services to support their transition, he added.

He, however, denied reports of a second round of job cuts in April as part of an overall plan to shut down its physical presence in the country after struggling to return a profit.

The 56 executives laid off make up for 1 per cent of Walmart's overall workforce in India.

The job cuts come amid rising competition. US e-commerce giant Amazon Inc has partnered with India's leading retailer, Future Retail Ltd (FRL) to expand in the country, while richest Indian Mukesh Ambani recently launched an online retailer Jio Mart, offering free home delivery for thousands of grocery products.

Iyer, however, ruled out a second round of layoffs, terming the speculation as baseless and incorrect.

He said the company remains committed to growing its B2B cash and carry business in India.

Walmart opened six new best price modern wholesale stores, one fulfillment center, and the company's sales grew 22 per cent in 2019, he added.

""We have recently made significant investments to serve our members better and will continue to do so. This includes investments in our brick and mortar stores as well as e-commerce.

""Our members are increasingly becoming omni-channel shoppers. We are thus investing heavily in technology and have a healthy pipeline of best price stores. This will provide our members with a truly omni-channel and convenient shopping experience in the future,"" Iyer noted.

Layoffs at Walmart's brick and mortar business began after it bought a majority stake in e-commerce retailer Flipkart in 2018 in an around USD 16 billion deal.

Walmart, as per its strategy to strengthen presence in the Indian market and also compete head-on with global rival Amazon, had announced a mega-deal in 2018 to pick up 77 per cent stake in Flipkart.

Walmart had started B2B e-commerce in July 2014 from its Lucknow and Hyderabad 'Best Price Store' and was later extended to other stores.

It was among one of the first companies in India, which had adopted the omni-channel retail system by integrating online and offline formats here.

Amazon's partnership with Future Retail will make the US e-commerce giant the official online channel for the Indian firm's more than 1,500 stores across 400 Indian cities. As part of the deal, Amazon will add Future Retail's grocery products on its two-hour Prime Now delivery programme in India.

Ambani on the other hand already owns India's biggest retail chain, Reliance Retail, and has made no secret of his goal of building an e-commerce platform to rival Amazon and Walmart.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-plan-to-exit-india--says-walmart-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-plan-to-exit-india--says-walmart.html

189,14-1-20,Retail inflation may force RBI to hold rates: Report,"Retail inflation, which accelerated to 7.35 per cent in December and could breach 8 per cent in January, may force the Reserve Bank of India to hold rates in the monetary policy review next month, according to a report.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) in December rose to about five-and-half year high of 7.35 per cent from 5.54 per cent in November, mainly driven by high vegetable prices.

It breached the upper end of the RBI's comfort level of 4 per cent plus-minus two percentage points.

""RBI did not cut the rate in December when October 2019 inflation rate was 4.62 per cent. Now that CPI inflation has surged to 7.35 per cent in December and January inflation is also expected to remain above 8 per cent, the RBI is likely to hold rate in the next policy,"" an SBI research report- Ecowrap said.

The RBI, which mainly factors in the CPI based inflation, is scheduled to announce its next bi-monthly monetary policy on February 6.

After cutting repo rates for five consecutive times by 135 basis points between February-October 2019, the RBI left the repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent in the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy announced in December.

The report also emphasised on relooking of the CSO data methodology for estimating the CPI.

""Unfortunately, CSO methodology of using CES survey data has resulted in CPI being overstated by 200 bps. Its high time we question the CSO methodology of CPI estimation as it results in erroneous policy decisions,"" it added.

The report said inflation is expected to remain high in the remaining months of this fiscal year, close to 7 per cent thus averaging to 5 per cent for FY20.

""We believe that the RBI will go for a long pause possibly throughout 2020 as inflation is likely to remain above 6 per cent till June-July 2020,"" it noted.

Given the situation of low growth and high inflation (a possible situation of stagflation), the coming months are crucial for the RBI to decide on any action at rate front, the research report said.

According to the advanced estimates released by CSO, the country's GDP is likely to grow at 5 per cent in FY20.

The World Bank in its recent report has also pegged a similar growth in the economy for the current fiscal.

GDP growth decelerated to five per cent and 4.5 per cent in the April-June and July-September quarters of 2019, respectively, the lowest readings since 2013.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/retail-inflation-may-force-rbi-to-hold-rates--report-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/retail-inflation-may-force-rbi-to-hold-rates--report.html
190,14-1-20,India-China trade dips by nearly USD 3 bn in 2019,"The bilateral trade between India and China declined by about USD three billion last year while India's trade deficit continues to be high amounting to USD 56.77 billion as both countries experienced economic slowdown.

The trade figures released by the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) on Tuesday projected the total trade in Chinese currency RMB-Yuan terms registered a marginal increase of 1.6 per cent year on year but in dollar terms it was down by about USD three billion.

GACC Vice Minister Zou Zhiwu, who released the annual trade figures to the media, said China-India bilateral trade totalled to 639.52 billion yuan (about USD 92.68) which is 1.6 per cent increase year on year.

China's exports to India increased by 2.1 per cent last year totalling to 515.63 billion yuan while India's imports to China decreased by 0.2 per cent totalling to 123.89 billion yuan, he said.

The trade deficit for India in 2019 was USD 391.74 billion yuan, he said. However, in dollar terms the trade has declined. The bilateral trade in 2018 totalled to USD 95.7 billion raising hopes of India-China trade touching the landmark USD 100 billion in 2019. But the total trade amounted to USD 92.68 billion last year about USD three billion less than 2018.

The Chinese exports in dollar terms to India last year amounted to USD 74.72 billion compared to USD 76.87 in 2018. India's exports to China amounted to USD 17.95 billion against USD 18.83 billion last year.

In the face of slacking trade, the trade deficit also declined from USD 58.04 in 2018 to USD 56.77 billion.

The declining trade was largely attributed to the slowdown of the economies of the two countries.

According to the figures posted on the website of the Indian Embassy here, from January to November 2019 the total trade between the two neighbours in the 11 months last year was declined by 3.72 per cent amounting to USD 84.32 and the trade deficit for the 11 months stood at USD 51.68.

Trade deficit has become a major irritant in India-China bilateral relations figuring high in the bilateral discourse. India has been demanding China to open up its IT and pharmaceutical sectors to enable it to increase its exports.

While China continue to promise to address the concerns, the two countries discussed initiatives in this regard at various levels last year.

The issue figured in the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping during their 2nd informal summit at Mamallapuram in October last year where the two leaders have agreed to set up new mechanism led by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Chinese Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua to discuss trade, investment and services.

The meeting under the new mechanism was expected to held this year. Highlighting India's concerns over the trade deficit, a note posted on the Indian Embassy here said while flourishing trade has brought with it all the advantages, “it has also led to the biggest single trade deficit we are running with any country”.

“Our trade deficit concerns are two-pronged. One is the actual size of the deficit. Two is the fact that the imbalance has continuously been widening year after year to reach USD 58.04 billion in 2018,"" it said.

The note also said “growth in bilateral investment has not kept pace with the expansion in trading volumes between the two countries”.

""While both countries have emerged as top investment destinations for the rest of the world, mutual investment flows are yet to catch up. According to the Ministry of Commerce of China, Chinese investments in India between January-September 2019 were to the tune of USD 0.19 billion and cumulative Chinese investment in India till the end of September 2019 amounted to USD 5.08 billion”.

Cumulative Indian investment in China until September 2019 is USD 0.92 billion, it said.

“However, these figures do not capture investment routed through third countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. Especially in sectors such as start-ups etc. Which has seen significant growth in Chinese investment,"" it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-china-trade-dips-by-nearly-usd-3-bn-in-2019-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-china-trade-dips-by-nearly-usd-3-bn-in-2019.html

193,14-1-20,When the best collide,"Multiple individual battle on cards as Men in Blue host Aussies in 1st ODI today

With skipper Virat Kohli stepping in to resolve India’s opening puzzle, the formidable hosts will look to ensure that their enviable home run remains intact against a full-strength Australia when the two teams clash in an ODI series starting at Wankhede stadium today.

Kohli said he has no hesitation coming down the order to ensure that KL Rahul’s consistency and Shikhar Dhawan’s experience are both accommodated in the Indian playing XI.

“...Big possibility. I would be very happy to do so. Look I am not possessive about where I play. I am not insecure about where I bat,” Kohli said.

At a time when bilateral ODI series are fast losing relevance, the three-match rubber between two top teams could give a fresh lease of life to the format.

The high-voltage rivalries that fans enjoy will be back as Rohit Sharma’s elegance will be pitted against enforcer David Warner while the Virat Kohli vs Steve Smith duel will resume in earnest.

India’s hungry-for-wickets pace attack led by Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Navdeep Saini is ready to test the Australians with subtle variations.

On the other hand, IPL’s costliest foreign recruit Pat Cummins, the crafty Kane Richardson and the ever-dependable Mitchell Starc will leave no stone unturned to make life uncomfortable for Kohli and his men.

Alex Carey’s gutsy batting and faultless glove-work will face the challenge of Rishabh Pant's flair.

The young Marnus Labuschagne, easily the most exciting talent spreading his wings on the international cricket map with some stellar performances in the Test arena, would like to replicate his form in the shorter formats.

On current form, Rahul was miles ahead to partner Rohit Sharma at the top of the order but Dhawan has had a phenomenal record in white ball cricket against the Aussies.

In fact, in their last meeting in the ODI World Cup, it was Dhawan’s superb hundred that paved the way for an easy victory for the Indians.

But that was a good seven months back and Dhawan, since then, endured a spate of injuries. He also lost form only to regain a bit of it by scoring a half-century in the final T20 against Sri Lanka.

During World Cup, till Dhawan was around, KL Rahul batted at No 4 as a stop-gap solution but Shreyas Iyer has made the slot his own with a string of good scores.

The Wankhede track is usually a belter and India will certainly not go with two wrist spinners considering the fate they met during the last home series in March, which India lost 2-3.

Kuldeep Yadav, who has a hat-trick against Australia, is likely to be preferred over Yuzvendra Chahal.

There is a strong possibility that this will be Kedar Jadhav’s last ODI series for India unless the pint-sized Pune right-hander does something extra special.

With buzz being about his reluctance to bowl off-breaks in order to enhance his IPL career, a few good scores will be required to keep Ajinkya Rahane and Suryakumar Yadav out of equation when the Indian team for the ODI series in New Zealand is announced on January 19.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/when-the-best-collide.html
194,14-1-20,N Test anywhere in Aus: Kohli,"Months after Tim Paine’s cheeky dig at him, Indian captain Virat Kohli asserted that they are ready to play day/night Test at any venue in Australia later this year.

“We’re ready and up for the challenge — whether it’s Gabba, Perth... It doesn’t matter to us. It’s become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we’re open to playing day-night Tests,” Kohli said.

India played their maiden day/night Test against Bangladesh last November, winning the match with plenty of time to spare at the Eden Gardens.

“We played the day-night Test here, we were pretty happy with how it went. We have the skill-sets as a team now to compete against anyone in the world, anywhere, in any format of the game, whether it’s white ball, red ball or pink ball, we’re ready to play anything,” Kohli asserted.

Last year, when asked about it, Paine had sarcastically remarked that his Australian team would need to ask Kohli if he was willing to play day/night Test Down Under.

We'll certainly try and we'll have to run that by Virat (Kohli). We'll get an answer from him at some stage I’m sure. As I said we’ll ask Virat and see if we can get his permission to play here and maybe even get a Pink-ball Test if he’s in a good mood. Paine had said.

Five-match Test series

Melbourne: Spin legend Shane Warne called for a five-match Test series, including a day/night game between India and Australia next season, after Virat Kohli asserted that his side is willing to play with the pink ball Down Under later this year.

India are scheduled to tour Australia starting in November which will include four Tests, three ODIs and as many T20s as part of the calender cycle that ends in 2021.

Kohli’s statement prompted Warne to ask the BCCI and Cricket Australia to schedule a five-match Test series instead of four between the two countries in the next calender cycle beginning in 2023.

“I’ve said this before-but how good would a 5 Test match series between Aust & India be next season. Bris Perth Adelaide D/N Melb & Syd. I hope both the BCCI & CA make it happen. Scheduling is not an excuse @BCCI @cricketcomau @imVkohli @tdpaine36 @SGanguly99,” Warne tweeted.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/open-to-play-d-n-test-anywhere-in-aus--kohli.html

197,14-1-20,Virat far better than Smith in white ball cricket: Gambhir,"Virat Kohli is a “far, far better” batsman than Steve Smith as far as white-ball cricket is concerned, feels former India opener Gautam Gambhir.

Kohli, with 11,000 plus runs and 43 hundreds in ODIs, is way ahead of Smith who is closing in on 4000 runs with eight three-figure scores.

“Virat Kohli is far far better than Steve Smith in white-ball cricket. There’s no comparison. I would not compare Kohli to Smith in white-ball cricket. I would actually want to see what spot Smith bats on,” Gambhir told host broadcaster Star Sports.

“Are they’re going to push him at No 4 or would have him bat at 3 and send Labuschagne at No 4,” he added.

On the bowling front, Gambhir feels that Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami can trouble Aussie batsmen with sheer pace.

“I’m really excited to see how these two guys bowl against some of the top batters like David Warner or Aaron Finch in that kind of form in white-ball cricket on flat wickets.

“But the best part is that they have got pace. They can actually get wickets with that sheer pace and the quickness in the air as well,” Gambhir opined.

The former opener believes Shami is way more effective on placid tracks like the one on offer at the Wankhede.

“I’ve always believed that when you’re playing on flacid wickets and smaller grounds like the Wankhede or Bangalore, your bowlers need to step up. The kind of form Shami is in, it’s a big plus for India that he has done really well in white-ball cricket.

“Jasprit Bumrah is coming back from injury but he’s a quality bowler.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat-far-better-than-smith-in-white-ball-cricket--gambhir.html

The Aaron Finch-led side is brimming with confidence after an unprecedented home summer that saw Australia register comprehensive series victories over Pakistan and New Zealand.

India, on the other hand, will look to avenge their 2-3 loss to Australia at home in March last year.

Ponting, a former World Cup-winning Australia skipper, responded to a variety of questions during an interactive session with his fans on Twitter.

When a user asked him to predict the result of the ODI series, Ponting backed his home country to emerge victorious.

“Australia will be full of confidence after an excellent World Cup and a great summer of Test cricket but India will be keen to redeem themselves from the last ODI series loss against Australia. Prediction: 2-1 Australia,” Ponting tweeted.

When asked about the debutant Marnus Labuschagne, who enjoyed a remarkable Test summer, he said the youngster is an “overall package” and will carry his form in the limited-overs format.

“I think he’ll do a great job for Australia in the middle-order.

199,14-1-20,More than words,"Director Adeeb Rais tells Sakshi Sharma that his short film Baatein initiates conversations around issues that people usually find hard to talk about

If you tell a story that can make an impact and force people to think, it will make the world a better place and you would have made a difference,” says director Adeeb Rais, who is keen on making a short film on the current political scenario of the country. He says, “Right now, I feel very strongly about what’s happening in the country. If I make a film on that, I would have a side to it unlike my recent one, Baatein. I usually hate taking sides. It’s always good to show both sides of the story. For instance, if a child is bullying another, there is a problem with the bully. So we should try to get to the root of the problem. That’s what the film talks about.”

The short film, set in Palghar, Maharashtra, is about starting conversations in today’s world where people find it hard to express themselves. It follows a young documentary filmmaker, Jeet, played by Adeeb who visits a widowed science professor, Mrs Deshpande, (played by Supriya Pilgaonkar). On his arrival, he is introduced to her niece, Tulika (played by Shivani Raghuvanshi). The two become friends. Mrs Deshpande, who is struggling to cope with the grief over losing her young son, Milind to suicide, too becomes a part of the group. The unlikely trio spend the day together and a bond develops. They begin to share a few personal stories and express some of their deepest fears, feelings and thoughts with each other. A few unexpected conversations take place, which change their outlook towards life.

So what inspired Adeeb to create this film? “Everyone is aware of the fact that the youth are going through a lot of pressure and mental health problems. Unfortunately, mental depression has become a very common issue, which often goes unrecognised. Most of us go through traumatic experiences at some phase in our life but we don’t know how to express ourselves properly,” says he. This made Adeeb realise that he needs to tell a story that addresses this issue, without being preachy and which could make people to stop and think.

In the film, Supriya’s son had committed suicide because he was bullied by other kids, out of which, one was jailed. Jeet meets that boy in the jail and puts across his perspective in the film. He finds out that the boy who was guilty of bullying people also wanted to commit suicide. The film explores some grey areas by putting across the criminal’s perspective. “Both are right in their own ways — people who agree with the story and even the ones who don’t. I just wanted to put this across that if a person does something bad, we need to understand why he did that. I am not trying to justify what he did, but maybe, as a society, we need to look into the reasons why kids are choosing the wrong path. Our elders need to give it a thought. The film is trying to make parents think about the importance of communication with their children, whether they are focussing enough on the right and wrong aspects of actions. And I want to show that talking and hearing the child out is of utmost importance,” says he.

The film is based on Margaret Wheatly’s quote — “Be brave enough to start a conversation that matters”. As Adeeb feels that we have a lot of issues to look into because of the way the world is heading. “There is a need to confront issues and find a solution. I believe that filmmakers have a responsibility to address them. There might be a time when my films wouldn’t have something to say in depth but majority of times, I would choose to entertain the audience through a message.”

The beauty of the short film is its reach. People don’t mind investing a short span of time which gives this format an upper hand as compared to mainstream cinema and series that demand commitment for a longer time period. Adeeb believes, “It fits in aptly in the little time gaps that one gets during the day. It also offers a lot of variety to the audience. They get a plethora of content to pick from. Moreover, it works for a lot of young film actors and directors too who can channelise their creativity. When one has a time limit, it restricts you as a filmmaker to not become over-indulgent and preachy on any topic,” he says.

It is often noticed that such thought-provoking issues don’t make it to the mainstream cinema. But the recent release, Chhapaak seems to have challenged this notion, believes Adeeb. “With Chhapaak, one can see that filmmakers are bringing important issues to the forefront. But with mainstream cinema, another challenge is also that the actors take the centrestage. It’s not just the actual content that matters but the face on the film’s poster too. Well, this dilutes the essence of the issue, too, sometimes,” he adds.

200,14-1-20,Not quite a piece of cake,"Chef Vikas Khanna got a lot of hate messages on social media for sharing a picture of BiggBoss 13 contestant Asim feeding him dessert

Michelin star chef Vikas Khanna was recently at the receiving end of mass trolling on social media after he appeared on an episode of BiggBoss 13 for a cooking task where all the contestants participated. In the end, the chef treated them to some of his signature Michelin dishes. He prepared a lavish spread of delicacies for the winning team.

After all the contestants were served the food and they were preparing to eat, Riaz, a model who has been part of the show, decided to feed the chef a piece of the cake. A delighted Khanna shared the image of the same on his Instagram story.

However, what Khanna wasn’t expecting was the sea of trolling that was in store for him after the post. As he posted the image, many questioned his faith considering he ate from the hands of Riaz. Incidentally, the model is from Kashmir.

Responding to the trolls, Khanna wrote, “When I posted this humble gesture on Insta Story, I got a lot of hate filled rude messages and questions. Even questioning my faith. I’m an Indian and that’s my faith.” He added that he was “happy” to watch the contestants eat and that he had only shared Riaz’s story because he was moved by his gesture.

He even shared the same picture on Instagram and explained, “Dear all. I was in the Bigg Boss house a few days back. We had spent hours and hours to create Michelin Style plates for the winning team.......when everyone started eating, I was so happy to see them eat. They are living in isolation without any luxury for months, it was a satisfying moment for me to see them savour my food. Except for Asim, who served me a bite with his hands first. It was a genuine moment to thank me. When I posted this humble gesture on Insta Story, I got a lot of hate-filled rude messages and questions. Even questioning my faith. I’m an Indian and that’s my faith. I have slept many days without food during my journey in America, I admire people with courage and big hearts even when they are at the receiving end. Humanity and humility shine even when they are silent and small.”

The chef’s response to the trolling has impressed many on social media. His post on Twitter has over 25,000 likes while the number of over 85,000 on Instagram. Many lauded him for standing up against communal trolling and taking a stand in defence of secularism and harmony.

201,14-1-20,Look beyond the borders,"Italian fashion Chamber adopts a manifesto promoting diversity

The Italian National Fashion Chamber is promoting a diversity agenda among Milan’s major fashion houses, a year after several top Italian brands faced criticism for designs and remarks seen as culturally and racially insensitive.

Its manifesto backed by major Italian fashion brands aims to increase racial and gender diversity in key roles in Milan’s fashion houses, which fashion chamber president Carlo Capasa acknowledged was lagging. “We have been speaking for many years against discrimination based on gender, religion, skin colour and physical ability. But we must acknowledge that this has not been truly implemented. We looked at our industry and saw there is disparity. We saw that a disparity of gender persists, that there are conditions not favourable to women in the workplace and in some cases there is discrimination,’’ Capasa said.

While Capasa resisted framing the manifesto as a direct reaction to the scandals involving blackface designs by Gucci and Prada, and a Chinese backlash that forced fashion house Dolce&Gabbana to cancel a major Shanghai show, the incidents show the cultural blind spots that can arise when a fashion house is too homogeneous.

Capasa said the Milan fashion world must work harder to attract people of colour. “If global companies want to represent the world they are targeting, they must welcome diversity and look beyond their own borders,’’ he said, citing the relative homogeneity of Italian society.

Milan has lagged the other main fashion cities of Paris, New York and London in racial diversity on the runway, according to season diversity reporting by the Fashion Spot. Capasa said the stories that fashion houses want to tell are often linked to their Italian roots, and that runway choices are linked to model agencies’ offerings since not all models come to Milan.

While many Milan fashion houses take their creative direction from women — including Miuccia Prada, Donatella Versace, Silvia Venturini Fendi and Angela Missoni — and more women than men work in the fashion industry, Capasa said efforts are needed to get more women into decision-making roles.

“If we look at the boards, at the CEOs, at other key roles, there might be an advantage for men,’’ Capasa said. “But we don’t want to introduce quotas obligating companies to promote women. We want to create the conditions so that women can have the same chances.’’ The chamber’s manifesto does not include hard commitments. Instead, it presents concepts that “will serve as a model for a radical reform in terms of diversity and inclusion.’’

They were adopted by the chamber’s more than 100 members, which include most major Milan fashion houses with the notable exception of Dolce&Gabbana, and will be monitored every year for progress. They call for changing representations of the standards of beauty on runways and in magazine campaigns, acknowledging that “canons of physical beauty and harmful psychological models have spread throughout the industry.’’ They also present inclusion as a business opportunity that can boost financial results while improving trust with clients.

Gucci and Prada have independently made efforts to address the scandals. Gucci’s efforts include launching a scholarship programme to reach students who have been underrepresented in the fashion industry, while Prada announced a diversity council headed by two Americans, artist Theaster Gates and film director Ava DuVernay.

Capasa put the fashion chamber’s initiatives in the context of an ever more globalised industry where 2.5 billion people follow the fashion world on social media accounts and can, with a single post, shift a fashion company’s fortunes.

Meanwhile the centre of fashion’s commercial gravity has shifted to Asia, with Chinese consumers accounting for 90 per cent of luxury sales growth last year, according to a study by the consultancy Bain & Co.

“The push to speak about diversity of inclusion comes directly from the fact that globalisation made us understand that you cannot speak in the same way that you spoke before,” Capasa said. “The audience has become much bigger.’’",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/look-beyond-the-borders-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/look-beyond-the-borders.html
202,14-1-20,When East meets West,"French artist and Zen practitioner Guyseika presents a series of works, which has been inspired by his trysts with spirituality and culture across East Asia. By Team Viva

There are swirling vortexes, ascetic figures and tigers that consume the walls of exhibition of French artist and Zen practitioner Guyseika’s works at the Alliance Francaise. The diverse elements have a common thread of Asian influence which lend the exhibition its title of Threads through Asia.

Inspired from the traditional Buddhist art of several Asian countries, mixed with imagery from popular culture and his own interpretation, Guyseika weaves together elements of Asian culture and abstract expressionism. Deeply meditative, his Buddhism-influenced works are a unique rendition of the Orient and Occident.

The show gives a glimpse into the 22 years of Guyseika’s Zen practice and artistic exploration. He threads together traditional Zen and Taoist painting of China and Japan, shamanism, mandalas and folk rituals of India with Tibetan thangkas. It features over 50 contemplative works in various media.

Guyseika said he found Asia fascinating since childhood as his grandmother hailed from Vietnam. Having travelled extensively across the East Asian countries, Guyseika finally started practicing Zen with a Japanese master. He later voyaged across India and by the time he returned to Paris, his works were strongly dominated by his experiences. He earlier said, “I had also been fascinated with the spiritual and geometric forms of yantras and mandalas and the ritual use of pigments, which one can find in abundance in India.” Being a multi-dimensional artist, he has written several novels and poetry compilations and also plays electronic music in underground concerts.

Jaya Jaitly, president, Dastkari Haat Samiti, said, “In the midst of all the pandemonium around us, Guyseika offers beauty, calm and gentleness through his intensely thoughtful works. I believe we all need to internalise such feelings to maintain our balance in today’s fast-paced world.”

Writer Sameer Abraham Thomas said, “Guyseika immersed himself in the ancient art of the Zen monks and Taoist sages, shamanic visions, Tibetan thangkas, Hindu mythology and folk art so much that he expressed these cultures through his words and images as though they were his own. He never quite turned his back on the world of abstract expressionism, street art and punk rock.”

With bold, colourful strokes, Guyseika’s works in acrylic on canvas represent fluid, dreamlike forms and visualise his affinity for the mountains — where much of his Zen practice took place. His works imagine Buddhist visuals mixed with manga, tattoo, street art and surfing culture. Other traditional series are of Zen inks, which are reminiscent of Asian calligraphy. The artist has also captured the fleeting present moment through shades of blue, red, purple and black on white handmade paper. Rooted in Buddhist philosophy, his works often illustrate a short poem which present the simple yet profound teachings of Tao (the path). Some of his Japanese influences have been poems by Han Shan, Ryokan and Ikkyu and Basho.

So what was Guyseika’s aim? He said, “It was to confront and mix different cosmogonies in order to create a mythical world neighbouring and questioning our ordinary reality.”

Thomas added, “Guyseika’s Buddhist inspirations are amply evident in his work, though they are also illuminated by a penchant for quirky captions in French and English.”

His works like Kat and Dragon Posture make layered psychedelic icons redolent of punk and comic book art with their simplicity and fantastic imagery.

Thomas pointed out, “Guyseika’s use of stamps, which resemble the Japanese hankos lend a sense of authenticity to the series.”

Mountains return in Guyseika’s series of mandala drawings made on textured handmade paper in natural pigments and crayons from the Avani-Kumaon cooperative, whose vegetable dyes and pigments Guyseika has a fondness for. In the mandalas, the mountain motif is distilled into the geometric shapes of circles and triangles.

203,14-1-20,An ode to traditions,"Khamir’s exhibition Desi Oon showcases how rural and urban communities come together to encourage indigenous crafts in a lesson for humanity, says Uma Nair

The portrait of a Meghuban Rabari spinner from Vemora village is one of the many images that strike a chord when you look at Khamir Kutch’s presentation, Desi Oon. The four-day exhibition at Bikaner House celebrates the indigenous wool of Kutch and is a summation of many odysseys in the language of regional symbolism.

Khamir Kachchh

Khamir is a platform for preserving and facilitating the crafts, heritage and cultural ecology of the Kutch or Kachchh region of Gujarat. It was instituted in the aftermath of the 2001 earthquake with the objective of engagement and development of Kutch’s rich, creative industries. In more ways than one, its very foundation is built on the dynamics of reclamation and recreation of indigenous identities in craft and heritage.

Desi Oon, Khamir’s exhibition of shawls, dhurries, shoes and handbags becomes a repertoire that translates tradition into modernity as it echoes the essence of an extraordinarily intriguing journey seeking to familiarise us with the local craft of spinning, weaving and dyeing wool. A rare opportunity is the presence of some of Kutch’s most respected artisans and herders, sharing secrets about the intricacies of wool craft and herding.

Khamir collaborated with weavers, spinners, dyers, felters and designers to organise this exhibition. This is a first step in a series of events planned by the organisation to put the spotlight on the utility of indigenous wool to urban consumer markets.

Immersive experience

The exhibition is an immersive experience with film visuals, images and exquisitely crafted textiles, which narrates the story of the indigenous wool of Kutch. Workshops are conducted on Desi Retiya (Charkha) along with a Takli/Dhera (Spindle)-spinning demo. Besides, a felting demo and workshop, a Kutchchi embroidery workshop with wool, the demonstrations of Tangaliya-weaving and Tabariya bag-craft are lessons for life.

“We are grateful to the Centre for Pastoralism (CfP), Asian Heritage Foundation and HT Parekh Foundation, for making this exhibition possible. All exhibited products undergo value addition and wool treatment facilitated by Khamir. It is hopeful that the story of wool and sensitively designed woollen products will help sway consumer preferences in favour of indigenous woollen items in households and closets,” says Paresh Mangaliya, deputy director, Khamir.

Regional realities of textiles

The success of the venture lay in the weaving in of textural and textile-based thinking and practices that celebrated the regional realities and possibilities for textile crafts and wool strategies. The sight of the shawls and the images of different yarns drying in the sun brings forth many memories in history such as that of active decolonising initiatives and the richness of unearthing overlooked bodies of knowledge that go back to 5,000 years of the Indus Valley Civilisation.

The exhibition also brings home the truth of the economic model that needs to studied. The integrity of craft value chains is dependent on local availability of raw materials. Sheep herding systems are of special importance for wool craft. Such systems are also special because of their low carbon footprints. They are invaluable in arid regions such as Kutch. They are also a source of food, raw materials for crafters and fertilisers for farmers and continue to conserve complex ecosystems.

Cultural and historical practice

One of the roles of institutions, like Khamir is to engage with the current issues and to be a mirror to society in reclaiming heritage practices in textiles in villages that have deep historic roots. In grappling with these issues, it is integral to have deeper knowledge about the state of our societies, our collective futures, the language of textiles and creative journeys. The beauty of the contemporary and traditional meld in design dynamics in the dhurries and shawls. It ignite the beauty of thought and the structural threads of thought that can rule our yearning to be partakers of the process of utility and economic interdependence.

Exhibitions like Desi Oon relate to an urban rural connectivity. It helps us to articulate through art the complexities of our realities. Textiles have a unique power of affirming the intrinsic power of artistic work, to become a keystone in everyday practices.

Remembering the earthquake and its aftermath in 2001 brings us to the need for sensitivity. The ability of our interventions to flourish artistically in fraught and dire situations, to create new journeys that progress over time, speak of the true power of society. When rural and urban communities come together to empower and encourage indigenous crafts and heritage practices, it becomes a lesson for humanity.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-ode-to-traditions-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/an-ode-to-traditions.html

Curated by Amarrass Records, Amarrass Nights, a mesmerising musical evening took place at Bagh-e-Azeem, at the capital’s Sunder Nursery. The performances by Rajasthani folk artists Ghewar and Firoze Khan, and Qawwali group Rehmat-e-Nusrat from Uttarakhand took the music enthusiasts back to their roots. Amarrass records other than hosting these two exciting new groups also highlighted the endangered folk instrument “Kamaicha” in the music performances leaving the Dilliwallah spellbound. It aims to showcase lesser known folk and traditional artists. It’s records are poised to host monthly series of music concerts at Sunder Nursery, Nizamuddin which serves as a platform to curate forthcoming folk and traditional artists from India and introduces new collaborations and artist exchanges.

The night embarked with the performance of brother duo Ghewar & Firoze Khan from Rajasthan. The Khan brothers with their “Kamaicha” and the “Dholak” gave a range of their musical repertoire, Ghewar opened the concert by playing the sound of moving train on Kamaicha, then the duo sang songs in Raag Khamaji, followed by a bhajan — “Bhola Shambu kya pooch jaat hamari” — dedicated to Lord Shiva. They sang folklore inspired by bird and Lord Krishna and Radha. The rustic notes from Ghewarji’s Kamaicha proved that it’s great legacy is still alive and needs to be preserved. Their performance depicted the raw beauty of Rajasthan’s landscape.

After the tunes of the deserts of Rajasthan, it was time for the Sufiana Qawwalis to take the stage at the Sunder Nursery, Qawwali group Rehmat-e-Nusrat from Uttarakhand, gave beauteous tribute to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with their performance.

Talking about his group lead vocalist, Sarvjeet Tamta said, “People always try to preserve and protect the things that are on the verge of getting extinct, traditional Qawwali form is one of those things and there are very few groups in India who perform the traditional Qawwali. Since the inception of our group we have always tried to preserve the traditional Qawwali.

JLo inspired Fleabag: Phoebe

Fleabag creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge said singer-actress Jennifer Lopez and dirty Latin words acted as sources of inspiration for her hit award-winning series.

She revealed her inspiration while accepting the win for Best Comedy Series at the 25th annual Critics Choice Awards.

Phoebe gave special thanks to her sister and Fleabag composer Isobel Waller-Bridge, saying that her music had “covered and elevated” the “slightly mediocre bits” of the show, sharing a “little secret.”

She said, “She put in a little secret in for anyone who can speak Latin, but all the words that the thing is is singing in Latin during the songs are completely filthy. So thank you for the support.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-01-14.html
206,14-1-20,"‘Char din ki chandni hoti hai, Test cricket nahi’","“A fish out of water is a dead fish” — This is how Virender Sehwag described the ICC’s plan to revamp Test cricket by shortening it to four days, asserting that innovation should not mean tinkering with the soul of the format.

Delivering the ‘MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture’ at the annual BCCI awards on Sunday night, Sehwag relied on some classic Hindi idioms to drive home the point that innovation in the longest form should stop at day/night matches.

“Chaar din ki chandni hoti hai, Test match nahi...Jal ki machli jal main hi acchi hai, bahar nikaloge toh mar jaegi,” he said in his inimitable style.

“...Test cricket ko chanda mama ke pass le jaa sakte hai. We can have Day-Night Test cricket. If there is a day-night Test, maybe people will come to watch game after office. Innovations should happen but within the five days. It should not be shortened” he asserted.

The ICC will consider the proposal to make Test cricket four-dayers during its cricket committee meeting in March.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---char-din-ki-chandni-hoti-hai--test-cricket-nahi---.html

Returning to the court after two years, Sania and Kichenok prevailed 2-6 7-6 (3) 10-3 over Oksana Kalashnikova of Georgia and Japan's Miyu Kato in a contest lasting one hour and 41 minutes.

The Indo-Ukrainian pair will next be up against Americans Vania King and Christina McHale.

The US combination upstaged fourth-seeded Spainish duo of Georgina Garcia Perez and Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-2 7-5 in a round of 16 clash.

In an engaging showdown, Sania and Kichenok weren't off to a particularly good start as they double-faulted twice, failed to convert any of the seven break points that came their way and lost their serve two times to go down 2-6 in the opening set.

However, they pulled things back in the second set, helped by their rivals' inconsistent game.

Both the teams converted three break points each as the set went into a tie-breaker in which Sania and Kichenok nosed ahead of their opponents to draw even.

Sania and Kichenok raised the bar in the final set and displayed superior returns to emerge triumphant.

During her two years away from the game, the 33-year-old Sania battled injury breakdowns before taking a formal break in April 2018 to give birth to her son Izhaan. The Hyderabadi is married to Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik.

The 33-year-old last played at China Open in October 2017.

A trailblazer in Indian tennis, Sania is a former world No.1 in doubles and has six Grand Slam titles to her credit.

She retired from the singles competition in 2013 after becoming the most successful Indian woman tennis player ever.

In 2007, she attained a career-high 27th position in the WTA singles chart.

However, she has also been hampered by career-threatening wrist and knee injuries.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sania-makes-winning-return-to-wta-circuit--enters-women-s-doubles-qfs-of-hobart-international-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sania-makes-winning-return-to-wta-circuit--enters-women-s-doubles-qfs-of-hobart-international.html
208,14-1-20,Ganguly says playing under pressure tougher than BCCI president's job,"BCCI president Sourav Ganguly says managing administration is a lot easier than being a player as batting is mostly a one-chance game.

The former India captain was speaking during the Sportstar Aces Awards here on Monday.

Asked what was tougher between being a player and BCCI president, Ganguly had no hesitation while responding to the question.

""It was tougher playing under pressure, because it was one chance while batting, that was lot difficult. Here (as BCCI President) if I make a mistake, I come back next and get it rectified, there if you nicked (Glenn) McGrath outside the off stump..."" Ganguly said.

From his time to now, Ganguly feels the pace of the game has changed.

Batting great Sunil Gavsakar, who successfully stood up to some of the best fast bowlers of all time, also felt administration is easier.

""Yes, I did (hold the office of BCCI president) for a couple of months in 2014, when the Supreme Court appointed me president of the BCCI, IPL, I did it. It was easy,"" Gavaskar said.

Asked what he feels has changed over the years in cricket, Gavaskar pointed to fitness.

""I think the fitness, they (players) are much fitter than we were playing, much more stronger and they can hit the ball a fair distance, (they are) physically fit and agile,"" Gavaskar said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ganguly-says-playing-under-pressure-tougher-than-bcci-president-s-job-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ganguly-says-playing-under-pressure-tougher-than-bcci-president-s-job.html

210,14-1-20,Opposition unity important for protests: Amartya Sen,"Days after demanding that the amended citizenship act be scrapped, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen on Monday stressed the importance of opposition unity to carry out any protest for a cause.

However, he said even in the absence of opposition unity, protests can continue.

The economist was answering journalists here over the countrywide CAA-NPR-NRC protests.

""For any kind of protest, opposition unity is important. Then protests become easier. Unity is important if the protest is for a proper cause,"" Sen told journalists here on Monday night.

""But even if unity is not there, then that doesn't mean we will stop protesting. As I said, unity makes protest easier but if unity is not there still we have to move on and do whatever is necessary,"" Sen said.

Earlier, speaking at Nabanita Deb Sen Memorial Lecture, the economist said viewing oppositional reasoning as quarrelsome would be a big mistake.

""It is necessary to emphasise the subtleties of the innovative forces of the opposition... We need to know more about what I am protesting about. The head must also join with the heart in protest,"" Sen said in his speech.

""When there seems to be a big mistake in the Constitution or human rights, there will surely be reasons to protest,"" Sen said.

Deb Sen, who passed away at her Kolkata residence last November, was the economist's first wife.

A few days ago, Sen, who has been critical of the Narendra Modi-led Union government, said the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act should be scrapped.

""I think the CAA must be scrapped because it cannot be an Act ... That's the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution,"" the Nobel laureate had said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/opposition-unity-important-for-protests--amartya-sen-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/opposition-unity-important-for-protests--amartya-sen.html
211,14-1-20,"If unemployment rises and incomes decline, youth may explode in anger: Chidambaram","Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday attacked the Modi government over the state of the economy, saying if unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is a danger of youth and students ""exploding in anger"".

""The nation is engrossed with the anti-CAA, anti-NPR protests. Both present a clear and present danger,"" Chidambaram said.

The sliding economy is an even greater threat to the country, the former finance minister said in a series of tweets.

""If unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is the danger of youth and students exploding in anger,"" he said.

Chidambaram also attacked the government over the rising consumer price index (CPI) inflation.

Retail inflation jumped sharply to 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI's comfort level, mainly due to high food prices, government data showed on Monday.

The retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 2.11 per cent in December 2018 and 5.54 per cent in November 2019.

""The circle of incompetent management is complete. Mr Narendra Modi's government started in July 2014 with CPI inflation at 7.39 per cent. In December 2019, it was 7.35 per cent,"" Chidambaram said.

The Congress leader's comments come a day after data showed that retail inflation rose to about five-and-half year high of 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI's comfort level, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables as onions were selling costlier.

Priyanka Gandhi accused the government of picking pockets of the common man and also taking away their livelihood.

""The prices of vegetables and other edible commodities is getting out of reach of the common man. What will the poor eat when vegetables, oil, pulses and flour turns expensive.

213,14-1-20,Muzaffarpur case: Court seeks CBI response on Thakur's plea claiming witnesses not reliable,"A Delhi court on Tuesday sought response of the CBI on a plea filed by Brajesh Thakur, prime accused in a case of alleged sexual and physical assault of several girls in a Muzaffarpur shelter home, claiming that testimonies of witnesses in the case were not reliable.

Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha directed the CBI to file its reply within two days and deferred for the third time pronouncement of judgement in the case till November 20.

The plea filed through advocate P K Dubey said the prosecution witnesses were not of sterling quality.

The plea was filed as the probe agency had given a statement in the Supreme Court that the girls, who were thought to be allegedly murdered, were alive, said advocate Dheeraj Kumar, representing some of the accused in the case.

The court had earlier deferred the order till January 14 as the judge was on leave and prior to it, the judgment was deferred by a month as 20 accused, who are currently lodged in Tihar central jail, could not be brought to court premises due to lawyers' strike in all six district courts in the national capital.

The court had on March 20, 2018, framed charges against the accused, including Thakur, for offences of criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault against minors.

The accused included eight women and 12 men.

The Court had held trial for the offences of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, drugging of minors, criminal intimidation among other charges.

Thakur and employees of his shelter home, as well as Bihar department of social welfare officials were charged with criminal conspiracy, neglect of duty and failure to report assault on the girls.

The charges also included offence of cruelty to child under their authority, punishable under the Juvenile Justice Act.

All the accused, who appeared before the court, pleaded innocence and claimed trial.

The offences entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

The court had reserved order on September 30 after final arguments by the CBI counsel and 20 accused in the case in which former Bihar Social Welfare Minister and the then JD(U) leader Manju Verma also faced flak as allegations surfaced that Thakur had links with her husband.

She had resigned from her post on August 8, 2018.

The CBI had told a special court that there was enough evidence against all the accused in the case.

However, those accused have claimed that the CBI had not conduct a ""fair investigation"" into the case, which has been registered under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and entails life imprisonment as the maximum punishment.

Additional Sessions Judge Kulshreshtha, during the in-camera trial, concluded the arguments in the case.

The case was transferred on February 7 from a local court in Muzaffarpur in Bihar to a POCSO court at Saket district court complex in Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions.

During the trial, counsel for the CBI told the court that the statements of minor girls, who were allegedly sexually assaulted, point to the fact that there was enough evidence against all the accused and they should be convicted.

The matter had come to light after the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) submitted a report to the Bihar government on May 26, 2018, highlighting the alleged sexual abuse of minor girls in the shelter home for the first time.

On May 29 last year, the state government shifted the girls from the shelter home to other protection homes. In May 31, 2018, an FIR was lodged against the 11 accused in the case.

The top court had on August 2 taken cognisance of the alleged sexual assault of about 30 minor girls in Muzaffarpur's shelter home and transferred the probe to the CBI on November 28.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/muzaffarpur-shelter-home-case--delhi-court-defers-verdict-till-jan-20-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/muzaffarpur-case--court-seeks-cbi-response-on-thakur-s-plea-claiming-witnesses-not-reliable.html
214,14-1-20,Mumbai take control against TN,"A disciplined bowling effort helped Mumbai reduce Tamil Nadu to 249 for 7 in their first innings to take control of their Ranji Trophy Group B match on Monday.

Tamil Nadu now trail by 239 runs at stumps on the third and penultimate day. Mumbai had earlier scored 488 in first innings.

Shams Mulani (2/59), Tushar Deshpande (2/47) and Royston Dias (2/34) took two wickets each for the visitors.

A middle-order collapse which saw the home side lose three wickets without a run being scored reduced them to 178 for 5 and subsequently to 195 for 7 before the experienced R Ashwin (32 batting, 96 balls, 2 fours) and R Sai Kishore (17 batting) came up with a rearguard action.

The two added 54 runs and played out the final session, frustrating Mumbai and making skipper Aditya Tare try out several bowlers.

Jalaj stars in Kerala win

Thiruvananthapuram: All-rounder Jalaj Saxena picked up seven wickets for 51 runs with his off-spin to guide Kerala to a 21-run win over Punjab in a low-scoring Group A match.

Chasing a meagre 146 runs for win, Punjab lost wickets at regular intervals with Saxena turning out to the star for Kerala on the third and penultimate day of the four-day match.

Besides Saxena, left-arm orthodox bowlers Sijomon Joseph (2/37) and M D Nidheesh (1/18) were the other wicket takers as Kerala shot out Punjab for 124 in 46.1 overs in their second innings.

Lower-order batsmen Mayank Markande (23) and Siddharth Kaul (22) were the top-scorers for Punjab even as skipper Mandeep Singh (10), Sanvir Singh (18) and Gurkeerat Singh (18) failed miserably in what should have been an easy chase.

Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 88 for five, Kerala were bundled out for 136 in 39.5 overs in their second innings, setting a gettable target of 146 for Punjab.

Akshay Chandran top-scored with 31, while Kaul (5/39) and Gurkeerat (4/4/45) shone with the ball for Punjab.

Kerala pocketed six points by virtue of the outright win.

In Ongole, Andhra need seven more wickets on the final day to register an innings win over Hyderabad.

At stumps, Hyderabad are still trailing Andhra by 219 runs with seven wickets in hand.

In Jaipur, Rajasthan made 327 for seven in their first innings in reply to Gujarat’s 325.

Haryana three wickets

Rohtak: Odisha needed 32 runs while Haryana required three wickets, leaving their Group C clash tantalisingly poised.

As many as 12 wickets tumbled at the Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium in Lahli with Odisha medium pacer Suryakant Pradhan claiming 5/86 and also effecting a run-out to help Odisha seize control in the first hour.

Folded for 90 in their first innings, Haryana staged a fightback to see through the second day on 218 for five.

But Pradhan’s stupendous bowling ensured that they lost the remaining five wickets for 30 runs inside the first hour, setting a paltry target of 179.

It was time for Haryana medium pacer Ajit Chahal to grab the limelight with his 6/65 as Odisha made a mockery of the chase to find themselves reeling at 147/7 at close of play.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mumbai-take-control-against-tn.html
215,14-1-20,Windies sweep Ireland,"Evin Lewis smashed a dazzling century as West Indies defeated Ireland by five wickets on Sunday to complete a 3-0 sweep of the one-day international series.

Opener Lewis hit his third one-day ton off 96 balls with six boundaries and five huge sixes at the National Stadium as West Indies reached their rain-revised target of 197 with 64 balls to spare.

The 28-year-old, left-handed Lewis had made an unbeaten 99 in the first game.

“All the hard work I’ve done in the nets has paid off,” Trinidadian Lewis said at the trophy presentation.

“This was an opportunity for my first hundred in the Caribbean, and it’s great to get a series win. I’ve been hungry for runs.”

He reached his century with a midwicket flourish off medium-pacer Craig Young before falling next ball trying for a big drive.

Earlier, leg-spinner Hayden Walsh took four wickets as Ireland were dismissed for 203.

Walsh, who starred with the bat with an undefeated 46 in Thursday’s nail-biting one-wicket win in Barbados, finished with figures of 4-36.

DJ back for T20s

Dwayne Bravo was recalled to the West Indies squad, more than three years after his last appearance as the Caribbean side build up to the defence of their World Twenty20 title.

The 36-year-old all-rounder, a two-time World T20 winner, was named in a 13-man squad for a three-match series against Ireland.

“Dwayne Bravo was recalled with the specific intention of bolstering our ‘death’ bowling which was identified as an area that really needs improving,” said chief selector Roger Harper.

“His record in this department speaks for itself. He will also be able to act as a mentor to the other ‘death’ bowlers and lend his experience wherever needed.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/windies-sweep-ireland.html
216,14-1-20,Aguero will ‘die scoring goals’,"Sergio Aguero, fresh from breaking two more goalscoring records in Sunday’s 6-1 thrashing of Aston Villa, will “die scoring goals”, according to proud Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.

The 31-year-old Argentine international broke the record for the number of goals by a non-English player, previously held by Thierry Henry, and hat-tricks (breaking Alan Shearer’s mark) in the Premier League with his 12th treble to take his tally to 177 goals since he made his Premier League debut in 2011.

“It’s an honour to be here the day he achieved that, hopefully he can score more. He will die scoring goals,” purred Guardiola.

“Sergio is one of the best, no doubt. The best is Messi, but the rest? Sergio is absolutely one of them.

“All the players in the locker room congratulated him. To break this record of an incredible legend like Thierry Henry, it means it’s not just for a short period, it’s many years.

“To be the foreign player with the most goals and hat-tricks speaks for itself.

217,14-1-20,Neymar’s brace not enough for PSG,"Neymar scored twice and created another goal but leaders Paris Saint-Germain were held to an entertaining 3-3 draw at home on Sunday by a Monaco side playing their first Ligue 1 game under new coach Robert Moreno.

The Brazilian gave PSG the lead after just two minutes at the Parc des Princes but Monaco scored two quick goals through Gelson Martins and Wissam Ben Yedder to move 2-1 ahead inside quarter of an hour.

A Fode Ballo-Toure own goal brought PSG level and Neymar restored their advantage from the penalty spot before half-time after a foul on Kylian Mbappe.

But Monaco, who also host PSG tomorrow in a rearranged fixture, earned a point when Islam Slimani’s goal was controversially awarded after it was initially ruled out for offside.

“We didn’t put in our best performance but we tried. It was a good test. Monaco have a good team but we are superior and we must show it on the pitch,” Neymar told Canal+.

“If we had played at our best we would have taken the three points.

“I think on the third goal, the fact our defender touched the ball wasn’t intentional but the decision falls to the referee. They have VAR for that, we can’t complain. We weren’t perfect tonight either.”

The draw represented a positive start for former Spain coach Moreno, who replaced Leonardo Jardim at the end of December.

“We should be very happy. I’m very pleased with my players and I want to congratulate them for a great match,” said Moreno.

“We played to our strengths on the counter-attack. We think we can beat any team and that’s what I tell my players. That’s our philosophy.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/neymar---s-brace-not-enough-for-psg.html
218,14-1-20,"Momota hurt, driver killed in crash","Badminton world number one Kento Momota was injured and his driver was killed in a crash near Kuala Lumpur on Monday just hours after he won the Malaysia Masters.

Police said the Japanese star, 25, suffered a broken nose and cuts to his face when the van carrying him to the city’s airport crashed early in the morning, in a blow to his preparations for this year’s Tokyo Olympics.

The driver was killed at the scene after the vehicle collided with a slow-moving lorry on a highway. An assistant coach, physiotherapist, and badminton official also suffered minor injuries.

The accident came after the dominant Japanese star began his 2020 season in style Sunday with victory over Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen in Kuala Lumpur.

“It’s truly tragic, especially involving a badminton icon like Momota,” Malaysian sports minister Syed Saddiq told reporters, after visiting the injured in hospital south of the capital.

But he added those hurt were “recovering well, (and) all four are also in stable condition”.

The others hurt suffered facial, leg, hand and head injuries, according to police.

Badminton Association of Malaysia said in a statement they were “saddened” by the crash.

The accident happened around 4:40 am (20:40 GMT Sunday), and 10 firefighters rushed to the scene, senior fire and rescue department official Norazam Khamis said.

The injured “were able to walk out of the van by themselves with some scratches”, he added. Pictures showed the front of the van crushed against a lorry but the back section appeared intact.

219,14-1-20,Cristiano brings Juve back on top,"Cristiano Ronaldo stretched his goal-scoring streak to six consecutive league games as Juventus took top spot in Serie A on Sunday with a 2-1 win at Roma, whose defeat was made worse by the cruciate ligament injury of rising star Nicolo Zaniolo.

Juventus move two points ahead of Inter Milan, who were held 1-1 by Atalanta, after going two goals up in just 10 minutes in Rome.

“We were very good for 60 minutes. Then, if you play against Roma, it is almost inevitable to suffer in the end,” said Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri.

Turkish defender Merih Demiral found a way through after three minutes when he connected with a Paulo Dybala free-kick.

Minutes later Argentine Dybala was hauled down in the box, and Ronaldo stepped up to convert from the spot to make it nine goals in six league games.

“It’s tough playing against a team like Juventus and we gave away two early goals,” said Roma coach Paulo Fonseca.

“We put in a good performance after that, against a great side. But once you go two goals down, it’s difficult.”

Both sides had casualties in the first half with Demiral limping off with a knee injury not long after scoring his first Juventus goal.

And Zaniolo was stretchered off in tears eight minutes before the break after falling victim to what Roma later confirmed was a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while trying to dribble past Matthijs De Ligt and Adrien Rabiot.

Zaniolo, who is considered one of Italy’s most exciting young talents and was a rare bright point for Roma in a torrid first half, underwent surgery on Monday.

“I swear to you ... I’ll be stronger than before,” the 20-year-old later wrote on Instagram.

Roma had their chances with Edin Dzeko hitting the post and Wojciech Szczesny denying Cengiz Under from point-blank range.

Diego Perotti pulled a goal back for the hosts from the penalty spot on 68 minutes after an Alex Sandro handball.

However, the capital side drop to fifth, outside the Champions League places, level on 35 points with fourth-placed Atalanta and seven behind local rivals Lazio.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cristiano-brings-juve-back-on-top.html
220,14-1-20,Zizou maintains 100% record,"Thibaut Courtois proved the hero on Sunday as Real Madrid beat city rivals Atletico Madrid in a penalty shoot-out in Saudi Arabia to win their 11th Spanish Super Cup.

Courtois and Jan Oblak were both imperious during a goalless final but the Belgian came up trumps, saving Thomas Partey’s penalty after Saul Niguez had already hit the post.

Sergio Ramos tucked away the winning spot-kick to ensure Real Madrid clinched their first trophy of the season, with La Liga and the Champions League next in their sights.

“I went through their takers on the bench,” said Courtois. “Saul’s surprised me but Thomas’ I read, and he’s got a very hard shot.”

Atletico might have won it in extra-time when Alvaro Morata went through one-on-one but Real’s Federico Valverde took a red card in exchange for cynically fouling the striker from behind.

“It was something you shouldn’t do and I apologised to Alvaro but it was the only option I had left,” said Valverde.

“It was the most important moment of the match,” added Atletico coach Diego Simeone.

“If he had gone through it was a goal but I told him that anyone would have done the same in his position.”

Victory maintains Zinedine Zidane’s spotless record as a coach in finals.

He has now led Madrid to success three times in the Champions League, and two each in the Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup and now Spanish Super Cup.

“I have won many things as a player and now as a coach,” said Zidane. “But I congratulate the players. You can achieve anything if you work hard enough.”

And although the final lacked goals and quality finishing, there was drama until the end and joy on the faces of Real Madrid’s players as Ramos hoisted another trophy under the fireworks.

Both teams had good chances to win it late on, with Luka Jovic’s deflected cross finding Valverde free five yards out but the midfielder’s header hit his own knee before drifting harmlessly over.

Then Atletico might have nicked it as Kieran Trippier clipped an excellent pass over the top for Morata, who opted for accuracy rather than power and Courtois was able to push away.

Into extra-time and, with 105 minutes on the clock, Courtois did well to flash out a leg and block Morata’s acrobatic effort while Oblak twice denied Real, first a curling shot from Luka Modric and then a follow-up from Mariano Diaz.

Yet the most dramatic moment was still to come as Saul sent Morata clean through, with only Courtois to beat, before the chasing Valverde scythed him down from behind.

The red card was inevitable but Atletico only had a free-kick and, for four minutes, a one-man advantage. Trippier hit the free-kick into the wall and Real held on for penalties.

Carvajal found the corner but Saul struck the post, despite sending Courtois the wrong way. Rodrygo coolly put Real two ahead and Thomas missed, this time Courtois diving right and palming clear.

Modric swept into the corner before Trippier did the same. It was left to Ramos to hit the winning shot.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zizou-maintains-100--record-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/zizou-maintains-100--record.html

225,14-1-20,"With greater tech use and mega campaigns, hopeful voter turnout will rise: Delhi CEO","The Delhi polls will see more thrust on use of technology complemented with massive campaigns in the run-up, Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh said on Tuesday and hoped the twin-edged strategy will lead to a greater turnout than in 2015.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, Singh said his office will soon launch a mega, multi-domain outdoor campaign ahead of the February 8 elections to draw large number of electorate to the polling booths.

""The 2020 Delhi polls will be tech-driven with greater use of technology elements like mobile apps, QR codes, social media interface, seeking to enhance the experience of all categories of voters, before polling or on the voting day. And we are trying to make the best use of it,"" he said.

According to Singh, focussed campaigns have been planned by his office to reach out to different sections of voters, aiming to break the ""urban apathy"" of the electorate.

""We are soon going to launch a very focussed massive outdoor publicity campaign to appeal to voters to exercise their franchise. Under this, metro stations and select coaches on certain corridors, bus shelters, and other public places having high footfall will be used,"" Singh told PTI.

He said the CEO Office has also partnered with 'Josh Talks' platform to reach out to young electorate and first-time voters.

""They (Josh Talks) approached us few days ago, and we have decided to partner with them. They will conduct talk sessions in colleges and other institutions to target young voters,"" Singh said.

Besides, two more ambassadors have been roped in, popular radio jockey Naved Khan and Kathak dancer Alaknanda Dasgupta to spread the message to voters, while sportspersons Manika Batra and Rishabh Pant will continue to endorse our campaigns.

""Their faces, along with new slogans coined for the outdoor campaign will be seen on publicity material for greater reach. I am very hopeful that greater use of technology and these huge campaigns will significantly contribute to push the voter turnout higher this time compared to that in the last Assembly polls,"" Singh said.

In 2015 Assembly polls, Delhi saw a turnout of about 67 per cent, while it was about 60 per cent in Lok Sabha elections last year.

Nominations for the high-stakes Delhi elections kicked off on Tuesday with poll authorities issuing the notification for the February 8 polls.

Elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly promises to be a triangular contest with the AAP hoping to retain power on the plank of development and the BJP and the Congress determined to put up a spirited challenge.

The counting of votes will be taken up on February 11.

Over 1.46 crore voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the February 8 Assembly election in Delhi, according to the final electoral roll.

Over 2 lakh among them are first-time voters, Singh said.

226,14-1-20,Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik to retire on Jan 31 after a tumultuous tenure,"Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Kumar Patnaik will retire on January 31, after a tumultuous tenure during which the force faced several challenges including student agitation and a protest by its own personnel.

""Consequent upon attaining the age of superannuation, Amulya Kumar Patnaik, IPS (1985), Commissioner of Police, Delhi, shall stand retired from government service with effect from January 31,"" a Delhi government order said.

The city government's home department issued the order on January 8 after the approval of Lt Governor Anil Baijal.

""It is a routine order and mandatorily issued in respect of government servant who is to attain superannuation in order to update the government record,"" a police source said.

Assembly elections have been announced in the national capital and the model code of conduct is in force.

Sources aware of the development recently said the government had informed the poll panel, before the Model Code of Conduct came into force in Delhi on January 6, that it was looking for a replacement of Patnaik.

The polls, to be held on February 8, were announced on January 6. The results of elections will be declared on February 11.

The Delhi Police comes under the central government.

Patnaik, who became the Delhi police chief in 2017, had a challenging tenure.

Scores of Delhi Police personnel, in an unprecedented move, took to the streets in 2019 demanding dignity and protection after some of them were allegedly beaten up by lawyers.

This had presented the city police and its top brass in a poor light.

The Delhi Police's handling of the protests at the Jamia Millia Islamia against the amended citizenship law also came under criticism as cops entered the library and hostel rooms and allegedly beat up students, leaving many of them injured.

227,14-1-20,7.3% inflation ties Budget down,"66-month high retail inflation a challenge for Govt, RBI to plan policy intervention

Retail inflation galloped to 66-month high of 7.35 per cent posing a new challenge to the Modi Government ahead of the Union Budget. This is second time that the inflation rate has reared its head so high since Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister in July 2014. The previous high in retail inflation was witnessed at 7.39 per cent in July 2014.

The sharp rise in inflation means your money parked in bank fix deposit will give you negative return in majority of the saving schemes. It will also narrow down the Government’s option to bring in fiscal stimulus in the Budget to revive the sinking economy.

With fiscal deficit veering around 5.5 per cent — if the provisions for food subsidy and scheme and highway building projects (both have been taken off the Budget and handed over to FCI and NHAI) are taken in to account — the rising inflation poses a new challenge to the Government. Economists feel that if the fiscal deficit of the States is included, India is staring at a 8 per cent fiscal deficit scenario.

The rise in inflation also ties the RBI down to making any monetary policy intervention to stimulate the economy.

Under this scenario, the Government can ill afford to cut down personal income tax. While this will be a popular measure which will put more money in the hands of the common man, it will also nudge up inflation and add to the fiscal deficit by impacting revenue collection.

The rise in inflation can be attributed to sharp rise in prices of food and vegetable prices, including onion, and tomato. According to the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday, vegetables inflation rose to 60.5 per cent in December from 36 per cent in November.

Prices of vegetables shot up 60.5 per cent, with a 53.37 per cent increase in urban areas and 75 per cent hike in rural areas. Most of the vegetables were sold between `40 and 80 a kg since October last year. Onion prices also touched `200 a kg in some parts of the country last month.

Besides, prices of tomato, cabbage, carrot, green coriander leaves, lady finger, and potato are still high in the retail markets. Prices of pulses, milk and other food products have increased in the recent months.

Prices of pulses and products rose 15.44 per cent. In case of “meat and fish” it was nearly 10 per cent. The inflation in eggs was recorded 8.57 per cent while in case of spices it was nearly 6 per cent. Overall, the inflation rate of the food and beverages category was 12.16 per cent.

As per the Government data, the food inflation rose to 14.12 per cent in December as against (-) 2.65 per cent in the same month of 2018. It was 10.01 per cent in November 2019. The retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 2.11 per cent in December 2018 and 5.54 per cent in November 2019. In July 2014, the CPI was 7.39 per cent, a tad higher than December 2019’s number of 7.35 per cent. CPI was 2.11 per cent in December 2018. The inflation rate was recorded 4.62 per cent in October, 2019.

As per the data, urban food inflation increased to 16.12 per cent compared to 12.3 per cent the previous month. Clothing and footwear inflation was at 1.5 per cent in December compared to 1.3 per cent in November. Housing inflation stood at 4.3 per cent compared to 4.5 per cent last month. Rural food inflation rose to 12.97 per cent in December 2019 as against 8.8 per cent in November 2019. Not a single item showed decrease in prices in December. Prices of fuel and light increased the least, by just 0.7 per cent.

The Central Government has mandated the RBI to keep inflation in the range of 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on the either side. The RBI is scheduled to announce its next bi-monthly monetary policy on February 6. In its December policy, the central bank, which had been reducing rates, had kept the repo rate unchanged citing inflationary concerns.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/7-3--inflation-ties-budget-down-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/7-3--inflation-ties-budget-down.html
228,14-1-20,Nadda to assume charge as BJP chief on Jan 20,"BJP working president JP Nadda is set to take charge as the party president on January 20, succeeding Amit Shah. Nadda was appointed BJP’s working president in July last year, after Shah was picked as the Home Minister in the Modi Government.

In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Nadda was made incharge of BJP’s election campaign committee in Uttar Pradesh, where the party convincingly defeated the formidable alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) by winning 62 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats.

Apart from handling crucial States for the BJP in the general elections, Nadda was a Cabinet Minister in the first tenure of the Modi Government and has been a member of the Parliamentary Board, the BJP’s top decision making body.

Known as part of the core team of Modi, Nadda, who was a minister in his home State of Himachal Pradesh, made rapid rise since Modi took to the centre-stage of the party in 2014. His name for the party’s top post, replacing Shah, had cropped up earlier also but for certain organisational reasons, Shah continued to head the BJP .

Nadda had played an active role in the troubled Kashmir when then BJP president Murli Manohar Joshi unfurled national flag at ‘Lal Chowk’ on January 26, 1992.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nadda-to-assume-charge-as-bjp-chief-on-jan-20.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar asked the police to look into the issue while also keeping in mind maintenance of law and order.

The court passed the order while disposing of a PIL filed by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni seeking a direction to the Delhi Police Commissioner to lift restrictions on Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh Stretch and Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15, 2019 for ongoing protests against CAA and National Register of Citizen (NRC).

It was a temporary measure but has been extended from time to time.

On Monday night, Tharoor alleged that Kejriwal is trying to have it both ways by making statements deploring the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) but has not taken any tangible action.

""He has not even shown human compassion one expects from a chief minister from victims of violence in his state. In any other state, had students been bashed up in this manner, the chief minister would have visited them and shown them some concern,"" Tharoor told a TV channel.

""Mr Kejriwal really wants power without responsibility, which we all know has been the prerogative of eunuchs for ages,"" he said.

The remark drew sharp criticism on social media as netizens accused him of ""transphobia"" and asked him to apologise to the LGBT community.

""Apologies to those who found my quote about 'power without responsibility' offensive. It's an old line from British politics, going back to Kipling & PrimeMinister Stanley Baldwin, & most recently used by Tom Stoppard.

234,14-1-20,"CAA protests: People on streets as things to be said inside Parliament were not said, says court","A court slammed Delhi Police on Tuesday for failing to show any evidence against Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, observing that people are out on the streets because things which should have been said inside Parliament were not said.

Delhi Police was behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan, Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau said, adding that even if it was, one can protest there peacefully.

Pakistan was once part of undivided India, she said.

The court's observations came while hearing bail plea of Azad, who was arrested in a case related to anti-CAA ptotests in old Delhi's Daryaganj area.

""Inside the Parliament, things which should have been said, were not said and that is why people are out on the streets. We have full right to express our views but we cannot destroy our country.

""You are behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan and even if it was Pakistan, you can go there and protest. Pakistan was a part of undivided India,"" the judge said.

The court asked the investigating officer of the police to put on record all the evidence which showed that Azad was allegedly giving incriminatory speeches at the gathering at Jama Masjid and any law which showed that the gathering there was unconstitutional.

It has put up the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.

During the hearing, police told the court they have only drone images of the gathering as evidence and no other recording.

To this, the judge said, ""Do you think Delhi police is so backward that it has no tools to record anything?

""Show me anything or any law that prohibits such gathering... Where is the violence? Who says you cannot protest...Have you read the Constitution. It is one's Constitutional right to protest.""

The court further observed that Azad, having a law degree, can also protest inside the courts.

It noted that Azad's Ambedkarite philosophy probably required more research.

""Azad is probably an Ambedkarite. Ambedkar was more closer to the Muslims, Sikhs and basically the repressed class of the society... He was a rebel of his own kind. Probably Azad has a vague idea of what he wants to say but probably not able to put it across. If you take up an issue, you do your research. And that is missing, "" the court said.

The plea, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, claimed that there was no evidence against the allegations made against Azad in the FIR and his arrest was illegal.

Azad's outfit had called for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the amended Citizenship Act on December 20, without police permission.

Other 15 people arrested in the case were granted bail by the court on January 9.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/caa-protests--people-on-streets-as-things-to-be-said-inside-parliament-were-not-said--says-court-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/caa-protests--people-on-streets-as-things-to-be-said-inside-parliament-were-not-said--says-court.html
235,14-1-20,Nirbhaya case: SC dismisses curative petitions filed by two of four death row convicts,"The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed the curative petitions filed by two of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

A 5-judge bench headed by Justice N V Ramana rejected the curative petitions filed by Vinay Sharma (26) and Mukesh Kumar (32).

The proceedings were conducted in-chamber. A curative petition is the last and final legal remedy available to a person.

The five judges were unanimous that there was no merit in the curative petitions filed by the two condemned petitioners.

""The applications for stay of execution of death sentence are also rejected. We have gone through the Curative Petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this Court in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs. Ashok Hurra & Another, reported in 2002 (4) SCC 388. Hence, the Curative Petitions are dismissed,"" the bench said.

The other members of the bench were Justices Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan.

Vinay and Mukesh had filed curative petitions on January 9.

A Delhi court had on January 7 issued death warrants against the four convicts and said they would be hanged on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail.

Two other death-row convicts, Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Gupta (25), had not filed curative petitions.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The Supreme Court had in 2017 upheld the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and a trial court.

One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail.

A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

236,14-1-20,NPR is first step to NRC: Sonia; 5 parties skip meet,"TMC, SP, BSP, allies DMK and Sena give Opp meeting a miss

At an Opposition meeting skipped by Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Trinamool Congress (TMC), and allies DMK and Shiv Sena, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday slammed the NDA Government’s divisive policies and described the national population register (NPR) as the first step to a “nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Sonia, who criticised the “shockingly partisan and brutal” crackdown by the police in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, also said though the CAA and the NRC were the immediate cause of the “nationwide spontaneous protests”, these “reflect widespread frustration and pent up anger, which is now out in the open”.

NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja, JMM leader and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, LJD chief Sharad Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha, RJD leader Manoj Jha, National Conference leader Hasnain Masoodi, besides Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were among those present at the meeting.

TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee kept away from the meeting, angry over the Congress and Left cadres unleashing violence in her State during a recent bandh call.

The DMK’s absence, however, came as a surprise.

Sources said BSP’s reason to keep away from the Opposition bandwagon was due to Congress’ poaching her party’s legislators in Rajasthan even though BSP had extended outside support to the Ashok Gehlot Government.

Shiv Sena, the Congress’ new alliance partner in Maharashtra and AAP also stayed away from the meeting. AAP Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh said his party was not invited. There was no word, however, on Shiv Sena’s absence. The party had supported CAA in the Lok Sabha but abstained in the Rajya Sabha but lately hurled allegations at NDA over the same Bill.

Sonia accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of misleading people on the amended Citizenship Act and the NRC, and claimed that their Government stands totally exposed for its inability to govern and provide security to people.

“The Prime Minister and the Home Minister have misled people. They have contradicted their own statements of only weeks ago, and continue with their provocative statements while remaining insensitive to the State suppression and violence that is increasingly becoming commonplace,” she said.

Asserting that there was “unprecedented turmoil” in the country, the Congress chief said the Government has let loose a reign of oppression, spreading hatred and trying to divide people along sectarian lines.

“The nation has watched in horror at the BJP-orchestrated assault on JNU coming so soon after what happened in Jamia (Millia Islamia), BHU (Banaras Hindu University), Allahabad University and AMU (Aligarh Muslim University) and other institutions of higher learning in other parts of the country,” she said, addressing a meeting of the Opposition attended by leaders of 20 parties.

She urged the Opposition parties to work together and thwart the designs of the Government. “The immediate cause is the CAA and NRC, but they reflect widespread frustration and pent up anger, which is now out in the open. The response of the police in UP and Delhi has been shockingly partisan and brutal,” the Congress chief said.

The real issue facing India today is the collapse of economic activity and slowing growth and development, affecting all sections of society, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, the Congress president said.

“The CAA, NPR and NRC are a package that is unconstitutional, which specifically targets the poor, the downtrodden, the SC/STs and the linguistic and religious minorities,” the resolution adopted by the parties said. “The NPR is the basis for the NRC. We demand the withdrawal of the CAA and the immediate stoppage of the nationwide NRC/NPR,” it added.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Prime Minister should have the courage to speak to the students in universities on why the economy of the country had become a disaster. “Modi was doing the biggest disservice to the nation by dividing it and distracting the attention of people, he told reporters after a meeting of the Opposition that was attended by the leaders of 20 parties,” he said.

“Modi should stand up and have the courage to speak to the youngsters of these universities on why the economy has become a disaster and why why unemployment in India is at its highest in 50 years. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister does not have the guts to do this,” Rahul said.

“I challenge the Prime Minister to go to any of the universities, stand over there without his police, without his infrastructure and tell the people what is he going to do with this country,” the Congress leader said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/npr-is-first-step-to-nrc--sonia--5-parties-skip-meet-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/npr-is-first-step-to-nrc--sonia--5-parties-skip-meet.html
237,14-1-20,Docyard : Avoid falls & fractures,"With Diabetes negatively affecting bone health and creating other clinical problems doctors need to consider the use of anti-osteoporotic drugs to supplement standard anti-Diabetes medications in patients suffering with Diabetic bone loss

Patients are often surprised to realise that they are at increased risk of various bone disorders if they are Diabetic. Given the increasing prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1 and Type 2) in India, patients should be better informed about the proper protocols to manage diabetes while ensuring that bone health is taken care of. It is a multi-pronged approach: Prevention of avoidable falls and fractures, lifestyle changes such as improved diet and weight-bearing exercises and caution in the use of certain medications.

Causes

Type 1 or Type 2, is associated with increased fracture risk. According to the World Journal of Diabetes: “Diabetes-related complications and certain antidiabetic drugs appear to further increase fracture risk, both directly and indirectly. The prevention and management of bone fragility in diabetes includes identification of patients at risk, correction of modifiable risk factors including appropriate choice of antidiabetic drugs and use of antifracture drugs with proven efficacy.”

Studies published by the US National Institutes of Health suggest that Type 1 Diabetes causes reduction in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) while Type 2 Diabetes may cause an increase in BMD. BMD is related to bone density and thus a reduction may lead to osteoporosis, a disorder that makes bones weak and more prone to fracture. On the other hand, increased BMD due to Type 2 Diabetes, while it may appear benign, is possibly due to lower rates of bone turnover (ie. creation and resorption) and increased porosity, and these could also lead to increased risk of breakage.

Skeletal fragility is now recognised as a complication of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Hence a focus on detecting Diabetic bone disease is important along with other Diabetic complications. With Diabetes negatively affecting bone health and creating other clinical problems, and treatment options potentially exacerbating these effects, doctors need to consider the use of anti-osteoporotic drugs to supplement standard anti-diabetes medications in patients suffering with Diabetic bone loss.

Prevention

Some of the complications of Diabetes like nerve damage, muscle weakness, episodes of low blood sugar, and vision problems, increase the risk of falls and may cause fractures. Hence fall prophylaxis is essential and thus detecting hypoglycaemia, orthostatic hypotension and other factors that increase the risk of falls is important. Fracture history and risk factors should be assessed in older patients with Diabetes. Proper management of blood glucose is desirable.

Treatment

Unfortunately some treatment options that are useful in treating insulin resistance have negative side effects that compound the health issues seen with diabetic bone. Antidiabetic drugs like TZD (glitazones) which have negative effects on bone health should be avoided. All SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided in diabetics with bone fragility.

Medications with a neutral or favourable effect on bone metabolism such as metformin and incretin based treatments should be the preferred treatment. Insulin is of course a major pillar in Diabetes management. For Type 1, there is little evidence of any impact on bone health. However, for Type 2, some studies suggest a non-trivial (40 to 100%) increase in the risk of bone fracture with insulin as compared to Metformin treatment.

240,14-1-20,Need to invest in mental health,"The birthday of Swami Vivekanand (January 12) is also observed as India’s National Youth Day. With a central theme of channelising youth power for nation building, the day signifies the power of investing in the young.

Young people have come into their own, and this decade is truly theirs. They are at the forefront in every sector. India has the largest youth population in the world — above 30 per cent are young.

By 2020, the average age of an Indian is expected to be 29 years, the youngest average age in the world. The influence the young are wielding today, and will wield in the days to come, makes it imperative that we immediately address issues related to their well-being. It is only when we include their needs and concerns in policy making and practice that we can be assured of channelise youth power for nation building.

The last three decades have seen a mind-numbing acceleration of changes in lifestyles and environments. Without a precedent to look to for guidance, youth health, well-being and safety are all under assault from a variety of internal and external factors.

Mental health problems,including depression, stress and anxiety are emerging as a serious threat. The reasons can be manifold: Increased isolation and increased internet penetration leading to addictive behaviours and sedentary lifestyles.

Cyber-bullying, unheard of a generation ago, is now a real threat. Substance abuse is a widespread phenomenon that cuts across the class and educational divides. Socio-economic situation, with gradually toughening job markets the political environment and family conflict — all have an impact on the young.

The US-based National Centre for Biotechnology Information says that about 20% of India’s young are suffering from various common mental disorders. Consider the disastrous phenomenon of suicides. The World Health Organization reports that one person commits suicide every 40 seconds in the world. India’s contribution to global suicide deaths increased from 25·3% in 1990 to 36.6% in 2016 among women, and from 18·7% to 24.3% among men (Lancet, 2018). 75,000 students committed suicides between 2007-2016.

One thing that clearly stood out was the urgent need of investing in mental health, especially in ending stigma on mental health.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/need-to-invest-in-mental-health.html
241,14-1-20,Studycentre,"Loneliness rivals smoking and obesity in its impact on shortening longevity and has become a public health concern, especially for the older adults, say researchers.

With older adults increasingly moving into senior living or retirement communities, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine sought to identify the common characteristics of residents who feel lonely in these environments.

The new study, published in the journal 'Aging and Mental Health', found that people's experience of living with loneliness is shaped by a number of personal and environmental factors.

Age-associated losses and inadequate social skills were considered primary risk factors for loneliness.

“Some residents talked about the loss of spouses, siblings and friends as the cause of their loneliness. Others mentioned how making new friends in a senior community cannot replace deceased friends they grew up with,” said Alejandra Paredes, a research fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at University of California San Diego School of Medicine.

The feeling of loneliness was frequently associated with a lack of purpose in life.

Others expressed a sense of “not being attached, not having very much meaning and not feeling very hopeful” or “being lost and not having control.”",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/studycentre-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre.html
242,14-1-20,Burnout may cause heart rhythm disturbance: Study,"A prolonged state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion -- or burnout -- is associated with a potentially deadly heart rhythm disturbance, according to a study which may lead to new interventions to reduce workplace stress.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this type of vital exhaustion, called burnout, is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.

The researchers, including those from the University of Southern California in the US, said burnout differs from depression, which is generally characterised by low mood, guilt, and poor self-esteem.

As part of the study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, the scientists surveyed more than 11,000 middle and older-aged adults for the presence of exhaustion, anger, antidepressant use, and poor social support.

They followed the subjects for a period of about 25 years for the development of atrial fibrillation -- an irregular, rapid heart rate which may increase the risk of strokes, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.

According to the study's findings, participants with the highest levels of burnout were at a 20 per cent higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation over the course of follow-up, compared to those with little to no evidence of vital exhaustion.

""Vital exhaustion is associated with increased inflammation and heightened activation of the body's physiologic stress response,"" said study co-author Parveen K. Garg of the University of Southern California.

""When these two things are chronically triggered that can have serious and damaging effects on the heart tissue, which could then eventually lead to the development of this arrhythmia,"" Garg added.

However, the study did not find any associations between anger, antidepressant use, or poor social support, and the development of atrial fibrillation.

""The findings for anger and social support are consistent with prior research, but two previous studies did find a significant association between antidepressant use and an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Clearly, more work still needs to be done,"" Garg said.

While earlier studies had shown the ink between vital exhaustion and heart disease like cardiac arrest and stroke, the current study revealed that burnout may also increase one's risk of developing irregular heartbeats.

""The importance of avoiding exhaustion through careful attention to, and management of, personal stress levels as a way to help preserve overall cardiovascular health cannot be overstated,"" Garg said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/burnout-may-cause-heart-rhythm-disturbance--study-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/burnout-may-cause-heart-rhythm-disturbance--study.html

The Hyderabad-born Nadella, 52, also stressed that every country should protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly.

""Every country will and should define its borders, protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly. And in democracies, that is something that the people and their governments will debate and define within those bounds,"" Nadella said on Saturday.

""I'm shaped by my Indian heritage, growing up in a multicultural India and my immigrant experience in the United States. My hope is for an India where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation benefitting Indian society and the economy at large,"" Nadella said.

He was speaking to editors at a Microsoft event here when he was asked by the New York-based news outlet BuzzFeed about his view on the CAA and if he has concerns about working with the Indian government in terms of how they were using data.

BuzzFeed posted Nadella's verbatim response to the question on Twitter.

Nadella described what is happening in India as ""sad"".

""I obviously grew up in India and I'm very proud of where I get my heritage, culturally in that place, and I grew up in a city, I always felt it was a great place to grow up, we celebrated Christmas, Diwali.

""I think what is happening is sad, primarily as sort of someone who grew up there, I feel, and in fact quite frankly, now being informed, shaped by the two amazing American things that I've observed which is both, it's technology reaching me where I was growing up and its immigration policy and even a story like mine being possible in a country like this,"" Nadella said.

""I think it's just bad...If anything, I would love to see a Bangladeshi immigrant who comes to India and creates the next unicorn in India, or becomes the CEO of Infosys, that should be the aspiration, if I had to sort of mirror what happened to me in the US, I hope that's what happens in India,"" Nadella said in response to a question.

244,14-1-20,SC orders ED to attach JP Morgan’s assets for conniving with Amrapali,"The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to attach Indian properties of JP Morgan, which engaged in a transaction with the now-defunct Amrapali Group to siphon off homebuyers’ money in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and FDI norms.

The ED said it had prima facie found violations of FEMA norms by the US-based firm and that a complaint in this regard was lodged.

The SC also allowed the ED to take into custody the defunct Amrapali Group’s CMD, Anil Kumar Sharma, and two other directors, Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar, who are behind bars on the SC’s order, for interrogation in the money-laundering offences.

It said the Central agency could take them into custody immediately and once their interrogation was over, they could be sent back to a prison here. According to the share subscription agreement between JP Morgan and Amrapali Group, the US-based firm had invested `85 crore on October 20, 2010, to have a preferential claim on profits in the ratio of 75 per cent to JP Morgan and 25 per cent to the promoters of Amrapali Homes Project Private Limited and Ultra Home.

Later, the same number of shares was bought back from JP Morgan for `140 crore by two companies — M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha — owned by a peon and an office boy of Amrapali’s statutory auditor Anil Mittal.

A Bench of justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit was told by ED Joint Director Rajeshwar Singh, who is supervising the probe, that the MNC remitted the money back to the US.

“They (JP Morgan) have a lot of properties in India. We want you to attach their office or corporate properties of a like amount. Then they will come running to us and we will see to it,” the SC said.

Singh said the adjudication process against the firm had begun in accordance with law.

On December 2 last year, the ED had informed the top court that it had prima facie found evidence of violation of FEMA by the multi-national firm and recorded the statements of the country head of the company with regard to dealings with the Amrapali Group.

It had said though the investigation was underway, prima facie it appeared that there were also violations of the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and that appropriate actions were being taken.

The apex court had then directed the ED that the investigation should be carried out impartially, properly and expeditiously within a period of three months.

On July 23 last year, the Supreme Court had cracked its whip on errant builders for breaching the trust of home buyers, ordered cancellation of Amrapali Group’s registration under real estate law RERA and ousted it from its prime properties in the NCR by nixing the land leases.

It had ordered a probe by the ED into allegations of money laundering and to look into the charge of FEMA violation by JP Morgan. “The money of the home buyers has been diverted. The directors diverted the money by the creation of dummy companies, realising professional fees, creating bogus bills, selling flats at an undervalued price, payment of excessive brokerage etc. They obtained investment from JP Morgan in violation of FEMA and FDI norms,” the top court had said.

It had said the equity shares of the group were purchased at an exorbitant price to suit the requirements of JP Morgan and the Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt Ltd had diverted home buyers’ funds.

“The shares were overvalued for making payments to JP Morgan. It was adopted as a device for siphoning off the money of the home buyers to foreign countries,” the top court had said as it accepted the reports of forensic auditors.

It had also noted that the shares of Amrapali Zodiac from JP Morgan were ultimately purchased for `140 crore by M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha, shell companies owned by a peon and an office boy respectively. “The transactions of Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt Ltd with JP Morgan were clearly in order to avoid the provisions of the Companies Act,” it had said.

The Supreme Court had said it was apparent that M/s Rudraksha was created for money laundering as its two directors and shareholders had no income.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-orders-ed-to-attach-jp-morgan---s-assets-for-conniving-with-amrapali-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-orders-ed-to-attach-jp-morgan---s-assets-for-conniving-with-amrapali.html

246,14-1-20,"Nationwide NRC not justified, says Nitish","In a clear rebuff to his ally the BJP and signalling his change of heart over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said he is open to discuss the Act in the State Assembly even as he emphasised that here is no justification for a country-wide NRC.

Speaking in the State Assembly, Kumar said the NRC was an Assam-specific regulation arising out of the Assam accord signed by the Rajiv Gandhi following agitation against influx of foreign nationals in the State.

“A country-wide implementation of NRC was needless and had no justification,” he said, adding that even the Prime Minister has clarified there is no move to enforce the NRC across the country.

At the same time, he said he is open for debate in the State Assembly on the CAA. “There should be a debate on CAA. If people want, then there will be a discussion in this House,” the Chief Minister told the House.

In the past, Nitish had dropped one-liner to suggest the NRC would not be implemented in Bihar, but this time he made his position official by articulating it in the State Assembly. Nitish’s rejection of the NRC and his willingness to debate the CAA in the Assembly is unlikely to please his ally.

With his number two in the party Prashant Kishor targeting the Modi Government everyday on the CAA and NRC, Nitish’s change of stance is indicative of his intention not to be seen as a piggy rider of the BJP’s Hindutava agenda.

The Bihar CM further said his Government agreed in principle to National Population Register (NPR) as they did likewise when such an exercise was last conducted 10 years ago.

But he came with a rider that the census should be caste-based and also expressed his willingness to have a discussion in the House with regard to “extra details” being sought as part of the NPR.

He made the remarks while thanking the House for its unanimous support to the Constitution amendment for extending quotas for SCs and STs in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies by another 10 years at a special day-long session convened for the purpose. Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi was seated next to him when Kumar was speaking.

The Chief Minister said at present he is preoccupied with the Jal Jeevan Hariyali drive on environmental conservation and all aspects relating to the issues could be discussed in the next session of the house and its sentiments conveyed to the Centre.

Earlier, Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, in his brief but impassioned statement, had remarked “the nation is on fire” on the issues of CAA, NRC and NPR and sought to know whether the Chief Minister “stands with Lalan Singh or Pavan Varma and Prashant Kishor”.

Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh is the leader in Lok Sabha of the JD (U) headed by Kumar. The party had voted in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in both houses of Parliament, to which

Varma, a national general secretary, and Kishor the national vice president had taken strong exception.

In his address, Kumar said, “This session has been convened for a specific purpose. However, there is a lot of turmoil over CAA, NRC and NPR. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be a discussion on these.

“But at present my mind is focused on the Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign as part of which we are organizing a state- wide human chain next Sunday (January 19). If desired, we can discuss all these issues in future”, he said.

“But I must say something about NRC. How does the question of NRC arise? It arose in the context of Assam, as a consequence of the accord signed by the Rajiv Gandhi following the Assam agitation (on the foreign national issue). We have no inkling that such an exercise would be conducted across the country.

“It would be needless (koi zarurat hai nahin) and have no justification (koi auchitya nahin). And I think the Prime Minister too has spoken clearly on this”, he said.

The Bihar Chief Minister had earlier also asserted that NRC will not be implemented in the State.”Kaahe ka NRC? Bilkul laagu nahin hoga” (NRC, what for Will not at all be implemented), Kumar had said on December 20 last. Kumar is the first CM from the NDA camp to have said no to any attempt to undertake an all India NRC exercise.

Kumar also responded to apprehensions expressed about details like parents places of birth and documents pertaining to the same being sought in the NPR forms which have triggered fears that NRC may follow the exercise.

“Our Government has agreed in principle to NPR since we did likewise when such an exercise was last conducted 10 years ago. At present it is in the preliminary stage and census proper will start only after three to four months. All issues relating to it, like extra details (anya cheezein) being sought in NPR can be discussed when the House meets again.

“On one thing, however, I am certain that the census should once be caste-based. At present census collects details of people following different religions and of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and it should be extended to all other castes”, the CM said.

He said this referring to his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and the leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav having spoken in favour of a caste-based census in their respective speeches.

“I am ready to have this matter discussed on the floor of the house from where a representation can also be sent to the Centre,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nationwide-nrc-not-justified--says-nitish-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nationwide-nrc-not-justified--says-nitish.html

While addressing the irate students outside her office twice, the VC announced that the ongoing semester examinations will be cancelled till further notice. New schedule will be declared later, she said.

“A decision has also been taken that the administration will also explore the possibility of moving court for the registration of FIR in the December 15, 2019 police brutality in university library at the earliest. The university has already followed all possible steps for the registration of FIR. It has given its complaint to SHO Jamia Nagar and its copy to Commissioner of Police (CP) Amulya Patnaik and DCP South East.

248,14-1-20,Situation in Kashmir violates human rights: US Congresswoman Debbie Dingell,"The situation in Kashmir violates human rights, a US Congresswoman has said, as she joined as cosponsors to a resolution urging India to end restrictions on communications and mass detentions in the newly-created Union Territory.

The resolution No 745 that was introduced in the House of Representatives last year by Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal now has 36 cosponsors, of whom two are Republicans and 34 from the opposition Democratic party.

""The situation in Kashmir violates human rights. Thousands have been detained unjustly & millions are without access to the internet & telephones,"" Congresswoman Debbie Dingell said in a tweet Monday night.

""That's why I signed onto House Resolution 745 so the US can let the world know we will not stand by while these violations happen,"" she said.

Dingell represents 12th Congressional District of Michigan.

The Congressional resolution is currently before the House Foreign Affairs Committee for necessary action.

Congressman Brad Sherman said he looks forward to getting US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster's report on his recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

""I expect the report to indicate what restrictions the Ambassador faced, in particularly, whether or not the Ambassador was able to visit detainees. The visit and report are valuable only to the extent of the access given,"" Sherman wrote on twitter.

A group of 15 envoys, including Juster, visited Jammu and Kashmir last week where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as the military top brass.

Internet services, landline and mobile phones were snapped across Jammu and Kashmir on August 4, a day before the Centre's announcement to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide it into two union territories.

Though most services, except mobile internet, were restored in Jammu within a week, Kashmir saw landlines and post-paid services being restored in phases.

However, internet continues to remain barred in the entire Valley except for some government offices, hospitals and business establishments. Pre-paid mobile services too are yet to be restored in Kashmir.

Mobile internet services were restored in Kargil district of Ladakh after remaining suspended for 145 days.

The visit by the envoys of 15 nations was the second one of a foreign delegation to Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370 provisions on August 5 last year.

Earlier, Delhi-based think tank International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies took 23 EU MPs on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the Union Territory.

Meanwhile, the Hindu American Foundation has launched a nationwide campaign urging Indian Americans to reach out to their representatives – Congressmen and Senators – to appraise them about the improving situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the atrocities against Kashmiri Hindus in the past.

In the past several weeks, more than half a dozen US lawmakers have come out in support of India's position on Kashmir. Almost all of them have spoken on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Congressman Scott Perry from Pennsylvania last week said that he stands with India in its aspiration to provide equal economic, social, and political opportunities to all citizens.

""As part of this pursuit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted last year to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of India to address the stagnant economy and high youth unemployment plaguing the region by providing economic opportunity and sound governance,"" he said.

""The residents of Jammu and Kashmir have battled economic depression and forces of extremism and radicalisation for too long. The regional stability now provided by government will give residents of Jammu and Kashmir a better way forward and hope for the future,"" Perry added.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/situation-in-kashmir-violates-human-rights--us-congresswoman-debbie-dingell-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/situation-in-kashmir-violates-human-rights--us-congresswoman-debbie-dingell.html
249,14-1-20,Prevent wear & tear,"Osteoarthritis is the second most common rheumatologic problem with a prevalence of 22% to 39% in the country. Dr Akhilesh Yadav tells you more

The condition

Osteoarthritis is the second most common rheumatologic problem and is the most frequent joint disease with a prevalence of around 40% in India. It is the form of arthritis which features the breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage of one or more joints. Cartilage is protein like substance which acts as cushion in between the joints. Although osteoarthritis can affect any joint, this disorder commonly affects hands, knees, hips and spine.

It’s a condition that give rise to joint inflammation, it happens when the wear and tear of cartilage, the tissue which protects from the ends of both bones and joints. It’s most common type of arthritis and is degenerative and it gets worsen with age. It causes damage to your joints, including: Hand and fingers, knees, hips, lower back and neck. It can also lead to problems with anxiety and depression.

The disease is associated with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, bone density, occupational injury. The physical ability arising from pain and loss of functional capacity reduces the quality of life and increases the risk of further morbidity. This condition is three times more prevalent in women as compared to men, which ultimately leads to joint replacements.

Incidences of joint replacement surgeries have seen an upsurge in the past 5 years. According to the recent data provided by Joint registry (ISHKS), over 35,000 total knee replacements (TKR) and over 3500 total hip replacement surgeries (THR) have been performed in India in the last 5 years. It is evident from the data that more than 75% of the TKR were performed on women ranging in the age bracket of 45-70 years. More than 33000 cases (over 97 per cent) of TKR were attributed to osteoarthritis, and more than 60% of women above the age of 60 years suffering from osteoarthritis have undergone total hip replacement surgeries.

Progession and what it means

The most common Symptoms of Osteoarthritis (OA) includes pain, tenderness, and stiffness in joints, loss of flexibility, bone spurs, grating and cracking sensation of bones rubbing together, swelling around the joint that gradually degrades the joint causing several complications.

The progressive degenerative nature has been classified into five categories. Therefore there is need to take precautions before it reach stage 4.

Stage 0: Normal: At this stage the knee joints do not show any signs of joint impairment or damage.

Stage 1: Minor: In this stage minor wear and tear and bone spur growth can be seen. At this stage you won’t experience any kind of pain or discomfort.

Stage 2: Mild: Diagnosis through X-rays of the knee joint will reveal increased bone spur growth, with healthy cartilage size. At this stage many people start experiencing the symptoms like pain after a long day of walking or running and tenderness.

Stage 3: Moderate: In this stage, the cartilage between bones shows obvious damage, and the space between the bones begins to narrow. People with stage 3 OA are likely to experience frequent pain when walking, running, bending, or kneeling. They also may experience joint stiffness after sitting for long periods of time or when waking up in the morning. Joint swelling may be present after extended periods of motion, as well.

Stage 4: Severe: People in stage 4 OA experience great pain and discomfort when they walk or move the joint. That’s because the joint space between bones is dramatically reduced—the cartilage is almost completely gone, leaving the joint stiff and possibly immobile. The synovial fluid is decreased dramatically, and it no longer helps reduce the friction among the moving parts of a joint.

To-do list

If the condition is detected in the earlier stages (stage 0 to stage 2), no specific treatment module is needed. The condition can be controlled through exercise and physical therapy to relieve pain and discomfort. Such therapies are non-pharmacologic (do not require any medication).

Medication: While the pain doesn’t subside with exercise the next option is to reduce the discomfort through medicines. If you experience a predisposition to Osteoarthritis (OA) or are at an increased risk, your doctor may recommend you take supplements, and doctors may prescribe for OTC pain killers and pain relief therapies. Usually the stage 3 condition can be controlled through medications.

Surgical intervention: In stage 4, if you experience severe OA of the knee, the last resort is surgical intervention. In most of the cases only the medial or lateral compartment is affected, unlike arthritis where it affects all the three of them.

If diagnosed at early stage, it can be treated with medications, but when the symptoms have crossed the extreme stage, surgery is the only option left. Full knee replacement has been the most common and the conventional method for treating arthritic knee. This is useful and necessary only when all the three compartments are involved, and can prove to be a disadvantage in case of unicompartmental arthritis. This is where unicompartmental knee surgeries are helpful.

Minimally invasive total knee replacement: Timely detection and advancements made in the field of total knee replacements with minimally invasive techniques making use of computer assistance has been providing an enhanced pathway for better recovery and improving the quality of life. Surgeries are now performed under highly specialised and advanced environment, ensuring shorter discharge time and negligible pain. This also enables a shorter hospital stay, speedy recovery and greater patient satisfaction.

Partial knee replacement: The latest techniques like partial knee replacement and new alloy implants are proving much better than previous ones, ensuring a long-lasting positive effect on knees. Earlier knee replacement was considered a necessity for the elderly suffering from the persistent keen pain. But today with improved implant technology and technique, the young generation is positive towards opting for surgery at an earlier age. The main advantage of the partial knee replacement is that it preserves the ACL which is a crucial ligament for movement and knee stability unlike in the case of total knee replacement where it is sacrificed. As this follows the minimal incision approach, a faster recovery, rehabilitation and quick return to full fledged activities is seen in all patients. Because the ligaments are kept intact, the patient feels the replaced portion of the knee as a natural part itself.

250,14-1-20,Hydrate for healthy skin,"Winter brings its share of problems when it comes to skin and hair care. Pooja Nagdev shares dos and don’ts that can help tackle the issue

There is a lot of dos and don’ts when it comes to skin and hair care during the winters. But this doesn’t mean that one should let the chilling temperatures get in the way of great skin, hair and scalp. Following are some small silly mistakes that we do repeatedly and all we need to do is to avoid them.

Oil your hair: Please do not over oil your hair in winters. Oil attracts a lot of dust and eventually the settled dust weighs down the hair, leading to dandruff and hair breakage. Remember with oiling excess is bad. Oiling once in a week is good enough.

Isn’t hot water bath tempting: The same doesn’t apply to skin and scalp. Always use luke warm water to take bath and never forget to apply a conditioner every time you shampoo. A five minutes self-body massage before getting into the shower works wonders. First, the oil on our body doesn’t let water get in touch with our skin directly as it slips away and second it is definitely moisturising.

Don’t leave sunscreen behind: We love the sun most in winters and love being outdoors, going out for open brunches and flea markets so applying a physical sunscreen that uses minerals titanium dioxide is essential at all times. Never leave home without applying a good sunscreen and apply repeatedly.

Make-up tip that’s cool: During winters go with foundations-cum-moisturiser with an SPF. Do avoid using matt make-up. Matt make-up products have more binders and lack oils and emulsifiers and therefore leave our skin dry and flaky.

Forget supplements: Another common mistake we all make is not taking supplements during winters. Taking health supplements that increase our body’s immunity to fight diseases is utmost essential.

Care of face & lips: Not using facial oils, facial oils are for everyone above 25 years of age and taking care of lips is also very important. Carry a good lip balm and use it every time the lips feel dry. Our nails also get dry during winters so it’s best not to ignore them and apply nail cuticle oil once in a week.

Avoid exfoliators: Please do not exfoliate a lot in winters. These exfoliators are usually harsh and leave skin dry and open pores. Every time you exfoliate remember to moisturise to close pores.

Body butters are for all skin types: Body butters are for everyone, sometimes people carry an assumption that people with oily skin do not need body butter. We all need body butters and there are butters available for all skin types. Mango butter is rich source of Vitamin C and is very good for oily skin. In terms with emollient content butter go like this first being lightest mango butter, avocado butter, almond butter, olive butter, shea butter and lastly argan butter.

Keep hydrated: Last, not drinking enough water is common mistake we all do. Our body requires same amount of water minimally as in summers so remind yourself to drink enough water every day.

251,14-1-20,China trade surplus with US dropped 8.5 per cent to USD 296 bn in 2019,"China's trade surplus with the United States narrowed last year as the world's two biggest economies exchanged punitive tariffs in a bruising trade war, official data showed Tuesday.

The figures were released just a day before the US and China are expected to sign a ""phase one"" agreement that marks a de-escalation in their two-year conflict.

The perennial US trade deficit with China has been a major source of anger for President Donald Trump, who has slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, triggering tit-for-tat responses from Beijing.

China's surplus came in at around USD 295.8 billion in 2019, down 8.5 per cent from the previous year's record USD 323.3 billion, according to customs data.

In December, its surplus with the US was around USD 23.2 billion, down from USD 24.6 billion the month before.

As part of the interim trade deal, Beijing will buy an extra USD 200 billion of US products over a two-year period, according to Washington officials.

252,14-1-20,Jamia imbroglio leaves parents in two minds,"With the normalcy yet to return on the Jamia Millia Islamia campus even after 30 days of anti-CAA, NRC protests that saw the police crackdown and triggered boycott of exams by some students, many parents are in two minds over the safety of their wards on the campus, particularly in the hostels of the university.

What added to students and parents’ worry was the development on Monday in which Vice Chancellor Najma Akhtar, buckling under the protesting students’ pressure, announcing that the ongoing semester exams stand cancelled until further notice.

The development has left the students and several parents vexed as many studying in the final year of graduation and postgraduation courses strongly feel that the delay in holding exam will jeopardise their future. Several students expressed their worries to The Pioneer.

Students said they want to study but they can’t oppose students who have been protesting peacefully against the CAA and police crackdown.

“We have right to express our points of view about the unprovoked police action inside the campus, during the protest. It had left many students injured and one of them had lost his left eye”, said Hamid, a postgraduate student.

“My parents called me after the violence and first thing they said was to pack my bags and come home. I tried to convince them that I am fine but they said you are not secure as the campus lacks security,” said Shazia, a girl student.

“Most of the students do not support the ongoing protest. CAA is not students’ issue and if we want to raise voice against it, we can take out a march to Parliament and sit on dharna for seven days but not for 40 days,” said Shubham Rai, a research scholar at Nelson Mandela Centre.

“Now exams were to start from January 9 but it has been postponed and the classes will start from February 3,” said Rai.

“We do hope that it is delayed further as that would harm the prospects of students who are in their finals year. Will they not face difficulty while applying for another course since result may also come late,” said Rai who visibly looked morose.

“Just after the violence, most of the students left Jamia hostels as their parents got worried about the safety of their wards. Even parents who had sent their ward to study in this premier institute to make their future bright now rues that it was better if they had got their child admitted to a private university for education,” said Manoj Kataria, the Treasurer of the Parents Association in city.

Though, Jamia administration has postponed its examinations but the students have started to come.

Meanwhile, a section of students sitting on protest said that they will continue their protest till appropriate action is taken against the police inaction and till the CAA is revoked. “We are demanding independent enquiry that why did police entered our campus without any permission. Even the VC had said that no permission was given to police to enter the campus,” said a protesting student.

Saeed Fahad, a student, said FIRs have been registered against those who were demanding their rights during protest. The real accused are still at large, he said referring to the police crackdown.

It may be recalled, on December 15, violent scenes were witnessed in and around JMI during a protest march organised by students against the CAA. The protest took a violent turn and many buses were set on fire. Instances of stone pelting were also reported. The police resorted to firing teargas shells. Students have alleged that police barged into the university library and started beating them up.

Jamia Millia’s Vice-Chancellor too has said the police entered the university campus without any permission. Police said that most protesters who took part in violence in and around Delhi’s JMI on Sunday were people who were not students.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jamia-imbroglio-leaves-parents-in-two-minds-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/jamia-imbroglio-leaves-parents-in-two-minds.html

255,14-1-20,"Acid attack survivors don't want sympathy, are not victims: Meghna Gulzar","Acid attack survivors don't want sympathy and her protagonist is not a victim either, says ""Chhapaak"" director Meghna Gulzar, explaining that she doesn't believe she needs to satisfy notions that there must be ""tragedy and sympathy"" in an assault story such as this.

“Chhapaak”, based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal, released on January 10 and has garnered glowing reviews from critics.

Featuring Deepika Padukone in the central role of Malti, “Chhapaak” also stars Vikrant Massey in the role of Amol, a journalist-turned-activist, and Madhurjeet Sarghi playing lawyer Archana Bajaj who spearheads the fight for justice.

""When Laxmi herself is not a victim how do I portray her as a victim because I have to satisfy certain expectation or notion that because it's a film on survivor there needs to be tragedy and sympathy?"" Meghna told PTI.

The director of films such as ""Raazi"" and ""Talvaar"" is hoping her film shines a light on gender violence.

""There's no psychological profile for an acid attacker. Husbands are doing it, landlords are doing it, ex-wives are doing it, ex-girlfriends are doing it.

“There's no profile and that makes it all the more dangerous because which is why the Vikrant line becomes very important. That everyone has some buraai (evil) in them, but what is that one moment where we flip. If we can get a handle on that, we will be better people,"" she said, referring to a critical conversation between Amol and Malti in the film.

The 46-year-old director said she opted for a non-linear narrative to depict the story of Malti (Laxmi), which opens in the backdrop of protests against the 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder.

""I didn't want to go chronological that she was born, she was a girl, these were her dreams, aspirations and she was so beautiful, but then this happened because the character is herself not a victim.

The director said it was important for her that the audience gets accustomed to Malti.

""... The way she is now and will be for the rest of her life. It's important to know her and remember her and understand her,"" she added.

Meghna, who co-wrote ""Chhapaak"" with Atika Chohan, shows the acid attack twice in the film.

Asked why she did so, Meghna said she wanted to stay focused on the consequences. ""What happens after... How a person and the family go through, what they do, how they crumble, how they collect themselves and how they resurface.""

""And once you have got that you have travelled along her journey with her, then it's okay to understand that this is how it happened. That's functional,"" she said about the flashback.

Meghna said she chose to open the film against the Nirbhaya protests because the issue of acid violence came to the fore after that.

""If you look at the archival reporting of the acid attacks, you'll find nothing before 2013... The way I depicted is that there was this man standing there with his daughter's picture with Amol there, this actually happened. I'm making all this from true life, I didn't conjure this up.

""It's putting it in context where you're talking about gender violence. And nobody focused on gender violence before 2012 protests so that was important.""

There's an important scene in the film where the idealistic Amol (Vikrant) reasons they shouldn't celebrate the court regulating the sale of acid. It had only regulated the sale, not banned, he tells Malti.

Malti replies with a smile that it was she who was attacked with acid, not him, and she wants to ""party"".

Asked if people attached to a cause tend to forget they are fighting on behalf of the survivor, Meghna said it also happens to the viewer and the film.

""(They think) this girl is the victim. She is not a victim but she is supposed to be a victim. If the woman, Laxmi Agarwal, is not that why would I diminish what she is?

""This is what we felt when we hung around with these girls for the last few years. They don't want our sympathy. I would be doing all of them a disservice if I'd be doing that,"" she said.

The director has also given nods to her father, legendary poet-lyricist Gulzar and her husband through the character of Malti's lawyer's husband (Anand Tiwari).

""That tying the plaits is my father and giving the keys and saying ‘Go' is my husband. That's how I get out and do what I do',"" Meghna said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/acid-attack-survivors-don-t-want-sympathy--are-not-victims--meghna-gulzar-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/acid-attack-survivors-don-t-want-sympathy--are-not-victims--meghna-gulzar.html

259,14-1-20,US Senate to begin impeachment trial against Trump on Jan 21,"The US Senate is likely to begin the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump on January 21 after the House of Representatives last month impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival, a top Republican Senator has said.

The 435-member House of Representatives, where Democrats enjoy a majority, last month charged Trump with “high crimes and misdemeanours"" and impeached in vote that was based on bitter political divide.

Now, the 100-member Senate, where the Republicans are in majority, needs to put Trump on trial before he can be removed from the White House.

After holding it on for weeks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to send its impeachment to the Senate sometime this week and that could be as early as Tuesday. The impeachment in the Senate is unlikely to pass through given that GOP has majority in the 100-member Senate.

Top Republican Senator John Cornyn, who is also Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus, on Monday told reporters that the Senate is likely to start the impeachment trial next Tuesday, January 21.

“Tuesday (January 21) is what it's feeling like,” he said.

""We'd actually be glued to our chair starting Tuesday, I think,"" he said in response to a question.

According to Cornyn, after House sends its articles of impeachment, the Senate will likely take a few days to deal with logistics of the trial.

Prominent among these include Chief Justice John Roberts and all Senators and sending summons to Trump's team. The Senate will also pass a resolution establishing the trial rules.

The New York Times reported that in the coming days, Pelosi is expected to choose half-a-dozen or so managers to argue on the Senate floor for Trump's removal from office.

“Those managers, who will be selected at least partly from the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, form just one element of a trial full of complicated procedures,” the report said.

Cornyn on the Senate floor alleged that Pelosi delaying the impeachment is hurting the Democratic presidential candidates.

“The only people who seem to gain anything from this are the Democrats who are running for president but who are not United States Senators, and thus aren't going to be tied up during the impeachment trial,” he said.

Meanwhile Republican Senators Corny, Mike Lee, and Jerry Moran announced to cosponsor Senator Josh Hawley's resolution to allow for the dismissal of articles of impeachment against Trump for failure to prosecute.

“It's been three weeks and counting since the House passed articles of impeachment, and Speaker Pelosi is still playing games after insisting the President's removal from office was urgent. This critical change will reinforce the Constitution and help prevent the House from using impeachment for personal political gain like the Speaker is sadly doing now,” Cornyn said.

“Our Constitution guarantees a fair and speedy trial to defendants, and Congress must provide these same guarantees to public officials facing impeachment. Speaker Pelosi has had three weeks to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but instead she is choosing to use the impeachment articles for political gain,” Moran said.

Moran said the resolution requires the Senate to move forward with impeachment trials in a timely manner and helps prevent Congress from playing political games with the impeachment procedure.

According to Senator Lee, the authors of the Constitution created the impeachment power to be a rarely used constitutional safeguard of the public trust.

“It was never meant to be a partisan tool used to harass a sitting president. This rule change will limit the House's ability to play partisan political games with impeachment. If a president is a true threat to the republic, articles to impeach him should be delivered to the Senate with haste,” Lee said.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz in an interview to NBC-Dallas-Fort Worth's ‘Lone Star Politics' said the trial in the Senate is going to be fair and would respect due process.

“It means that it is going to be very very different from the one-sided partisan show trial that we saw in the House for the last several months. The last several months House Democrats did an entirely one-sided hearing, presentation,” he alleged.

“They did not follow the precedent from the Clinton impeachment. They didn't follow the precedent from the Nixon impeachment. They didn't allow the minority to call witnesses. They didn't allow the White House to cross examine those witnesses,” Cruz said.

Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who is of Indian origin, feared that the trial in the Senate might not be fair.

260,14-1-20,Rain offers hope in Australian bushfire fight,"Forecasts of heavy rain offered hope Tuesday in the months-long battle to contain Australia's unprecedented bushfires, but smoke lifted pollution levels in the nation's second biggest city to among the worst in the world.

Cool weather over recent days has already given some respite for exhausted firefighters spread out across vast swathes of the country, with some of the biggest blazes now brought under control.

Optimism was further boosted on Tuesday with heavy rain forecast for some of the hotspots in the most populated eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria.

""It's some pretty good news,"" New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.

""We've been talking about it for months now, that January might see the first fall of decent rain, and that looks like what's coming along over the next few days."" However, dozens of fires remained out of control and, with many weeks of hot weather still expected throughout Australia's summer, there was no suggestion the crisis would end soon.

Toxic smoke from the blazes also blew overnight into the Victorian capital of Melbourne, which is due to stage the Australian Open tennis tournament next week.

Pollution in Melbourne, which is normally ranked as among the world's most liveable cities, was rated ""hazardous"", with health authorities warning people to stay indoors.

Practice sessions for world number one Rafael Nadal and some of the other big names in tennis were suspended on Tuesday.

Qualifying rounds for the Australian Open were also delayed for a couple of hours, and the organisers' decision to resume play late on Tuesday morning caused confusion and concern for some players.

Mandy Minella, the world number 140 from Luxembourg, voiced her opposition on Twitter.

""Shocked to see that qualifying matches have started @Australian Open, What about the health of all the people that have to work out there, especially the ballkids?"" she tweeted.

Still, the hazy conditions were not expected to last all week in Melbourne, with a change in wind direction and the forecast wet weather over the coming days set to clear the air.

The bushfires have killed at least 27 people, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and burnt 10 million hectares (100,000 square kilometres) of land -- an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.

Australia endures bushfires every summer.

However climate change and a prolonged drought have contributed to the current crisis, with the blazes starting much earlier than normal and lasting for far longer.

Australia experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded in mid-December.

The fires have prompted an outpouring of donations from around the world to help communities and devastated animal populations.

Environmental groups estimate one billion animals have been killed, many of them unique to Australia.

The country's environment minister Sussan Ley has warned that in some areas, koalas may have to be reclassified as endangered.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rain-offers-hope-in-australian-bushfire-fight-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/rain-offers-hope-in-australian-bushfire-fight.html
261,14-1-20,Flood-hit Jakarta residents sue over deadly disaster,"Jakarta's governor has been hit with a lawsuit filed by residents of the sprawling city after torrential rain sparked floods and landslides that killed dozens and left thousands homeless, a lawyer said Tuesday.

More than 200 flood victims are seeking a total of 43 billion rupiah ($3 million) in compensation in the class action, which was filed Monday in Jakarta district court.

The suit claims Governor Anies Baswedan was responsible for failing to provide the megacity with a proper early-warning system and effective emergency measures to minimise deaths and financial losses.

The city's legal bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""This should serve as a lesson for local government elsewhere to be more aware of disaster mitigation,"" lawyer Alvon Kurnia Palma told AFP.

""If this happens in Jakarta, where the central government is located, it could happen anywhere,"" he added.

The disaster caused at least $72 million in damage and monetary losses, according to business lobby the Indonesian Indigenous Entrepreneurs Association.

Whole neighbourhoods in the capital -- a megalopolis home to around 30 million people -- were submerged by floodwaters that forced tens of thousands into temporary shelters after torrential rains that began on New Year's Eve.

It was the city's deadliest flooding in years, with Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency saying downpours that sparked floods and landslides were the heaviest in the capital since record-keeping began in the 19th century.

At least 67 people in Jakarta and nearby cities were killed, with floodwaters reaching up to the second floor of some buildings after rivers burst their banks.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/flood-hit-jakarta-residents-sue-over-deadly-disaster-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/flood-hit-jakarta-residents-sue-over-deadly-disaster.html

264,14-1-20,Ex-Pak PM Sharif's UK restaurant pic goes viral; Opposition raises questions over his illness,"A fresh picture of ailing former Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif at a London restaurant along with some family members has gone viral on social media, leading the Opposition to cast aspersions over the ""serious nature"" of his health.

Sharif, 69, left for London on November 19 in an air ambulance to seek medical treatment, a month after he was released on bail from a seven-year prison sentence for corruption.

The PML-N supremo is undergoing treatment of multiple diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD). The CAD is the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to which the heart does not receive the blood it needs, leading to acute chest pain and, in some cases, a fatal heart attack.

In the photo leaked on Monday, Sharif appeared to be stable and sitting in a restaurant with his son Hasan, PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif, his son Salman and former finance minister Ishaq Dar.

Federal Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry uploaded the leaked photo on his Twitter account and made a satirical comment.

""In London's intensive care unit, the treatment against plundering is underway and all patients present (there) are feeling better,"" the outspoken minister said.

The photo was also reportedly discussed at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad, the Dawn newspaper reported.

It may cause problems for him in securing extension in his stay abroad from the PTI-led Punjab government which has become sceptical about the ""serious nature"" of his health, it said.

At the time of Sharif's departure for London, Khan had taken a dig at him, saying doctors were of the opinion that ""this man could die any minute if he did not go abroad for treatment. But he suddenly recovered and looked perfectly fine as he got a glimpse of the London-bound air ambulance"".

Sharif's PML-N slammed the ruling party leaders for doing politics on their leader's health, saying the government should come out of the ""Sharif phobia"" and concentrate on addressing important issues facing the country.

""Doctors have advised Nawaz Sharif to go out for change of environment. They insist that staying indoors will not be good for his health. Therefore, Sharif has started going out. On Sunday, Sharif along with his family members had a walk to catch fresh air and had tea in a restaurant,"" the leading daily quoted a PML-N leader from London as saying.

Sharif was shifted from jail to the Services hospital in Lahore in October after his health condition deteriorated. Doctors then recommended him to get treatment abroad.

The Pakistan government allowed Sharif''s travel for medical reasons but put the condition that he submit an indemnity bond as a guarantee that he would return to the country after getting treatment. He, however, rejected the condition and challenged it in courts.

Sharif was granted bail by the Islamabad High Court on humanitarian grounds in the Al Azizia case and by the Lahore High Court in the ongoing Chaudhry Sugar Mills case, in which he is a suspect.

In November, he was allowed by the Lahore High Court to travel abroad for treatment without any bond.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ex-pak-pm-sharif-s-uk-restaurant-pic-goes-viral--opposition-raises-questions-over-his-illness-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/ex-pak-pm-sharif-s-uk-restaurant-pic-goes-viral--opposition-raises-questions-over-his-illness.html
265,14-1-20,Mercedes-Benz launches EQ brand in India,"Mercedes-Benz India on Tuesday announced its entry in the electric space in the domestic market with the launch of its EQ brand.

The luxury car maker plans to come out with its first full electric vehicle EQC in April.

The launch of EQ brand underlines Mercedes-Benz India's strategic initiative in the EV domain to establish luxury electric motoring in the country, the company said.

""The first vehicle that the brand as such as a full EV been able to deliver or aiming to deliver is the EQC, which is a sporty SUV, which has been unveiled today,"" Martin Schwenk, MD and CEO, Mercedes-Benz India told PTI.

EQ is the brand which Mercedes has grouped and bundled all activities around electrification.

It has three different stands -- EQ boost, EQ Power and EQ itself. And it goes with the electrification of portfolios from mild-hybrid to plug-in hybrid and to full electeric vehicles.

""With the launch of EQ we firmly announce Mercedes-Benz's arrival into the new era of electro mobility. We want the EQ brand to create an ecosystem in which electric mobility is reliable, simple and at the same time exciting,"" he said.

Stating that Mercedes-Benz India is gradually but truly building the footprint with the brand and EQ as well as with the EV, Schwenk said our biggest first step in that direction is all-electric EQC.

""The 'EQ' brand is a key pillar of our 'Sustainable Luxury' objective and is the first dedicated luxury electric brand in India. We felt the time was right to introduce EQ brand in India.

""We are confident that EQ will lay a strong foundation for our electric ambition in India, which will see further expansion of our green cars portfolio and also for our future,"" he said.

EQC edition1886 is essentially very close to the car that will be introduced in April, he said.

Schwenk said Mercedes Benz India sees a gradual growth at a measured pace in its EV portfolio going forward.

He said at the global scale, there will be as many as 10 electric models are being made available in the next 2-3 years, there will also be more and more hybrid vehicles in the portfolio of both Mercedes-Benz and Daimler AG.

""So, we are trying to see what fits India. But right now, I have no clear decisions or plans how we address them in the next 2-4 years,"" he said.

According to Schwenk a lot of things would depend on issues such as infrastructure, regulatory frame work, among others, going forward.

""If there is some support for plug-in hybrids, it will make a case for customers to buy a plug-in hybrid car. If it is treated same as a car with combustion engine or like a normal petrol or diesel car, it does not make a sense for both the customers and the manufacturer,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mercedes-benz-launches-eq-brand-in-india-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/mercedes-benz-launches-eq-brand-in-india.html
266,14-1-20,Starc takes three wickets as Australia bow out India for 255 in 1st ODI,"Left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc scalped three batsmen as Australia bundled out India for 255 in 49.1 over after electing to bowl in the opening match of the ODI series, here on Tuesday.

India did not drop any of its three openers -- Rohit Sharma (10) Shikhar Dhawan (74) and KL Rahul (47) -- with skipper Virat Kohli (16) deciding to bat at number at four.

When Dhawan and Rahul were at the crease, India were cruising towards a big total but their dismissal in space of 10 balls affected their run-rate. They raised a 121-run partnership for the second wicket.

The hosts struggled to raise any substantial partnership after that but Kuldeep Yadav's useful 17-run cameo help the team cross the 250-run mark.

Wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant, who has been under the scanner for some time, yet again frittered away a good start, scoring 28 off 33 balls.

The Wankhede stadium track offered good bounce to Australia pacers, who were willing to be patient and were rewarded for being disciplined.

268,14-1-20,India get 10-wicket hiding from Australia in series opener,"Australia gave India a harsh reality check with a 10-wicket hiding in the ODI series opener here on Tuesday, exposing the home team's middle-order frailty and putting to sword its bowling.

Anticipating dew in the evening session, Aaron Finch opted to field. India ended up with a below-par 255 on a decent batting surface after a middle-order failure.

Australia made short work of the target, racing to a resounding victory in 37.4 overs with David Warner (128 not out off 112) and Finch (110 not out off 114) smashing unbeaten centuries, making the Indian attack look rather ordinary. They simply ran away with chase, sharing 30 boundaries and five sixes between them.

The manner of India's defeat, which came after dominating limited overs series wins against West Indies and Sri Lanka, has left the hosts with plenty to ponder ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Friday.

India made some unmissable changes in their batting combination with Virat Kohli pushing himself down to number four to accommodate specialist openers Shikhar Dhawan (74 off 91) and K L Rahul (47 off 61) in the playing eleven.

Dhawan opened alongside Rohit Sharma while Rahul batted at three, disturbing the combination that India employed successfully after the World Cup in July.

With Kohli (16 off 14) dropping himself down the order, Shreyas Iyer (4), who had shown a lot of promise at number four in recent times, was demoted to five. The entire experiment failed miserably, raising plenty of questions.

Earlier, Dhawan hit a half-century before Australia pulled things back to bowl India out with five balls to spare.

Dhawan looked in great touch during his stay in the middle and in the company of Rahul, shared a second-wicket stand of 121 runs off 136 balls to set the base for India's total. However, India failed to capitalise.

Sent into bat, India were dealt an early blow when they lost Rohit, caught by Warner at mid-off off Mitchell Starc (3/56).

Rahul joined Dhawan at the crease and the duo played fluently without much trouble against a formidable Australian attack.

After adopting a cautious approach initially, Dhawan upped his ante and started to play his shots, while at the same time gave due respect to the good deliveries.

Dhawan showed his class and played all kinds of shots to register his fifty in 66 balls with a single off leg-spinner Adam Zampa (1/53) in the 20th over.

Soon after reaching his fifty, Dhawan got a reprieve when he was dropped by Warner at midwicket off Ashton Agar (1/56).

The two went about their business in style, picking up runs off bad balls before both departed in consecutive overs.

Just three short of his fifty, Rahul gave a straight forward catch to Steve Smith at covers off Agar and then, in the next over, Dhawan was caught by Agar off Pat Cummins (2/44).

While Rahul hit four boundaries during his 61-ball knock, Dhawan's innings was laced with nine fours and one six.

Dropping himself to No. 4 to accommodate both Dhawan and Rahul in the side, Virat Kohli (16) was in attacking mode from the onset, but didn't last long as Zampa took a sharp catch off his own bowling to dismiss the Indian skipper.

Iyer followed suit when Starc induced an edge an over later and Alex Carey did the rest behind the stumps.

Rishabh Pant (28) and Ravindra Jadeja (25) shared 49 runs for the sixth wicket before the duo perished in consecutive overs as India lost the plot.

Towards the end Kuldeep Yadav (17) and Mohammed Shami (10) struck some useful boundaries.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-get-10-wicket-hiding-from-australia-in-series-opener-2020-01-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-get-10-wicket-hiding-from-australia-in-series-opener.html
