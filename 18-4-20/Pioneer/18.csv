0,18-4-20,Who has the eyeballs?,"Opp CMs are stealing a march with their interactive strategies vis-à-vis the handout briefings of the Centre

In the beginning, it seemed like a genuinely cooperative effort, the decision to fight COVID-19 in the Indian context and within our set of challenges and resources. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, known for his muscular approach, did enforce a nationwide lockdown in the world’s most populous democracy, overriding any other concern except that of saving lives and arresting the spiral of the disease. There were several rounds of discussions with Chief Ministers of affected States, experiences and lessons were shared and an all-party consultation held. Modi himself did set aside politics on the shelf and even consulted his predecessor Manmohan Singh on the economic fallout of the disease. Then the reverse migration of the daily wage earners threw everybody off guard and the humanitarian crisis of returning labourers, wanting to escape the forced lockdown, the big city disease and work in their own fields for whatever it paid added another front in the battle. And now that everybody is up to the gills in trying to assess the trajectory of the problem, they are coming apart yet again. Although Central despatches talk about a peak in May/June before a petering out, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said he doesn’t expect the curve to flatten before September. Meanwhile, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot expressed concerns over the phased and gradual easing of lockdowns, saying the disease spiral was such that an opening up decision could go either way. Now as the nerves are fraying at the edges, both ruling and Opposition parties have begun whataboutery and mutual blame games at a time when we are just about reining in the disease and need to choke and chase it away. The Maharashtra BJP is blaming the Shiv Sena alliance Government of Uddhav Thackeray for mishandling the migrant issue. The Bengal BJP is blaming the Mamata Banerjee Government for fudging death figures in cases of co-morbidities and the Delhi BJP is in a war of words with the Aam Aadmi Party Government over access to medical gear and testing. Now there’s a raging war over whether we are testing enough, although the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is confining tests to hotspot clusters, claiming the penetrative approach, and not wasting kits. Of course, the rapid antibody tests have just landed. Perhaps the distancing between the Centre and Opposition States is becoming more pronounced over issues of transparency.

It is a fact that apart from his national addresses, rallying his citizen soldiers for a big fight, the Prime Minister hasn’t exactly held a press conference or been talking to the media, except for some confabulations with newspaper barons on sectoral concerns. His Health Minister, too, is missing from daily briefings, leaving that job to the Health Secretary. In comparison, Chief Ministers of all Opposition States have been interactive on a daily basis, keeping their people abreast of developments and spelling out strategies according to the evolving situation. This spontaneity and hands-on approach have not only struck a chord with the people, they have made the Chief Ministers look taller than they were before COVID-19. Politically, the success of Chief Ministers like Gehlot in Rajasthan with the Bhilwara model or Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala has given them a doer-deliverer image that will last for a while. No BJP Chief Minister is being seen as proactive, continuing to be just under Modi’s shadow. Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, only ridiculed these days without any political capital, has emerged as a mature version, something which he could have done long before. He, too, held an impromptu press conference and though provoked, refrained from attacking the Modi Government over crisis management. Truth be told, he did raise an alarm about the possible COVID-19 impact as early as February, has been harping on early testing to save lives and pleading for an economic package. However, he was pooh-poohed by not just the BJP’s IT cell but its senior leaders. Still, at the press conference, he emphasised how all parties should work together in a united fashion to face the crisis. Rahul, who had paid dearly for personally attacking Modi, has been mature in his approach. In fact, he just insisted on making “constructive suggestions” to the Government, calling for direct cash transfers to migrants and rushing the overstocked foodgrains in a disciplined manner. He is taking the moral high ground and at least started to make sense. And with his press conference, he is just pointing to the vacuum in communication from the other side. Communication dissolves panic and fear. Everybody is using the COVID-19 scenario to reap dividends later on. The Prime Minister has stepped up no doubt, but needs to build a credible and constructive talking point, too. And be seen as a deliverer rather than speech-maker.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-has-the-eyeballs--2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/who-has-the-eyeballs-.html
1,18-4-20,Zoom into our lives,"With concerns over privacy, is the Chinese app masking data mining and surveillance?

Months before the deadly Coronavirus virus struck the world, we had never even heard of Zoom, the US-based video conferencing app that was first founded in 2011 by a Chinese immigrant Eric S Yuan. With countries facing a nationwide lockdown, almost the entire world population was compelled to work from home and it is here that it became a critical component of an enabling technological infrastructure. So much so that after TikTok and Whatsapp, it ranked as the third-largest downloaded app. According to data, in India itself, in the 10 days between March 1 and 11, when work from home arrangements were just beginning to kick in, there were 1.25 lakh Zoom downloads. But at the same time, concerns regarding an increasing dependence on this platform were already red-flagged. In fact, there are serious questions about privacy and security. This is why the Union Government’s latest advisory warning against the usage of the application as it was “unsafe” and “vulnerable to cyber crimes” doesn’t spring a surprise. But the popularity of the app cannot be denied. From conducting business meetings to facilitating religious services, to conducting online classes and even meeting friends for virtual hangouts, it has become the default social chatroom. The benefits are far too many to lure in a network of users. Its services are free (superior services are charged though), it can accommodate up to 100 users in a single video call and has additional features, for example, foregrounding the speaker. It is a saviour for people in self-isolation, who are dying to catch a glimpse of another human face. Undoubtedly, when world stocks are plummeting, its share price has doubled. Makes one wonder if anybody had anticipated a work from home scenario?

But now it appears if this was another Chinese effort to mine data of its users to create a world surveillance network. Perhaps this is the reason the Government is warning against its use in secure communications. Accusations involve the already-established concerns on privacy and end-to-end encryption. Its ease of use also encouraged bad actors — there have been several cases where users have taken recourse to making racist attacks, child abuse, even pornography. While the company is still making amendments on a daily basis, it has also cultivated an image of being a snooper on the prowl. And its admission that some calls were “mistakenly” routed to China is not reassuring at all. Nobody knows the shape of a post-COVID world but politics is in full play.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zoom-into-our-lives-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/zoom-into-our-lives.html
2,18-4-20,Crime and punishment,"‘Covidiots’ are breaking the law and putting the lives of other people at risk. They must be held accountable and booked under the criminal justice system

Does it make sense to be politically correct when faced with an existentialist crisis? If a person is fighting for his/her life and finds that survival depends not just on his/her own actions but also on the actions of the neighbours/community, how should one respond?

The choices are pretty stark and binary, there is no time or place for grey areas and that is how it should be. Simply put, good deeds must be rewarded while bad deeds must be punished. And political correctness be damned.

During the present pandemic, as the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases and casualties continue to spiral not just globally but also in the country, there are millions of anonymous doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, media personnel, soldiers, policemen, grocers and shopkeepers, delivery staff, sanitation workers and many others, who keep our essential services functional. They are on the frontline, battling the COVID-19 monster, keeping us safe without a care for their personal safety and for the future of their families.

Many healthcare workers have even been infected and died due to the pandemic. These “Corona warriors” must be thanked and applauded for their dedication and resilience, wherever in the world they may be. In fact, more than just gestures, we must reciprocate and do our best to keep them safe, albeit by ensuring that we remain disciplined and follow rules regarding social and physical distancing; contribute what we can to make their lives easier and, most importantly, treat them with the respect they deserve.

The other side of the coin pertains to how we deal with those who violate social and physical distancing norms, knowingly or unknowingly, “Covidiots” as they have commonly come to be known. Ignorance after over two months of facing this pandemic is no longer a viable excuse and those who violate norms must be treated as deliberate defaulters, regardless of how illiterate or ignorant they may actually be. The motivation for their actions obviously stems from the belief that either it is not in their hands or that they are unlikely to be effected by the virus, even if they catch it.

The problem of disciplining or getting these people to adhere to the law is that our legal system is such that summary punishments do not exist. So, actually punishing a wrongdoer takes months, if not years. Moreover, given the poor quality of recruits to our police forces, leaving the disciplining of wrongdoers in their hands will lead to sadistic and uncalled for abuse. None of this is likely to deter individuals from indulging in activities that may not amount to being seen as criminal in nature but are certainly not socially acceptable behaviour either.

For those indulging in such behaviour do not see that their actions could be responsible for putting others in harm’s way and even if they do, for some it is of no concern.

In fact, some who feel that they have been treated unfairly by society at large, or even by the country, see this as an ideal opportunity to get even. Among the latter there are also those working at the behest of forces that are inimical towards the country and wish it harm. They should obviously be categorised separately and their actions must be treated as deliberate acts of bio-terrorism and treated as such with no quarter being given. There is no differentiation here between Over Ground Workers (OGW) and terrorists and all of them are no different from those wielding guns or explosives.

Even among the scores of others who disobey societal norms, there are some who do so deliberately because they believe they are above the law. These are those who belong to religious groups or political parties or are seen as influencers who consider that their wealth, social status or position protects them.

The examples that best illustrate this kind of horrendous behaviour are from Karnataka, where the unwillingness of the State administration to act is condoned by the Central Government, just because it happens to be a BJP one.

In one case, a chariot-pulling ritual that was a part of the Siddalingeshwara Fair, held in Chittapur village, in Kalaburagi District of Karnataka, saw the participation of thousands of devotees, who violated the nationwide lockdown and social distancing norms with impunity.

The police and District Administration remained mere spectators even though they were aware of the planned event well in advance. They were finally forced to act and lodge an First Information Report (FIR) against the temple trust a day later, after a maelstrom erupted on social media. The likelihood of any substantive action being taken against those responsible seems unlikely.

Incidentally, Kalaburagi has been deemed a COVID-19 hotspot and is under complete lockdown. It also has the dubious distinction of having reported India’s first death from the Coronavirus. Clearly, the Central Government’s writ seems to run only within the National Capital Region (NCR), even if there!

The second incident is even more appalling because those involved are the very ones who are expected to set examples for the rest of us to follow. It pertains to the marriage of Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the grandson of former Prime Minister Deve Gowda, to Revathi, the grand-niece of former Congress Minister M Krishnappa. Hence, a VIP wedding.

While only family members were invited and the event was moved out of Bengaluru to a farmhouse some distance away, the adherence to social distancing norms or the wearing of masks, as is mandated, were completely disregarded by those attending. Photographs available in the public domain show this utter disregard for the nation”s fight against the virus. But this was only to be expected as the Karnataka Chief Minister, BS Yediyurappa, had earlier set a precedent of sorts, when he along with some of his Cabinet colleagues attended a wedding in Belgavi, at which there were over 5,000 guests present. This, just days after he had himself passed directions that not more than 100 guests could be invited to weddings.

Finally, there are also those who either unwittingly or carelessly break these norms just because they lack self-discipline or believe they can get away with it, much like those who jump traffic lights when there are no policemen about.

The fact of the matter is that all “Covidiots” belonging to any of these groups are breaking the law and putting the lives of other people at risk, for which they must be held accountable.

This clearly suggests that given the infirmities in our criminal justice system, there is an urgent and pressing necessity to introduce summary punishments. These must be handed out without fear or favour and be applied on all who break the rules. Obviously, the scale of punishment meted out should be based on the severity of the misdemeanour.

This will be similar to the legal process of summary disposal that exists within the military justice system, where punishments are awarded and carried out on the spot.

If the offence is seen to be of a serious nature, or the individual is a repeat offender, s/he could then have an FIR registered against him/her as per our criminal justice procedure. However, for such behaviour, the charges preferred against the individual must be non-bailable and instead of being kept in a prison s/he must be kept locked in specially earmarked “internment camps” where s/he will be ineligible to receive anything other than prophylactic medical care for COVID-19 till his/her case is brought to trial. There is little doubt that extraordinary situations demand extraordinary measures. Those who follow the law cannot be held hostage by the few who do not follow rules, using our democratic process as their excuse. The notification of such a measure will act as a strong deterrent against willful misbehaviour and should be put in place for the duration of this pandemic.

3,18-4-20,Innovations in bureaucracy,"The Govt should find a way to harness talent and expertise from a larger resource pool but with a well thought out strategy for nation building

Since time immemorial, mankind has been facing existential threats and one of the challenges during such times is how to organise manpower to meet the threat. In the modern world, a competent bureaucracy fills the gap but is embroiled in red-tapism, which proves counter-productive. Therefore, it is time for the bureaucracy to embrace innovation to fight any challenges that come its way.

If one actor in the bureaucratic chain slips up, things go haywire quickly. The latest example is the faux pas in Delhi where the impact of the lockdown on daily wagers and the unorganised sector workers was not visualised by the Centre, the Lieutenant-Governor or the Delhi Government. In fact, after the suspension of two IAS officers, it was revealed that the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses were ferrying labourers to the Uttar Pradesh border. It should have been planned better. Before/after the announcement of the lockdown by the Prime Minister, officials of different Ministries should have been in touch with State Government officials to handle the migrant workforce and address their needs. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) also appears to have failed in tracking the foreigners who came to India to attend the meet in Nizamuddin. Or its advice was not acted upon by the police and the administration.

This brings us to the need for innovation in the Indian bureaucracy in order to make its functioning quick and effective. There are more than 65 lakh pensioners and 48 lakh regular employees and the question is how to improvise the functional talent of the regular staff and harness the experience of retired officers without committing to any remuneration. Is it possible to have a provision in the rule book to use the experience of retirees in national building without increasing the superannuation age?

The average lifespan is increasing and as per studies a person is at his/her best professional capability in the age group of 60-68 years. Hence, globally almost all governments have increased the retirement age of their staff. The superannuation age of United Nations (UN) employees is 65, in the US it is 66 and will be raised to 67 by 2023. The UK is proposing an increase in the pension age to 66 by 2020 and 67 between 2026-2028. It is the same situation in the most of Europe. But it is still 60 years in India, China, Malaysia, Thailand and other developing countries. However, there is a sound rationale behind this difference. The populations of developed countries have stabilised and due to negative population growth they lack experienced manpower replacement. Therefore, they want to hold on to their experienced workers, particularly when they are at the peak of their capabilities. On the other hand, developing countries like India have burgeoning populations and their educated youth is facing severe unemployment. Hence, we can ill-afford to increase the retirement age beyond 60 years.

However, the Indian bureaucracy has created several post-retirement sinecure for itself. And politicians in the Central and State Governments dole this out indiscriminately without consideration for merit, which is nothing but crony capitalism. These positions are being cornered by IAS officers mostly as they harbour the notion that all the top talent in the country is available within this group of civil servants only. It has taken the form of quid pro quo and is the root cause of the malfunctioning of the Government, waste of talent and poor delivery. This also leads to unfair networking and lobbying among babus.

The Government should, therefore, mull an innovative way to use and harness talent and expertise from a larger resource pool but with a well thought out strategy. The Centre is trying to bring fresh talent into the Government through lateral entry. It is, however, being done on an ad hoc basis, which is counter-productive. The Centre should constitute a higher Government management service and after 15 years on the job, all officers of the organised civil services with proven capability should be allowed to be screened by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) through a written and personality test. This will also help in junking the deadwood.

For the pensioners, it could be done by amending pension rules and the Government should retain the power to summon them and make it compulsory for them to be available at least for seven days a month, should it need them. But this should be without remuneration, except for a marginal transport allowance per sitting. This will help the Government increase its productivity as well as efficiency and pensioners will also get an opportunity to contribute to nation-building. Many retirees will challenge this provision but it may be given a try on an optional basis as it will open a window of opportunity for innovation. The Government should identify such works at different levels in each department and use the large mass of talent, which otherwise goes waste after retirement. There is ample opportunity to innovate on this and it may be possible to bring the curtains down on regular post-retirement jobs and save money on defunct posts.

4,18-4-20,There is great opportunity in the Corona crisis,"Instead of waiting for the stock market to hit the bottom, experts recommend taking a gradual and incremental approach where you start investing a small portion of your cash on a regular basis and take advantage of the current crisis

Any crisis brings with it great investment opportunities but it is not easy to decipher what to bet on. At present the sentiment in stock markets across the world is gloomy and financial markets in India, too, are witnessing sharp volatility as a result of this. The fall is in line with the global benchmark indices as the domestic market usually tracks them. The stock market is likely to continue to be highly volatile in the near future. Further, with Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) flying to the safety of dollar-backed assets, this has led to a sharp plunge in the Indian stock market. The S&P BSE Sensex, which was 42,273 points on January 20, dipped to 29,894 points on April 8. The Price to Earning Ratio of the Sensex is less than 18, which is far less than its historical range of 20-24. Markets across large, mid and small caps have corrected sharply from their peaks. In the Financial Year (FY) 2019-20, the mid-cap index fell by 26 per cent while the Sensex fell by 22 per cent. But that does not mean that it is the end of the stock market. Volatility tests the patience of investors and traders. While the trader ends up losing money the investor grabs multi-baggers.

COVID-19 is a black swan event: Throughout history, there have been highly improbable events that catch almost everyone by surprise and can potentially have a large impact on status quo by disrupting human activities and/or creating havoc. These are called “black swan” events. The name stems from the fact that up until 1697, mankind believed that all swans were white. Then Dutch explorers sighted black swans for the first time in Western Australia, completely nullifying the belief that swans can only be white. Thus, the term “black swan” is used to describe an improbable event which also has an extreme impact.

The field of finance regularly attempts to capture outlier events and fails with equal regularity. The impact of the Coronavirus on the stock market has all the characteristics of a “black swan” event.

Crash and recovery: Worldwide stock markets have a history of crash and recovery and the Indian bourses are no different. The Sensex plunged 53 per cent in one year during the “Harshad Mehta scam” in 1992 but recovered 127 per cent in 17 months. During the “tech bubble burst” in 2000, the Sensex crashed 56 per cent in 17 months but recovered 138 per cent in two-and-a-half years. When the US faced the “Lehman crisis” in 2008, the Sensex crashed 61 per cent in a year but recovered 157 per cent in 17 months. The current market has crashed around 30 per cent in less than three months. Due to the Covid-19, no one knows when the economy will come back on track. Some experts even compare this meltdown of global economies to the “Great Depression” that started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. Between 1929 and 1932, the worldwide Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15 per cent. By comparison, the global GDP fell by less than one per cent from 2008 to 2009 during the “Great recession.” Given the economic slowdown in India, the Yes Bank imbroglio, the CAA-NRC protests, Delhi riots, panic amid the Coronavirus, the sentiment is extremely negative. And this led to the March-April meltdown on the Indian bourses.

Fear and greed: Investing in the stock market is not all about technical and fundamental analysis but also about analysing the behaviour of investors at large. Investors discuss and agree to take rational decisions but at times they are influenced by events and behave irrationally. Sometimes their actions are influenced more by emotions rather than the fundamentals of the stock market. Historically it has been proven that in a bullish market, investor decisions are based on potential gains rather than losses and they make risky investments. However, stock markets reward patient long-term investors. There is no better way of making money other than owning a great bunch of Indian companies and ignoring the inevitable ups and downs of the market.

The future of other sectors: The banking sector may see more pain but the insurance sector may see gains.

The automobile sector, which was suffering due to the 2019 economic meltdown, may benefit from the Coronavirus outbreak. Recently, Maruti Suzuki India said that they expect to see a boom once the lockdown is lifted and as social distancing becomes a common practice, forcing people to buy more cars. Similar views were shared by other automobile makers. The Nifty 50 Index — a diversified 50 stock index accounting for more than 13 sectors of the economy — has rallied by over 20 per cent since its March lows.

The Nifty Pharma Index, on the other hand, has skyrocketed to over 37 per cent, outperforming the broader markets quite remarkably. This happened because with the world grappling with the Coronavirus pandemic, the spotlight is clearly on healthcare. In the same way, the agriculture sector might not be affected much.

However, despite numerous attempts by the Reserve Bank of India to stem the freefall in the Indian currency against the US dollar, there is no end to the pain. This may benefit the software export sector and TCS, Wipro, Infosys and so on could be the beneficiaries. But real estate, hospitality and the entertainment sector might be the real losers in the stock market. The oil and natural gas sector might also suffer but as crude oil prices are low, their losses are under control for now. Due to the lockdown, inflation has reduced but so have the volumes. Various sectors have felt the positive impact of the pandemic whereas others have borne its negative impact. Thus, their share prices will move accordingly.

What of recovery? It would be foolish to expect a quick economic rebound from the current crisis. But considering the all-out efforts by Central banks and fiscal authorities to soften the blow, a deep economic slump might be avoided. The problem in the current scenario is that until we know how quickly and thoroughly the public-health challenge will be met, it is virtually impossible for economists to predict the endgame.

Global trade is expected to fall across all sectors this year but could rebound later depending on when the pandemic is brought under control and the policy choices governments took to support their economies. Once business and economic normalcy returns, the stock market will start moving in a positive direction. Recovery would be faster than expected. But if people only do discretionary spending then economic revival would take longer.

Whether it is correction or growth, both phases are worth taking an exposure in the stock market. But don’t try to catch the falling knife.

What should investors do? Most of us would want to wait till there is some clarity or evidence on how the Coronavirus will be contained, before deciding to invest. But practically waiting for the bottom to invest is extremely difficult. Therefore, instead of waiting for the market to hit the bottom, experts recommend taking a gradual and incremental approach where you start investing a small portion of your cash on a regular basis. If there are sharp further corrections, the amount deployed can be increased aggressively. The current crisis can be a great opportunity for stock market investors.

5,18-4-20,ANM team attacked in Bareilly,"



|

Close on the heels of attack on police and doctors in Moradabad, a team of Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) was allegedly manhandled by villagers in Bareilly when they went to verify if any outsider had taken shelter there or any coronavirus suspect was staying in the locality.

The ANM team members alleged that the records maintained by them were tampered with and their mobile phones and purses were also snatched by the mob. Later, after intervention of some senior residents, the belongings of the ANMs were returned after which the team left the area and briefed their seniors about the incident.

Medical Superintendent of Faridpur Community Health Centre Dr Wasid Ali said they had reported the matter to the police and were also looking into the facts to take necessary action. So far no arrests was made.

Reports said that about two dozen ANMs attached with Faridpur and Naveen primary health centres in Bareilly visited Mahadev and Unchey Faridpur areas on Friday morning to check whether any outsider had taken shelter in the area and also whether any coronavirus suspect was living there without informing anyone.

The ANMs completed their task in Mahadev but when they started verification in Unchey Faridpur area, members of four to five families suddenly came out and objected. They questioned the purpose of the visit and even after the team members showed them their identity cards and disclosed the purpose of their visit, the miscreants allegedly manhandled the team, tampered with their registers in which records had been maintained and also snatched their mobile phones and purses.

Luckily, some senior residents came to the rescue of the ANM team and helped them get back their belongings.

It may be mentioned that last Wednesday, doctors, paramedics and policemen were injured as a mob attacked them when the corona warriors went to take some coronavirus suspects for isolation. Three vehicles, including an ambulance, were damaged in the mob violence in Gulshaheed police station area of Moradabad.

Meanwhile, one person suspected to have attended Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin markaz in New Delhi, was held in Gorakhpur and put in quarantine.

Reports said that Badruddin, a native of Lalganj area of Badhalganj in Gorakhpur working in Dubai, had returned home on March 22. However, the intelligence wing of the Delhi Police, working to trace out persons who attended the Jamaat event, found the mobile phone of Badruddin active in the Nizamuddin area in the second and third week of March so they passed the information to Gorakhpur police which on Thursday held Badruddin from his house and put him in quarantine in local primary school.

Badruddin told the police that he had returned from Dubai after work stopped there due to coronavirus scare and that he had stayed in Delhi before reaching Gorakhpur.

He denied having any connection with Tablighi Jamaat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anm-team-attacked-in-bareilly.html
6,18-4-20,CM: Formalise PDS universalisation,"Asserting that no citizen of the state should be left hungry, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to formalise universalisation of public distribution system by June 30.

Addressing a high-level review meeting on lockdown in Lucknow on Friday, Yogi said that the universalisation of PDS would ensure that every needy person was entitled to free ration even if he/she did not have a ration or Aadhaar card.

“This mechanism has to be evolved under special circumstances due to COVID-19 pandemic so as to provide relief to the poor people of urban and rural areas, including nomads,” he said.

The chief minister took stock of the status of community kitchens, doorstep delivery and foodgrain distribution system and expressed satisfaction over the supply chain.

He also instructed officials to make all possible arrangements, including availability of essentials, during the month of Ramzan.

“The state government has been successfully running community kitchens and shelter homes during lockdown and this should be continued. Similarly, action against black-marketing, hoarding and profiteering should also be continued,” he stressed.

The chief minister said that medical check-up of those sent to home quarantine after completing 14 days of institutional quarantine, be ensured. “Also, the person being sent to home quarantine should be given foodgrain compulsorily,” he further directed.

Yogi also asked officials to ensure availability of persona protective equipment including N-95 masks, in hospitals while ensuring that the protective gears be of specified quality.

The Covid Care Fund and NHM funds should be utilised to purchase PPE kits,” he said.

“Nominate one nodal officer in each district where students from other countries or other states are studying in educational institutions. These officers will redress the problems of students from outside. Similarly, the problems of residents of Uttar Pradesh living in other states, should be taken care of by the officers nominated for other states,” he said.

Yogi said that in order to start projects related to road construction, cleaning of drains in rural and urban areas immediately after the lockdown, online operations for tendering and other logistics be started. He also directed the officials that in case of death of any destitute, last rites should be performed from the amount sanctioned by the administration.

Those present at the meeting included Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh, Chief Secretary RK Tiwari and other senior officers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm--formalise-pds-universalisation.html
7,18-4-20,Empire state of mind,"Will New York city rise again from the shadow of COVID-19? It did from the trauma of 9/11. Will there now be a second coming? Those familiar with NYC’s resilience know there will be

Peering through the window, I could see the iconic Manhattan landscape with its tall towers soaring into the sky. I was on an American Airlines flight from Washington DC that was set to land at what was then Idlewild Airport and is now John F Kennedy International Airport. That was my first view of New York City (NYC) and the date, if memory serves, was March 2, 1960.

Over the years, New York has become my second-most favourite city, the first being Kolkata, where I was born and where I grew up, and which remains home despite my decades in Delhi. I, therefore, deeply mourn the tragedy that has struck both NYC and New York state in the form of a massive COVID-19 attack, sending thousands to the hereafter and paralysing a throbbing megacity with its vibrant diversity of peoples and cultures, waxing along its wide avenues and in the shadows of its concrete canyons, epitomised by the Wall Street.

I am not the proverbial New Yorker who has lived in the city for years and feels the richness of its life in his/her viscera. I am an outsider whose many visits, none more than a month long at a time, have left behind a string of warm memories of exciting encounters with people, visits to galleries and museums, of the buzz of many voices in bars, varied fares in restaurants and hours of bookshop browsing (alas most of them have now closed down). The variety of people one sees is stunning — ranging from White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPS) to African Americans, from those of European origin to those of Chinese, Latin American, Sri Lankan, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Indian stock, from those in dark suits scurrying around in the financial district in lower Manhattan, to residual hippies lounging around in the Village’s Washington Square Park.

My memories, too, are diverse. I remember the West End Bar on the Broadway opposite Columbia University. Later closed down, it was frequented by the university’s faculty members and students and, often, by celebrities and writers. It was here that Jack Kerouac (On the Road, The Dharma Bums, The Subterraneans et al), William S Burroughs (of Naked Lunch and Junkie and much else) and Allen Ginsberg (Howl and Other Poems and Kaddish and Other Poems) held court, gave identity to Beat writing and shaped its emerging contours, with the word “Beat” being first used by Hubert Edwin Huncke (Guilty of Everything: The Autobiography of Herbert Edwin Huncke and The Evening Sun Turned Crimson among others).

Prior to gentrification in the last couple of decades or so, the area around Columbia University and the West End Bar was marked by poverty and a high crime rate. Now the Beats and kindred souls have left along with junkies, hustlers and muggers; the Yuppies (young, upwardly-mobile professionals) and the university authorities have taken over much of it. A sigh for that. But then NYC has seen many transient bursts of literary and artistic excellence under the canopy of its fervid creativity. The area around the Columbia University and the West End Bar is a part of West Harlem which, in turn, is included in the wider sprawl of Harlem, enveloping the central and eastern part of the latter, in the northern reaches of NYC.

In the 1920s and early 1930s, the entire area was the venue of what has come to be known as the Harlem Renaissance, which saw a flowering of African American culture in the spheres of literature, music, theatre, visual art and sculpture. There was an explosion of music, particularly jazz. Paul Robeson was a towering presence. Many others, who became tall eminences later, cut their teeth at the Cotton Club, for a long time a Whites-only nightclub at the heart of Harlem, which featured promising African American performers. Duke Ellington, composer, pianist and jazz orchestra leader, made his mark here. Louis Armstrong, trumpeter, who profoundly influenced the evolution of jazz, played here. Lena Horne, singer, dancer, actress and civil rights activist, made her mark here, as did Ethel Waters, celebrated for her mellifluous rendering of the blues and Adelaide Hall, the noted jazz singer who later migrated to Britain.

The visual and plastic arts flourished. Aaron Douglas’s paintings and Augusta Savage and Meta Warrick’s sculptures were widely and critically applauded. It was equally a time for intellectual ferment, which owed much to the collection of essays, The Soul of Black Folk (1903) by WEB Du Bois, sociologist, historian, civil rights activist, author and editor. He played a major, if not defining, role in shaping the Harlem Renaissance, as did Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and the African Communities league. The widely-circulated weekly newspaper, Negro World, which he founded and ran on behalf of the UNIA, and The Crisis, the quarterly mouthpiece of the NAACP which Du Bois founded in 1910 and edited until 1934, played a critically important role in publishing African American writers and giving them much-needed visibility.

Langston Hughes was, perhaps, the most important literary figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Countee Collen left behind his mark as a poet. Arna Bontemps and Jean Toomer were important writers whom The Crisis gave salience. While the Renaissance’s role in enabling individual writers to be recognised and successful is important, much more so its contribution to laying the groundwork for the evolution of African-American consciousness and literature and defining its ethos. Du Bois wanted African American artists to remember their moral responsibility projecting the issue of racial equality in their work. James Baldwin, the novelist and essayist whose writings shook the United States in the 1960s, did this in all his works, and, particularly tellingly, in Nobody Knows My Name and The Fire Next Time.

Unfortunately, the Great Depression delivered a crippling blow; other factors like internal squabbling worsened matters. The Harlem Renaissance hobbled to an end in the early 1930s. As they say, sic transit Gloria mundi (Thus goes worldly glory). Before waning, however, it projected the ethos and culture of African Americans on their terms and not in terms of the stereotypes many Whites had imposed on them. With its creative reverberations spreading far and wide, it made the world sit up and take note. It aroused the latent pride of African Americans in their own accomplishments, culture and capabilities and made them progressively unwilling to suffer the discrimination that had continued to be heaped on them despite the abolition of slavery. The road was prepared for the movement for equality, an issue that was gaining increasing momentum, to swell into the tidal wave of the civil rights movement of the 1960s when many barriers collapsed.

The 1960s were a turbulent period. Besides the peaking of the civil rights movement, the one against the United States’ participation in the Vietnamese War (as David Elliott calls it in his definitive book the by the same name), convulsed the campuses and streets. NYC was no exception and the highest point in the multiplicity of protest meetings, marches and sit-ins was clearly the April 15 Spring Mobilisation march against the war in Vietnam, which attracted several hundreds of thousands of participants.

In NYC, the civil rights, anti-war and the Beat movements, which often overlapped, flowed parallelly in the 1960s. The three subsided in the early1970s. The reasons were several. The civil rights legislation of the 1960s seemed to have taken some of the edge of the African American drive for equality. The Vietnamese war limped to a close in 1972. Internal feuds split the Left-leaning Students for a Democratic Society, which was active in both the anti-war and civil rights movements. All involved were tired of the prolonged campus unrest.

The Beat movement had also lost steam. The East Village Other, the shrill voice of counter-culture and protest, died in 1972. The Village Voice, a sober platform of creative dissent founded in 1955, ceased publication in 2017, surviving online till 2018. The Bohemians moved out of the village. Yet New York was not bereft of excitement. The village had its jazz and restaurants. Until the COVID-19 horror struck, performances and exhibitions drew thousands to the Lincoln Centre for the Performing Arts, which now houses the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet and the Julliard School of Music. The Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of Natural History drew streams of visitors.

Over the whole city now hangs the sinister shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. Will it ever recover? It did from the trauma of 9/11. Will there now be a second coming? Those familiar with NYC’s resilience know there will be.

9,18-4-20,Indore corona breeding ground,"As Indore alone presently has 2/3rd of total number of covid19 positive cases reported in Madhya Pradesh, there seems no respite in sight, at least for the time being.

The State commercial capital Indore has turned out be a breeding ground for corona cases and these infected persons have more than tripled in last one week.

The number of positive cases which were 249 on April 10 have now reached 842 on Friday with 244 of these cases were on Thursday. Total cases of infection in the State have reached 1274.

Thanks to rapid spread and unhindered spread of corona virus in Indore, Madhya Pradesh now stands at fourth place nationally in terms of maximum covid19 positive cases behind Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, the Congress party and BJP are passing the buck on each other for this massive covid19 outbreak in Madhya Pradesh.

Congress state media cell chairman Jitu Patwari in a statement has alleged that Indore’s situation has turned graver in 25 days of lockdown and CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan has failed miserably to prevent the spread of this virus. Patwari urged PM Narendra Modi to assess the situation in Indore personally or else the day is far when Indore would become Wuhan city.

Claiming that Chouhan has been running away from reality, the Congress leader demanded that the Chief Minister should start functioning from Indore.

Meanwhile, the BJP has also blamed Congress rule for the mess.Claiming that the inefficiency of the Kamal Nath government is responsible for the covid19 mess, BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal on Friday claimed that Centre had issued guidelines for corona prevention even before the first case was reported in India but the State government did nothing.

The State is paying a price for the mistakes of exCM Kamal Nath, alleged Agrawal claiming that now the Congress party is shifting the blame on Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In an important statement, Indore collector Manish Singh said that around 5000-6000 fliers who reached Indore via air route are to be blamed for the corona mess.

“I was appointed in Indore later so I am not sure what kind of guidelines were there for these visitors but I am of the view that these visitors were allowed without any screening or quarantine advisories,” said the collector.

Several of these visitors also landed here to take parts in ongoing agitations, he claimed hinting towards antiCAA protest which ran all the way till March at Badwali Chowki area. Several religious heads and noted personalities including Swara Bhaskar had attended the protest.

First five cases of corona virus infection were reported from Indore on March 24.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/indore-corona-breeding-ground.html

16,18-4-20,Khalid Rasheed’s fatwa on burial of corona victims,"Prominent Muslim cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali issued a fatwa in an attempt to clear misconception among the community over burial of COVID-19 patients who die.

In a fatwa issued by his seminary, Darul Uloom Farangi Mahali on Thursday night, Maulana Khalid Rasheed said the victims of coronavirus infection who die should be given decent burial as per rituals and their bodies should not be treated as untouchable.

The fatwa comes in the wake of a controversy in Lucknow on Wednesday night when a section of Muslims protested against the burial of a coronavirus victim in Aishbagh graveyard.

The deceased, a a64-year-old man, died in King George’s Medical University hospital on Wednesday.

As per Islamic Centre of India’s statement, Lucknow resident Sayed Ejaz Ahmad sought a fatwa on the last rites of a coronavirus victim. Ahmad sought answers about the ritual bath (gusl) before burial, shroud, janaza-e-namaaz (last collective prayer for the departed soul) and burial in the graveyards.

The fatwa said that `gusl’ for the body of coronavirus victim should only be formal and water be poured on the body bag.

“There is no need to open the body bag or a separate shroud. The body bag should be treated as a shroud,” the fatwa said.

Similarly, the fatwa said that last prayers be held keeping COVID-19 protocol of social distancing in mind and the body could be buried in a public graveyard.

The boycott of the burial on Wednesday was condemned and it was said that it was not only against Shariat but also against social courtesy and human behaviour.

The fatwa was given collectively by Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, Maulana Nasrullah, Maulana Naimur Rahman Siddiqui and Maulana Mohammad Mushtaq.

He said that similar PPE kits had been supplied to doctors of medical colleges.

“Despite daily meetings of Team-11 of chief minister, there is no check on the quality of PPEs. The glaring irregularity was revealed by the principal of government-run medical colleges in Noida and Agra. Sub-standard PPE could endanger the lives of medical staff fighting coronavirus pandemic,” Akhilesh said.

“The possibility of more such scams cannot be ruled out. The state government owes an answer to the people as to how sub-standard kits were supplied to corona warriors and how many have been replaced? The government must share information as to what action was taken on the complaint that was made before April 13 and why is the CM silent on the issue,” Akhilesh sought to know.

The SP chief further said that Samajwadi Party had repeatedly demanded that supply of good quality PPE kits be ensured. “Now the doctors will and paramedics will be more worried about how careless the government can get towards them.

In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday, Priyanka said that this was the period of wheat harvesting and farmers were perturbed as to how things were going to pan out. “Although permission to reap crops by harvester machines has been given in the state, machine owners are scared of the official rigmarole. Most drivers come from other states and hence, arrangements be made for their hindrance-free arrival. Farmers have been harvesting at night due to lack of clear cut information and fear of fines,” she said.

The Congress leader further said that cane dues of farmers be immediately paid and guarantee of purchasing crops also be given.

The letter also stated that in recent days, farmers had to face unseasonal rains and hailstorms but despite government announcements on compensation, farmers were yet to receive it, which should be addressed soon.

Priyanka further said that coronavirus pandemic had also brought along an economic crisis and glass, brass, carpet, weaving, furniture, leather, hosiery, dairy, clay pot, fishery-hatchery and other small industries had suffered much in the state.

Citing the deteriorating condition of labourers and small industries, the Congress leader appealed to the chief minister that an ‘Economic Reconstruction Task-Force’ of economic and planning experts be formed for economic revival of the state.

She further suggested that unregistered labourers be provided the guarantee of economic help as several of them were not getting benefits of any relief plan as they were not registered.

20,18-4-20,Rahul ‘bonds’ with Amethi Sends truckloads of relief for residents,"The drubbing in the last general elections in Amethi notwithstanding, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi does not seem to have severed his ties with the locals as he despatched a dozen trucks of foodgrains and other essentials, including safety kits, to his erstwhile political citadel at times of coronavirus spread.

Congress Legislative Party Leader (CLP) in UP Legislative Council, Deepak Singh said that the Congress honcho was concerned about the problems faced by Amethi residents due to the lockdown.

Rahul despatched five trucks of rice, five trucks of flour, one truck of pulses and a truck loaded with oil, spices etc on Thursday and these will be distributed along with a safety kit comprising of masks, sanitiser and soap.

“These commodities will be packed and given to 16,400 people spread across 877 gram panchayats of Amethi,” the Congress MLC said.

Singh claimed that in early April, Rahul had sent 12,000 sanitisers, 20,000 face masks and 10,000 soaps for the residents of Amethi, reminding them that their well-being meant a lot to him. “Besides, the Gandhi had also sent five trucks of wheat and rice for distribution among the local residents in the same week,” he said .

Extending help to residents of Amethi during the national health emergency emerged as a bone of contention between sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MP Smriti Irani and outgoing MP Rahul Gandhi, in the first week of April.

Sharing a news article on its Twitter handle, the Congress alleged that while MP from Amethi Smriti Irani was playing ‘antakshari’, Rahul Gandhi was fulfilling his responsibility towards Amethi residents by sending relief material.

Stung by the attack, Irani tweeted asking why would Rahul want lives to be saved?

She tweeted, “How would Rahul do his politics if the people survived? If he wished to know how Amethi was, he could ask Pradeep Singhal. I spoke to him (Singhal) about how to focus on development here keeping aside politics. You didn’t get the message, perhaps.”

21,18-4-20,Curbs on alcohol production lifted with rider,"The Uttar Pradesh government has lifted restrictions on production of alcohol in distilleries and breweries subject to the protocol and guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry on April 15 to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

The order issued by the principal secretary (excise) on Thursday said the restrictions on the operation of distilleries and breweries were being lifted before allowing the retail sale of country liquor, Indian-made foreign liquor and beer.

The order issued by Principal Secretary (Excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy on Thursday evening went viral on the social media, triggering hope among tipplers that liquor would soon be available in the retail liquor vends.

Reddy said prior to permitting the retail sale of potable alcohol, it was essential to allow the production in distilleries and breweries for the sake of huge revenue from this sector.

For 2020-21, the UP government has set a target of realising over Rs 31,000 crore from the sale of different kinds of potable alcohol and beer.

He said the order had been issued after prior consultation with the home department.

The principal secretary said the production, packaging, transport, marketing and retail sales of potable alcohol was banned till the Central and state government decide on it after April 20.

The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), the apex body of leading liquor firms, has demanded an exit plan to open distilleries and liquor shops, including pubs and restaurants, in non-COVID-19 hotspots.

36,18-4-20,Telemedical faster way to issue insurance,"The COVID-19 crises have underlined the role technology can play in underwriting life and health policies.

Santosh Agarwal, CBO – Life Insurance, Policybazaar.com said that the telemedical has emerged as a faster, safer and most secured way to issue insurance for the consumers in the current environment.

It is quite obvious that if the healthiest people or the young generation- who is at the least risk of being infected with the novel coronavirus - don’t show up in emergency rooms, more resources would be available to treat the most vulnerable patient - elderly and kids – who need extra care. It is advised that if you are looking for an affordable, convenient health and life insurance plan anytime soon, consider getting one plan that offers insurance plan through telemedical.

Why Telemedical Is the Way Forward?

Amidst the corona outbreak, online aggregator like PolicyBazaar.com has partnered with insurance companies including both, life and health companies to issue a policy by way of telemedical consultation instead of a physical medical test.

The online aggregator/channel has worked with Insurance companies to ramp up their telemedical services with an increased volume of physicians and other health professionals lined up to consult with patients and assess their health condition over a call making the need of visiting a physical centre during the COVID-19 outbreak redundant.

It won’t be wrong to say that allowing people to buy health and life insurance through virtual care options such as telemedical can be an effective way while minimising their exposure to other potentially contagious viruses.

By offering policies through telemedical, online insurance platforms aim to continue providing an essential service like Term Life and Health Insurance to more and more customers as pandemic situations like these are a wake up call that make us realise the importance of having a robust insurance cover that protects against death, disease, and disability. Notably, the coronavirus continues to spread to across 192 countries around the world and infect more than 4,22,000 people, hospitals and clinics are expecting a swell in the number of visitors to emergency rooms.

41,18-4-20,Lockdown: W Odisha hoteliers seek sops,"Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western Odisha (HRAWO) has sent SOS to the State Government seeking sops for the hospitality industry, which is in dire straits due to COVID-19 pandemic.

HRAWO general secretary Abhishek Lath has requested the State Government for a revival package post lockdown period as it seems the hospitality industry's survival will be difficult with a longer period of lockdown.

Presenting a memorandum to Minister Tourism Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi, the HRAWO has urged the State Government to depute a senior official of the Department of Tourism to help in chalking out a strategy after looking into several aspects of problems being faced by hoteliers in western Odisha.

Lath stated that tourism in western Odisha is not that developed as coastal Odisha and hotel industry in this zone is in a nascent stage.

Hotels and restaurants are closed down, however, the hoteliers are spending a lot to keep the property sanitized and maintaining staff while paying them their salaries.

Apprehensions are there that lockdown will continue till June and followed by rainy seasons, survival of hotel industry will be very difficult.

In this backdrop, the HRAWO has requested the State Government to allow a State owned bank to provide loan with subsidized rate of interest.

The HRAWO has requested for complete waiver of electricity bill, Bar License fee for six months and bank interest incurred during lockdown period for three months.

The HRAWO has requested the State Government to form a committee of all hotel and restaurant associations of Odisha, being endorsed by Department of Tourism to interact with several departments of the Government on the issues related to revival package post lockdown and its implementation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown--w-odisha-hoteliers-seek-sops.html

Thakur said that only persons with negative reports should be allowed to enter the borders and strict vigil should be kept on such persons during their home quarantine.

The Chief Minister asked the officers to increase the sampling of persons of high risk areas for coronavirus so that situation could be normalized there at the earliest. He said that hot spots of coronavirus would be sealed and there would be no relaxation in curfew in these areas.

He said inter-district and intra-district movement must be restricted so that there were minimum chances of spread of virus to other areas, adding that a mechanism should be evolved under which voluntary blood donors could come forward in donating their blood so that there was no shortage of blood in the hospitals. He said that it must be ensured that proper screening of blood donors was done before taking the blood of the individuals.

Thakur said that the State Government was concerned about the people the State stranded in other States and it is in constant touch with these people and the respective State Governments have been requested to ensure their proper care.

43,18-4-20,SAD asks Capt to stop Ministers from violating social distancing norms,"Raising the issue of “irresponsible behaviour” of Congress legislators and Ministers who were rushing to mandis and throwing all social distancing norms to the wind, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal on Friday asked Punjab Chief Minister to immediately give directions to them not to endanger the health of farmers by crowding mandis only for the sake of a public relation opportunity.

“Due action should also be taken against everyone violating social distancing norms,” said the SAD chief.

Pointing out that e-token system had failed in Punjab, Sukhbir asked the Chief Minister to take immediate corrective steps to avert total chaos in grain markets in the State during the ongoing wheat procurement season.

“Besides the failure of the e-token system, the State's inability to arrange required gunny bags, lack of cleanliness and basic hygiene in mandis and inability to take arhtiyas along in the procurement exercise has exposed the Government's lack of preparation. It seems that most plans have been made on paper only as there is a big mismatch between the announcements of the Government and ground situation,” said Sukhbir.

Speaking about the problems being faced by farmers, Sukhbir said that there was a lot of confusion about the App which generates an e-pass for travel to mandis. “Farmers are not able to validate e-token on their mobiles. Many also do not have smart phones,” he said.

“Farmers are also demanding that they be allowed to weigh their wheat trailers at weigh bridges before entering the mandi to speed up the entire procurement process. Another solution is to set up multiple weigh bridges in each block and ask farmers to get their produce there,” he added.

SAD president said that coming days could be even worse due to severe shortage of gunny bags in most mandis. “There are widespread complaints that basic requirements like adequate water and soap are not being provided in mandis. Besides, farmers should also be allowed to manage their wheat straw immediately and not be told to wait till May 1 as this would affect its quality and quantity besides it is a fire hazard if left unattended,” he added.

Requesting the Chief Minister to intervene and resolve all pending issues of arhtiyas who were on strike, Sukhbir said that the commission agents were demanding payment of Rs 200 crore in dues and insurance cover for labourers besides other issues. “Instead of threatening them with punitive action, the Government should talk with them in farmers’ interest,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-asks-capt-to-stop-ministers-from-violating-social-distancing-norms.html

45,18-4-20,UT Admn allows private Covid-19 testing lab,"Any citizen who wants to get tested for COVID-19 (Coronavirus) can now get it done at a private lab. For the Chandigarh Administration has authorized a private lab-- SRL Diagnostics – to collect samples and test them at subsidized rate of Rs 4500 per patient.

Apart from this, the Administration has also decided to start rapid testing facility in the city.

These decisions were taken at the meeting held by Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore on Friday here.

UT Home-cum-Health Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said that that the Central Government has dispatched rapid testing kits, which will be utilized in consultation with medical experts in the city.

He also said that SRL Diagnostics has now been authorized to collect Covid samples and test them at subsidized rates of Rs 4500 per patient. Any private citizen can take advantage of this facility, he addwd.

Only a day before, the UT Administrator Badnore had asked the UT officers to explore the possibility of launching rapid testing facility here. Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for diagnosis.

Currently, PGIMER, GMCH-32 and CSIR-IMTECH are testing Covid-19 samples in the city.

The present Covid-19 detection tests being carried out in the country are called PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which require nasal or throat swabs.

The rapid testing kits are quicker to get early results and use blood samples of suspected patients and normally take around 15-30 minutes to give the result. Under this, one has to clean their finger with an alcohol swab and use the lancet provided for finger-pricks.

The city has so far recorded 21 positive Covid-19 patients out of which ten have recovered. With the discharge of one more patient from PGIMER on Friday, the number of active Covid cases in Chandigarh has reduced to 11.

During the meeting, the Administration directed Director Health Services, Dr G Dewan to ensure that private doctors running clinics and dispensaries are trained properly in handling Covid-19 cases, so that the unfortunate situation, as happened in Panchkula does not arise here.

Notably, a private doctor in Panchkula was booked by the local Police under relevant provisions of law for allegedly failing to inform state health authorities that he had been treating a suspected Coronavirus patient. The patient—a woman—later tested positive for the Coronavirus.

Badnore also directed all UT officials to strictly follow discipline and the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to time.

He also appealed the residents to download and utilise the Arogaya Setu mobile application which will serve as a personal shield for them against Covid-19. He expressed hope that with full cooperation of Chandigarh residents we can get out of the red zone.

Chandigarh has been declared a Covid-19 hotspot by the Central Government. A curfew was imposed in the city on March 24 to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of Covid-19.

UT considering concession in electricity charges

UT Finance Secretary AK Sinha on Friday said that the matter regarding concession in electricity charges is under consideration.

In view of curfew imposition in the city, the Administration has already extended the due date of electricity bills for all consumers. The Administration has also allowed the residents to make self assessment of the power bills.

In Chandigarh, there are around 2.25 lakh power consumers, out of which 1.75 lakh are residential users.

Admn to provide ration to NGOs

With people from the economically weaker sections struggling to get regular supply of food in the city, the UT Administration has decided to provide ration to NGOs to supply cooked food to the needy people.

While supply of essential items is going on smoothly in the sectors, needy people in periphery areas are struggling to get meal every day as some NGOs and other organizations providing cooked food had withdrawn from the services due to shortage of ration.

“A mix of ration and cooked food will be supplied. The supply of milk powder has also been started for small children,” said a senior UT officer.

He said that to encourage charities to supply cooked food, the Administration has decided to provide them ration. Administration, which is currently providing 5,000 cooked food packets, will also be boosting the supply through its mid-day meal infrastructure.”

Use of e-coupons are also being planned for streamlining distribution and shortening waiting time for people for collecting ration, he added

So far, around 10,000 families have been provided with wheat and pulses under PMGKAY in the city.68,525 cooked food packets were distributed among the destitutes and needy persons in various parts of the city on Friday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-admn-allows-private-covid-19-testing-lab.html

The ‘Mobile Police Clinics’ are working in all seven police ranges and police commissionerates of the State to medical examine the frontline police force, which has been working relentlessly for curfew enforcement and relief operations, across three shifts a day, said the state DGP Dinkar Gupta on Friday.

In some of the districts, help is being taken from the civil hospital doctors also to get the police personnel, especially on duty at the naka points, checked for symptoms of flu or other illnesses.

52,18-4-20,It's as much to fight corona as to fight poverty,"Poverty has taken the cruellest of its forms amidst the nationwide lockdown owing to the corona pandemic and the impact of the lockdown is unbearable and crucifying to the poor and migrant labourers.

Lockdown implies a different story for the rich and urban middle class but it is something completely different for the migratory labourers and the poor people who live on a day to day earning, those who thrive on a day’s income to buy food and other basic necessities like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). The point is they don’t have a consistent and committed income, they never had it; and that is the precise reason for which, they don’t have and cannot be expected to have savings to meet the exigencies and demands of the present time. Though quite late, but the Indian poor have made their presence felt and registered their protest in between the corona crisis, they have now stood up to say, ‘look, you shouldn’t forget to count on us’.

They are now protesting, in one of such instances, believing a fake news of resumption of outstation trains many poor migrant labourers gathered at Bandra station in Mumbai and used that opportunity to register their protest, some news of protest have also come from Surat.

We have also seen images of many walking hundreds of kilometres to their native. One of such cruel realities is, once the lockdown was declared and inter-State borders were sealed with absolutely no means of transportation, we have witnessed that, in the wee hours of the morning many such migrant labourers have set for their native places, which are miles away. The irony is, they are bereft of the treatment of care and compassion from the cities they have helped build, they are forced to walk along the roads which wouldn’t have been built without their help.

The sudden lockdown has meant that millions of migrants labourers actually had no time to get back to their destinations of optimum security, that is their native home. There cannot be anymore sense of betrayal, than how they have been treated, as in good times the cities have relied on the oceanic workforce drawn from the less privileged parts of the country, which includes job opportunity seeking low-paid/underpaid labourers, taxi drivers, restaurant staff and industrial workers. And this economic storm has made their lives upside down, it has dried their incomes and all prospects of sustaining their minimum living. It shall not be wrong if we put the post lockdown moment of the poor, as ‘a walking exodus’. Chinmay Tumbe, the author of ‘India Moving: A History of Migration’, has compared this situation of, the walking exodus of millions, with something worse than what had happened in 1947 during the bloody partition of the Indian subcontinent.

And the fact in hand is, the Government is sitting on surplus food or food grain, which are rotting and infested with rats and fungus in Food Corporation of India godowns, since there is no demand or market. As per data available in FCI website, it has 3.09 million tons of wheat, 2.75 million tons of rice and 2.87 million tons of paddy which is more than three times of the required ‘buffered stock norms’. And new Rabi crop is coming in, wheat and mustard will be produced in bulk in States like Punjab, which will again be kept in open. As a consequence, they will be destroyed due to various natural circumstances like rain and pests. So it is prudent to let the grains be taken out and given to the poor. And since excess grain is a liability, so instead of just disbursing money, let the duration and quantum of distribution of food grains and pulses be enhanced.

In the meantime, the Government has declared that, everybody in the PDS scheme shall get another 5 kilo of grain and 1 kilo of pulses every month free for 3 months. On this Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has demanded that 10 kilo of grains and 1 kg dal and 1 kg sugar be given through PDS, his demand and the aforesaid reasoning and suggestions actually are stemmed and supported in the strong arguments and suggestions given by eminent economists Amartya Sen, Raghuramm Rajan and Abhijeet Banerjee in their article published in the Indian Express. They have also suggested that the poor who don’t have access to ration card, since it is stuck in some or the other kind of verification process, be issued temporary ration cards with minimum scrutiny.

Food grains alone shall not be able to wipe the tears of the poor, and to address their necessities and concerns, it is necessary to give them some cash. It is learnt that the Government has already decided to remit cash to the accounts of the poor by JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) and Rs 1.75 lakh crore is sanctioned and is being disbursed to “80 crore poorest Indians” under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) over three months starting from April 1. But there is a need to further diversify the mediums, like basing upon the rolls of MNREGA and other social security records, and also it is necessary to make a reality check that, the process is not hindered owing to technical hitch.

We need to understand that, the lockdown is a story that is to run for quite some time now, but that should not be putting life out of the track. It as much important to escape from the fatal traps of corona, as it is essential to keep starvation away, empower the farmers to be able to fetch seed and fertiliser for the next season, replenish the stocks of shopkeepers, to make a whole lot of us to repay our debts and in essence to live and make the civilisation survive the worst tragedy that humanity has faced so far, but this essentially has to be done with compassion and care for the weak, the needy and the poor.

60,18-4-20,Char Dham reopening,"The reopening of the Char Dham shrines is slated to begin from April 26 though due to the nation-wide lockdown in view of COVID-19, the Yatra is not going to resume as usual with the opening of the shrines. While about 32 lakh pilgrims had visited the Char Dham shrines last year, when the regular Yatra will be allowed this year remains uncertain.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has stated that the shrines would be opened on the scheduled dates. However, only the necessary minimum number of priests and supporting staff would be present to conduct ritual worship in the shrines. The State Government is also attempting to facilitate the return of the Rawal (chief priest) of Badrinath, Ishwari Prasad Namboodri from his native village in Kerala and the Kedarnath Rawal Bhima Shankar Lingam from Nanded in Maharashtra. However, a decision would be taken in a few days in case this is not possible. Regarding this uncertainty, the Shankaracharya of Jyotirpeeth (Joshimath) and Sharadapeeth (Dwarka), Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati has stated that lord Badrinath is a national deity and his ritual worship according to tradition must be ensured.

Stating that there should not be any change in tradition like resorting to online Puja, he opined that the chief minister should use his authority to bring the Rawal to Badrinath by air.

Acknowledging the problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Shankaracharya stressed that in these troubling times, it is vital to conduct the ritual worship in Badrinath with more care while observing precautions.

Meanwhile, on Friday the Devbhumi Teerth Purohit Hakhakookdhari Mahapanchayat of Uttarakhand wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, appealing him to ensure that the Rawals of Badrinath and Kedarnath reach the shrines on time.

A representative body of the priests and traditional right holders of the Char Dham and other related shrines in Uttarakhand, the Mahapanchayat reminded the PM that Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines would be reopened on April 26 while Kedarnath would reopen on April 29 and Badrinath on April 30. While the chief priests of Gangotri and Yamunotri are from the local community, the Rawals of Badrinath and Kedarnath are traditionally from south India. To maintain the ancient traditions, it is essential for these two Rawals to reach the shrines before the temples are reopened. It is the Rawals who oversee all the rituals in the shrines.

Citing the uncertainty on the timely arrival of the Rawals due to the nation-wide lockdown, the Mahapanchayat has requested the PM to initiate action from his level to ensure that the chief priests arrive on time in order to maintain the ancient traditions established by Adi Shankaracharya.

The Mahapanchayat has also requested the PM to issue directions to the State government on this subject.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/char-dham-reopening.html

67,18-4-20,PSPCL consumers deposit advance payment of `35 cr,"In less than a week, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited’s (PSPCL) offer for its consumers to pay in advance and earn interest has received resonating response as the State power utility has received an advance payment of Rs 35 crores till date.

Notably, the banks have reduced the interest rates on fixed deposits (about six percent per annum) as well as on savings accounts (about 3.5 percent) in recent days.

Thus, to mobilize funds during corona pandemic and to help the consumers earn a better rate of return, the PSPCL has recently launched a scheme to offer its consumers of all categories to make advance payment towards their estimated electricity bills up to March 2021 through digital modes and earn interest at the rate of one percent per month on advance payment as per Clause 31.8 of Supply Code, 2014.

With this, the consumers will earn interest almost at 12 percent per annum, that is double the rate of interest on fixed deposit.

“This offer has received a resonating response from consumers of all categories. Oasis Enterprises (Rs 10 crores), STELCO Industries Private Limited (Rs 7 crores), Veekay Concast (Rs 5 crores), Arishudan Industries Limited (Rs 4 crores), Vardhman Adarash Ispat Private Limited (Rs 3 crores), Waryam Steels (Rs 2 crores) are major contributors,” said PSPCL chairman cum managing director Baldev Singh Sran.

Sran said that this drive is not confined only to LS consumers, rather Medium Supply and Small Power Industrial consumers, Commercial Consumers and more than 70 Domestic Consumers have also availed this opportunity to deposit lakh of rupees as advance payment of bills.

“The corporation is indebted and grateful to its esteemed consumers who have come forward to deposit advance bills of Rs 35 crore at the call of PSPCL. This shall provide much needed liquidity to PSPCL in the hour of crisis of scarce financial resources and also help consumers to earn handsome returns on their deposit,” he said.

Sran said that it was a win-win situation as in case of delay to pay power generators, PSPCL has to pay 12 percent per annum as a late payment surcharge which can now be paid to consumers who would get almost double the interest being offered for fixed deposits.

At the same time, Sran appealed to other consumers of all categories to help PSPCL sustain these difficult times and to avail this golden opportunity to earn extra interest. Make advance payment at PSPCL bill portal — https://billpayment.pspcl.in/, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pspcl-consumers-deposit-advance-payment-of--35-cr.html
68,18-4-20,API among 18 highly-polluting sectors in country,"Hydroxychloroquine is being used worldwide as a medication for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed India’s overdependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), also known as bulk drugs, defined by the World Health Organisation as any substances used in finished pharmaceutical products.

APIs denote the dosage in a drug, or in other words, the key chemicals that make the drug work, while finished formulation is the process in which different chemicals, including the active ingredient, are mixed in specified ratios to produce a specific drug. The API means the active ingredient which is contained in medicine. For example, an active ingredient to relieve pain is included in a painkiller or analgesic. This is called API. A small amount of the active ingredient has an effect, so only a tiny part of the active ingredient is contained in medicine.

The chemical compound which is in the process of becoming an API from a raw material is called an intermediate. Among the APIs we produce, there is an API which passes through over ten kinds of intermediates in a process when it changes from being a raw material into an API. After this long manufacturing process, it is purified until it reaches a very high degree of purity and finally becomes an API. In addition to APIs, a variety of pharmaceutical excipients are contained in the medicine. Drug manufacturers make medicines by mixing APIs and pharmaceutical excipients. This is how an API becomes a medicine. It is delivered to hospitals and pharmacies until it reaches the patient. If an API is not ultrapure, a medicine cannot meet the strict quality criteria so the quality of an API plays a very important role.

India’s pharmaceutical industry is the third-largest in the world in terms of volume. Two-thirds of the total imports of bulk drugs or APIs, however, come from China. India imports around 90 per cent of APIs used to make antibiotics. The recent studies have identified direct emission from drug manufacturing as a source of much higher environmental discharges that, in some cases, greatly exceed toxic threshold concentrations. The discharges that promote the development of drug-resistant microorganisms have global concern. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified the API sector as one among 18 highly-polluting industries in the country.

69,18-4-20,Focus more on Ayurveda for combating disease: Kamboj,"Set up in the year 2001 on the old Mussoorie Road in a picture perfect location in Dehradun, the Uttaranchal Ayurvedic College and hospital has established itself as an excellent academic centre for learning and research in Ayurveda and Yogic sciences in the country. On threat posed by the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and containing its further spread in population, the chairman of the institute, Ashawani Kamboj opines that government and other agencies should focus more on the ancient practice of Ayurveda for combating the dreaded viral disease.

Talking to The Pioneer, he said, “It is a known fact that apart from treatment of herpes zoster, the allopathic system does not have medicine for any other disease caused by virus. On the other hand, the Ayurvedic system is based on fitness and sickness principle for treatment.

The Kadha of Neem, Giloi and Turmeric helps in strengthening of immune system while there are medicines which treat viral infection,’’ he said. Kamboj added that the institute is working on a draft proposal which would have a comprehensive strategy for COVID-19.

He said that due to the lockdown, the college is closed but the hospital is functioning. “Our OPD has decreased from about 150 on normal days to 30-40 these days. For patients of flu, we have made separate arrangement.

We provide free treatment for poor patients. As the lockdown has affected poor the most, we are in sync with local MLA and councillor for providing help to such people. The management has also decided to donate Rs 2 lakh for PM CARES fund,’’ he said. Kamboj added that the college has started online classes for the students from April 15 so that their studies are not hampered.

The schedule of online classes is from 10 am to 4 pm on all working days. The chairman admitted that the practice of social distancing would have to be strictly followed once the lockdown is lifted and the institute is seeking the opinion of experts for remodelling classrooms, sitting arrangements of students and other campus activities in changed times.

When asked about the financial condition of the institute during such hard times, Kamboj said, “Our financial position was not good from last one and half years due to the agitation of the students which had affected collection of fees. To meet our expenses and pay salaries of staff we have taken a loan of Rs 3 Crore from bank.’’

He added that if the authorities want that the private educational institutes keep providing salaries to its staff then it should allow them to collect fees also. Kamboj opined that the government should compensate the institutes if it wants that they should not charge fees from the students.

On the question of chances of placements of the college getting affected by the prevailing crisis, Kamboj said that he expects the placements to decrease by 20 to 30 per cent.

This has resulted in temporary stoppages in some of the ongoing contracts, informed Vivek Anand Public Relations Officer of ESL.

Anand said, ESL has urged its contractors to take care of the people who have been asked to stay back at home at this point in time.

Presently due to coronavirus pandemic, the world economy has gone into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income, spelling serious trouble for the businesses of both developed as well as in developing countries. This has negatively affected the cash flows of all major manufacturing units across the country, he said.

To support this ongoing crisis and to ensure the business continuity, ESL as an organization has taken certain steps to ensure the critical units of the plant are operational with reduced capacity adhering to the COVID -19 guidelines issued by the Central and State Governments, said Anand.

But there are various such messages on this subject which is being spread without understanding the above rationale, he said.

Our nation and economy is passing through a very tough phase with no visibility of immediate revival. We always remain firm on our commitment to serve the society at large by ensuring that the plant remains operational and continues to cater to the livelihood of more than 7000 direct and almost 15000 families who are indirectly related to us, said Anand.

All such contracts which are under suspension are purely a resultant of the current situation and shall be reviewed periodically to ensure continued support to the local community, he said.

ESL being a responsible corporate citizen continues its efforts to support the community at large through various initiatives even during these difficult times and expects a revival of from the pandemic soon, said PRO.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/esl-scales-down-few-operations-temporarily.html

The central bank chief also lauded the state for registering a robust economic growth driven by uninterrupted agricultural and allied activities during the lockdown.

A state government statement further claimed that RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said Chhattisgarh is leading in the sowing of kharif crops and other agricultural activities despite adverse conditions during the lockdown.

Describing the increase in sowing of paddy in Chhattisgarh and other states as “silvers of brightness amidst an encircling gloom”, the RBI governor said: “The efforts in increasing food grain stocks will help the country’s economy to stage a sharp V-shaped recovery in 2021-22 as projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).”

Das took note of the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activity on the back of all-time highs in the production of food grains, with huge buffer stocks of rice and wheat far in excess of the buffer norms.

“Over the last three weeks, there have been a few data releases on domestic developments (including on factory output), but they are too disjointed to allow a comprehensive assessment of the state of the economy,” he said.

By April 10, pre-monsoon kharif sowing had begun strongly, with acreage of paddy up by 37 per cent in comparison with the last season, he said. States such as West Bengal, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh are leading in sowing activity despite the lockdown, das added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rbi-governor-lauds-c---garh-for-registering-robust-economic-growth-despite-lockdown.html

With the nation-wide lockdown extended until May 3 and as schools and colleges are closed, the online education is the only option for continuing with the children’s education, Baghel said in his letter.

“I am glad to inform that Chhattisgarh has developed a complete e-learning portal to provide free online education at cgschool.in,” he said.

“We have named it 'Padhai Tuhar Dwar' which in Chhattisgarhi dialect means education at your doorstep.

“This portal has brought classroom experience online, where students get all the facilities to study and learn online, “ he said and added that a video lecture series of all the classes and subjects are available on the portal, which students may access at their own time and space.

An audio and a PDF study material are also available on the portal for improving the curriculum, he said.

“Children can ask their queries and clear their doubts online, which will be answered by the teachers.

“Homework questions are also available online, which can be solved at home and sent online for evaluation by teachers,” Baghel said.

Online interactive classes are also being held and the portal was started for school education on April 7, and within a week 65 lakh page views were recorded, the Chhattisgarh CM said.

More than 1.26 lakh students have registered for online classes and more than 1.26 lakh teachers have been selected to teach the courses, Baghel said and added that the numbers are constantly increasing.

“And anyone, especially people of Hindi-speaking states, can take advantage of the study material. I have received information that all the states are making efforts in the direction of online education.”

The knowledge sharing by teachers of all Hindi-speaking states on one portal will turn it into a huge treasure-chest of knowledge for students, Baghel said.

“You can also get the portal customised as per the requirements of your state. Students of all the states can start using the portal right away,” Baghel said in the letter.

Government officials from Chhattisgarh can provide a demo of the portal, Baghel said and asked his counterparts in the others states to contact officials of the school education department of Chhattisgarh for further details.

The Anjuman Islamia after consultation with members of community and residents nearby the cemetery is to give the name of graveyard where the dead bodies of corona patient can be buried.

Residents of Ratu Road and Joda Talab area protested after they came to know that Ranchi district administration was to bury the dead body of an elderly corona positive man from Hindpiri area.

The religious leaders have identified the burial ground.”

Echoing the views of minister, Ranchi SDM Lokesh Mishra said that the religious leaders have to indentify the burial ground after having consultation with local residents too as on previous occasion we have seen that at Kabristan it was local resident who protested against burying the dead body at graveyard.

Last Sunday, throwing the social distance advisory in wind, at least 200 people gathered and protested outside the cemetery against the Ranchi district administration's decision to bury the body in the graveyard as they feared that burying corona patient can lead to spread of infection. They also demanded that the corpse be buried somewhere else.

89,18-4-20,"BJP, JMM spat over transfer of police officials","State BJP and JMM today crossed swords over the transfer of a special branch officer, who was deputed in Lohardaga and was transferred recently.

While the BJP charged the Government for doing vote bank politics, the JMM wanted to know what the relation of BJP with Special branch was as the latter was having problem with Government’s internal works.

State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo termed the transfer of four DSPs including DSP Jitendra Kumar posted at Lohardaga in the special branch by the State Government as the culmination of appeasement politics. He said that the communal riots of Lohardaga shook the entire State.

“The DSP of the special branch sent a report to the headquarters on February 29, saying that the Rohingya and Bangladeshis were involved in these riots. He also talked about giving protection to 13 people of Lohardaga. Among the patrons were the names of Congress leaders and their relatives, the constituents of the ruling coalition.

The government should have taken cognizance of this report, but in contrast, it transferred four DSPs including the DSP of Special Branch of Lohardaga. In Lohardaga on the lines of the Hindpiri model, the government also appointed a minority officer in a special branch,” said Pratul.

He further said that BJP believes that transfer of officers reporting the presence of foreigners in this manner will break the morale of the police force. The state BJP will also ask the Union Home Minister to get an NIA inquiry into the whole issue.

Reacting on the allegations JMM spokesperson Manoj Kumar Pandey questioned the relationship of the saffron party with special branch.

“The Special Branch is an intelligence department, which is not interfered into by the government. Do BJP leaders not know this? The transfer of four DSPs of the Special Branch is a routine process.

There is no mention of any investigation or charge in the transfer order either. In such a situation, the BJP should tell what is its relationship with the special branch? Did the special branch work at the behest of the BJP in the Raghubar government? Is this why the BJP is facing problems on the internal transfers?” he questioned.

Pandey said that the statement of Shahdeo is absolutely irresponsible. He wants to give communal colour to the inner workings of the government and government departments under a conspiracy.

Today the whole country and the State is engaged in fighting against Corona, but it does not matter to the BJP. The BJP wants to give religious colour to every issue under its agenda. Efforts are being made to disturb the state. It will not be tolerated, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp--jmm-spat-over-transfer-of-police-officials.html

98,18-4-20,RMC needs Rs 10 crore to fight coronavirus: Mayor,"Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra on Friday said that inspite of limited resources Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) is playing a vital role in fighting against the pandemic Coronavirus.

While addressing a press conference on April 17, Lakra spoke about the civic body’s requirements in fighting the virus and also the coming summer months. A letter regarding the same has been addressed to the Chief Minister, Urban Development Minister and Secretary Urban Development Department on April 15.

The Mayor said that to prevent the spread of the virus in the State capital, RMC requires a sum of Rs 10 crore. A letter regarding the same had been addressed to the Chief Minister on April 8 but sadly no decision on this matter was taken in the cabinet meeting on April 13.

In view of the increasing number of positive cases, special emphasis on sanitization and cleanliness is being given to three wards- ward numbers 21, 22 and 23 in the Hindpiri locality. If in the coming days, the infection spreads to other wards, the situation will become very scary. Therefore, to prevent its spread adequate resources are required.

Lakra further stated that presently there are 2400 cleaners under RMC who are working without a PPE kit and other safety equipment. In order to sanitize all houses, apartments and slum areas, RMC requires handgun spray, sanitizer machine, sodium hypochlorite chemical, bleaching powder, hand sanitizer and other equipments.

The civic body has also made a provision of giving Rs 2000 as an additional incentive to the sanitary workers for the months of March, April and May on the basis of minimum 20 days attendance. In case of contracting the disease, all medical expenses will be borne by RMC and in case of death Rs 10 lakh will be given to the dependents.

The monthly expenses of RMC have gone up to Rs 7 crore from Rs 5 crore and the present Congress- JMM government is not bothered about the safety of the workers. The central government has allotted a fund of Rs 284 crore and if RMC is not given even Re 1 from it, what will it be used for.

The Mayor also stated that the government is not serious about the upcoming summer months. A total amount of Rs 19,77,81,321.00 is required for the current financial year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Two letters regarding the same have been addressed to the Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department but the issue has not been sorted yet.

Water user charges being collected by RMC is being transferred to Drinking Water and Sanitization Department. In such a situation, to provide water to the common people new schemes (boring, tanker) can be used.

A proposal to allocate funds from the department for the repair and maintenance of old hand pumps, mini HYDTW and HYDTW has also been made. In various localities, RMC supplies water through boring and tankers to the people.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rmc-needs-rs-10-crore-to-fight-coronavirus--mayor.html

The Congress president also demanded that Covid-19 testing facilities should be made available in MCD hospitals to widen the testing facilities in Delhi so that more and more people could be tested and preventive steps could be taken accordingly. “A large number of patients visit hospitals run by Corporations and if Covid-19 test facilities are made available in these hospitals more people could be tested for the COVID pandemic,” he added.

He further alleged that Mayors and Standing Committee members of all three Corporations have not been spotted in respective zones. He asked them to join hands with the Corona warriors in fighting to eliminate the pandemic.

Kumar pointed out that the Corporations have not announced any relief package for the people, particularly the poor and the needy.

103,18-4-20,"1st cop to test virus +ve recovers, discharged from hospital","Listening to recitals of the Bhagwad Gita and keeping himself away from news about coronavirus motivated police official Jeet Singh during his recovery from the dreaded contagious disease.

""I have got a new lease of life,"" said Singh, an assistant sub inspector (ASI) attached to the traffic unit, who was the first policeman from Delhi to test positive for COVID-19.

On Friday, the 49-year-old returned to his home following recovery with his neighbours showering flowers on him.

""I felt very good when I recovered and was welcomed by my colleagues and staff who applauded. I feel like I have got a second life. With God's grace, I recovered and my recovery period went smoothly,"" he told PTI.

When he fell sick a few weeks ago, Singh thought he had the common flu and viral fever and stayed at home. But the fever and throat pain refused to go and got worse.

""On April 7, my throat was choked and I couldn't breathe. I felt my end was near. I had high fever of 103-104 degrees Celsius,"" he recalled.

Singh gave his samples for testing on April 7 and was informed the same evening that he had contracted the virus.

""I was deployed on picket duty so I don't know who I came contact with and how I was infected with the virus. I had body pain and fever, so I went to AIIMS where doctors advised me for home quarantine for 14 days,"" he said.

After his test result came positive, he informed his seniors who got him admitted to Safdarjung Hospital.

He lost his appetite and was on oxygen support. He was in extreme difficulty from April 7 to 10. By April 10, he started feeling better after his temperature went down. He still had difficulty in breathing and body pain but by April 13, his symptoms disappeared and the medicines given to him were reduced.

""It was a hard time but the tough times have passed successfully. When I was undergoing treatment in hospital, I did not think I was a coronavirus patient. The doctors advised me to not strain and stress on it and instead told me to treat it like any other disease,"" he said.

Following the doctors' advice, he never let the disease bog him down.

""I used to watch Bhagwad Gita (recitals) on YouTube and other religious texts to stay positive and motivated during this tough time. I used to do Devi Kavach paath daily,"" he said. Singh said he avoided watching the news since it used to be ""full of coronavirus and related deaths which would be scary"". He would watch the news only once in a day to stay updated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/1st-cop-to-test-virus--ve-recovers--discharged-from-hospital.html

106,18-4-20,Chouhan longest serving CM sans Cabinet!,"Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has created a record of being in office for 25 days without his Cabinet. Having assumed office on March 23 in a brief function amid corona scare, Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been spreaheading his Government alone and is yet to form his Cabinet.

While doing so, Chouhan has created a sort of record of being the Chief Minister for longest term sans a Cabinet. Chouhan on Thursday completed 25 days in power as CM while previously the record was held by BS Yediyurappa who had formed his Cabinet after 24 days in Karnataka.

Sources claimed that the Cabinet expansion is on the cards in a couple of days. It may take place even on Saturday evening.

It was Rajya Sabha member and the senior lawyer Vivek Tankha who had pointed this fact out in a tweet on Thursday.

“Congratulations Shivraj ji. Amidst so much gloom in MP you managed an Indian record –as the longest serving CM without a Council of Ministers. Previous record of 24 days of was Mr Yediyurappa CM Karnataka. Both become CM fourth term and formed Governments with the aid of defection (sic),” Tankha had tweeted with a taunt about Kamal Nath Government being dislodged by ‘unfair means’.

On Friday, Tankha while replying to a tweet from a senior journalist replied, “Hope they (BJP) realise how MP suffers cause of their shenanigans.”

“Bhopal wrecked with 90 plus cases and Health dept. Indore with 800 plus positive cases and highest mortality in country is to less and too little to wake BJP,” added the senior lawyer.

To add, Congress leaders have been attacking Chouhan for not forming cabinet and have been accusing him of usurping power with unfair means amid corona times.

Chouhan apparently replying to Congress jibes on Thursday tweeted, “Aap Bas Rajniti Karen, Main Bas Kaam Karta Rahunga. (You keep on indulging in politics, I would continue to serve.”

Prompt came the reply from Congress media cell in charge Jitu Patwari who tweeted, “You achieved what you wanted to, but have mercy and please save the public.”

Sources claimed that the BJP has a tough ask on its hands of accommodating its senior leaders apart from adjusting Scindia camp and other entrants into the cabinet.

The half a dozen former ministers of Scindia camp –Mahednra Singh Sisodia, Imarti Devi, Pradyumn Singh Tomar, Tulsiram Silawat, Prabhuram Chaudhary and Gvoind Singh Rajput, who had lost membership for assembly are hoping for a ministerial berth and plan to contest by-polls later on to become MLAs again.

Things are complicated further as others who deserted Congress and joined BJP including Aidal Singh Kansana, Rajyawardhan Singh Dattigaon, Bisahulal Singh and others too are vying for a cabinet berth.

Congress too have been demanding that at least ministers for crucial departments amid corona scare should be appointed to run ministries properly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chouhan-longest-serving-cm-sans-cabinet-.html

108,18-4-20,Cops get spl powers for lockdown enforcement,"In a bid to enforce lockdown measures more effectively during the lockdown, the State Government on Friday empowered police officers to take necessary action against violators.

The Home Department authorised Officers-in-Charge of various police stations to file complaints in courts pertaining to the offences committed under Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The powers were delegated under Section 60(a) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (Central Act no.53 of 2005).

Notably, despite warnings, people in different parts are using two-wheelers to go to markets to buy groceries and vegetables.

The Commissionerate police on Friday seized over 20 vehicles at Unit-4 and the Unit-8 fish market in Bhubaneswar and fined over 70 persons for violating the lockdown guidelines.

Police said that in the last 24 hours in the State, 252 persons were arrested and a total of 122 cases were registered including 117 cases of lockdown violations, one for spreading rumours and four others.

Meanwhile, the State Government on Friday classified its departments into two categories as 'critical' .and 'partially critical' for COVID-19 management.

109,18-4-20,"5,000 samples to be tested in BBSR","In view of Bhubaneswar becoming the epicentre of COVID-19 outbreak in Odisha, the State Government has prepared a new strategy for the capital city to effectively tackle the virus during the second phase of the lockdown.

“As part of precautionary measures, we have decided to intensify COVID-19 tests in upcoming days to identify persons infected with the deadly virus,” said Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy here on Friday.

Under the new strategy, the focus would be on scaling up of tests in Bhubaneswar to detect the positive cases in the city.

Tripathy said the city has been divided into three zones headed by six IAS officers for active surveillance. A total of 1958 (38%) samples have been collected from Bhubaneswar so far and the number would be increased significantly.

“To make Bhubaneswar safe, we have decided to test 5,000 samples in next seven days. We have prepared a priority-basis methodology for COVID-19 testing in Bhubaneswar,” Tripathy said.

Persons with travel history, those having symptoms and persons who have come in contact with active cases in hotspot areas, COVID-19 workers including health workers, police, sanitisation workers and people aged above 60 years with co-morbid diseases like hypertension and diabetes are on the priority list for testing. Besides, random samplings would also be carried out.

“If any person is required to undergo COVID-19 test under the new strategy in Bhubaneswar and he or she does not cooperate with the officials concerned voluntarily, we will be bound to take help of the administration and police,” he warned.

He said the Government is considering relaxing restrictions on economic activities after April 20 in low-risk areas where positive cases have not been reported in Bhubaneswar.

“Wearing mask is compulsory to tackle the virus and its violation will attract penalty,” he said.

He also said that spiting in public places is also now a compoundable offence and the violators would be penalised. “While a Rs 200-fine will be collected from each violator in first three times, thereafter the violator will be slapped with a penalty of Rs 500 fine,” he said.

“The BEO, Additional Tehsildar, ASI of Police and municipality Ward Officer will be assigned to enforce the rule,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/5-000-samples-to-be-tested-in-bbsr.html
110,18-4-20,"Virus shadow on Char Dham Yatra, uncertainty on opening","The deadly coronavirus has also affected the “muhurat” for the Char Dham yatra. The Yamunotri and Gangotri will initiate the annual opening rituals on April 26, but the opening of the customary “Kapaat” (doors) to invoke the Lords at Kedarnath and Badrinath is still mired in uncertainty.

With all means of transportation suspended due to the lockdown, the Home Ministry has allowed the head priests to travel by road after the Uttarakhand Government wrote to the Centre, Kerala and Karnataka Governments, from the native places of Rawals, the priests.

The Rawals, descendants of Adi Shankaracharya who established both the shrines, are in charge of the daily obeisance of the Lord Shiva at Kedarnath and Lord Vishnu at Badrinath for almost six months from April/May to October/November every year. When the snow sets in Himalayas during the winter the replica of idols are relocated at Joshimath (winter abode of Badrinath) and Ukhimath (winter abode of Kedarnath) through a procession and between the nominated priests perform the daily puja while Rawals go back to their native places.

The Uttarakhand Government’s request to fly the priests by a special chartered flight from down south to Uttarakhand was declined by Home Ministry. Now, the State Governments are coordinating to facilitate travel by roads for Rawals in a day or two. The manual of the COVID-19 vehicle usage will be followed accordingly so that each vehicle has only two occupants.

The head priest (Rawal) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva jangam community from the village Banuvalli of Taluka Harihar of Davanagere district in Karnataka while head priest Rawal of clan Namboodari of Badrinath temple belongs to Kerala.

As per schedule given by the Royal family, Kedarnath is to be opened on April 29 while Badrinath the following day. But as per Government Covid-19 guidelines, the Rawals will have to be under mandatory 14 days quarantine as they enter Uttarakhand.

The Badri-Kedar Trust has opposed this, arguing that the Rawals are always “quarantined” as they are not touched by anyone round the year, whether they are in the sanctum santorum or in a retreat.

“They do all their chores themselves even cooking as per the custom. Why do they need to be quarantined? Even if it’s delayed, only the Rawals will perform the opening of both the religious place. The dates can be reshuffled as has happened a couple of times in the past when the priests could not reach on time,” an official of BKT told The Pioneer over phone.

The Uttarakhand Government is digging into pages of temples’ manual to verify the claims of BKT whether the dates can be changed. A senior State Government official, however, confided that they are also talking with the Royal families of Tehri to nominate someone (as has happened in last four occasions) to perform the opening of doors rituals of both the holy shrines.

“Even if the Kapat are opened, it will not be thrown open for the pilgrims until the lockdown is lifted. For Kedarnath only 12 persons will be allowed and at Badrinath 20 of them will be allowed to take the procession from Joshimath and Ukhimath to the shrines,” said the official.

The doors of Kedarnath temple will be opened on April 29, 2020 at 6.10 am in the morning with special puja in the temple by the Rawals while Badrinath Temple will be open on April 30 at 04.30 am and pujas are carried out by Rawal’s assistants on his instructions as per the thousand year old tradition.

The Kedarnath shrine, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva, is said to be more than 1,200 years old. It was built by Adi Shankaracharya and is among one of the 12 jyotirlingas in India.

A visit to the Kedarnath temple is an integral part of the famous Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand. The yatra (pilgrimage) also includes visits to shrines like Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath. All four shrines are located in the Garhwal division of Uttrakhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/virus-shadow-on-char-dham-yatra--uncertainty-on-opening.html

The Mohali District Administration on Friday claimed that the foodstuff would be “safer” as the cooks and the delivery persons would be thoroughly examined.

A day after Delhi’s pizza delivery boy was tested positive for coronavirus and 72 families besides 17 of his colleagues were quarantined, Mohali Administration maintained that it would continue with the home delivery of the cooked food.

However, the Administration would take a call on “non-essential delivery” on Saturday, like Dominos, Pizza Hut, among others.

Alarmed over the Delhi’s incident, Ludhiana and Ferozepur District Administrations have decided to bring to a halt all the home delivery services of food establishments to curb the spread of coronavirus. “As of now, we are continuing with the home delivery of cooked meals in Mohali…There are other people who need cooked food like PGs (paying guests) who depend on tiffins, and not the Dominos kind,” Mohali Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan told The Pioneer. He pointed out that there are people who are giving milk, groceries, and other deliveries and “we've asked them all to be screened”. Dayalan maintained that the Administration would be screening and thoroughly examining all those involved in the business including those cooking the food, and those delivering it.

“Mohali Administration will be screening everyone who is cooking the meals besides those who are delivering it,” said Dayalan, adding, “we will take a call on non-essential delivery tomorrow”.

Only a day before, Ludhiana Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate Pradeep Agarwal had revoked the permissions granted to the food establishments for home delivery. “The permissions regarding food preparation establishments given earlier only for home delivery, were on an experimental basis and for a limited duration of time, and now in an alarming situation arising due to coronavirus across the country and the risks attached to food contamination, it has been decided to stop all the operations of food establishments till further orders,” he had stated.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/in-mohali--meals-at-doorstep-to-be----safer---.html

According to RP Meena, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Southeast district, around 1.30 am, police stopped a truck bearing a Haryana registration number near Okhla T-point and found 37 labourers inside.

“The contractor told the police he was ferrying the labourers to Palwal Mandi from Okhla Mandi in Delhi for work. The contractor is a resident of Lakhi Sarai district in Bihar and had been staying in Palwal,” said the DCP.

“The labourers were staying in Chhatarpur. All of them have been booked under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and section 3 of the Epidemic Act,” said the DCP.

Another seven migrant labourers trying to travel to their home district Vaishali in Bihar were intercepted by a police team in South Extension.

According to Atul Kumar Thakur, the DCP, South district, the labourers had hired an SUV (Toyota Innova ) of a Trilokpuri resident for Rs 37,000. “The vehicle was seized and the seven labourers were sent to a shelter home. A case has been registered against the driver and he has been arrested,” said the DCP adding that the advance payment made to the driver has been returned.

Meanwhile, in south Delhi, over 50 labourers who were planning to leave for their native village in Bihar amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown were also counselled and provided ration after Delhi police received a distress call from one of them.

According to police, on Thursday, a labourer Manoj Yadav, hailing from Sangam Vihar, called Additional DCP -1, South district Parminder Singh and informed him that over 50 labourers were in urgent need of ration. He also told the DCP that the labourers were contemplating moving to their native village in Supaul in Bihar as they were unable to meet their food requirements, police said.

“The information was shared with ACP of Sangam Vihar who then instructed the local Station House Officer (SHO) to help the labourers. The person who made the call was contacted, counselled and assured help,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, the DCP, South district.

“A list of 55 such needy labourers was compiled and with the help of a good samaritan, 12 kilogram (kg) dry ration, which included 5 kg wheat flour, 5 kg rice and 2 kg dal was distributed to each labourer,” said the DCP.

113,18-4-20,SHO belts out song to inspire fight against virus,"While many Delhi cops may be resorting to stringent actions to make the people stay indoors during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, some of them like police inspector Suhaib Farooqui has preferred to take to singing to inspire, reassure and educate people on combating the deadly pathogen which has killed nearly 450 people in India.

Farooqui , the Station House Officer of New Delhi’s South Avenue Police Station who enjoys turning his thoughts to poetry during his private time, has penned an evocative poetry titled, ‘Hai waqt yeh inquilab, Corona se Jung hai’ to carry on the anti-Corona campaign. The song, a peppy number that one could easily listen to many times, is not only sweet to the ears but also carries useful advisory on following the safety precautions.

The poetry which is composed into a song by Mumbai-based music director Sudhakar Sneh advises people on how to behave during lockdown; it asks them to wear a mask, stay at home and only step out in the most urgent cases. Further, it stresses that everyone —from rich to poor, villagers to city dwellers — have to act resolutely to combat the pandemic.

While Farooqui, who regularly attends poetry sessions and recites his creations, is not new to public attention, the admiration he is drawing this time is unprecedented. It is drawing a large number of visitors from the day it was posted on the Social Media accounts of Farooqui’s and New Delhi Police. Many are downloading it and sharing it with their friends and families.

The initiative by the Delhi Police has become popular given the Indian appetite for good music. Police forces in other states too are dipping into their human resource pool to harness the best of their strategic, physical and creative skills to reach out to the masses to enforce strict public safety standards to combat the disease.

Keeping this in view, an engineering student from Telangana has come out with a device which warns a person indulging in these activities.

The device developed by Budhavarapu Sneha beeps whenever the person wearing it involuntarily indulges in any of these habits.

The device, wearable like a wrist watch, alerts a person whenever he or she reaches out for a handshake or touches any part of the face.

When the person offers a shake hand, the device will buzz to warn that it must be avoided.

""Whenever you move your hand to touch any part of your face, the device beeps to warn you. If your hands are sanitised, you can ignore the beep. Otherwise, you will realise that you need to wash your hands,"" said Sneha, a first year B.Sc (Electronics) student from Karimnagar town.

The device comprises a three voltage battery, a sensor, a buzzer and a rubber band. It can be sold for Rs 350 apiece.

""As we don't have a vaccine or drug for Covid-19 yet, prevention is the only option available to us. Since avoiding a handshake and touching the face are identified common habits which could lead to infection, I have made this device,"" said the young student who worked under the supervision of her father B.

The crew and helicopter are safe and a mandatory court of inquiry is on to ascertain the cause leading to the landing.

Incidentally, the IAF saw two such landings in successive days involving the latest and one of the oldest helicopters. A Cheetah helicopter made an emergency landing on a highway in western Uttar Pradesh after taking off from the Hindon airbase and bound for Chandigarh. While this helicopter is more than 40 years old, Apaches were inducted into service in September last year.

116,18-4-20,"Worried Mamata posts armed cops, orders rigorous lockdown","Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has ordered rigorous implementation of lockdown in designated hotspots like Howrah, North 24 Parganas and parts of Kolkata saying the situation was so sensitive that if strict actions were not taken immediately then things could spin out of control leading to community contamination in places like Howrah.

Four areas of Bengal including Howrah, Kolkata, North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore have been identified as corona hotspots. Out of them East Midnapore reported no new cases in the past 14 days shifting the region from ‘Red” zone to “Orange” zone, she said.

The Chief Minister who earlier shunted senior IAS officer and State Food Secretary Manoj Agarwal and two District Magistrates for alleged deficiency in services on Friday said “the situation in Howrah is very sensitive —particularly in areas like Sankrail, Bankra and urban Howrah… So much so, that if it is not handled aggressively now then things may spin out of conrol leading to community contamination.”

Bengal reported a total of 162 active corona cases with 22 people getting infected in the past 24 hours.

Four persons were cured during this period, government sources said.

The Chief Minister directed the officials to work towards reverting the “red zones into orange zones and orange zones into green zones in 14 days time,” citing how “touchwood 10 districts of the State have remained unaffected by corona,” and cautioning “there may be attempts to cross the State and international borders to enter Bengal and spread the disease and we will have to stop that at any cost.”

She directed the police administration to deploy armed police personnel in pin-pointed areas to prevent movement of the people. “Let he given areas be sealed and let the policemen reach food and other essential items … but stop entry and exit from these areas… post armed police men if needed,” she said dismissing however, the suggestions of Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to deploy para-military personnel.

Apparently hitting out at the Governor she said “some people who do nothing but dish out unnecessary sermons asking deployment of paramilitary forces should first understand that the police is doing excellent job… These people want deployment of paramilitary but here we see the paramilitary personnel are busy protecting the BJP MPs who are touring the regions with CRPF without considering the gravity of the situation,” Banerjee said.

Earlier following reports of irregularities in the public distribution system with about 10 per cent people not getting their share of free food grains Banerjee replaced state Food Secretary Manoj Agarwal a 1990 batch IAS officer with Parvej Ahmed Siddiqui. The former has been sent in “compulsory waiting,” sources said.

She also transferred Darjeeling District Magistrates of Priya P and one’s West Bardhhaman counterpart Shahshank Shethi even as the opposition cried foul over bungling in distribution of food grains to the people stuck in lockdown.

Notwithstanding the quick action taken by the Chief Minister senior BJP leader Rahul Sinha wondered why only the officials and not the Trinamool Congress workers involved in the bungling were not punished.

“We had brought to the notice of the Food Minister Jyotpriya Mullick as to how the TMC men were lifting huge amount of grains but no action was taken against these TMC men. Only the officers were made the scapegoat,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Bengal Government on Friday announced a scheme “Sneher Parosh” (touch of affection) under which it would transfer Rs 1,000 each to the stranded migrant workers in other States.

Arrangements were being made to transfer the amount online to stranded workers in Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala and other places after verification, State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/worried-mamata-posts-armed-cops--orders-rigorous-lockdown.html
117,18-4-20,"Unlike Gowdas or Naddas, this couple marries in isolation","At a time when the country’s high and mighty are sprinkling crores in lavish weddings mustering hundreds of guests in contemptuous defiance of the corona regulations, an inconsequential couple in comparatively lesser known part of Bengal on Thursday entered into a proverbial “no-frills” wedlock sans guests.

Neither Swati Nath nor Sourav Karmakar’s grandfathers are former Prime Ministers (like HD Deve Gowda). Nor their parents are ex-Chief Ministers (like HD Kumaraswami). Yet the couple had the humble discernment that tying the wedding knot amid a large crowd could be a suicidal proposition when the country is under a lock down to ward off the dreaded corona virus.

The Kharagpur couple’s marriage ceremony was not only sparsely attended by a group of 10-15 “very close relatives and friends” but also everyone was conscious enough to mask their faces to keep the virus at bay.

Kharagpur is barely an hour’s drive from Bengal’s one of the four hotspots of Egra in East Midnapore district. The icing on the cake came when Karmakar the humble owner of a fast-food kiosk decided along with his wife to donate a paltry amountRs 31,000 — that he had saved to host the wedding party --- to feed the 500 poor souls who had been caught stranded nearby amidst the complete shutdown for two days.

“I had saved the money to spend at my wedding. But in the changed circumstances I asked myself: why not spend it to feed the poor! … When I told my family about it, they all readily agreed,” Karmakar said with his newly married bride saying how happy she was at the decision taken by her husband. “It is a great thing to feed the poor people at our wedding. They will bless us.”

One wonders whether the blessing will land the couple one day on Prime Ministerial or Chief Ministerial chairs.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/unlike-gowdas-or-naddas--this-couple-marries-in-isolation.html

123,18-4-20,Rising Covid-19 cases make TN’s joy short-lived,"Tamil Nadu’s joy over the reduction in the number of coronavirus patients tested positive for the last two days turned out to be short-lived as the State recorded 56 new cases of the pandemic on Friday.

As on Friday evening, the number of persons undergoing treatment for COVID-19 stood at 1,323 and 18 persons succumbing to the dreaded disease till date.

The redeeming feature of the day’s data, released by the department of health and family welfare was the increase in the number of persons who were cured and discharged from various hospitals on a single day. The day saw 103 cured persons getting discharged from the hospitals.

The reduction in the number of persons tested positive for Tuesday and Wednesday had made chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami to claim on Thursday that the intensity of COVID-19 in the State has come down due to the incessant steps taken by his government. “We hope to achieve zero cases in the next few days,” the chief minister had told reporters on Thursday.

With the number of persons testing positive for coronavirus showing an increase on Friday, the chief minister’s statement on Thursday that the government would withdraw the restrictions on a phased manner from April 20 has come under a cloud.

There was no Press briefing on Friday and the Government chose to issue a medical bulletin instead of the health secretary herself addressing the journalists.

But the war of words between the Chief Minister and the Leader of Opposition MK Stalin continued unabated on Friday with the latter asking the Government not to play with the lives of common men.

The Opposition leader has been alleging that the Tamil Nadu Government has failed in testing the number of persons suspected of having the coronavirus.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rising-covid-19-cases-make-tn---s-joy-short-lived.html

Without mincing any words, General Naravane also said, ""In keeping with our national strategy, the Indian Army remains prepared to undertake operations across the full spectrum of conflict and is prepared for every contingency.

Standing in the backdrop of North Kashmir's mountain range in Kupwara sector, General Naravane also exposed the role of Pakistan Army in fomenting trouble in the region. He said, It is very unfortunate that at a time when the whole world and India is fighting the menace of this pandemic, our neighbour continues to foment trouble for us.

“While we are busy not only helping our own citizens but the rest of the world by sending medical teams and exporting medicines, on the other hand, Pakistan is only exporting terror. This doesn’t augur well,” he added.

Gen Naravane was sharing his assessment about the prevailing security situation after winding up his two day long visit to Jammu&Kashmir.

Speaking to ANI, General Naravane said, ""We have evolved a strategy of resolute punitive response against sponsored terrorism. Acts of terror will not be tolerated and perpetrators will be punished. The onus remains with Pakistan to bring peace in the region. Unless Pakistan gives up its policy of state sponsored terrorism, we will continue to respond with impunity and precision.

126,18-4-20,Here drone helps police catch lockdown violators,"Pandemic too has its own lighter sides. Though most of the reports are focussed on the number of persons tested positive for coronavirus, the casualties and the number of patients who have been cured of the disease, the struggles of the law enforcing agencies to ensure fool proof lockdown ordered by the Central and State Governments brings in humorous instances.

The Salem district police had this to tell on Friday morning. Salem is a VIP district in Tamil Nadu as the assembly constituency of Edappadi falls in this district.

The Police who were on their guards since Thursday following news that Chief Minister was on his way to the district wanted to ensure everything was in place.

A bunch of youth, buoyed by the total lockdown and empty landscape, chose to have a game of cricket in the open space in a Salem suburb on Friday morning. They thought that they could cock a snook at the policemen by hiding into the thick bush adjoining the ‘maidan’. But the youngsters were unaware of the technological advancement incorporated by the law enforcers to monitor that everything was in order. The Salem Police had introduced a drone to scan the entire city in their “radar’.

While the cricket match reached feverish pitch, the cops came with their sirens blaring and the ‘Tendulkars’ and ‘Dhonioes’ ran helter-skelter into the woods. But the cameras installed on the drones beamed live pictures of the Stars and their exact hide outs. Some had covered themselves with bed sheets and lungies to hoodwink the eyes of the drones but without success. The police nabbed all the law-breakers and made them perform sit ins as an act of atonement. The inspector on duty gave them a sermon at the end of the “mild punishment’ and told them not to violate the prohibitory orders.

The game of cricket played in the scorching Sun of Salem, the attempt to escape from police dragnet and the exhaustion resulting from the sit-ins made the cricket stars promise the cops that they would never venture out of their houses so long as the lockdown was in place.

It was the turn of a Tamil Nadu minister on Friday to perform pada pooja for sanitary workers in Madurai district. The sanitary workers, hitherto uncared for and unnoticed by the local population and political masters, have become the most sought after persons in the State for paada pooja and aartis. Minister for revenue R T Udhayakumar chose Friday to perform aarti and pada pooja on the less fortunate ones of the society. Azhaku, who was made to sit on a plastic chair as the minister with his face covered with a mask fell at the feet of the sanitary worker and praised him for the kind of great work their fraternity was performing. “What is this, Sir?

133,18-4-20,ICMR to study ‘BCG impact’ on corona patients,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Friday said that it would conduct a study soon to find out whether the vaccine for tuberculosis — bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) — could be effective for the management of the Coronavirus patients.

While clinicians in at least six countries including US and Italy are running trials that involve giving frontline health workers and elderly people the BCG vaccine to see whether it can provide some level of protection against the Covid-19, the ICMR is looking to generate “more concrete evidence”.

“We won't recommend the BCG vaccine even to the healthcare workers till we have any definitive results,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, senior scientist from the ICMR, a health research wing of the Union Health Ministry.

Replying to a question on the use of the BCG vaccine to fight COVID-19 during daily media briefing, Dr Gangakhedkar said: ""ICMR will begin a study next week. Till we don't have definitive results from this, we won't recommend the BCG vaccine even for health workers.""

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis. In the countries where tuberculosis or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as close to the time of birth as possible.

""We don't have enough evidence to take an official position on the BCG vaccine in COVID-19. It can't even stop TB but it can only protect from severity. It is an immunomodulator, effective for 15 years,"" he added.

Dr Gangakhedkar said that coronavirus has been in India for three months. ""The mutation doesn't happen too quickly. Whatever vaccine comes out now will work in the future as well if the virus mutates,"" he added.

According to the ICMR, of the 28,340 tests COVID-19 done on Thursday, 23,932 were conducted at 183 labs under the public lab and rest were done in the private labs.

Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry who was also at the press briefing, shared that Indian scientists and researchers are working on vaccine development and that by next month, 10 lakh indigenously developed RT-PCR kits would be manufactured.

He said the government is working with global partners on the vaccine development front and introducing it for the general public. Although it is a time-consuming process, ""we are accelerating the processes involved.""

He said the RT-PCR kit manufacturing work is in progress. By May, we can produce around 10 lakh kits. ""We are also working on manufacturing 10 lakh rapid antibody detection kits"", he said. The real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) test is considered one of the most accurate lab methods to detect, track and study coronavirus.” Agarwal said that top government organizations – the Council for Scientific and Industrial Search, Department of Biotechnology and Science and Technology, and Department of Atomic Energy -- have also contributed in the fight against coronavirus by providing 30 labs to enhance the overall testing for the viral infection.

The Ministry said it has prioritised the indigenous manufacturing of new rapid and accurate diagnostic kits, which can provide results in 30 minutes.

""Innovative pooling strategies, limited tested to increase large numbers of people; we are focusing our efforts to increase indigenous synthesis of critical components for domestic kit production. We are also working viral sequencing, to epidemiologically identify mutation, and vaccine development and work is in progress to develop RNA-based vaccines"", said Agarwal.

""Under a multi-pronged strategy we are working, taking into account India''s indigenous knowledge to boost the immune system. We have partnered with WHO to determine different drug therapies. A scientific task force is working to re-evaluate the existing drugs, and if required, these drugs could be re-purposed for COVID-19 use. We are working on the indigenous synthesis of anti-viral drugs"", said Agarwal.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icmr-to-study----bcg-impact----on-corona-patients.html

135,18-4-20,HRD Min appeals to private schools not to hike fees or demand quarterly payments,"With complaints and requests from parents from across the country over the arbitrary hike of school fees, HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Friday appealed to private schools to not to hike fees or demand quarterly payments as the world was going through the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

The HRD Minister said he had been receiving complaints from various parts of the country that schools were not only hiking fees but also asking parents of students to submit the amount for three months in one go.

Pokhriyal requested all states to come up with a solution that protects the interests of both parents and schools in terms of quarterly tution fees and salary of the staff.

Pokhriyal’s statement comes amid various complaints raised by parents of children in private schools alleging that schools were asking for the quarter and annual and new admission fees even as lockdown persists due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all the private and public schools charge new admission fees and certain additional charges in the beginning of the new session in April.

In a statement shared through his official twitter handle, Pokhriyal said: “It has been brought to my notice by many parents from across the country that even in times of crisis, many schools are increasing their annual fees and taking the current fees of three months together.”

“I hope that the education departments of the states will be working in a satisfactory manner towards better protection of the interests of parents and schools,” he said

Pokhriyal also requested private schools to not raise their annual fees or collect fees in bulk during the lockdown

“At the time of this global disaster, I request all the schools to consider not increasing the annual school fees and not taking the fee for three months together,” he added.

Due to the lockdown, many parents saw their income sources dry up which made it difficult for them to pay the full amount upfront. Pokhriyal also requested the schools to “provide timely salary to teachers and staff.”

He appreciated states that have taken “positive steps” towards solving the issue and hoped that all states will consider his request.

On the same day, the Delhi Government had directed private schools to only collect tuition fees from parents and to refrain from raising their annual fees without taking permission from the Government.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hrd-min-appeals-to-private-schools-not-to-hike-fees-or-demand-quarterly-payments.html

While party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote a letter to the UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath seeking immediate help to farmers and labourers who have been hit due to the lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak, former Union Minister Ajay Maken put forth 10-point charter demand to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to help those in distress in the national Capital due to COVID-19 lockdown.

Priyanka sought the setting up of a task force for economic revival in the State.

She said that the Government should take immediate measures to provide relief to farmers and labourers who are suffering due to suspension of economic activities. Free ration like wheat, pulses, oil and spices should be given to all those labourers and workers not registered in the State, she said in her letter.

Stating that an economic rejuvenation task force of experts be set up to handle the crisis, she said in her letter, “The pandemic has severely breached the economy, every section of the society is affected due to this, there are many social and economic issues which should be looked at. I urge you to set up an economic revival task force in Uttar Pradesh with noted experts to put in place an economic revival plan. The task of this force would be to prepare a roadmap for the economic revival in the State,” the Congress general secretary said in her letter.

Priyanka also demanded smooth harvest and procurement of Rabi crops. She said that the Government should relax conditions for the use of combined harvesters, agricultural machines that reap, thresh, and clean cereal crops.

Stating that the coronavirus pandemic has brought an economic destruction and cast its shadow on small scale industries, she said it is the time to focus on helping the people and providing them relief to reduce their sufferings.

The Congress leader further demanded payment of dues to the sugarcane farmers and relief for those farmers who have suffered due to the hailstorm and unseasonal rain.

143,18-4-20,Banks get 20% LCR breather till Oct,"To ensure that the repayment moratorium to help individuals and businesses to tide over the coronavirus-triggered disruptions does not land banks in a liquidity crisis, the RBI on Friday lowered the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) to 80 per cent from 100 per cent with immediate effect.

The LCR requires banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets such as short-term Government bonds that can be sold to fund a stress scenario. Banks are required to hold LCR which is 100 per cent equivalent of projected cash outflows during the 30-day stress scenario.

Addressing the media via video on Friday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said “to ease the liquidity position at the level of individual institutions, the LCR requirement for commercial banks is being brought down from 100 to 80 percent with immediate effect.”

The Governor said the LCR requirement will be gradually restored back in two phases — 90 per cent by October 1, 2020 and 100 per cent by April 1, 2021.

He said the Reserve Bank has been proactively taking measures to address the systemic liquidity issues through a slew of monetary and market operations.

The LCR was introduced as part of the Basel-III reforms following the 2008 global financial crisis and was finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in January 2013. The RBI made LCR binding on banks from January 1, 2015 with a transition time where they reached 100 per cent LCR by January 1, 2019.

The LCR is calculated by dividing a bank’s high-quality liquid assets by its total net cash flows, over a 30-day stress period. Here, high-quality liquid assets include only those which can be converted easily and quickly into cash.

Commenting on the LCR reduction, ratings agency Icra said the relaxation will enable banks meet the regulatory LCR requirements in case their reliance on bulk deposits or interbank lines increases.

This will help small private banks all the more as they have been witnessing deposit outflows, increasing their reliance on interbank funding. Such interbank funding is included in high run-off while calculating the LCR ratio for banks, the agency added.

RK Gurumurthy, treasury head at Lakshmi Vilas Bank, said the relaxation in the LCR requirement to 80 per cent releases the pressure on banks to divert a larger part of their investments in high quality liquid assets.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/banks-get-20--lcr-breather-till-oct.html

147,18-4-20,Large global contraction in the first half of 2020 inevitable: IMF,"A large global contraction in the first half of this year is inevitable, the International Monetary Fund has warned, asserting that the coronavirus pandemic has struck the world economy that was already in a fragile state as it was weighed down by trade disputes, policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday that the world economy was in a sluggish recovery before the coronavirus outbreak, warning that it is now bound to suffer a ""severe recession"" in 2020.

Addressing the Development Committee Meeting during the annual Spring Meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, a severe economic impact in the first half of 2020 was inevitable and the pandemic encounters weak public health systems.

""The global coronavirus outbreak is a crisis that is like no other and poses daunting challenges for policymakers in many emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), especially where the pandemic encounters weak public health systems, capacity constraints, and limited policy space to mitigate the outbreak's repercussions,"" Georgieva said.

She said the medium termed projections were clouded by uncertainities.

""Medium-term projections are clouded by uncertainty regarding the pandemic's magnitude and speed of propagation, as well as the longer-term impact of measures to contain the outbreak, such as travel bans and social distancing,"" she said.

However, most EMDEs are already suffering from disruptions to global value chains, lower foreign direct investment, capital outflows, tighter financing conditions, lower tourism and remittances receipts, and price pressures for some critical imports such as foods and medicines, she said.

""The world economy was in a sluggish recovery before the coronavirus outbreak and is now bound to suffer a severe recession in 2020,"" Georgieva added.

According to Johns Hopkins University data, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed two million globally and 144,000 people have died so far. The US is the worst hit with more than 700,000 COVID-19 cases and 35,000 deaths.

Rising malnutrition is expected as 368.5 million children across 143 countries who normally rely on school meals for a reliable source of daily nutrition must now look to other sources, the IMF official said.

Georgieva said that prospects had deteriorated sharply with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries that were affected early such as China, South Korea, and Italy have suffered large contractions in manufacturing activity and services, exceeding the losses recorded at the onset of the global financial crisis, Georgieva said.

She said retrenchments in activity have been accompanied by a sharp re-pricing of financial assets amid rapidly deteriorating risk sentiment, large equity sell-offs, widening risk spreads, and reversals of portfolio flows to EMDEs.

Many commodity prices have fallen sharply, notably for oil.

""A large global contraction in the first half of 2020 is inevitable. Prospects thereafter depend on the intensity and efficacy of containment efforts, progress with developing vaccines and therapies, the extent of supply disruptions, shifts in spending patterns, the impact of tighter financial conditions on activity, and the size of the policy response,"" Georgieva said.

There is an assumption the global economy would start recovering from the third quarter as public health measures are scaled back and the impact of policy support materializes.

""While the recovery is expected to pick up in 2021, by end-2021 global output would remain significantly below the pre-crisis trend,"" she said.

The IMF Managing Director said that the immediate priority is to minimise the pandemic's human toll and economic disruption.

""Bold action from the international community is needed to help LIDCs cope with the pandemic and its economic and social repercussions,"" she said.

""In the light of the ongoing global health concerns, we have currently stopped accepting bookings on all domestic flights for travel till May 3, 2020, and on all international flights for travel till May 31, 2020,"" a notification on Air India's website said on Saturday.

This means the national carrier's domestic and international flights will remain suspended till May 3 and May 31, respectively.

""Bookings for select domestic flights for travel from May 4, 2020, and for international flights for travel from June 1, 2020, onwards are open,"" the notification stated.

India has been under lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of novel coronavirus. The first phase of the lockdown was from March 25 to April 14. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14 extended the lockdown till May 3.

All domestic and international commercial passenger flights have been suspended during this period.

150,18-4-20,Global death toll passes 1.5L,"The global coronavirus death toll passed 1,50,000, with nearly two thirds of all fatalities in Europe.

In total, 1,50,623 people have died of the virus, including 92,900 in Europe, the hardest hit continent in the world. There are now more than 2,227,622 recorded infections globally, nearly half of which are in Europe. Of this 563,771 have been recovered so far.

US: The confirmed coronavirus death toll in the United States reached 35,500 on Friday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

The despair wrought on nursing homes by the coronavirus was laid bare on Friday in a state survey identifying numerous New York facilities where multiple patients died over the past few weeks. Nineteen of the state’s nursing homes have each had 20 deaths or more linked to the pandemic, the report said. One Brooklyn home reported having 55 deaths. Four homes, in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, were listed as having more than 40.

UK: The UK has recorded another 847 coronavirus deaths in hospitals, raising the overall total to 14,576. The increase is slightly down on the 861 released on Thursday. Last week, a daily high reached 980 deaths.

The figure, which is released daily by the government, has come under increasing scrutiny. It likely underestimates the true toll because it only includes deaths in hospitals and not in nursing homes or other settings within the community.

Britain’s Office for National Statistics has indicated the figure could be around 15 per cent higher, though others think it will be more amid growing reports of a sharp increase in coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes.

Spain: Spain’s death toll spiralled towards 19,500 on Friday as the government revised its data collection methodology despite controversy over a system that counts only deaths among those who tested positive. The country reported 585 new fatalities in the past 24 hours, but it was difficult to compare with previous tolls after the government amended its counting mechanism.

The total number of deaths in Spain now stands at 19,478, the third-highest in the world after the United States and Italy.

Russia: Russia on Friday said it had recorded 32,008 coronavirus cases, including a record 4,070 in the last 24 hours, as President Vladimir Putin warned of “very high” risks, particularly in the ill-equipped provinces.

Official figures showed more than half of the new cases were registered in Moscow and the surrounding region. So far 273 deaths have been recorded in Russia, including 41 in the last 24 hours. Speaking during a televised video-conference with regional governors, Putin said that “the risks surrounding the epidemic’s spread are still very high, not just in Moscow but in many other Russian regions.”

Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Friday reported the completion of a 500-bed hospital built within weeks, which will start admitting patients Monday.

Italy: For doctors in northern Italy, fighting what is still Europe’s worst outbreak of Covid-19, the frontlines have moved beyond hospitals as special teams try to keep patients alive at home, away from the saturated wards where thousands have died. For staff on the so-called USCA (Special Continuity Assistance Units) teams, it has been a draining struggle, initially hampered by a shortage of vital protective gear, that mixes emergency medicine with the shock of losing unprecedented numbers of patients.

“It was and still is a tough experience that will leave its mark on everybody,” said Giulia Villa, a 33-year-old doctor in the northern town of Bergamo, where hundreds have died since the coronavirus outbreak emerged in a nearby town on Feb 21. “We gave everything we had and we are still trying to help people. We especially want to relieve the strain from hospitals by being able to treat patients at home,” Ms Villa said.

Accounting for half of the more than 22,000 people who have died from the coronavirus in Italy, Bergamo’s home region of Lombardy on the border with Switzerland remains one of the worst affected zones in the world and its doctors have been under strain for weeks.

“We saw so many people who needed to be hospitalised very quickly but the problem was, the ambulance service just couldn’t keep up,” she said.

Since March 19, when they went into operation, the units have carried out more than 1,000 home visits after initial problems getting enough masks and protective equipment for the medical staff and vital oxygen bottles for patients with severe respiratory problems.

Oxygen has also become easier to provide now that suppliers have begun shipping liquid oxygen. But the personal toll has been enormous as the teams deal with sick and frightened people struggling for life or preparing to watch a family member die.

Iran: Iran said 89 more people have died from the novel coronavirus, as the country’s official fatalities remained in double figures for a fourth day. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the latest deaths brought the overall toll to 4,958.

It was the sixth day that the official fatality rate has dropped in the Middle East’s worst-hit country. Jahanpour added that 1,499 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 79,494 from 319,879 tests.

Belgium: The novel coronavirus has claimed the lives of more than 5,000 people in Belgium, officials said on Friday, confirming its high per-capita mortality ratio compared to most other European countries. A further 313 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours have pushed the overall toll to 5,163, health authorities said in a daily news conference. Half of the fatalities were reported from old-age care homes, and the other half from hospitals in the country of 11.5 million inhabitants.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/global-death-toll-passes-1-5l.html

He lauded banks for rising to the occasion and ensuring that ATMs are refilled regularly despite the logistical challenges during the lockdown.

Additionally, there has not been any downtime in internet or mobile banking as well, he said.

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, who also heads industry lobby grouping IBA, called the measures, which included both regulatory as well as liquidity interventions, as “rightful recognition to the evolving market conditions” by RBI.

“Overall, the second set of package by RBI is an excellent reflection of combining the policy response and regulatory responses in the most optimal manner,” he said in a statement.

Kumar said the second set of targeted long term repo operations will help non-bank lenders and micro lenders.

He also welcomed the refinancing support for Sidbi, NHB and Nabard, saying deserving sectors will get help.

British lender Standard Chartered Bank’s country chief executive Zarin Daruwala called the announced measures second booster shot to the economy from RBI within a month, and added that steps like reducing liquidity coverage ratio requirements and NPA relief during moratorium will improve credit delivery appetite.

Padmaja Chunduru, the managing director and chief executive of the state-run Indian Bank, said RBI’s tone is full of empathy and support to the needy sectors of the economy. Small businesses and retail borrowers will benefit through the 90-day extension in NPA recognition for stressed standard assets, while the 90-day extension given for NCLT filing in cases of bad loans will save banks 20 per cent in provisions, she said.

SBI chairman Kumar also said that allowing 90-day asset classification standstill for accounts covered under moratorium will “imbibe banks with the desired operational flexibility to lend a helping hand to stressed accounts”.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bankers-welcome-rbi---s-steps-to-enhance-liquidity.html

DBS Bank India Economist Radhika Rao said the reduction in the reverse repo rate is meant to prod banks to consider lending activity rather than park funds with the central bank.

159,18-4-20,She breaks free,"A decade of building businesses and dealing with challenges faced by women made Iffat Khan start a venture to support female entrepreneurs and help them grow. By Team Viva

An entrepreneur, an author, an international speaker, a breakfree coach, and a TEDx speaker, Iffat Khan dons several hats and is on a mission to make an impact on the lives of a million people and help them break free in their business. Growing up, she was often called socially awkward, weak and a failure but she brilliantly fought her personal battles and emerged victorious. Today, she has become an inspiration for many women and men in India and around the world. Here are a few excerpts of how she defines her journey:

What has been your creative process?

I have failed in countless endeavours in my life — my subjects at school, interviews for a job, my first business — and was thought of as weak and incompetent. I had to fight through personal challenges of being a misfit.

Then I began listening to myself and following what my heart said, and soon, things changed. I always had this inner voice but I did not have the courage to act upon what it told me to do. I remember working for Fortune 500 companies and always outperforming everyone. Yet it didn’t make me feel worthy enough. I still felt that something important was missing. I wasn’t content. However, I didn’t understand what that void was.

I was a performer at work and yet felt miserable when it came to self-confidence and worth. I felt stuck because that one thing that I always wanted to do, I couldn’t for several reasons. But it didn’t leave me for decades. I was scared. I remember, while growing up I was treated as a failure by my friends and acquaintances. For long, I ignored my inner voice and my dreams because I was restricted by my fears.

Then came a time when I often felt trapped and suffocated. And I couldn’t live like that for the rest of my life. I wasn’t doing justice to the people around me. I wanted to do a lot but didn’t know how. Finally, I decided to chase my dreams. I quit my job to follow my long-term passion of starting a business and helping companies grow as a business consultant. That’s when my journey as an entrepreneur began.

Would you suggest people to quit their jobs to start their businesses?

I wouldn’t suggest that anyone should quit their job to start a business until they have saved enough to take care of at least six months of expenditure. Because when you leave a job, your plan should be foolproof and you also should have a backup plan ready in your mind.

How challenging is it to be a woman in business?

It has its pros and cons like every entrepreneur does. Looking at how times have changed, women should be looked at equals but the truth remains that there are still many challenges that women face.

For too long, women haven’t been given their due rights or recognition in the public sphere. They haven’t been treated well and have often been objectified. Well, they still are, often. And their challenges are far more. But there are also some things which I beg to differ on. Women are not respected due to the programming of the society. However, I don’t like the term, ‘women empowerment,’ because they are already empowered. If they can bring a life to this world, they can do anything they want to. Women don’t need empowerment. They just need support and a place that they own.

Everyone is special in their own way and that’s what makes each one of us amazing. We all should be treated as unique apart from just being equals.

The entire experience of a decade of working with businesses, building them and the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs made me start Femipreneur, a venture to support women in their business and help them grow.

Where does your strength come from?

My family has been my biggest strength no matter what happens, or how many challenges we’ve been through, I always find them by my side. We have always overcome challenges as a family and that’s incredible. It’s a blessing to have them — my amazing parents and crazy siblings.

What is ‘Breakfree’ all about?

We all need to break free from the past programming that has influenced us due to our surroundings and the people around us so that we can realise our potential.

I believe it’s now that people need us more than they ever did before. Especially, in the world of social media, accessibility, and technology, things are easier to accomplish now than it was ever before. Yet most of us are not utilising the true potential that we have.

I believe the sooner people understand they can break free from what’s stopping them to pursue their dreams, the sooner they can literally fly.

What is your message to the readers out there?

Find yourself. Dive in self-discovery. Find your purpose. Explore more and understand what more you can do. I wish each one of you can break free and live your heart’s desire (because I know how it feels like not to).",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/she-breaks-free-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/she-breaks-free.html
160,18-4-20,Spicing it up,"In the forthcoming episode of Starry Nights GEN Y, director Punit Malhotra and actor Ananya Panday agree that she learnt not only acting but also how to get her way during SOTY 2. By Team Viva

I really believe in making people smile and even giving back some love to haters,” says actor Ananya Panday who became the favourite target of trolls recently for her views on nepotism during the Rajeev Masand Show. Her reaction towards nasty memes, trolls and hilarious social media imitations is in keeping with the 20-year old’s Instagram bio description of herself as a ‘serial chiller’. The coolest new student of Bollywood Academy will soon be seen in the forthcoming episode of Starry Nights GEN Y. The show hosts candid conversations with Bollywood’s Gen Y celebrities about their personal and professional lives. It also shares the gossip doing the rounds of the Bollywood world.

The actor will confess the names of her biggest competition from B-town and reveal nuggets from her journey to fame with host and trade analyst Komal Nahta.

When it is a chat show about Zen Y, Ananya is a natural fit as she doesn’t shy away from speaking her heart out. A quick teaser, she pointed out three things she would learn or swap with actor Suhana Khan, she says, “I would like to learn dancing and acting skills from her. Not only this, I would love to swap my closet with her too.”

Ananya will be accompanied by her mentor and the Student Of The Year 2 and I Hate Luv Stories director Punit Malhotra. And this made her remember all the things connected with her co-actors and from the sets.

Talking about the preparation involved the film, Ananya shares, “When I auditioned for SOTY 2, Punit thought I’m very quiet. He said that ‘we want to be bold and outspoken like Shreya’, (her character in SOTY 2.) So he would call me to Dharma’s office every day and make me yell and hurl abuses to the point where I actually became that person.”

Talking about the three biggest transformations in her, Punit reveals, “She opened up quite a bit, she learnt how to stand in front of the camera and be diplomatic to get her way around things.” To which Ananya instantly retorts, “I learnt that from Punit.”

He also shares how Ananya broke down on the sets of the film because she felt that the shot didn’t take place the way it was planned. He says, “When I took Ananya aside to have a chat with her, tears were rolling down her cheeks and she said that she would not shoot the introduction for the film”.

The duo are candid about how the director is extremely protective about her. On currently being single, Ananya says, “Punit wouldn’t let anyone hit on me because he keeps telling people that she is in her diapers, she is a baby, she is two years old.”

When asked what alternative role would her SOTY 2 co-star (Tiger Shroff) play if not an actor, Ananya says, “Tiger could be a great motivational speaker because whenever I would feel low or down, he would make me feel good instantly.”

If given an opportunity, the actor would love to work with Dharma productions. “I have literally grown up watching their films. It would be like a dream come true”, says she talking about her aspirations and future in the industry.

The actor will be seen sharing her behind-the-scenes pranks with Tiger, why she cried in her introduction shot and much more during the show.

Safely done at home, the experiments rely on common products including dish soap and baking soda, with a dash of glitter thrown into the “puffy slime” formula. An adults-needed icon marks ones requiring supervision.

Biberdorf has also written (with Hillary Homzie) Kate the Chemist: Dragons vs Unicorns, the first in a planned fiction series featuring a 10-year-old Kate as an intrepid problem solver. How could her school musical include a fire-breathing dragon if Kate couldn’t devise liquid nitrogen cheese puffs as a stand-in for flames?

Both titles are from Philomel Books, a Penguin Random House imprint, and were released early for antsy parents and kids alike.

In an interview, Biberdorf explained who nurtured her passion for chemistry in her hometown of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and her efforts to do the same for new generations.

How did science capture your interest?

My mom saw that I liked to explore and maybe had an engineering side of my mind. So she cleared one bathroom and made it so everything was perfectly safe and we could mix together shampoo, conditioner and soap and all this fun stuff in a huge green bowl. I’ve always been a little bit of a scientist and liked to see what happens if you add A plus B, what are you going to get? But it wasn’t until my sophomore year of high school that I realised chemistry was my true passion, and I have to credit my teacher, Mrs (Kelli) Palsrok. She made chemistry come alive for me.

You said that the gender gap in the sciences grows as students advance and is widest at the PhD level. Why is that and how can it be addressed?

There are a lot of reasons. If you’re a young girl and you raise your hand (in class) and give an incorrect answer and a boy makes fun of you, that can have a crippling effect on your self-esteem. My mission is to get out there and talk to these girls so that they’re passionate about science. Then when they do inevitably give a wrong answer, because we’re all human, they have enough confidence to not be knocked down and are still interested.

What changes need to happen for women in the scientific ranks?

Female scientists are supporting other female scientists and we are banding together and forming this beautiful community. We’re supporting each other’s research and talking about each other’s projects in such a positive way. I personally feel so empowered to be part of this that I can’t even wait to see what’s going to happen in the next 10, 20, 30 years.

Does the skepticism some are now voicing about science concern you?

As the scientific community, we need to step up. We need to speak out. We need to use our voices and our credentials to explain what’s happening. So for example, with climate change and the Coronavirus, if there are questions in your community about it, we need to be responsible scientists. We’ve got to make sure that the accurate information is going out to our communities.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hooked-to-its-possibilities-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/hooked-to-its-possibilities.html
162,18-4-20,ICC exploring all options on T20 WC,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is not in a hurry to take a decision whether the T20 World Cup should be postponed in the wake of COVID-19 or staged as scheduled, saying it is “exploring all options” as part of its comprehensive contingency planning for all its events.

With Australia sealing its borders and putting restrictions on travel to contain the dreaded disease, there have been speculations that the T20 World Cup scheduled to be held from October 18 to November 15 could be postponed to next year or held inside closed doors.

“We are continuing with our planning for ICC events as they are, but given the rapidly evolving situation as a prudent and responsible measure we are also undertaking a comprehensive contingency planning exercise,” an ICC spokesperson told SkySport.

“This includes exploring all options available to us based on a range of scenarios connected to the pandemic.”

The T20 World Cup is still six months away and ICC said it will take a decision after consulting all stakeholders, including the Australian government.

“We will continue to take advice from experts and authorities, including the Australian government and will take decisions at the appropriate time,” the spokesperson said.

“We will utilise all the data and information available to us to ensure we can take well-informed, responsible decisions that are in the best interests of our sport.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/icc-exploring-all-options-on-t20-wc.html
163,18-4-20,No proposal on IPL from Lanka: BCCI,"Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is keen to host the currently-suspended IPL but the influential voices within the BCCI feel that there is no point in discussing such a proposal in a “closed world” battling the COVID-19 pandemic right now.

The IPL, scheduled from March 29-May 24, has been postponed indefinitely by the BCCI and the Board will only conduct the tournament when normalcy returns.

SLC president Shammi Silva on Thursday said that Sri lanka is ready to host the mega event as the country, which has fewer positive cases, is expected to return to normalcy earlier compared to India.

“The BCCI will not be in a position to say anything when the world is closed,” a senior Board official said.

Sri Lanka has just over 200 cases cases right now as against India’s tally of more than 13,000. The death toll in India has crossed the 400-mark.

The official confirmed that currently, there is no proposal from the SLC and there is no guarantee when a meaningful discussion can take place on the subject even if it comes along.

“There is no proposal from SLC yet and obviously no discussion,” the official said when asked what will be the BCCI’s stand when the offer is on table.

The SLC can have the matches on three grounds — Galle, Kandy and Premadasa Stadium — with logistics reduced to less than half as there are no inland flights.

Having an IPL could help the SLC gain significant financial stability, more than what a short white-ball series against India (three T20Is and three ODIs) can guarantee in July.

As of now, the BCCI will be more keen on having it in India in either of the two slots between September-October and October-November.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-proposal-on-ipl-from-lanka--bcci.html
164,18-4-20,De Kock won’t be SA’s Test captain: Smith,"Former Test skipper Graeme Smith was on Friday confirmed as South Africa’s director of cricket — and revealed that Quinton de Kock would not be elevated to the Test captaincy.

Jacques Faul, acting chief executive of Cricket South Africa, said Smith had been appointed for a two-year term, expiring at the end of March 2022. Smith was appointed in an acting capacity last December.

The 39-year old captained South Africa in a world record 108 Test matches and in 149 one-day internationals.

He told a tele-conference that the debate over the Test captaincy was one of the challenges he faced during a period when no cricket can be played because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s not going to be Quinton,” he said, citing De Kock’s responsibility as the country’s limited-overs captain as well as being wicketkeeper and a key batsman.

“Quinton will be our white-ball captain but from a workload and mental capacity aspect we want to keep him fresh. From personal experience I know that captaining all three formats is challenging and we don’t want to overburden him.”

Smith gave no indication of the likely replacement following the decision of Faf du Plessis in February to step down from the job.

“There’s no one person you can pinpoint,” he said. “There are a lot of players on a similar level.”

South Africa’s next scheduled Test series is in the West Indies in July but Smith said that it had not been finalised due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

South Africa are also due to go to Sri Lanka for a limited-overs tour in June but Smith said both tours could be postponed.

“We are in discussion with the boards of those countries and decisions will have to be made pretty soon,” he said.

Smith said his immediate priority was the T20 World Cup in Australia in October and November, assuming it happened as planned.

He said South Africa hoped to host a Twenty20 series against India in August as part of the build-up to the world event.

“There is a lot of doubt about what the situation will be by then but we are in discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/de-kock-won---t-be-sa---s-test-captain--smith.html
165,18-4-20,Lockdown hasn’t affected our goal to win Olympic medal: Mandeep,"Indian hockey striker Mandeep Singh believes the team has moved on from the initial disappointment which they had to deal with following the postponement of Tokyo Olympic Games and are now working on improving their skills and fitness during the lockdown in place due to COVID-19 pandemic.

“At first, it was disappointing (Olympic postponement) but with the entire world battling this crisis, we understand this decision was made keeping the players’ safety in mind,” Mandeep said.

“We have moved on from the initial disappointment and are now working on maintaining our fitness levels during this lockdown period.”

The hockey team, both men and women, are currently at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centre in Bengaluru where they are carrying out their fitness drills and keeping in touch with the game.

“We are lucky the entire core group is together here in SAI, Bengaluru and our coaching staff is also here. Though we are not doing hockey training we have been given a specific program schedule to follow which includes independent training schedule for all players,” said the Indian striker.

“This is something every athlete will have to deal with from across the globe and we are no different.

“At least, I would like to think we are in a better position than others with the team still together going about other aspects of training like analysing our opponents matches, making individual presentation to our coaches via video meetings and so on.

“We are in a better position to begin training once the lockdown is lifted,” he added.

India last won a Gold in Hockey in 1980 in Moscow Olympics. Since then, they have participated in eight Olympic editions but have failed to make a podium finish. And after qualifying for the Tokyo Games, the team was in high spirits and were looking forward to end the medal drought.

166,18-4-20,"China denies virus cover-up, accuses US of trying to divert public attention","China on Friday denied covering up the extent of its coronavirus outbreak and accused the US of attempting to divert the public attention by insinuating that the virus originated from a virology laboratory in Wuhan. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian’s comments came as China’s coronavirus death toll mounted to 4,632 after it revised the fatality figures by 50 per cent in Wuhan.

“I want to emphasise that the revision of the data regarding infectious disease is an internationally accepted practice,” Zhao told a media briefing, defending the sharply upward revision of figures amid allegations of under-reporting of casualties of coronavirus cases and casualties by China in Wuhan.

He said in the early stage of the outbreak there were some late reports, omissions, and inaccurate information.

He said this can be explained by the insufficient capacity of admissions and treatment of patients in hospitals, failure of some medical institutions to connect with disease prevention and control information systems in a timely manner, overload of hospitals and pre-occupation of medical staff with the treatment of patients.

“But there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment,” Zhao said. The revision of figures came amid sharp criticism of China by the US and other nations for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last, reportedly from the local Huanan seafood market.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-denies-virus-cover-up--accuses-us-of-trying-to-divert-public-attention.html
167,18-4-20,Africa could see 3 lakh virus deaths this year,"Africa could see 3,00,000 deaths from the coronavirus this year even under the best-case scenario, according to a new report released Friday that cites modeling from Imperial College London.

Under the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the virus, Africa could see 3.3 million deaths and 1.2 billion infections, the report by the UN Economic Commission for Africa said.

Even with “intense social distancing.” under the best-case scenario the continent could see more than 122 million infections, the report said.

Any of the scenarios would overwhelm Africa’s largely fragile and underfunded health systems, experts have warned. Under the best-case scenario, $44 billion would be needed for testing, personal protective equipment and treatment, the report said, citing UNECA estimates. The worst-case scenario would cost $446 billion.

The continent as of Friday had more than 18,000 confirmed virus cases, but experts have said Africa is weeks behind Europe in the pandemic and the rate of increase has looked alarmingly similar.

The new report is the most detailed public projection yet for coronavirus infections and deaths in Africa, where more than 1.3 billion people are bracing for the pandemic.

Poverty, crowded urban conditions and widespread health problems make Africa “particularly susceptible” to the virus, the U.N. report said. “Of all the continents Africa has the highest prevalence of certain underlying conditions, like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.”

On Thursday, a World Health Organization official said one projection over the next six months shows more than 10 million severe cases of the virus.

“But these are still to be fine-tuned,” said Michel Yao, the WHO’s emergency operations manager in Africa, adding that public health measures could have an impact in limiting cases. He did not give the source of the projection.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/africa-could-see-3-lakh-virus-deaths-this-year.html
168,18-4-20,Coronavirus could complicate Trump’s path to re-election,"The coronavirus is poised to reshape the political map, pummeling battleground states and alarming Republicans who see early signs of an election that could be a referendum on President Donald Trump’s management of the crisis.

The pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 Americans and left millions out of work, has eviscerated Trump’s hope to run for reelection on a strong economy. A series of states he won in 2016 could tilt toward Democrats.

In Florida, Republican governor closely aligned with Trump has come under scrutiny for being slow to close the state. In Wisconsin, Democratic victor in last week’s Supreme Court race captured 28 counties, up from 12 that Hillary Clinton won four years ago. In Michigan, Democratic governor has seen her approval rating rise against the backdrop of fight with Trump. In Arizona, low marks for Trump could be enough to turn formerly Republican stronghold into tossup. “It makes me wonder if there’s something brewing in the weaker elements of the Trump base,” said Paul Maslin, a Wisconsin-based Democratic pollster.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-could-complicate-trump---s-path-to-re-election.html
169,18-4-20,Tip of the iceberg: Nations struggle to count virus toll,"China acknowledged on Friday that the coronavirus death toll in the one-time epicenter city of Wuhan was nearly 50 per cent higher than reported, underscoring just how seriously the official numbers of infections and deaths around the world may be understating the dimensions of the disaster.

Such figures can have a huge influence on governments’ actions, as medical staffs struggle to figure out how to cope with surges of sick people and officials make crucial decisions about where to devote resources and how to begin easing lockdowns to resuscitate their economies.

As virus deaths mounted — with the U.S. reporting its highest one-day death toll yet at nearly 4,600 — the economic devastation from the restrictions is becoming even more shocking.

The number of people applying for unemployment benefits in the U.S. rose by 5.2 million, bringing the four-week total to a staggering 22 million. China’s economy shrank 6.8% in the quarter ending in March compared with the same period a year ago, its worst contraction since market-style economic reforms began in 1979. And in Europe, car sales tanked 55% last month.

Authorities say infections and deaths have been under-reported almost everywhere. Thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms — many in nursing homes, which have been ravaged by a disease that hits the elderly the hardest — without being tested. Four months into the outbreak, nations are still struggling to increase their testing capacity, and many are still far from their goal. Spain on Friday ordered the country’s 17 autonomous regions to adopt uniform criteria on counting the dead. The country has recorded more than 19,000 deaths, but the system leaves out patients who had symptoms but were not tested before they died.

“We are probably only seeing the tip of the iceberg,” said Barcelona University epidemiologist Antoni Trilla, who heads the Spanish government’s expert panel on the epidemic. Italian officials have acknowledged that the country’s official COVID-19 death toll of more than 22,000 — second only to that of the United States — understates the true number, primarily because it doesn’t include the hundreds of dead in nursing homes who were not tested.

Britain’s official death toll, which is approaching 14,000, has come under increasing scrutiny because it does not include any deaths at home or in nursing homes. The country’s statistics agency has indicated the actual number of dead could be around 15% higher. Other experts think it will end up being a lot more than that. Anthony Costello, a professor at the Institute for Global Health at University College London, said Britain could see 40,000 deaths by the time the first wave of the outbreak is over.

In Russia, authorities reported relatively low numbers of cases until late March. That raised suspicions, given the country’s history of concealing embarrassing truths. Doctors treating coronavirus patients in Moscow said last week that the vast majority of all pneumonia cases in Russia are probably caused by the new virus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/tip-of-the-iceberg--nations-struggle-to-count-virus-toll.html
170,18-4-20,We all bleed red,"Sushant Divgikar, popularly known as Rani Ko-HE-Nur, believes that education is the key to ensuring equality for LGBTQ+ community in society. By Ayushi Sharma

Sushant Divgikar, popularly known as Rani Ko-HE-Nur, is on cloud nine as he is India’s first drag queen to be featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia List — Class 2020. He has been listed under ‘The Arts’ honorees as well as in ‘Celebrities’ category. He is counted among the 300 bright and innovative young leaders from the Asia-Pacific region as well. Currently, Sushant is focusing on his singing career and is working on releasing an original number in the coming month. He is known for singing in a male as well as a female voice.

Excerpts of the interview:

You have earlier been featured in 300 bright and innovative young leaders and now in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia List — Class 2020. You are the first drag artiste to be on the list. What do you think is the future for LGBTQ+ community?

Yes, I have made it to a couple of power lists in the past two years but I must remind everyone that it took me 14 years to establish myself. Moreover, it took me time to find and accept my true authentic identity. People like me are the future of the LGBTQ+ community in India.

Section 377 has been repealed but how long will it take before we see some actual change?

There are a lot of people who are making great efforts but we still have a long way to go. I am an optimist but at the same time, I am well versed with the real situation. According to FRA LGBT+ Survey (2013), more than one in four (26 per cent) LGBTQ+ people had been attacked or threatened with violence in the five years preceding the research. The decriminalisation was a victory for sure, however, it does not necessarily mean that LGBTQ+ people are fully free or perceived as equals among their fellow citizens. Society has discriminated in the past and this seems to be continuing. It’s my sincere plea to not discriminate or spread hate on the basis of gender, religion, sexual orientation, nationality or caste. Maybe only then we can hope for a better tomorrow.

Judicial reform is one thing, but social realities don’t shift in an instant. How do you think people are ready to take this change ahead?

Education is the key. People are usually scared or phobic about things and people that they have no information about. We need to tell people that LGBTQ+ people are as human as anyone else. We don’t come from Mars. We drink the same water, breathe the same air and eat the same food as our heterosexual counterparts. We are as human as you. We have families too. And at the end of the day, gay, straight, black or white, we all bleed red.

How would you describe your journey from the time you started to your name appearing in the Forbes list?

All I can say is that it has been a roller coaster ride. I have absolutely enjoyed the ups and downs. I take it all in my stride. I am screaming with excitement right now because it was a childhood dream to be on this list and it has been finally accomplished.

Since you are focussing on your singing career, how do you plan to make a place for yourself in the music industry?

I feel I have already created an impact. Now all I have to concentrate on doing is to win my audience’s heart through good music. No unnecessary controversies are needed to grab eyeballs when an artiste is true to his/her art. That’s what I aim to do and I am sure the audience will appreciate that.

You have done short films too, many on the LGBTQ+ community? Do you think they have had an impact?

I really hope they have made an impression. I may not be the best judge of that. We should address that question to the audience. But I’m sure it has at least initiated a dialogue. Just like how it has made you ask me this question in particular. We need more people like you asking these questions so that there is more visibility for the cause and for the community.

There are a lot of podcasts, films and books around the LGBTQ+ community. How do you think they would help people to understand the community better?

One of India’s first podcast for and about the LGBTQ+ people as well as our heterosexual allies was hosted by me and former MTV VJ, actress and author Maria Goretti. There are plenty of podcasts that I have been associated with. I also had the longest-running LGBTQ+ friendly column in the DNA newspaper and have written extensively for online media houses. There’s a lot of material out there to educate oneself about ground realities of the community.

How do you feel empowering and reflecting a change towards your community?

I feel like a queen. Therefore, I also make sure that I slay everything I do and spread positivity wherever I go. I feel like a mother figure (even though I am still in my 20s) for the LGBTQ+ people of my country because I believe in the community sentiments more than anything. I hope that my journey and body of work inspires every young and ambitious person out there to spread their wings and fly high.

171,18-4-20,Nothing called void,"Artiste Sohan Qadri pushed the language of art beyond its boundaries to develop his work. He is best-known for his luminous, dye-infused works, which explore the notion of emptiness, says Uma Nair

When you look at the paper dyed works of poet, painter and Tantric yogi, Sohan Qadri, it is like stepping into the world of a seer, who launched an odyssey of abstraction that none could envisage. Sundaram Tagore Gallery’s show of Sohan Qadri comes at a time when abstraction in India has been reduced strokes of geometry and colour.

Modernism’s mystic

Transcendence and tranquility both flirt with each other in these presentation. Critic Donald Kuspit was accurate in his assessment of Qadri as “the pre-eminent aesthetic mystic of modernism.”

Sohan Qadri was born in Chachoki, Punjab, in 1932 and died in 2011, Toronto, Canada. He is perhaps best-known for his luminous, dye-infused works, which explore the notion of emptiness or voids. Relying on a language of orifices and elongated paths, Qadri abandoned representation in search of transcendence. He was particularly inspired by Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism, which emphasises the notion of shunyata or emptiness. Qadri’s minimalist compositions on paper are symbolic of this void from which seeds arise. The seeds are primordial symbols representing the self in the universe, the notion of creation and a sexual union.

The state of being

Painting for Qadri was part of a meditative sojourn. Deeply influenced by tantric practices, abstraction for him was focussed on the embodiment of his philosophical and spiritual state of being.

“When I start on a painting, I, first, empty my mind of all images. They dissolve into primordial space. Only emptiness, I feel, should communicate with emptiness of the canvas,” Qadri had said once. Though he started painting in the impasto style using oil and acrylic on canvas, he discovered his spiritual medium in inks and dyes. He used the heavy Van Guelder paper — used for intaglio printing — and treated it to create a consistency ideal for ink and dye dispersion.

Transcending time

Qadri would bathe paper in acid-free water. Once it was swollen with liquid, he would rhythmically score the surface with various gouging and cutting tools, and then apply inks and dyes. Using the thick intaglio paper and carving it in stages achieved a sculptural effect. Imbued with vibrant hues, the serrated surfaces possess a strong sense of energy and rhythm. In Qadri’s hands, the very nature of paper was transformed from a flat, two-dimensional surface into a three-dimensional medium.

Spiritual quest

Born into a Hindu and Sikh family, Qadri’s art is deeply influenced by a spiritual journey, which began at a young age. As a teenager, he ran away to a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in search of higher truth. He spent days in remote temples in the Himalayas and Tibet. The isolation he experienced at that time influenced him to paint. Later in life, he became fascinated with Sufism and Vajrayana Buddhism, which became potent sources of inspiration for later works.

Qadri pushed the language of art beyond its boundaries to develop his work. This paved the way for truly contemporary ink dyes that spoke of mystic moorings with a suggestive source of a third-dimension.

He owed as much to Western experimentation as to Eastern tradition. His work was unique because it was a quest for his true self through Tantric yoga and silent meditation. Throughout the course of his career, he interacted with an array of intellectual figures including the architect Le Corbusier, the surrealist painter René Margritte and the Nobel laureate Heinrich Böil. The visual dynamics of his colour fields bring home the deeper truths of his practise.

173,18-4-20,PL clubs committed to finishing season,"Premier League clubs remain committed to finishing the top-flight season, but did not set a June 30 deadline to complete the fixture list at their latest meeting.

With the Premier League postponed since March 13, it had been suggested a firm closing date for the season needed to be imposed.

But the 20 clubs did not discuss wrapping up the remaining 92 Premier League fixtures by June 30 when they met on a conference call with league chiefs.

With fears that failure to finish the season could cost the Premier League more than £1 billion ($1.2 billion), clubs looked at various models for a potential return to action.

However, Britain is on lockdown until May 7 at the earliest, leaving English football to play a waiting game in the hope of an improvement in the health crisis.

A Premier League spokesman said a number of complex scenarios were being worked through.

“We are actively engaging with stakeholders, including broadcast partners, and our aim is to ensure we are in a position to resume playing when it is safe to do so and with the full support of the government,” added the spokesman.

“The health and wellbeing of players, coaches, managers, club staff and supporters are our priority and the league will only restart when medical guidance allows.

“Today’s shareholders’ meeting provided an opportunity to discuss possible scheduling models. It remains our objective to complete the 2019/20 season but at this stage all dates are tentative while the impact of COVID-19 develops.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pl-clubs-committed-to-finishing-season.html
174,18-4-20,2016 IPL title one of the best memories of my career: Warner,"Explosive Australia opener David Warner has rated the 2016 Indian Premier League title triumph with Sunrisers Hyderabad as one of the best memories of his career.

""My IPL favourite memory would be when we won the IPL in 2016. We had a very good tournament the whole way through. The best thing was we won a lot of close games which really built great momentum and great belief within the team.

""It was fantastic. That's one thing that I will always cherish for the rest of my life. It was a great memory and one of the best,"" Warner said in a video message posted by the franchise on its official Twitter handle.

Warner was the captain when Sunrisers won their maiden IPL title in 2016, defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore by eight runs at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Opting to bat first, Sunrisers scored a challenging 208 for 7, riding on Warner's quick 69 and fellow Australian Ben Cutting's 15-ball 35-run cameo.

""We came up against Bangalore in Bangalore in the finals, we knew how good they were. We knew how well Virat Kohli was going, that year he scored 960 odd runs and was the highest run-scorer. Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers made a great great team,"" Warner said.

""For us it was about backing ourselves, our skills. We won the toss and we elected to bat first. Bangalore were good at chasing but we felt as a team our best attribute was defending. We had a great bowling attack led by Buvi and I felt that was the best way forward.

The 13th edition of the IPL has been postponed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

175,18-4-20,"BCCI creates 'Team Mask Force'; video features messages from Kohli, Tendulkar","Featuring India's most revered cricketers such as Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar, the BCCI has created a new video to promote wearing masks in public places and help the country battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 'Team Mask Force' has been created to spread awareness about wearing masks in public places.

""TeamIndia is now #TeamMaskForce! Join #IndiaFightsCorona and download @mygovindia's @SetuAarogya mobile application Mobile phone,"" the BCCI tweeted.

177,18-4-20,Sharjeel Imam chargesheeted for Jamia riots,"Delhi police charged former JNU student Sharjeel Imam with sedition before a court here on Saturday, alleging his speech promoted enmity between people that led to riots in the Jamia Millia Islamia University area.

In its supplementary charge sheet, the police said serious riots had broken out in consequence to the protest march organised by Jamia students"" against the amended citizenship law on December 15 last year.

The mob indulged in large-scale rioting, stone-pelting and arson, and in the process destroyed many public and private properties. Cases of rioting, arson and damage to public property were registered in both the police stations. Many policemen and public persons were injured in the riots, the agency told in its final report filed before the chief metropolitan magistrate court.

The cases were registered in New Friends Colony and Jamia Nagar police stations.

In the New Friends Colony case, Imam was arrested for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots, due to his seditious speech delivered on December 13, 2019. During investigation, on the basis of evidences collected, sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A IPC (promoting enmity between classes) were invoked in the case,"" police said.

The police previously filed a charge sheet against the rioters arrested by the SIT.

Further investigation in the case is under way, they said.

Imam was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28. He had been involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges.

Delhi police had also booked him for an ""inflammatory"" speech on the Jamia campus.

Another case was filed against Imam in Assam under the stringent anti-terror law for his remark that Assam could be ""severed from India, even if for a few months"" as a result of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Police in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh had also lodged FIRs against the JNU scholar over his speech in which he threatened to ""cut off"" Assam and the rest of the northeast from the country.

Addressing an online media briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, Kejriwal said that out of 2,274 samples tested, only 67 people tested positive for the novel virus on Friday.

A few days earlier, the daily tally of infections ranged between 180 and 350.

The chief minister also appealed to people living in containment areas to follow rules and don't step out of their homes.

""Some people have been seen on streets in containment areas. Yesterday, 26 members of one family tested positive for coronavirus in an area in Jahangir Puri which has been declared as containment area,"" Kejriwal said.

He also said that 71 containment areas have so far been identified in the national capital.

179,18-4-20,Bihar minister slams Gehlot over suggestion to bring back Kota students,"A Bihar minister on Saturday Disapproved of the Uttar Pradesh government sending buses to bring back students from the state stranded in Kota, and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot calling upon other states to follow suit, terming it a ""mockery"" of the nationwide lockdown prompted by COVID-19.

""Dear Sir, will it not be a severe blow to the #lockdown and a mockery of it!

""So far, we've done well in containing #COVID-19# compared to many countries owing to restraint & good work of all. Why dilute this? Also has Rajasthan called back all outstation students?"" Sanjay Kumar Jha, Bihar's Water Resources Minister and a close confidante of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, tweeted.

He was responding to Gehlot's tweet that suggested states to bring back home their students from the coaching hub for medical and engineering examinations in Rajasthan.

Gehlot had tweeted:""As the UP government called back students living in #Kota# Rajasthan, it can also be done for students from other states. Students in Kota can be sent to their home states on the consent of the concerned state governments so that these young boys & girls do not panic or feel depressed.""

Nitish Kumar had also said such a step will defeat the very purpose of the lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus and be ""injustice"" to the migrant labourers from Bihar stranded in other states.

The Uttar Pradesh government was reported to have sent over 200 buses to Kota to bring back nearly 7,500 students from the state stuck there.

News reports from Kota highlighted the difficulties faced by these students.

The Bihar minister repeated the chief minister's appeal to migrants to stay wherever they are to check the spread of the disease.

The Bihar government had earlier this week lodged a protest with the Centre over the Kota administration issuing passes to students of various coaching centres and their parents for returning to their home states.

In a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, Bihar Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar had on Monday said, ""Such movement from Kota is not at all advisable in the present scenario. In Bihar, we are now medically examining the returning students as well as their guardians accompanying them, and instructions are being issued to quarantine them.""

Jha also took a swipe at senior RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for attacking the Bihar government for not facilitating the return of state natives stuck elsewhere during the shutdown.

In a statement, Tejashwi refered to the Uttar Pradesh government facilitating the return of its students from Kota and the National Capital Region (NCR), and Gujarat bringing back its 1,800 peoople in luxury buses from Haridwar in Uttrakhand.

""Why these BJP ruled states are so capable, while in Bihar, where the JD(U), despite being in alliance with the BJP, is so 'asahaya' (helpless),"" the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly had said.

Jha, a JD(U) national general secretary, said the Bihar government is sincerely following the lockdown protocol and those making ""irresponsible"" statements are violating the ""spirit"" of the shutdown.

""In this hour of crisis, instead of staying with the people of Bihar here, why is he putting up in Delhi and registering his presence through tweet messages and irresponsibe statements?"" he asked.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bihar-minister-slams-gehlot-over-suggestion-to-bring-back-kota-students-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bihar-minister-slams-gehlot-over-suggestion-to-bring-back-kota-students.html

181,18-4-20,Current top 4 qualify for CL if season cancelled: Spanish FA,"The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) proposed on Thursday that La Liga’s current standings decide which teams qualify for European competitions if the season has to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

La Liga and UEFA have not given their approval to the plan, with both governing bodies insisting they are still focused on finding a way to ensure domestic seasons are completed.

Javier Tebas, La Liga’s president, said earlier this month the league had identified the end of May, start of June and end of June as possible times for fixtures to restart.

But the RFEF, which regularly clashes with La Liga over political issues in Spanish football, has put forward a back-up plan that would see the current top four — Barcelona, Real Madrid, Sevilla and Real Sociedad — qualify for the Champions League.

Getafe and Atletico Madrid, in fifth and sixth respectively, would go into the Europa League, along with Athletic Bilbao, as the Copa del Rey’s highest-placed finalist outside the top six.

“The decision will be made, when requested by UEFA, according to the positions on the last day of the First Division when an equal number of games are played by the 20 teams,” said the statement from the RFEF.

“The top four at that time would go into the UEFA Champions League and the fifth and sixth ranked, plus one of the two finalists of the Copa del Rey, to the UEFA Europa League, according to different circumstances that may occur.”

If the Copa del Rey final was played and Real Sociedad beat Bilbao, Valencia would take the additional Europa League spot as the seventh-placed team in La Liga, said the RFEF.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/current-top-4-qualify-for-cl-if-season-cancelled--spanish-fa.html

Singapore: International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has confirmed that the Australian Open and the South Korean Open have been cancelled amid COVID-19 outbreak. “The ITTF is looking at a number of different scenarios and possibilities of rescheduling, but it is currently still too early to make any decisions until there is greater certainty about when activities can resume,” the sport's ruling body explained in a statement.

183,18-4-20,Vettel dismisses idea of back-to-back races,"Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel on Friday cautioned against the temptation to shoehorn too many Formula One races into a revised calendar, describing the move as “not realistic”.

The 22-event F1 season has been decimated by the coronavirus with nine races either cancelled or postponed.

The French Grand Prix scheduled for June 28 is also in doubt as is the Belgian Grand Prix, set for August 30.

F1 chiefs have floated the idea of making up for lost time by staging races on successive weekends or even having two races on the same weekend. However, Ferrari star Vettel fears such a move could lead to burnout for team staff.

“We drivers are a little privileged,” Vettel told reporters by teleconference from his home in Switzerland.

“Of course, the races are tiring but there have to be limits for the staff. They must rest.

“We must also see if it is easy to reschedule races, if the circuits are not already taken. Many questions remain. I think the schedule will be busier, but 10 consecutive weekends is not realistic.”

Vettel suggested that he would favour staging races without fans if it allowed a quick resumption as long as it did not become a common feature.

“It’s complicated,” admitted Vettel.

“On the one hand, there is the health of the sport, on the other, that of the people who work in the paddock and especially the fans.

“There are several options. No one likes to run in front of empty stands, but we will have to see if it will not allow us to resume much sooner.

“The first races will probably be a little different, but not too much, I hope, because we want to run in front of the fans.”

Vettel insists that for him even a 10-race season is just as valuable as a 22-race campaign.

There have been talks over an extension. However, those conversations took a twist after Vettel finished the 2019 c’ship behind new teammate Charles Leclerc.

“At the beginning (of the coronavirus crisis), the priority was to manage the situation in the best way and therefore the negotiations were put on hold,” said Vettel.

“I think we are going to move forward but we do not have a specific deadline.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/vettel-dismisses-idea-of-back-to-back-races.html

The tournament will now be held September 24-26, 2021, also in Boston.

185,18-4-20,Seam & swing top priorities for Shami,"Team India boasts of a fast-bowling attack that skipper Virat Kohli says he is proud to lead. And the man who has been an integral part of the transformation of a young attack into world beaters is Mohammed Shami. Having started off under former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Shami is now the leader of the pack under Kohli.

While bowlers tend to get slower as a Test match progresses, Shami is someone who gets better with each passing session and has time and again shown that he can be a match-winner in the second innings for Team India. So what is his area of focus when he has that ball in hand?

“I try to ensure that my pace doesn’t fall below the 140kph mark. But my focus is on the seam and swing. I have always tried to make sure that these two things remain perfect. I can bring pace with my physical strength and you can always work on it by doing strength training. But I have always given priority to swing and seam and never for a minute let them take a backseat,” he smiles.

And the reverse swing? Did Shami have it from the word go? Or did it take time to master the art? The pacer says that it is something that has come to him with time and after a lot of training.

“As you keep playing, you learn a lot of things. It is all about following one process after the other. So, when you have learnt one trick and mastered it, you then move to the next one and work on that. In the beginning, I didn’t have much idea about reverse swing.

“But slowly I came to understand what the process of reverse swing is all about and how it can be an integral part of a pace bowler’s armoury. Then I started working on it and I had to work hard,” he explained.

It is often said that a bowler is only as good as his captain allows him to be because at the end of the day it is the skipper who has to trust his bowler to deliver. And Shami says the relation between Kohli and him is there for all to see on the field.

“Do I need to say this? I think the results bear testimony to the fact that Virat backs us to the core. He has always given us that freedom to do what we feel confident about. Also, it is very important at the international level to have a captain who knows your strengths and weaknesses and also backs you. This in turn helps you raise your game.

“Also, Virat has a lot of trust in our abilities and he gets the result because as a bowler, all you need is for the captain to back you and believe in you and your vision,” he insists.

Critics had started saying that Shami had become a red-ball specialist till he showed the world he can be a force to reckon with even in white-ball cricket. Now that he plays all the three formats, how different is the preparation going into a format? Shami says it is all in the mind.

“Mindset obviously does change as per the format. In terms of skills also you do need to change and adapt as per the format because what will work for you in Tests might not work for you in the shorter formats of the game. It is all about the mindset and how you adapt to the situation,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/seam---swing-top-priorities-for-shami-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/seam---swing-top-priorities-for-shami.html

187,18-4-20,Dhoni arguably the greatest captain ever: Pietersen,"Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen says two-time World Cup-winning skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is arguably the greatest captain ever.

When asked, Pietersen said it would be difficult to argue against Dhoni's greatness.

""It will be very difficult just with the weight of expectation to go against MS Dhoni because of what everybody expects from him, how he has to live his life and what he has been through captaining India and then captaining the CSK,"" Pietersen, who played 104 Tests, told Star Sports.

India tasted huge success under Dhoni, winning the 2007 World T20 and the 2011 World Cup at home.

India also won the 2013 Champions Trophy under the Jharkhand dasher, who has not played any international cricket since India's semi final exit from the ODI World Cup last July.

Dhoni, who has also been leading IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, has been a successful captain there also, winning the cash-rich T20 league thrice in 2010, 2011 and 2018.

The IPL was supposed to be his comeback event but it has been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, former India batsman Gautam Gambhir, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles in 2012 and 2014, believes that the franchise could have added another one or two titles if they had got swashbuckling West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell earlier than it did.

Russell, known for hitting towering sixes, was the player of the series in 2019, when Mumbai Indians clinched their fourth title.

Imagine (Andre) Russell going for (Rs) 50 Lakhs to KKR and Pawan Negi for (Rs) 8 crore to (Delhi) Daredevils. I probably wished that he would have been there for 7 years when I was playing we would have certainly won one or two more,"" said the former left-handed batsman.

189,18-4-20,"China revises epicentre Wuhan’s death count by 50%; total 4,632","China’s coronavirus death toll mounted to 4,632 on Friday after it revised the fatality figures by 50 per cent in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, as Beijing faced mounting international criticism of under-reporting of the Covid-19 data.

Citing data discrepancies, the Wuhan municipal headquarters on Friday revised the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths due to the disease which originated in the central Chinese city in December last year.

As of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was raised by 325 cases to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The revised figure raised China’s overall Covid-19 death toll to 4,632, and the total number of cases to 82,692.

The Wuhan municipal headquarters in a notification said the revisions were made in accordance with related laws and regulations as well as the principle of “being responsible for history, the people and the deceased.”

The latest revision of figures came amid sharp criticism of China by the US, the UK and other countries for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases, lack of transparency and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last, reportedly from Huanan sea food market.

The way Covid-19 cases were counted in China was changed in January and February, leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the health crisis in China, which on Friday denied it had covered up the extent of its Covid-19 outbreak.

A foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged that the virus’s rapid spread had contributed to under-counting that resulted in China raising its death toll earlier in the day. However, he emphasised that “there has never been any concealment, and we’ll never allow any concealment.”

Explaining the reason for the figure revision, the Wuhan municipality on Friday said it was done to ensure that the information on the city’s Covid-19 epidemic is open and transparent, and that the data are accurate.

Listing the reasons for the data discrepancies, it said the surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.

Besides, during the height of their treating efforts, hospitals were operating beyond their capacities and medical staff were preoccupied with saving and treating patients, resulting in belated, missed and mistaken reporting.

Also, due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients — including those administered by ministries, Hubei Province, Wuhan city and its districts, those affiliated to companies, as well as private hospitals and makeshift hospitals — a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network and failed to report their data in time.

The registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting, the Wuhan authorities noted.

Citing an official of the Wuhan municipal headquarters, Xinhua reported that a group for epidemic-related big data and epidemiological investigations was established in late March.

The group used information from online systems and collected full information from all epidemic-related locations to ensure that facts about every case are accurate and every figure is objective and correct.

“What lie behind the epidemic data are the lives and health of the general public, as well as the credibility of the government,” the official was quoted by the report.

The timely revision of the figures, among other things, shows respect for every single life, the official said.

199,18-4-20,Glimmer of hope! Rate abates,"Lockdown cuts doubling rate even as growth rate down to 40%; but cases above 14,300

The total number of coronavirus cases shot up from 500 to 13,500 during the 24-day of countrywide lockdown so far, but the growth rate of the pandemic has declined by 40 per cent since the lockdown was imposed from March 25.

The Union Health Ministry data has said that the ratio between number of patients recovered and number of deaths is 80:20 and 13.6 per cent people have recovered so far.

Addressing the media, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said the Ministry has analysed the data of cases of novel coronavirus in the country in many ways. It has been found that the rate of recovery of the patient is higher than that of the deceased. “At least 1,749 people recovered so far which is 13.6 per cent as on today,” he said.

He also said the doubling rate that means in how many days numbers of cases get doubled in the country has also reduced. “Our doubling rate of the number of cases is 6.2 days. The analysis is based on data of the last 7 days. It was 3 days before the lockdown. It is a product of how we are managing situations at field level. This is an ongoing process. We need to intensify our vigil to reduce the doubling rate even more,” said Agarwal.

“The doubling rate is lower than the national level in 19 States and Union Territories. Kerala, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Ladakh, Puducherry, Delhi, Bihar, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Assam, Tripura all have low doubling rates of coronavirus cases,” Aggarwal added.

Agarwal explained that the data was analysed in another way also in which growth factor and outcome ratio were calculated. “Growth factor is calculated by comparing today’s cases with the number of cases that came on Thursday.

“We have found that the average growth factor is at 1.2 since April 1 which was 2.1 at an average between March 15 and March 31. There is 40 per cent decline in average growth factor even as we have increased the number of testing by testing even ILI (Influenza Like Illness) and SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) samples,’’ Agarwal said.

He also said that the outcome ratio which is number of recovered people against number of deaths stood in the proportion of 80:20 in India which is higher than that in several other counties.

“A total of 1,749 people have been cured, which is equal to 13.6 per cent of the total number of cases. With 1,007 fresh cases of coronavirus reported in the last 24 hours, the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country has reached 13,387. A total of 23 new deaths have been recorded in the last 24 hours,” he added.

“Although every death is a matter of concern for the country, we have found that the ratio between recovered Covid-19 patients vs number of deaths, is 80:20 in India, which is higher than that in several other countries,” said Agarwal.

The Health Ministry, in its daily update, said 452 deaths have been reported in India so far, with the highest — 194 — getting reported from Maharashtra, followed by MP, where 57 deaths have been reported so far. Maharashtra remained the worst hit State with positive cases rising to 3,205, followed by New Delhi at 1,640, Tamil Nadu at 1,267 and Rajasthan at 1,131, as per the Health Ministry data.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/glimmer-of-hope--rate-abates-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/glimmer-of-hope--rate-abates.html
200,18-4-20,RBI’s booster shot to help eco recuperate,"Repo rate cut, bad loan rules eased, liquidity to aid lending

With a clear message to banks to lend more to revive the corona-hit economy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday cut the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points, further eased bad-loan rules and froze dividend payment by lenders as it unveiled a second set of measures to support the economy.

The move gave an impetus to stock market, especially the banking stocks. The Sensex closed 986 points up, Nifty 273 points up, and banking index rose by nearly 1300 points.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced that the Central bank’s decision to reduced the reverse repo rate — the rate at which banks park their fund with the central bank — by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent, and went on to say the RBI will ensure adequate liquidity in the system to ease the financial stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

On other measures, Das said the RBI will begin with giving an additional Rs 50,000 crore through targeted long-term repo operation (TLTRO) to be undertaken in tranches.

Das also announced a re-financing window of Rs 50,000 crore for financial institutions like Nabard, National Housing Bank and Sidbi.

He further said surplus liquidity in the banking system has increased substantially as result of RBI’s actions.

Stating that the RBI is monitoring the situation developing out of Covid-19 outbreak, he noted that the contraction in exports in March at 34.6 per cent was much more severe than global financial crisis of 2008-09.

The RBI also debarred all commercial and cooperative banks from paying dividends to shareholders and promoter groups as the regulator fears the Covid-driven economic shocks would continue longer and may put the health of the financial system at risk.

The decision will hit the finances of the Centre, which get a lion share of the dividend from the PSU banks.

“It is imperative that banks conserve capital to retain their capacity to support the economy and absorb losses in an environment of heightened uncertainty.

“In this regard in view of the Covid-19-related economic shocks, commercial banks and cooperative banks shall not make any further dividend payouts from the profit pertaining to FY20 until further instructions,” said the RBI Governor.

“This restriction shall be reviewed on the basis of the financial position of banks as of the September 2020 quarter,” he added.

The RBI move will be impact the Government’s non-tax revenue, further worsening the already stressed fiscal situation.

The RBI measures will revive credit flow by commercial banks and targeted long-term repo operation (LTRO) would further activate the corporate bond market and also provide much needed liquidity to NBFCs, Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Friday.

""Kudos to the Government and RBI for announcing another bazoka like package for reviving up credit activity by commercial banks and also by NABARD. The targeted LTRO will further activate the corporate bond market and also provide much needed liquidity to NBFCs.

202,18-4-20,"Wedding of ex-CM’s son, religious procession snub Covid lockdown","VIPs and religious groups have made a mockery of lockdown measures in Karnataka. A day after thousands of devotees took part in the Siddalungeshwara Jatra in Kalburgi district, former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy’s son Nikhil tied the knot on Friday with Revathi, niece of former Minister M Krishnappa, in full fanfare.

According to reports put out by news agencies, scores of people reportedly thronged a farmhouse in Ramanagara district near Bengaluru to get a glimpse of the wedding of former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda’s grandson Nikhil Kumaraswamy. The visitors at the ceremony were seen without facial masks or observing the one metre distance between two individuals as part of the social distancing advised by the Government.

The marriage was solemnised at Kumaraswamy’s Kethaganahalli farmhouse at Bidadi in Ramanagara district, considered a JD(S) stronghold.

“The information we have is that at least 150 to 200 vehicles were given permission to attend the event. This happened when the social workers who want to serve the badly affected poor people are not getting permission to run their vehicles,” Ramanagar BJP district president M Rudresh was reported to have alleged.

“Till now Ramanagara is safe from coronavirus. If at all the disease spreads in Ramanagara, the entire blame will be on Deve Gowda’s family,” Rudresh alleged.

The local leader said he will meet the Deputy Commissioner and the SP of Ramanagara district and ask them how permission was granted for such a “large gathering”.

However, JD(S) MLC TA Sharavana denied allegations that the lockdown norms were flouted, claiming, “There were only eight people on the stage to perform rituals as against the claim that people crowded the venue.”

“Social distancing was maintained throughout the marriage,” Sharavana told an agency.

JD(S) leader NH Konaraddi also denied the accusations saying that all the norms were followed.

“Whatever Central guidelines are there, we have them followed in toto. The social distancing norm has also been adhered to,” he claimed.

In Kalaburagi, the Siddalingeshwara Jatra was organised in Ravoor village of Chittapur taluk with a large number of devotees seen violating the lockdown norms of social distancing and wearing face masks.

The event entailed the chariot pulling ritual in the temple where scores of devotees had participated.

The chariot pulling ceremony was scheduled to take place on Thursday evening but the Siddalingeshwara Trust agreed to cancel the event in keeping with the lockdown norms. However, the chariot was pulled on Thursday morning at 5 am in the presence of many devotees without the local administration being kept in the loop.

An FIR in the matter was filed on Friday.

Last week, BJP MLA from Teruvekere, Masale Jayaram celebrated his birthday in a grand style with participation of hundreds of villagers, including children.

Jayaram had hosted his birthday party at a Government school in Tumkuru, videos of which are available in the open domain.

People gathered in large numbers at the venue Idagaru Government School to wish their legislator amid the lockdown.

The MLA is heard addressing his well-wishers who gathered around the table at the venue as Jayaram cut a cake.

A number of visitors were seen wearing masks in the video but the social distancing norms were not followed.

The MLA was garlanded with a shawl by his supporters and is seen wearing gloves and a face mask.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/wedding-of-ex-cm---s-son--religious-procession-snub-covid-lockdown-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/wedding-of-ex-cm---s-son--religious-procession-snub-covid-lockdown.html
203,18-4-20,NASA announces first SpaceX crewed flight for May 27,"A SpaceX rocket will send two American astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27, NASA announced on Friday, the first crewed spaceflight from the US in nearly a decade.

""On May 27, @NASA will once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil!"" Jim Bridenstine, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in a tweet Since July 2011, the United States has relied on Russian Soyuz rockets to send American astronauts to the ISS.

The US space agency had been aiming to conduct the crewed mission in May and is sticking with the plan despite the global coronavirus pandemic.

Astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will fly to the ISS on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket aboard a Crew Dragon spacecraft also built by SpaceX, the company founded by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.

They will lift off at 4:32 pm (2032 GMT) on May 27 from historic launch pad 39A, the same one used for the Apollo and space shuttle missions, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said.

Behnken and Hurley have been training for years for the mission, which would move the United States closer to no longer being reliant on Russia for crewed flights.

The Crew Dragon capsule is a modified version of SpaceX's Dragon capsule which has been used to send supplies to the ISS since 2012.

It will take approximately 24 hours after liftoff for them to dock with the ISS. The length of their stay aboard the ISS has not been determined.

One American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are currently aboard the ISS.

The May mission will be a milestone for NASA, which has had trouble turning the page on the space shuttle era. Shuttles transported American astronauts into space for three decades but two of them also blew up.

After abandoning the shuttle, NASA turned to private industry to develop its next generation spacecraft and SpaceX and Boeing have been competing on rolling out a crewed capsule.

SpaceX came up with Crew Dragon and Boeing the Starliner but the Starliner suffered a setback in December during a test run.

SpaceX is now poised to become the first private company to send astronauts into space.

In March, Musk's Crew Dragon capsule made a round trip to the ISS, which is in orbit more than 250 miles (400 kilometres) above Earth, with a mannequin on board, before returning to the Atlantic after six days in space.

SpaceX has made the trip 15 times since 2012, but only to refuel the station.

It was the seventh day that the number of deaths in the previous 24 hours had fallen.

It was also the fifth straight day that the number of new deaths had stayed in double figures, ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference.

""This (73) is a very low number compared to recent days,"" he said, hoping the downward trend would continue.

Jahanpour said the ""small victory"" against the coronavirus had been won despite ""enmities"" towards Iran.

He claimed that US sanctions had prevented Iran from buying virus testing kits from South Korea, but gve no further details.

""This is despite all their false claims that trade in medicines is not covered by the sanctions,"" he said.

""The world will judge such actions.""

Jahanpour added that 1,374 new infections had been confirmed in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 80,860.

Of those admitted to hospital, 55,987 have recovered and been discharged, while 3,513 remain in critical condition.

According to a parliamentary report, the published figures are based only on those hospitalised with ""severe symptoms"".

The report said the real death toll was estimated to be as much as 80 per cent higher and infections ""eight to 10 times"" higher.

The health ministry has confirmed the numbers may be higher due to limited testing.

Tehran city councillor Nahid Khodakarami told the Shargh newspaperon Wednesday that the daily death toll in the capital ranged between 70 and more than 100.

But a member of the national coronavirus taskforce, Masoud Mardani, dismissed the claim, stressing that ""not every respiratory disease is coronavirus."" Iran has struggled to contain the outbreak and keep Iran's sanctions-hit economy running.

It shut schools and universities, postponed major events and imposed a range of other restrictions, but it has stopped short of ordering lockdowns.

The government allowed small businesses in Tehran to reopen on Saturday, following a similar move in the provinces last week.

205,18-4-20,"Global virus deaths pass 150,000 as Trump endorses lockdown protests","Coronavirus deaths have surged past 150,000 worldwide with nearly a quarter of them in the United States, where President Donald Trump lent his support to protesters rallying against lockdown orders.

Evidence is mounting that social distancing successfully slowed the pandemic after more than half of humanity -- 4.5 billion people -- were confined to their homes.

Governments around the world are now grappling with when and how to ease lockdowns that have crippled the global economy, even as the COVID-19 death toll climbs further in hard-hit countries.

Demonstrators in three US states staged public rallies this week to demand an end to the restrictions, with the largest protest in Michigan attracting 3,000 people -- some of whom were armed.

Trump has largely left decisions on easing lockdowns to state officials even as he laid out guidelines for a staged reopening of the national economy.

But his call to ""liberate"" Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia in a series of tweets Friday were quickly rebuked by the Democratic leaders of all three states.

""I do not have time to involve myself in Twitter wars,"" said Virginia governor Ralph Northam.

The United States accounts for nearly a third of the 2.25 million coronavirus infections reported globally. It has also recorded over 37,000 deaths, more than any other nation, followed by Italy, Spain and France which have all been ravaged by their own outbreaks.

Many countries are testing only the most serious cases and the number of confirmed global cases is likely only a fraction of the true total.

Virtually no corner of the world has been left untouched, with deaths in Africa passing 1,000.

Nigeria announced the death of President Muhammadu Buhari's top aide on Saturday, the highest-profile person to succumb to the virus in Africa's most populous nation.

Meanwhile, many of the world's 260 million Orthodox Christians are preparing to mark Easter without attending church services. The Russian Orthodox Church has asked the faithful to celebrate at home, even though many places or worship will remain open. Services in Turkey will be closed to the public and broadcast on the internet.

In Zimbabwe, celebrations and mass rallies to mark the country's 40th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule were cancelled.

And Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II will not mark her birthday on Tuesday with a traditional gun salute.

China sharply raised its death toll to 4,636 on Friday after adding another 1,290 fatalities for the city of Wuhan, where the respiratory disease first emerged late last year.

Trump, who has angrily shot back at claims he reacted too slowly to the virus threat, has accused Beijing of downplaying the impact of the virus within its borders.

""It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!"" he tweeted.

Trump did not offer evidence to back the claim, but pressure has mounted in recent days on Beijing to come clean over its handling of the initial outbreak.

Leaders in France and Britain have also questioned China's management of the crisis but Beijing hit back, saying it had not concealed information about the illness.

Signs that the outbreak could be easing in parts of Europe prompted Switzerland, Denmark and Finland to begin reopening shops and schools this week.

Germany's health minister said Friday that the virus was ""under control after 3,400 deaths in his country, which is now beginning the delicate task of lifting some restrictions without triggering a secondary outbreak.

Some small shops will be allowed to reopen Monday, and some children will return to school within weeks.

Parts of Italy also began emerging from lockdown, with Venice residents strolling around quiet canals.

But Spain, where the death toll topped 20,000 on Saturday, has extended its strict lockdown, while Japan, Britain and Mexico have all expanded their current movement restrictions.

Signs of the economic carnage wrought by the pandemic are mounting, with China reporting its first contraction in GDP since at least the early 1990s after several decades of breakneck growth. The Trump administration pledged another $19 billion in relief for farmers reeling from a massive jolt to the agricultural markets with schools and restaurants shuttered across the country.

Part of the funds will be used to buy up surplus dairy products and produce that farmers have been destroying, unable to get it to consumers or food processors.

""Having to dump milk and plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it's heartbreaking as well to those who produce them,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.

African state leaders and global financial bodies warned Friday that the continent needed tens of billions of dollars in additional funds to fight the outbreak.

The IMF also warned the virus could spark another ""lost decade"" in Latin America and backed debt moratoriums to free up spending for the region's fragile economies.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-virus-deaths-pass-150-000-as-trump-endorses-lockdown-protests-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/global-virus-deaths-pass-150-000-as-trump-endorses-lockdown-protests.html

207,18-4-20,"Virus shadow on Char Dham Yatra, uncertainty on opening","Gangotri, Yamunotri opening rituals to be held on April 26

The deadly coronavirus has also affected the “muhurat” for the Char Dham yatra. The Yamunotri and Gangotri will initiate the annual opening rituals on April 26, but the opening of the customary “Kapaat” (doors) to invoke the Lords at Kedarnath and Badrinath is still mired in uncertainty.

With all means of transportation suspended due to the lockdown, the Home Ministry has allowed the head priests to travel by road after the Uttarakhand Government wrote to the Centre, Kerala and Karnataka Governments, from the native places of Rawals, the priests.

The Rawals, descendants of Adi Shankaracharya who established both the shrines, are in charge of the daily obeisance of the Lord Shiva at Kedarnath and Lord Vishnu at Badrinath for almost six months from April/May to October/ November every year. When the snow sets in Himalayas during the winter the replica of idols are relocated at Joshimath (winter abode of Badrinath) and Ukhimath (winter abode of Kedarnath) through a procession and between the nominated priests perform the daily puja while Rawals go back to their native places.

The Uttarakhand Government’s request to fly the priests by a special chartered flight from down south to Uttarakhand was declined by Home Ministry.

Now, the State Governments are coordinating to facilitate travel by roads for Rawals in a day or two. The manual of the Covid-19 vehicle usage will be followed accordingly so that each vehicle has only two occupants.

The head priest (Rawal) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva jangam community from the village Banuvalli of Taluka Harihar of Davanagere district in Karnataka while head priest Rawal of clan Namboodari of Badrinath temple belongs to Kerala.

As per schedule given by the Royal family, Kedarnath is to be opened on April 29 while Badrinath the following day. But as per Government Covid-19 guidelines, the Rawals will have to be under mandatory 14 days quarantine as they enter Uttarakhand.

The Badri-Kedar Trust has opposed this, arguing that the Rawals are always “quarantined” as they are not touched by anyone round the year, whether they are in the sanctum santorum or in a retreat.

“They do all their chores themselves even cooking as per the custom. Why do they need to be quarantined? Even if it’s delayed, only the Rawals will perform the opening of both the religious place. The dates can be reshuffled as has happened a couple of times in the past when the priests could not reach on time,” an official of BKT told The Pioneer over phone.

The Uttarakhand Government is digging into pages of temples’ manual to verify the claims of BKT whether the dates can be changed. A senior State Government official, however, confided that they are also talking with the Royal families of Tehri to nominate someone (as has happened in last four occasions) to perform the opening of doors rituals of both the holy shrines.

“Even if the Kapat are opened, it will not be thrown open for the pilgrims until the lockdown is lifted. For Kedarnath only 12 persons will be allowed and at Badrinath 20 of them will be allowed to take the procession from Joshimath and Ukhimath to the shrines,” said the official.

The doors of Kedarnath temple will be opened on April 29, 2020 at 6.10 am in the morning with special puja in the temple by the Rawals while Badrinath Temple will be open on April 30 at 04.30 am and pujas are carried out by Rawal’s assistants on his instructions as per the thousand year old tradition.

The Kedarnath shrine, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva, is said to be more than 1,200 years old. It was built by Adi Shankaracharya and is among one of the 12 jyotirlingas in India.

A visit to the Kedarnath temple is an integral part of the famous Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand. The yatra (pilgrimage) also includes visits to shrines like Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath. All four shrines are located in the Garhwal division of Uttrakhand.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-shadow-on-char-dham-yatra--uncertainty-on-opening-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/virus-shadow-on-char-dham-yatra--uncertainty-on-opening.html

There have been reports that the duo is dating but actors haven't confirmed their relationship.

""Sushant is a fear friend. It (spotlight) doesn't bother me. We are people who are in the limelight. If we want people to watch your films, they will also want to talk about our personal lives. It's the most common psychology to discuss other people. So I don't get bothered by it,"" Rhea told PTI.

The actor, who started off as a VJ on MTV, made her Bollywood debut with ""Mere Dad Ki Maruti"" in 2013 and went on to feature in films like ""Sonali Cable"", ""Jalebi"". She will be next seen in Amitabh Bachchan-starrer ""Chehre"".

""My journey has been beautiful, more than what I could ask for. Of course there have been ups and downs but I've been fortunate and grateful for this journey. It has taught me a lot, I've grown, become a better actor and a human being.

""When I was in MTV, I wasn't really looking out to do films. I never even knew I would end up becoming an actor. It was coincidental for me. Once I did it, I realised it's what I really want to do. Like every other actor, I would want to prove my merit,"" she said.

Rhea's latest project is director Sonam Nair's short film ""Boom Boom"", which recently premiered on Zee5.

The actor said she is open to work in any medium as long as the content excites her.

""I do actively look out for any kind of work, whether it's long form, short or web. I just look out for interesting characters. It doesn't matter where it is.

211,18-4-20,Trump announces USD 19 bn relief for farmers amid COVID-19 epidemic,"President Donald Trump has announced a USD 19 billion financial rescue package to help the agriculture industry weather the staggering economic downturn sparked by measures to defeat the coronavirus.

Trump told a press conference on Friday that the government ""will be implementing a USD 19 billion relief program for our great farmers and ranchers as they cope with the fallout of the global pandemic.""

The program will include direct payments to farmers, ranchers and producers who Trump said have experienced ""unprecedented losses during this pandemic.""

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said US farmers have been hit hard by a sharp shift in demand, as schools and restaurants close and more Americans eat at home. That has disrupted the food supply chain, forcing farmers in many places to destroy dairy output and plough under crops that no longer have buyers.

""Having to dump milk and plough under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it's heartbreaking as well to those who produce them,"" Perdue said.

Perdue said some USD 3 billion of the money would go to buying produce and milk from such farmers, and redistribute it to community food banks. Millions of Americans have recently turned to food pantries for meals and groceries after losing their jobs.

The US farm and food industry has been hit in numerous ways by the coronavirus epidemic. Farmers are having trouble finding seasonal labourers to prepare and harvest crops; some meatpacking plants have been hit hard by COVID-19 outbreaks.

But the change in the way consumers eat has had a huge impact. ""Shuttered schools, universities, restaurants, bars and cafeterias are no longer buying milk, meat, fruits, vegetables and other food, causing a downward spiral in crop and livestock prices,"" the American Farm Bureau said recently.

Perdue praised farmers, who have enjoyed billions of dollars in support payments over the past two years due to the impact of Trump's trade war with China, as ""heroic.""

""Our farmers have been in the fields planting and doing what they do every spring to feed the American people, even with a pandemic, as we speak.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-announces-usd-19-bn-relief-for-farmers-amid-covid-19-epidemic-2020-04-18.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-announces-usd-19-bn-relief-for-farmers-amid-covid-19-epidemic.html
212,18-4-20,"Coronavirus cases in US cross 700,000, death toll more than 35K","The number of the coronavirus cases in the US crossed 700,000 on Friday, while over 35,000 people have died from the disease, as President Donald Trump assured his people that America was ""very close"" to seeing the light ""shinning brightly"" at the end of the tunnel.

New York, the financial capital of the world, has emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic. More than 14,000 people have died in the city and over 200,000 lakh people have tested positive so far. Neighbouring New Jersey has more than 78,000 cases and 3,800 deaths.

President Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday that to date the US had conducted more than 3.78 million coronavirus tests, by far the most in any country.

""It's not even close. In the hardest-hit areas such as New York and Louisiana we have also tested more people per capita than South Korea, Singapore, and every other country. The United States has the most robust, advanced and accurate testing system anywhere in the world,"" he said.

Trump said that the number of deaths could have been much higher if his administration had not mounted a massive effort against containing the coronavirus. Against initial estimated death of between one and two lakhs, Trump hoped that the death toll could be far less and around 65,000.

""It's a horrible thing that happened to our country. This is a horrible thing that happened to 184 countries all over the world. It was a horrible thing and there was no reason for it. That should never, ever happen again,"" Trump said.

Ultimate victory in this war will be made possible by America's scientific brilliance, Trump asserted.

""There is nothing like us, there is nobody like us, not even close. I wish I could tell you stories what other countries, even powerful countries say to me, the leaders. They say it quietly and they say off the record, but they have great respect for what we can do,"" he said.

The last few months have been among the most challenging times in the history of the nation, Trump said.

""This invisible enemy is tough and it's smart and it's a vicious that every day we are getting closer to the future that we all have been waiting for,"" he said.

""I talk about the light at the end of the tunnel. We are getting very, very close to seeing that light shine very brightly at the end of that tunnel and it is happening,"" he said.

According to data maintained by Johns Hopkins University, Over 35,000 people have died in the US and the country has 701,131 infections, the highest in the world.

Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that despite the tragic loss of more than 36,000 Americans, the latest data show that the new cases are slow and steady on the West Coast.

""We continue to see cases and hospitalisations declining in the new greater New York City area, in New Orleans and Detroit and elsewhere,"" he said.

A total of 154,142 people have died and 2,242,868 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus that originated in China in November last year, according to Johns Hopkins University.

213,18-4-20,"UK sets up new Vaccine Taskforce as COVID-19 death toll hits 14,576","The UK has set up a taskforce to urgently find a coronavirus vaccine and prepare the industry to manufacture it at scale once it is developed, as 847 fresh death were reported due to the COVID-19, taking the death toll in the country to 14,576.

Addressing the daily Downing Street briefing, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said on Friday the new Vaccine Taskforce, led by the government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, is a collaboration between business and industry and academia.

It is aimed at coordinating efforts to discover a vaccine, funnel resources and support to industry and research institutions and review regulations to remove any blocks in scaling it up, he said.

""We cannot put a date on when we will get a vaccine. But we live in a country with a rich history of pioneering science, and with the government backing our scientists, we have the best chance to do this as quickly as possible,"" said the Indian-origin Cabinet minister.

Sharma also announced 21 new research projects to receive funds from a 14 million pounds government pot for the development of treatments and vaccines.

""UK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people's lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts.

""The Vaccine Taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible,"" he said.

Under details of some of the scientific work ongoing to combat the spread of the deadly virus, one new project is led by the University of Oxford to trial an anti-malarial drug, believed to have anti-inflammatory properties, to determine whether it could diminish the effects of COVID-19 on people in high risk groups.

General Practitioner (GP) surgeries across the UK have been invited to take part in the groundbreaking trial, to ascertain whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery.

Other projects receiving vital government funding under the new taskforce include an Imperial College London initiative testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies and Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus.

Public Health England is also studying how COVID-19 can be transmitted from person-to-person by determining how long it can survive in the air and on different materials found in hospitals and households like fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics.

The UK has already pledged 250 million pounds to the international effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine under the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

The latest announcement aims to make the UK a leader in clinical vaccine testing and manufacturing, building on existing research and development expertise.

""We're doing everything possible to save lives and beat this disease, and that includes working flat out with businesses, researchers and industry to find a vaccine as quickly as possible.

""The UK is world-leading in developing vaccines. We are the biggest contributor to the global effort and preparing to ensure we can manufacture vaccines here at home as soon as practically possible,"" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

214,18-4-20,"COVID-19: China's imported cases rise to 1,566; revised death toll 4,632","China's imported cases of coronavirus rose to 1,566 and the death toll jumped to 4,632 with a 50 per cent spike in fatality figures from the epicentre Wuhan, health officials said on Saturday.

The country's National Health Commission (NHC) announced the revised national figures of coronavirus, taking note of Wuhan's new data.

As per the new figures, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 82,719 by Friday, including 4,632 deaths. As many as 1,058 patients are still being treated and 77,029 have been discharged from hospitals.

On Friday, Wuhan's officials announced that as of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases was raised by 325 to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869.

No deaths due to COVID-19 were reported on Friday.

The latest revision of figures came amidst sharp criticism of China by the US, the UK and other countries for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases, lack of transparency and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last year, reportedly from the local Huanan sea food market.

The way COVID-19 cases were counted in China was changed in January and February, leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the health crisis in the world's most populous country.

But China denied that it had covered up the extent of its COVID-19 outbreak.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the virus's rapid spread had contributed to under-counting that resulted in China raising its death toll earlier in the day.

However, he emphasised that ""there has never been any concealment, and we'll never allow any concealment.""

On Saturday. the NHC said 27 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported of which 17 were imported.

The other 10 new cases were domestically transmitted.

This included seven new cases in Heilongjiang province, bordering Russia where cases went up following return of large number of Chinese nationals from various Russian cities and two in Guangdong province and one in Sichuan province.

No death was reported on the mainland, the NHC said.

As of Friday, the mainland has reported a total of 1,566 imported cases, it said.

Also 54 new asymptomatic cases, including three from abroad, were reported, taking their total to 1,017.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

By Friday, 1,021 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao and 395 in Taiwan including six deaths.

215,18-4-20,"Pak struggles to rein in defiant clerics as COVID-19 cases near 7,500","Pakistan's coronavirus cases on Saturday rose to 7,481 with 465 new patients even as the government struggled to control clerics flouting orders against congregations in mosques.

The Ministry of National Health Services reported that 143 people have died so far including eight on Friday. Another 1,832 have recovered.

The largest province of Punjab registered 3,391 patients, followed by Sindh with 2,217, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 1,077, Balochistan 335, Gilgit-Baltistan 250, Islamabad 163 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with 48 patients.

The ministry showed that so far 92,548 tests have been conducted, including 6,416 in the last 24 hours.

The steady rise continued despite hectic efforts to contain the spread.

One of the biggest hurdles being faced by the authorities has been to convince clerics to stop congregational prayers in mosques.

President Arif Alvi on Friday held talks with Jamaat-i-Islami chief Senator Sirajul Haq, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith chief Senator Sajid Mir and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Rana Tanveer Hussain over prayer congregations.

He was poised to continue consultations on Saturday to convince the clerics from different sectors to avoid big gatherings in the upcoming month of Ramzan.

Prime Minister Imran Khan is also expected to meet religious leaders to take them into confidence over the vital issue.

So far Tablighi Jamaat has promised to cooperate and its chief Maulana Nazarur Rehman appealed to his followers to follow official direction in Ramzan.

But a group of hardline clerics led by Mufti Muneebur Rehman and Mufti Taqi Usmani wanted to let the clerics decide the opening of mosques without any interference by the government.

Meanwhile, Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, who is also a religious leader, on Friday asked the fellow clerics to abide by the guidelines of the government in order to defeat coronavirus.

On Friday, several incidents of violation of official directives were reported. But the situation was better than the previous Friday when scuffled took place between police and worshippers outside a mosque in Karachi.

In stark violation of the government orders, a recalcitrant cleric of Red Mosque had been holding regular Friday congregation in the heart of capital Islamabad.

Maulana Abdul Aziz refused to cooperate and the government was unable to remove him from the pulpit of a mosque which is owned by government's religious affairs ministry.

The government has said that only five worshippers including those who are associated with the affairs of the mosques are allowed to offer congregational prayers.

Meanwhile, it was reported that two women who returned to Pakistan from India via the Wagah border tested positive for the novel coronavirus. They were part of 41 people that returned to the country, according to The Express Tribune.

218,18-4-20,Instagram to allow users to move live streams on IGTV,"Facebook-owned Instagram is reportedly testing a button that would allow its users to upload their finished live streams directly to IGTV.

IGTV is a standalone video application by Instagram for Android and iOS smartphones.

With that button, one can also choose to share a preview of their video to their feed and profile. Comments and question stickers will not carry over to IGTV, reports The Verge.

The button could make uploading to IGTV an easy option, which would not only benefit viewers who missed a Live but also help Instagram-build IGTV content.

Instagram launched Live feature back in 2016. The company says Live usage is up over 70 percent in the US.

To make Live more user friendly, Instagram has also made live streams viewable on the web so that one can watch homebound celebrities from the comfort of a large screen.

The mobile Instagram Live experience has comments scrolling up through a transparent window at the bottom of the video.

However, the new feature does not allow users to begin a broadcast from their laptop, it still need to broadcast from the iPhone or Android app.

Instagram recently rolled out a feature where people can send direct messages from their web browser globally.

The photo-sharing service has been testing web DMs with a small group of users since January this year.

In a video, there are a bunch of other claims to make for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

Not only did the YouTube channel leak the CAD renders of the phone, but also created a 3D printed design based on the leaks.

According to the video, the device will be seemingly thinner at 7.4mm, compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which is 8.1mm thick.

It will feature a 6.7-inch display with a complete flat stainless-steel frame rather than the existing rounded implementation and a smaller notch.

The SIM card tray could also be moved to a different place on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.

The speakers on the device could get 10 to 15 per cent louder, as well and would come in light blue, violet, and light orange colour variants among others, the video has claimed.

The Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is expected to go official in September alongside the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Plus, and iPhone 12 Pro.

The shipments are likely to begin in October or November due to COVID-19 delays.
