0,27-1-20,You’re what you say you’re,"In the midst of all the din created by parties that has earned India the dubious title of a divided nation, Delhi stands as a calm outlier. AAP has significantly changed perceptions

I was reading a piece on the popular online platform, Medium. In the said article, I came across an interesting tidbit about an American football coach, Bill Parcells. He has been listed in the “Pro Football Hall of Fame” and is one of the most successful football coaches in the US. While he has won many championships and brought great success to his team, most fans remember him for his famous quote rather than something he had done on the field: “You are what your record says you are.” This is a lovely take on the classic adage, “You are what you say you are.” Both phrases are rooted in real-life experiences. There can be no greater example of it than the prevailing political scenario in New Delhi.

Elections in the national capital are due in February. With the media’s focus on the said polls, it is likely that one may have had a chance to hear about or must have come across the different political campaigns currently at play by various parties in the city. One of the favourite catch phrases for one of the political opponents of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been “Pakistan.” It’s very hard to escape any mention about it. Whenever any panellist speaks against the AAP on a television debate or otherwise, it is almost inevitable that reference to “Pakistan” is made. This is in stark comparison to the catch phrase of the AAP, which reads: Kaam Pe Vote.

Why is there such a difference in the approach of both parties? To understand this, the phrase, “You are what you say you are” may be of help. When the AAP exploded into the Indian political landscape, it came up with a message that was entirely different from the prevailing political narratives at that time. There was no talk about division along religious or caste lines. Instead, the message of hope that was offered then was that the AAP is in politics to change the narrative and that of the politicians. Communalism or crony capitalism was not on the agenda. Instead, the focus was on “development” and to provide cheaper power and ample water supply to the people of Delhi.

At that time, this mandate was only based on “hope” because back in 2015, the AAP had no prior record in Indian politics. Fast forward it to 2019 and the story is quite different now. Just how different will be dealt in detail later in this piece. The reason why the AAP chose to speak about “development” and aimed to provide basic amenities to the people is simple. Its focus on these issues isn’t one of “obsession” or “identity.” On the contrary, AAP’s belief is that most Delhiites, and for that matter most Indians, do not care as much about what makes them different but what can take them and their children forward. It’s an aspirational view of politics that speaks to not only what it can be about but also how a commitment to this basic principle can help the citizens move forward.

On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made “Pakistan” its main focus area. Party spokespersons speak little or do not even talk about development. But if one were to ask them about Pakistan, they can write a thesis about our neighbour. This is why BJP leaders have little or no idea about how to improve the state of education or to provide cheap electricity. The BJP’s agenda is to focus on what divides us. Differences abound among Indians; we have different religions, eating habits, climates, spices and different colours. But just because we have differences doesn’t mean that we must be divided.

Our greatest asset lies in “diversity” and Delhi is a microcosm of it where citizens from all across the country have come together to make it their home. I believe that as Indians, we are in unison about at least one thing: We want our children to see a better India than what we have seen until now. Citizens want affordable electricity, a corruption-free Government, good roads and an empowering education system. These formed the foundation of the AAP’s 2019 slogan, Kaam Pe Vote.

While 2015 may have been an election about hope, in 2020, the AAP has asked for votes only on the basis of the work done by it. This is a marked departure from the way its political opponents, who are obsessed with identities, have campaigned. The AAP is obsessed with “work.” This is where Bill Parcells’ quote comes into picture: “You are what your record says you are.”

Since 2015, the AAP has reduced teacher vacancies by over 70 per cent. The party’s focus, which is to improve Delhi’s education system, has been recognised by the world. The fact that 1.4 lakh children in the national capital have been shifted from “private” to “Government” schools is a testimony to the fact that people have recognised and appreciated the work done by it. In the healthcare sector, too, the party has already set up 450 mohalla clinics till December 2019 and has served around two crore people in the city.

The power sector, too, has undergone a transformative change. Delhi is the only State where both domestic and commercial tariffs have reduced and where 24x7 electricity is a reality. Under previous Governments, an increase in tariffs was all but regular. To receive 24x7 electricity was a treasured rarity. Delhi is going the way most Indians want India to go. Its economy is growing and the AAP Government has managed a surplus by reducing leakages and corruption at every level.

I can go on and on speaking about the efforts and results of the AAP in Delhi but this article is about something more than this. It’s about how in 2010, the term, “India” was on everyone’s lips. Great things were expected of us and the entire world looked upon the country to provide them “intellectual” and “human capital.”

We were on the cover of international magazines as an emblem of hope. Now, we are on their covers as an example of a divided nation. A mixture of corruption, incompetence, entitlement from certain political parties and politics of hatred, division and communalism on the part of certain political parties has brought us to this unfortunate moment.

However, all is not lost. Amidst all this din, the fact is that Delhi stands as a calm outlier that has done actual work for the people. It has done so by leaving the task of talking to be done by those who are more adept at it. And when the AAP does speak, it’s about kaam (work) not “Pakistan.” The party believes in the phrase, “You are what you say.” Does anybody not believe us? Have a look at our records and they will speak for themselves.

1,27-1-20,Toxic war of words,"The BJP seems to have lost the plot with its support to rabid statements by party leaders and is in no mood to engage

If the ruling BJP is indeed serious about its outreach to civil society, which it feels is an alien species and needs an education in Bharat Parv, then its methodology of hammering home truths is grossly and crudely misplaced. And at best ends up as an egoistic assumption of what a dialogue should be like — more and more force-feeding, treating questions like malignant spyware and blaming all of the nation’s problems to either Pakistan or Bangladesh. How else does one explain the distasteful transgressions of the BJP candidate for the Delhi polls Kapil Mishra and Bengal BJP in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya? The former, clearly defying the party diktat to dispel fears on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), likened civil protest spots, like Shaheen Bagh, to mini-Pakistan. He even called the Delhi polls an Indo-Pakistan match, clearly implying Hindutva as India and lumping all sorts of otherness into one disposable basket. The Election Commission, which had overlooked incendiary remarks during the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls last year, has thankfully issued a notice and the Delhi police has lodged an FIR against him. Vijayvargiya, who is to drive the party’s campaign in Bengal, has found out a simpler method of identifying infiltrators that does not need documents at all. He feels people eating flattened rice or chidwa are confirmed Bangladeshis, totally ignoring the fact that all Bengalis have this as a staple snack or that poha is a breakfast favourite even in his home State, Madhya Pradesh. At least, he seems to have dispelled the need to go for an elaborate process of compiling and sorting out the National Population Register (NPR). The point is such racist, misogynist and uncouth statements are not even funny any more. They are dangerously serious considering that they are given legitimacy, either because the party’s top leadership stays silent or because fringe leaders of the Sangh, who were once kept under wraps by the old BJP, have been coopted and rewarded in proportion to their success in disseminating a divisive agenda. What else could explain how even a seasoned senior leader from the old school like Prakash Javadekar had to reduce the Delhi electoral battle to the binaries of who is more committed to Indianness and who is a traitor. He labelled the fight as one between “Bharat Mata ki Jai” and “Jinnah wali azaadi.” One can understand that the BJP has nothing to show as a record of its performance unlike its key opponent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Can that, therefore, justify this dog-whistling politics? BJP leaders know that their party cannot match the hyper-localised agenda of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and are, therefore, countering that with an umbrella issue that can generate a swell of emotion, which in the current scenario of identity politics, happens to be the most virulent strain of nationalism. Having been out of power in the city for almost 20 years, most of which had seen high-performing regimes, the BJP can no more claim to champion anything revolutionary. Even its war room expert and Home Minister Amit Shah has not picked up any issues except pledging Rs 1 lakh crore for bolstering infrastructure in the recently regularised colonies. And now that AAP deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has also publicly extended support to the women protesting citizenship laws at Shaheen Bagh, the BJP feels it has drawn out its opponent to an arena where civic issues become somewhat national.

What is frightening though is that in the process, the BJP is dictating the zeitgeist of contemporary politics. Worse, it is changing the DNA of political discourse with a mythologised sanctity of India’s greatness that has been eaten away by all kinds of imposed viruses until the party rescued it. There was a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself reined in party motormouths and had advised them to stay away from media platforms. Now that same man is either painfully silent or sometimes guilty of playing to the gallery. Anyway, his restraint was just in the nature of an advisory and the fact that someone like Pragya Thakur is now a bonafide MP or that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is allowed a free run with his religion-specific remarks, proves that they not only have the blessings of higher-ups but are deployed as their prize arrowheads. If the Modi of 2014 was about the ABCs of development, he himself has been rather brazen if his comments of green versus pink revolution (against meat-eaters) and kabristan versus shamshan ghat are any indications. So clearly, toxicity was not just limited to campaign rhetoric. And 2014 was just a stepping stone to get a hold of national consciousness in 2019. Now that the BJP has that at its command, it wants to replicate the Sangh’s vision as a voluntary national will that has nothing to do with science, reason, history or culture. With a new obsession on whom we need to be as Indians, issues like the economy can be easily swept under the carpet or become a secondary concern. The saddest part is that this does great disservice to Hinduism and the tenets of an Indic civilisation.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/toxic-war-of-words-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/toxic-war-of-words.html
2,27-1-20,Roger that,"With his fightback at Australia Open, Federer is the first singles player to win 100 matches in two Grand Slams

Roger Federer is not just a sporting legend. He is a human story and an inspiration for everybody because he has demonstrated true grit that survival requires in our times, surprising us every time when we feel he has just gone over the hill. And at a time when individual power sports is all about burnouts, Federer has crafted lastability as a credo despite the competition and overcome challenge from millennials. He has produced several great performances over the years. One of those performances came in the match against Australia’s John Millman during the third at the Australian Open 2020 on Friday where the former world number one was looking down and out in the fifth-set super tie-breaker after falling behind with the score of 8-4. However, he showed why he has won 20 Grand Slams in his career by picking up six consecutive points and cementing his spot in the fourth-round at the first Grand Slam of the year. And he did it in a thrilling match that began Friday night in Melbourne and ended after midnight Saturday. Who cares if he is 38 years old when he keeps finding new ways to redefine his greatness?

Unlike other tournaments — such as Wimbledon and the US Open, which play first-to-seven in a tiebreaker — the Australian Open has a first-to-10 format, and Federer fell behind 8-4 early on. So imagine the kind of rallying he had to do with six straight points to win the tiebreaker and the third-round match, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10-8). With this, he has also become the first singles player to win 100 matches in two different Grand Slams; his Wimbledon 100 happened last year. In his post-match interview, Federer joked that when Millman had that huge lead in the tiebreaker and was two points away from taking the match, he was already preparing himself to offer excuses during his press conference for why he lost. Now we know how he didn’t let his doubts get the better of him. So tennis can still be an old man’s game. Just like life itself.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/roger-that-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/roger-that.html
3,27-1-20,Listen to the teenage zealot,"One does not have to buy into Greta Thunberg’s apocalyptic angst to see that something has to be done on climate change. Changing to a cleaner energy future is a good thing in itself

An unfamiliar white patina covered our lawn recently, something seldom seen any longer, certainly not here in the South: A frost. For the first time this year, I considered digging out my heavy coat from the depths of the cupboard but it wasn’t really cold enough.

Where have our winters gone? I miss them. No doubt having written those words, the country will freeze for the next month but there is no sign of anything remotely wintry in the long-term forecast anywhere in the country, not just in London. It is hard to recall an old-fashioned winter where it would snow at least two or three times between December and April.

This mild pattern is noticeable across the entire European continent and has been for some time now. In Moscow, the authorities sprayed fake snow around the city centre over the New Year to give the residents a sense of the season. The temperature in the Russian capital last week was 4oCelsius; usually it is -10oCelsius or lower.

I remember visiting Moscow in late January and it was -25oCelsius, with the River Moscva frozen so solid you could drive across it. They used to call it General Winter — weather so ghastly that it was an integral part of Russia’s defences, repelling Napoleon and Hitler, among others. Now it’s not even Lance-Corporal Slightly Chilly.

All the great eastern and central European cities — Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna and St Petersburg — are exceptionally mild, though winter could yet have a sting in the tail. The so-called Beast from the East that arrived late in the season a few years ago temporarily shocked us out of our complacency but it was relatively short-lived and not that exceptional in any case.

Mild Januaries are now the norm. We have a lovely old wooden toboggan that has hardly been put to use since the 1980s, which is the last time I can remember a succession of cold winters. Growing up in Kent in the 1960s and 1970s, heavy frosts and blizzards were an annual occurrence. Not now.

I am reluctant to attribute what might prove to be temporary weather glitches to long-term climate change but there is clearly something going on that cannot be ignored. We don’t have to buy into the apocalyptic angst of Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, on show again in Davos last week, to recognise that something has to be done.

Whether or not you are a sceptic about the impact of carbon dioxide on the climate or question man’s involvement in producing the greenhouse gas, our energy future is a non-carbon one, like it or not. Virtually every Government across the world has committed to this as an overt aspect of public policy and those that haven’t, like China or the US, have a rapidly growing green energy sector poised to exploit the move to a carbon-free future.

If US President Donald Trump wants to be remembered for anything other than being impeached, he would throw his weight behind it because it is happening anyway, even in his own backyard. American greenhouse gas emissions are falling despite his commitment to fossil fuels.

Perhaps Trump would be persuadable if he were to recognise there is a hard-headed economic imperative here. He should listen to someone like Marco Alvera, an oil and gas CEO who understands what is going on and has ideas to address it.

At a conference in Venice at the weekend, he said we should commit to the one clean energy source that is plentiful, easy to transport and getting cheaper to produce. It is all around us, does not have to be drilled out of the ground in parts of the world favoured with the right geology and does not pollute the atmosphere. It is hydrogen, the most widespread element in the universe. Like many businesses reliant upon carbon-based energy, Alvera’s Italian energy infrastructure company, Snam, has no long-term future unless it adapts because its pipelines, compressors and storage tanks will be useless as oil and gas come under pressure from state actors around the world. They can be used for hydrogen instead.

However, this is more than just a commercial calculation. Alvera has published a book compellingly setting out the case for Governments, manufacturers and investors to get behind hydrogen now before they head off down other less-promising blind alleys.

Hydrogen can be burned to drive a turbine, can be piped into homes for boilers, cookers and air conditioners and converted into electricity using a fuel cell to power a car or a lorry. Unlike wind and solar power, it is easily

stored and can generate the intense heat needed by industrial processes including manufacturing steel and cement. The only waste product is water.

True, there is nothing new about the concept. Fuel cells were developed in the mid-19th century and some buses were running on hydrogen in Germany and Britain in the 1930s. There are cars today that have been converted to hydrogen but they are expensive and there is no infrastructure to support them. Manufacturers like Toyota are developing hydrogen cars with their Mirai range but few others are following suit. They should.

In the past, hydrogen has been too expensive relative to fossil fuels but that will change as new taxes are loaded onto coal and gas to meet carbon dioxide targets and the cost of renewable energy continues to fall. No one pretends the transition will be straightforward but if there’s widespread adoption of the technology and the necessary infrastructure, it will become increasingly affordable.

This is a reasoned, not a hysterical, approach. Alvera likes to adapt the argument known as Pascal’s wager to our climate change conundrum. The 17th century French philosopher and mathematician asked what we should do if we had to bet our lives on the existence of God. Pascal posited that the rational response was to behave as though he did exist because we have nothing much to lose if it turns out that he doesn’t but risk eternal damnation if he does.

Climate change is the same. If Greta is right then the consequences of doing nothing are calamitous. But if she is wrong, changing to a cleaner energy future is a good thing in itself and can even generate growth and prosperity. You do not have to be a teenage zealot to see sense in that.

4,27-1-20,Endless protests and their fallout,"For any protest to last beyond a small fraction of sustainable time, it needs the support of sponsors. The challenge is in keeping it free from vested interests

There’s a feeling of disquiet among segments of the cross section of a news-aware people across the country. They consume news either in print or television, which is dominated by private players. This has led to a situation where financiers view their broadcasting channel to be a surrogate of their own political, social and economic inclinations. This is a fact of life that is seldom flagged. By and large, the so-called public is unaware of the political slant of the promoters and protectors of the medium who carry the news. Hence, the distinction between facts, comments and commentary often becomes dubious. Comments parade as facts and commentary often becomes the explanation thereof. This makes the job of the reader — to understand what is actually happening — even more complex. The result is that rabble-rousing often gets mistaken for a vibrant democracy.

The current atmosphere of agitations for and against an issue has raised some fundamental questions. One of them is: How significant are street protests as a counterfoil of a dominant majority of parliamentarians, who in their wisdom, took a decision on a given topic? It is generally assumed that given the total voting population of the country, a parliamentarian represents approximately 16 to 17 lakh voters. No single demonstration ever approximates that number. What makes a demonstration great is the media coverage it receives and how for hours, certain shots can be repeated over and over again. That some people get animated and get prone to posture in an excitable manner is no secret. Thus, it is that process give a slant to a situation represented by a selection of facts. Repetition of this approach across more than one forum serves as a drumming up. It goes far beyond the wildest dreams of the sponsors of that limited agitation on the crossroads.

Brigades of two types of professionals then descend upon the location. On January 23, an aspiring leader-to-be descended with a mike on the crowd of protesters in Shaheen Bagh to encourage them. He promised that he would create 500 or better still, 5,000 more Shaheen Baghs across the country. The same day, while delivering a memorial lecture, a now retired VVVIP lauded the very act of protest as something very encouraging. Whether it is encouraging or not is another matter. The bald truth remains that it raised several unanswered questions. For instance, protest is a desirable process in a democracy but the concurrent question is: What form should it take? How should the theme be chosen? What is the mode of protest? Is it disrupting the life of an average citizen, who is interested in nothing more than leading a normal, quiet and ordinary life? The questions are numerous but answers are few. At the end of the day, any protest that has to last beyond a small fraction of sustainable time needs the support of sponsors. Somebody has to promote it and that person would not do so without a vested interest.

Across world history, from Paris Commune to Bolshevik Revolution, lessons are easy to identify. The Paris Commune collapsed when organised sponsorship withdrew. Perhaps, there would have been no Bolshevik Revolution if the Germans had not smuggled Lennon into Czarist Russia. In such circumstances, serenading protest for the sake it, especially by the young and distinguished professionals, who have no track record of having participated in a significant populist protest movement, can only be pandering to the gallery. Such episodes cannot be overlooked because they tend to feed upon themselves, get drummed up and projected. The ultimate spread effect cannot be a gain to anyone or any process. There are innumerable cases where protest movements have fizzled out because of the absence of a sustainable agenda. That, too, would be a tragedy because protests or any process should be an input to be more robust. The danger of throwing the baby in the bath water is too risky to sustain or even consider. It would have made sense if some leader of standing, credibility and past records made a headline by pointing out how protests can get out of hand.

Besides, there are ripple effects, too. Reports have it that a lady enumerator of a certain, totally a political social intervention, while dealing with a community of people of her own faith in Kota, was summoned back to the colony after she collected data of names and addresses. She was threatened not to use them. This kind of contagion is highly infectious. A little later, hundreds of miles away from Kota, a programme run in the aid of internet awareness by Google India and Tata Trust got into foul weather. The reason was that enumerators were asking for the names and addresses of the trainees. The upshot was that the programme, at the end of December 2019, was halted in all the five districts of West Bengal because the trainers faced trouble. Is this right?

5,27-1-20,Students of a feather,"What makes a university campus Left wing or Right wing? Fact is, both try to mould the ideological orientation of the students. They are actually endangering the whole idea of free speech and critical thinking

Across India, protests have erupted against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that was enacted in December last year. Even though the law is widely being deemed “anti-Muslim”, many non-Muslim Indians, too, have participated in the protests. They see the law — passed by the Right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government — as an attack on the country’s Constitutional secularism, first established in 1950.

At the centre of the protests are thousands of university and college students. One of the most active campuses in this respect has been Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). On January 5 this year, at least 40 JNU students were admitted to the hospital with injuries. According to a January 6 report by the BBC, masked men and at least one woman, allegedly belonging to the student wings of Hindu nationalist parties, attacked students of the JNU and vandalised university property.

For decades, JNU has been one of India’s most politicised campuses. It is often described as a hot-bed of radical Left-wing politics. According to a study of politics in JNU, published in the March 2018 edition of Economic and Political Weekly, Jean-Thomas Martelli and Khlaiq Parkar wrote that on 33 occasions, radical Left-wing student outfits have won JNU’s student union elections.

Even though the student wings of the BJP and the paramilitary Hindu nationalist organisation the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are also active there, only once have they won the presidential post in the university’s union.

The university’s union has remained in the hands of Left-wing student groups and alliances due to what Martelli and Parkar say is JNU’s “dominant anti-establishment discourse.”

The BJP and RSS student wings have lamented that anti-Left politics is suppressed at the university. There are also, of course, universities and colleges in India where Right-wing student outfits are dominant and Left-wing student groups accuse them of repression.

So what makes a university campus Left wing or Right wing? Recently, in the US, conservative think-tanks, academics and student outfits accused their Left-wing counterparts of blatantly repressing free speech by disallowing conservative groups to operate on various campuses. They accused “radical” Left-wing professors of “indoctrinating” students in the name of liberalism and socialism, while, in fact, turning them into “Left-wing fascists.”

Such allegations are not entirely unfounded. In their 2005 essay for a journal called The Forum, researchers Stanley Rothman, S Robert Lichter and Neil Nevetti wrote that Left-wing “ideologically-based discrimination in academic advancement deserves serious consideration.” Even many “moderate” commentators in the US have not hesitated in pointing out the proliferation of “political correctness”, purportedly formulated on “Left-leaning” US campuses as the reason behind the off-campus “backlash” that eventually put Donald Trump in the White House.

But again, what makes a campus Left or Right wing? In February 2017, the American journalist Scott Jaschik (in an essay for Inside Higher Ed) analysed four studies conducted between 2007 and 2016. The studies concluded that faculty members of most American universities leaned Left. Professors thus play a major role in shaping the students’ ideological orientation and biases.

I shall briefly discuss cases of some specific universities to elaborate this. Locally, between the early 1960s and 1970s, the Karachi University (KU) was seen as a vibrant bastion of diverse student political activity. But a former founder of the erstwhile Pakistani Left-wing student outfit, the National Students Federation (NSF), Husain Naqi, and another NSF luminary, the late Meraj Muhammad Khan often accused the university’s Vice Chancellor — from 1961 till 1971 — Dr Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi, of siding with Right-wing student groups to curb NSF’s electoral influence in KU.

Naqi told The News International in June 2007 that NSF was popular among KU’s students but Qureshi went the extra mile to change this. Therefore, by 1970, KU’s student union had been won by the Right-wing Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) and NSF broke into various factions.

In 1968, KU had been active during the largely Left-wing movement against the Ayub Khan regime. But in 1977, it went the other way by becoming the epicentre of a Right-wing movement against the “socialist” ZA Bhutto Government. Of course, there is more to this than just a faculty turning Right and influencing the students but after 1977, it became tough for Left-wing groups to operate at KU without being harassed. The results were tragic. Another example in this context is of Tehran University. In his book, Democracy in Iran, the sociologist Misagh Parsa wrote that between the 1950s and 1979, student politics in almost all major campuses in Iran, especially the Tehran University, was a mixture of Left and Right groups.

Most of these groups were opposed to the Iranian monarchy. According to Parsa, after the monarchy was toppled in 1979, the Iranian clergy, under Ayatollah Khomeini, attempted to oust its former anti-monarchy allies on the Left. Protests against many of Khomeini’s prescribed “Islamic laws” erupted at the Tehran University.

In June 1980, Khomeini ordered a “cultural revolution” to eliminate all “Western,” “anti-Islam” and Leftist influences from Iran’s universities. Leftist students were physically attacked by pro-Khomeini groups and faculty members suspected of being Leftists or liberal were expelled, replaced by teachers and professors sympathetic to Khomeini.

Commentators perturbed by the Left-Right “cultural wars” that have erupted on US campuses have insisted that when faculty members — both on the Right and the Left — try to mould the ideological orientation of the students, they are actually endangering the whole idea of free speech and critical thinking.

They are blocking young minds from intellectually engaging with those who may hold different opinions. That’s why the young Indian Hindu nationalists from “Right-wing campuses” decided to use iron rods to engage with their left counterparts at JNU. And that’s why, in November last year, Left-wing students at California’s Berkeley University went on a rampage and refused to allow a speaker from the other side of the ideological divide to speak at the university. The casualties in both cases were free speech and basic democratic norms.

6,27-1-20,People fail in general knowledge on nationalism,"Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was a “brave army general”, Khalli is the Iron Man of India, there is a toss-up between Shreya Ghosal and Neha Kakkar for the title of Nightingale of India, the slogans Vande Mataram and Jai Hind were first coined by Amit Shah and Dilip Ghosh…And not the least January 26 is famous because India defeated Pakistan on this very day.

Your correspondent hit upon many more “inspiring” instances of national awareness and beat a hasty retreat after sampling the “nationalistic fervor” among the fellow citizens on the 71st RepublicDay.

Regardless of the love and respect Bose commands among the people of Kolkata Arya Sundar Saha, a staunch campaigner of Citizenship Amendment Act, said Netaji was a “brave Army General led the freedom fighters to victory against the British.”

Bipra Basu an architect and a proud owner of a swanky SUV craned out his neck of the driver’s window to inform that Netaji was the “Father of the Nation” and also the “first Prime Minister of India,” before rolling up the window and driving away nonchalantly.

At Howrah Station Krishnamohan Tewari a busy businessman from Patna broods for a while before dropping his reply and rushing away to catch his train. “Netaji was the founder of the Congress party,” he said.

Cut to Elgin Road, near the house of the icon freedom fighter from where he fled in disguise to Germany. “Netaji was the founder of Jan Sangh,” Dilip Agarwal said, adding Syama Prasad Mukherjee was his “close associate.”

When asked about the importance of January 23 (Bose’s birthday) half of the respondents said it was the day when the national hero died.

At the busy Red Road where thousands of people had gathered to watch the Republic Day march past an MLA said the day was celebrated because “India was declared Independent on this auspicious day.” When told that it was the day when the Constitution of India was adopted the politician said what he said was a “slip of tongue.”

Akash Khurana working with the prestigious Information Technology sector who had come to watch the Republic Day parade said Shreya Ghosal was considered the Nightingale of India only to be instantly corrected by a colleague Tejas Kishore who said “it was in fact Neha Kakkar and not Ghosal. “History to be told Sorijini Naidu is called the Nightingale of India for her poetic brilliance.

The duo even ridiculed the “media wallas” for spreading false information about Citizenship Amendment Act which they said was aimed at providing citizenship to all the Indians.

Busy watching India-New Zealand tie on the mobile phone, Rohan Bhai Shah identified Khalli as the Iron Man of India. But when told that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the right answer he corrected himself saying, “Yes! Yes! now I remember. I saw his stature in Gujarat. He is the founder of the RSS.”

Smriti Biswas a college student loitering about with her boyfriend in the precincts of Victoria Memorial said the term Vande Mataram was coined by Home Minister Amit Shah. When reminded that the term is found for the first time in Anand Math of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay she shrugged dispassionately saying “may be!”

When asked as to who coined the term Jai Hind, Abdul Qader a builder said the term was the creation of Dilip Ghosh the State BJP president. The term was however introduced for the first time by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during the training of the Indian National Army.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/people-fail-in-general-knowledge-on-nationalism.html

8,27-1-20,"Mamata, Governor Dhankhar break ice","In what the critics called signs of improvement of relations between Nabanna (State secretariat) and the Raj Bhavan Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday greeted each other at the Republic Day Parade at the historic Red Road and joined a tea party as a part of the day’s celebrations.

The Sunday’s development was a sharp departure from what the State had been witnessing for the past 4-5 months with the two dignitaries attacking each other for showing mutual disrespect.

The day started with the Governor hoisting the tri-colour and the Chief Minister remaining present at the programme. Even as the two leaders exchanged greetings the Governor invited Banerjee to a tea party at the Raj Bhavan which the Chief Minister promptly accepted, sources said.

In late noon the Chief Minister visited the Governor’s House where leaders of other parties too were present. The two leaders spoke to each

other for sometime on a number of issues and “the exchanges were cordial,” a Government source said.

The Chief Minister who earlier tweeted “On Republic Day, let us pledge to protect our Constitution and uphold the principles of sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, as enshrined in the Preamble,” said she was happy to join the programme.

Banerjee had been critical of the Governor ever since he personally ignored the Home Department’s advisory and personally went to Jadavpur University in September to rescue Union Minister Babul Supriyo who was gheraoed by the students of the university.

She also attacked him for allegedly trying to run a parallel Government in the State whereas the Governor accused her of not paying adequate respect to him.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata--governor-dhankhar-break-ice.html

Indian and Pakistani troops usually exchange sweets and greetings on their important national days and festivals. But the tradition has not been followed for the past few years due to Pakistan’s continued support to terrorism in the Union Territory and frequent ceasefire violations, the officials said.

They said there was no exchange of sweets and greetings on Republic day this year as well.

On January 10, Pakistan’s Border Action Team comprising regulars and terrorists, beheaded army porter Mohammad Aslam (28) and injured three others in an attack along the LoC in Gulpur sector of Poonch district.

10,27-1-20,"Tania Shergill, all-women CRPF motorcycle team give many girls goosebumps","Captain Tania Shergill, who led an all-men contingent at the Republic Day parade on Sunday, gave many girls goosebumps in the huge crowd at Rajpath.

The all-women motorcycle team of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) also won hearts with their daredevilry and many young women felt pumped up and inspired after watching them. Gill and the CRPF team, among others represented the ‘Nari Shakti’ at the ceremonial event, and the charm

literally rubbed off on to many in the crowd.

Aarushi Goyal, 16, a class 12 student of the Delhi Public School, Indirapuram, said, she had “found her idol” in Capt Sher Gill, a fourth generation Army officer, who led the marching contingent of the Corps of Signals.

Wearing a khaki uniform and holding a ceremonial sword, as the 26-year-old trailblazer officer of the Corps of Signals marched down the Rajpath, she was the cynosure of all eyes.

“The sight of her (Gill) leading the men, as she strode confidently, gave me goosebumps. I stood up, closed my eyes and held my breath...It was kind of surreal for me,” Goyal said,

adding that “from kitchen work to armed forces, women have come a long way”.

The Hoshiarpur-born officer had recently created history by becoming the first woman Parade Adjutant to lead an all-men contingents during the Army Day function on January 15. A graduate of the Officers Training Academy (OTA), Chennai, she added another feather to her cap on Sunday, saying, it was a feeling of “immense honour and great pride, a sense of achievement and worthiness, and absolute blessing”.

The CRPF team too drew loud applause and stunned looks from the crowd, as its members performed dardevil stunts on Rajpath. Diksha Chaudhary, 19, in the crowd, stood atop her chair, clapped and whistled when the all-women team zipped down the Rajpath in astonishing display of courage.

As women personnel formed human pyramid on Royal Enfield motorcycles, Chaudhary, shouted “Jai Hind”, saluted the soldiers and murmured to her friend, “Yaar ye karna hai ha ( I wish to do this).” “I am so moved and inspired...I am preparing for exams to join Haryana Police, but this has changed my mind. I will join CRPF now,” said Chaudhary, who herself has driven a motorcycle to Delhi.

Mahima Chug, 16, captured the moments in her camera as the team displayed its gravity-defying acrobatic skills on Bullet motorcycles towards the end of the ceremonial parade. Chug, a vice-captain in a Noida-based private school, said, “I will paste the photos I have taken today on the walls of my room and draw inspiration from them. There’s nothing women cannot do.”

The team was led by Inspector Seema Nag, who performed the ‘VIP Salute’ standing atop a moving motorcycle. Other members performed ‘Pistol Position on Move’, ‘Rifle positions’, CRPG Flag March’, ‘All Round Defence’, ‘Beam Roll’, Ladder Climbing’ and ‘Human Pyramid’.

11,27-1-20,PM appeals for peaceful solution to resolve crisis,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said violence and weapon are not at all solutions and peace and brotherhood should prevail citing the series of peace talks in the North Eastern region. Citing steep decline in insurgency in various parts of North East, Modi appealed that people should have faith in the country and must shed violence. He was addressing through the monthly radio programme — ‘Mann ki Baat’.

""I appeal to everyone who is using violence and weapons to solve issues in any part of the country to return to peace and they should have faith that all their concerns will be addressed and they should have faith in the country,"" PM said.

Modi said that in the festive atmosphere of Bihu, Pongal, Lohri and Uttarayan, many might not have noticed that Delhi witnessed an historic event in which an agreement was signed to end the Bru-Reang refugee crisis. ""With it, the close-to-25-year-old Bru-Reang refugee crisis, a painful chapter, was closed for ever and ever."" He spoke in detail about the crisis. The problem dated back to 1997 when the Bru community fled from Mizoram owing to ethnic tensions. They lived in camps in Kanchanpur in north Tirpura.

In his message for peace, Modi said that there is no place in the world where peace has been achieved through violence. ""Have you heard of any place where violence has managed to solve differences? Have you heard of any place where peace and brotherhood have become a cause of concern? Violence can never solve any problem,"" Modi said.

Modi said that there is a growing sentiment in the country among people that they can also contribute towards nation building and the sentiment of 'can do' is fast growing into a mass movement in the country.

PM said that the radio programme had become reflection of new Bharat and many issues that have been discussed in the programme have taken shape of a mass movement in the country. Talking about the various issues that have been discussed in the programme that have taken shape of a movement because of public involvement were selfie with daughter, use of Khadi, clean India campaign, digital economy, and fit India campaign.

12,27-1-20,Vardhan now writes to CMs on change in laws against leprosy patients,"The Union Health Ministry’s appeal to the Law and Social and Justice and Empowerment Ministries seeking amendment in over 100 discriminatory laws against persons affected by leprosy more than six months ago is yet to see the light of the day.

Though the disease is now fully curable by Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT), there still exist 108 discriminatorys laws against persons affected by leprosy including 3 Union and 105 State laws.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had in August last year written to his counterparts Ravishankar Prasad and Thawwarchand Gehlot, Ministers for Law and Social Justice and Empowerment respectively to look into the matter. India has more than half the world's leprosy cases. After claims that it was ‘eliminated’ in 2005, leprosy, also known as The Hansen's disease is making a comeback. India still has over 800 leprosy colonies, where people live even after they have been cured.

Dr Harshvardhan had also written to the Chief Ministers of various States requesting them to direct the concerned departments/ officers to work for the amendments of the existing discriminatory legislations against the community.

Sources in the Union Law and Social Justice Ministries said that the matter is under consideration.

Dr. Vineeta Shanker, Executive Director, Sasakawa-India Leprosy Foundation (S-ILF) said: ""Leprosy is a disease that which is entirely curable and among the least infectious of diseases. People need awareness and education about leprosy - that it is a bacterial disease which is easily treated with a simple regimen of antibiotics.”

""It is indeed sad that there are 108 discriminatory laws against Leprosy patients in India. I urge the Central

and State Governments to annul these laws which will help reduce stigma and ensure equal rights and

treatment to those affected by leprosy.”

""Repeal of these discriminatory laws will help convince people that there is no need to fear and exclude those who have had leprosy. Ending stigma will help them regain their dignity and self-esteem,"" she added.

Weighing in on the existing discriminatory laws against the community, Yohei Sasakawa, WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination said on the World Leprosy Day on January 26, 2020, ""We have not only to fight the disease, but also the prejudice and discrimination that have infected society.""

Alice Cruz, UN Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members too lamented that ""Stigmatization remains institutionalized in the States' architecture and functioning: more than 50 countries in

the world keep hundreds of discriminatory laws against leprosy-affected people. Discriminatory practices at the States' administration endure.""

Brazil, Indonesia and India combine to account for 80 percent of the nearly 210,000 new cases of leprosy reported in 2018.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/vardhan-now-writes-to-cms-on-change-in-laws-against-leprosy-patients.html
13,27-1-20,"Delhi will vote for BJP on Feb 8, says Tiwari","With the political parties going all out to woo voters in the high voltage Delhi Assembly elections, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Manoj Tiwari took out a massive roadshow in support of Ghonda Assembly constituency BJP candidate Ajay Mahawar.

Appealing to the public to make BJP victorious in the upcoming Assembly elections, the star campaigners raised slogans in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and then toured the area in roadshow. Delhi BJP leaders, District and Mandal office bearers, Councilors along with thousands of BJP supporters and local citizens participated in the roadshow.

""The time has come when the Delhi will vote for BJP on February 8 to make it victorious. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narender Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, many positive changes have taken place due to which development works have been completed. BJP is reaching out to every house with the message Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwash and ensuring that the benefits of the Central Government schemes reached to the poorest person. BJP pledges to change Delhi after changing the country,"" said Manoj Tiwari.

Tiwari further claimed that the AAP Government has failed to improve public facilities in the national Capital. Though Arvind Kejriwal failed to do anything, he issued advertisements of crores not only in Delhi but in other states to buttress his claim. Even the Congress Party tried to mislead the people and its leaders are busy supporting the people who are protesting against CAA and creating an atmosphere of anarchy. Whenever BJP has tried to solve the problems of Delhi, AAP played dirty politics and now Kejriwal Government will have to pay for it. The way Congress and AAP playing dirty politics of appeasement, they will be defeated in this election too. They should not forget how they were rejected by the people municipal corporation and Loksabha Elections, Tiwari added.

Besides, Tiwari also held a Twitter Chaupal on Sunday in the Greater Kailash Assembly in a get together with the people of constituency.

Talking and replying to the people, Tiwari said, 'Bhajapa Dil Mein, Bhajapa Dilli Mein'. People are now bored by the dramas of Kejriwal.

""For the last five years, Kejriwal used to accuse the Centre every morning and when he failed to attract the attention of the people, he sat on 'Dharna' at Lieutenant Governor (LG) house. But all these tactics of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government have failed because the people have completely rejected him. The people of Delhi are ready to support BJP with the slogan Bahut Ho Gaya Dilli Ka Nuksaan, Ab Bhajapa Karegi Iska Samadhan,"" said Tiwari.

Replying to the questions on Twitter, Delhi BJP Chief said, ""No one can win elections only on publicity. The party which solves the problems of the people will win the elections and BJP has solved the problems of the people and as a result BJP will get majority in Delhi Assembly Elections. Kejriwal spent crores on advertisements for his self promotion but did not do anything to curb pollution in Delhi.""

Appealing to the people of Greater Kalish Assembly seat to vote for BJP, he said, ""After coming to power, BJP will install 60 smog towers to curb pollution in Delhi. The cost of these smog towers is not very high. AAP only believes in making promises and when the time comes for fulfilling them then it makes more new promises. BJP is such a party which works for good governance and to win the trust of the people.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-will-vote-for-bjp-on-feb-8--says-tiwari.html
14,27-1-20,It’s AAP vs BJP in Mehrauli,"Voters of South Delhi's Mehrauli Assembly seat, surrounded by villages and posh localities, gave mixed responses for Delhi Assembly election slated for February 8. The residents of constituency, which covers half of Saket, Mehrauli, Kishan Garh and Vasant Kunj localities were impressed with Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) developmental works especially water supply in their areas. The constituency which has most of the urban areas and some villages is a fight between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP candidates. Though due to works done by the AAP candidate is a clear advantage to him in this election.

The AAP has once again fielded Naresh Yadav, a sitting MLA whereas BJP has fielded Kusum Khatri and Congress has brought Mohinder Choudhary, a Jat candidate to contest election in Mehrauli constituency.

Focusing his work on the lower-income groups, Yadav, a local from Rajokri village has a good vote bank of urban areas, JJ clusters and his village whereas Khatri, a Jat candidate have support of several villages including Lado Sarai, Kishan Garh, Masoodpur which have Jat population. The disadvantage to Congress and BJP is split of rural votes as both the candidates belong to Jat community.

As many as 1,13,366 are expected to exercise their voting rights from the Mehrauli constituency in the upcoming Assembly elections on February 8.There are around16 per cent of Dalit voters and 25000 Muslim voters in the area. From 1993 to 2003, the segment which covers half of Saket, Mehrauli, Kishan Garh and Vasant Kunj localities, was a BJP bastion under former MLA Braham Singh Tanvar, a Gujjar by caste. In 2003, the constituency was taken over by the Congress for another six years following which the BJP's Pravesh Verma reinstated the BJP in the segment in 2013. Now, Naresh Yadav has been representing the AAP since 2015.

""Yadav has done works in the area especially 500 water connections in the houses. Sanitation has been improved in the area and the most important, CCTVs has been installed in the area,"" said Rajesh Arora, a resident in ward no-8, Mehrauli.

""Our ward will vote for AAP again as they have solved most of the issues in the constituency and we hope there will be more development works if Yadav wins again. Our MLA was visible in the area,"" said Sunita, a resident of ward-8 Mehrauli.

Whereas, there was support for AAP in few wards in the areas some residents alleged that there are still bumpy roads and some open sewers which are inviting untoward incident anytime.

The posh Vasant Kunj, which comes in Mehrauli constituency, has a mixed population, housing government employees and including many non-residents of Delhi.

""We will vote for Arvind Kejriwal due to his work on education and health services. Though a lot of development work which includes potholes on roads, leaking sewers, water logging is yet to be done in our constituency but we hope that AAP will resolve our pending issues in their next term,"" said Amresh Khanna, a resident of Vasant Kunj area.

Meanwhile in rural areas which come under the Mehrauli constituency, the votes are divided between Khatri and Chaudhary as most of the villages are Jat dominated and this clearly gives advantage to Yadav.

""Villagers always see the candidate and now it is a Jat who is contesting from BJP, so our vote will go for Khatri,"" said Dharamraj, a resident of Massodpur village.

Meanwhile, in Mehrauli, the villagers said that the votes will go for Chaudhary as he will develop Mehrauli village which is being neglected by every government when it comes on development in the area.

Congress candidate, Chaudhary who is a resident of Mehrauli village said that Yadav was not visible in the area and people don't know even his face.

""There is shortage of water in the area as water comes on weekly basis and Yadav has not even built a school or college in the area. The roads are broken and there are no street lights in several areas. Nothing has been done for the welfare for residents. There are still lots of work to be done in the area,"" alleged Chaudhary.

Meanwhile, Kusum Khatri alleged that AAP MLA Yadav was not visible in the area and has done nothing in Rajokri, Mehrauli and Kishan Garh areas to resolve resident issues. Khatri also alleged that Chaudhary is a gujjar by caste and to lure Jat votes, which are 30 percent in the area, he presents himself as Jat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/it---s-aap-vs-bjp-in-mehrauli.html

The party workers are also visiting door to door in support of party candidate and making people aware of the development works being done by the AAP Government in last five year.

17,27-1-20,‘CAA is BJP move to influence polls’,"The brains behind the successful implementation of free coaching under Jai Bheem Mukhyamantri Yojana and many other social welfare schemes of Delhi Government, Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam is contesting election for the second time from Seemapuri seat. Gautam spoke to The Pioneer’s Gayathri Mani on hosts of issues that AAP is banking upon to return to the power in Delhi.

Do you think Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) kept its promises with the youth that it had made in 2015 election manifesto?

Since day one, AAP has kept its promise and about 95 per cent of the promises made by party have been fulfilled. There are some promises which will be completed soon. More than 20,000 rooms have been constructed in public schools which are equal to 5,000 new schools, new engineering institute Netaji Shubhash Technical University has been opened, new education blocks have been opened in the already existing schools and faculties. There is a proposal to start 25 Skill Development Centre’s (SDC), seven are already functional.

What is your take on scholarships to poor students and free coaching to them?

Jai Bheen Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana, started for the Scheduled Caste (SC/ Scheduled Tribe (ST) students but has already been extended to all the students coming Economically Weaker Section. Another programme has been launched recently for the SC, ST students to study overseas in universities abroad. The online process to apply will take about six month to get completed, so we have started offline process so that more students can avail the facility.

What are the main issues in this election?

Pollution is biggest issue in Delhi. I believe, this issue should not be politicised. Pollution will be curbed, if everyone comes together because it is crucial matter which is affecting everyone be it a member of BJP, AAP and common man. Centre and Municipal Corporations is led by BJP and Delhi Government is with AAP, irrespective of one political agenda, we should come together to curb pollution in the national capital.

Seemapuri is underdeveloped area and crime is a major issue here? Do you think Delhi Police has been successful in maintaining law and order in your constituency?

First of all, it is not underdeveloped. All the colonies except few streets and slum clusters are developed and are authorised colonies. Sewer, electricity and water pipeline are laid down including slum areas and sewer lines has been laid wherever is possible. The biggest issues in my constituency are snatching, theft, pick pocketing and selling of narcotics. The area is situated in border and theft incident is increasing and our initiative of CCTV installation has helped to controlled many incidents. But the police have done nothing, I submitted many representations and met both DCP and LG but no action has been taken to curb criminal activities in the area.

What are the promises that you want to make to your voters?

My promise is to make my constituency free from traffic congestion, pedestrianisation and waterlogging issue will be addressed. In the last five years, the police have not done much to curb drug menace in the area. This time we will involve public and take their suggestions to curb such incidents. Adult education will be provided for the drop outs and seminar and counseling will be provided for youths to lead a good life and focus on education.

Do you think AAP Government has done enough than any other previous Government regarding social sectors especially reaching out to the weaker sections?

If you see, the developmental and infrastructure work done in the authorized colony in the last five year, no government has done such work and initiatives. About Rs 8,000 crore have been spent to lay road, sewer and water pipeline in the hundreds of un-authorised colonies. Free coaching under Jai Bheem, Free Bus ride, CCTV is a historic initiative brought by AAP. Sewer cleaning machines to curb manual scavenging and initiatives to clean septic tank by Delhi Jal Board is also in process. No Government can compete AAP in terms of development.

How do you see the demolition of the Sant Ravidas Temple? You blamed BJP why?

Because, the BJP hurts the sentiments of the people by demolishing the ancient temple. When we protested, it allowed 400 meter plot but why it first demolished the temple by hurting the sentiments of people? The opposition did it on purpose to create unrest in the society.

How will the party perform in SC/ reserved seats? You replaced one from Bawana.

The performance of the party will be good and the party will win all the seats. The candidate Jai Bhagwan Upkar who has been given ticket from area is also a strong candidate and has been a counselor. No leader is replaced without a reason; the party sees the work done, takes people suggestion, conducts survey and decides. I welcome the party’s decision and the party will perform well in all the reserved seats. Out of 70 seats, 68 plus is expected.

What is your opinion on NRC and CAA, because Home Minister Amit Shah said people who oppose it are Anti-Dalit?

First, the NRC and CAA is planned move by the BJP to imapct Jharkhand and Delhi elections but it is BJP which will be losing voters. They demolished Saint Ravidas temple. During the protest against the protest, dalits were beaten and arrested and yet they call others anti-dalit. PM Modi says there will be no NRC and Shah says NRC will be initiated. People are scared of NRC more than CAA. There is no need of NRC and CAA. The people who are protesting are Indians not outsiders. BJP wants to take away the right to vote of people, if NRC is amended then dalits, minorities and labour class will be largely affected as they do not have papers to prove their citizenship. About 80 per cent of the people do not have papers and they will be called as refugees and their fundamental rights will be taken, thus CAA and NRC are anti-constitutional acts which should not be amended. It is a tool to divide Hindus and Muslims. Why BJP always creates unrest in the country during elections?",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---caa-is-bjp-move-to-influence-polls---.html
18,27-1-20,Kejriwal accuses Shah of insulting people of Delhi,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah of insulting people of Delhi during his daily campaigning for the upcoming election.

Kejriwal said in the last five years, the people of Delhi have worked very hard to improve our city. ""Two Crore people of Delhi got together to fix our schools, hospitals, electricity and water supply. But Amit Shah comes daily and makes fun of the hard work of the people of Delhi in the last five years,"" he said.

While campaigning a few days back, Shah said there is no CCTV cameras were installed in Delhi, he said, adding that the next day people sent him a CCTV recording in which he was seen. ""How many cameras have you installed in Delhi? Not even one right? Instead of making fun of the people of Delhi, it would have been better if your central government had also installed some cameras in Delhi,"" he said.

Talking about the achievement of the AAP Government, he said ""Delhi’s Government schools had a pass percentage of 96 per cent this year. The parents of these children worked hard with the children staying awake all through the night. 65000 teachers of Delhi government worked hard on the children,"" he said.

""In the history of India, no state has ever had a pass percentage higher than 96 per cent in government schools. Other states of the country have results in the range of 40to 50 per cent. People of Delhi are proud of their children’s success,"" he added.

Referring the statement of Home Minister in which he said that the state of education in Delhi is very poor, he said ""When children and teachers saw this statement on TV, they felt very bad. Many parents came to me and said that they felt very bad when they heard your statement. What would have been good politics is if you had learned from the people of Delhi and improved the schools of UP and Haryana as well. Why go so far? You should fix the school of MCD first,"" he added.

Hitting out at Home Minister, the Chief Minister said ""Your people are saying that the people of Delhi are ‘bikau’ because Delhiites get free electricity, water, bus service, schools and hospitals. Due to the policies of your central government, there is so much inflation in the country. It has become difficult for a common man to survive. So if the government of Delhi made people’s electricity, water free to give them some respite from inflation, does it make the people of Delhi ‘bikau’? This is absolutely wrong.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kejriwal-accuses-shah-of-insulting-people-of-delhi.html

A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and Navin Sinha held that ""all the links in the chain of circumstances pointed to the guilt of the appellant alone"".

The man had alleged that five persons had entered his house in the intervening night of March 24 and 25, 2002 to abduct him and that his wife was shot dead by them when she resisted their attempt.

But he had failed to mention any reason for his ""attempted abduction"" or name any person who tried to abduct him, the apex court noted.

""If the intruders had come to abduct him and his wife had been shot dead after she tried to prevent his abduction, it would have been all the more convenient for the intruders to take him away with them.

No explanation has been furnished by him in this regard,"" the bench said.

The man was convicted by the trial court and the order was upheld by the high court. Thereafter, the convict had approached the Supreme Court.

The apex court further noted that the convict also could not provide any description of the intruders' physical features.

It said there were inconsistencies in the statements made by the convict before the police and the trial court.

""The appellant failed to furnish any plausible defence,"" the bench said, noting that he tried to give false evidence by first raising alleged ""extra-marital affairs"" of his wife and later stating that five intruders had broken into his house to abduct him. It said there was no evidence to prove that people had barged into the convict's house as there were no footprints in the muddy courtyard.

The court further noted that the convict did not mention any reason for his attempted abduction or name any person on the suspicion of enmity or otherwise. PTI

It also took into consideration the statements of his in-laws, who said the convict was very greedy, had demanded money from them and had also taken an LIC policy in his wife's name days before the incident.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-upholds-man-s-life-term-for-killing-wife-days-after-buying-insurance-policy-in-her-name.html

The police had given permission for the protest march on the occasion of the 71st Republic Day on the condition that no man will participate, an organising member claimed.

The protesters started from the Ajit Mill compound in Rakhiyal locality, the venue of the anti-citizenship law demonstrations since the last two weeks, and marched till Vir Abdul Hamid Chowk, a distance of around 2 kms, before returning to the starting point.

A total of six resolutions have been tabled by groups within the European Union (EU), including the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group.

They are set to be debated in the European Parliament in Brussels next Wednesday and voted on the day after.

Official sources in New Delhi on Sunday said the EU Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a matter entirely internal to India and the law was adopted through democratic means after a public debate in both houses of Parliament, they said.

28,27-1-20,AIIMS to initiate study to evaluate ill effect of biomass fuels on tribal’s health in Jharkhand,"nDoctors from the Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will soon initiate a pilot study in Jharkhand's two districts — Hazaribagh and Koderma — to evaluate the ill effect of biomass fuels (dung, agriculture waste and wood) on the overall health of the tribals, particularly women in the region.

Dr JS Titiyal, Chief investigator of the study and senior ophthalmologist from RP Centre, AIIMS said, ""The biomass based cooking fuels that are commonly used in Indian households especially by the poorest socio-economic groups carry a lot of health related short-term and long-term hazards that were not systematically studied till to date.""

Inhalation of these pollutants may cause deleterious effects on health, he added.

Women are most affected due to direct exposure to such waste several hours every day. ""The problem seems not restricted to just this. It has been found that smoke exposure also affects mental health and a link between mental health and air pollution seems a real possibility,"" he said.

The study will investigate affect on health from smoke and its short and long term consequences on cardiac and pulmonary functions, explained Dr Titiyal. The study spanning three years will also compare health of those using clean fuels such as LPG with those using conventional method, results of which will help the authorities in drawing long term policies for the welfare of the tribal people.

A pact has been inked between the AIIMS, Delhi and the Jharkhand Government to conduct the study which is being funded by the Central Coalfields Ltd in the

State.

According to various data, household air pollution (HAP) from combustion of solid fuels for cooking mainly coal and biomass fuels (wood, coal, crop residues, dung) has been ranked as the second global cause of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and a major cause of reduced life expectancy in South Asia.

Globally, around 4.3 million deaths per year are attributed to household air pollution

Further the smoke from the biomass has been shown to cause cataract, eye dryness and other eyes diseases. The multidisciplinary team from the AIIMS comprising Rakesh Yadav, Professor of Cardiology, Dr Nand Kumar, Professor of Psychiatry, Dr Ramkishor Sah, Scientist, R P Centre and Dr Subhradip Karmakar, Assistant Professor of Biochemistry, all from the AIIMS among others will investigate blood based markers as well as vital organ physiology parameters to address the problem.

The doctors will also assess the tear proteomics and genomic profiling to understand the interaction between users and non-users of biomass fuels besides evaluating the risk factor of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke increased with more prolonged use of solid fuels.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aiims-to-initiate-study-to-evaluate-ill-effect-of-biomass-fuels--on-tribal---s-health-in-jharkhand.html

In another tweet, the Congress said a lesson the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has failed to understand is that all persons no matter creed, caste or gender are guaranteed equality before the law under Article 14 of the Constitution.

""It is this article that is completely violated by the Government's Citizenship Amendment Act,"" the party said.

""It is important to remember that it is enshrined in our Constitution that all persons are protected from discrimination of any form. Therefore, any attempt to draft laws based on discrimination areunconstitutional,"" it said.

Both Rahul and Priyanka extended their greetings to the people on the occasion of the Republic Day.

In a message on the eve of the Republic Day, Sonia Gandhi urged people on Saturday to rise above personal prejudices and stand united to protect the Constitution and its values, claiming that they are being attacked through a ""deep-rooted"" conspiracy.

""A deep-rooted conspiracy has been hatched to set a discourse to divide countrymen based on religion, regionalism and language as also to subvert and undermine the Constitution. An unprecedented atmosphere of disturbance, fear and insecurity has been foisted upon the country.

""The common citizen is convinced that the constitutional values are no longer safe in the hands of the present dispensation,"" she had said.

Meanwhile, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram called for raising the ""level of protests"", saying ""as long as freedoms are denied to any number of people, the whole population is denied freedom"".

Greeting the people on the occasion of 71st Republic Day, he said the soul of the Constitution lies in the freedoms guaranteed in part three of the document.

These freedoms were given by the people unto themselves and no Government can take them away, the former home minister said in a series of tweets.

""Remember that today as we think of the 70 lakh people of the Kashmir valley whose freedoms have been taken away, including those in custody for over six months without charges. Add to that the outrageous charges, including sedition, slapped against hundreds of protesters by the authoritarian Government,"" he said.

Sami, accorded Indian citizenship in the recent past, was one of the 118 people whose names were announced on Saturday for the Padma Shri awards, with the Ministry of Home Affairs list showing his home State as Maharashtra.

Sonu Singh, who came from Himachal Pradesh, suffered the same fate. Waiting in long, serpentine queues, huge crowds had gathered near the Rajpath, some of them having arrived in the early hours to ensure a seat.

But, Rao and Singh and many others like them could not get entry despite holding a seat pass.

“I have never witnessed a Republic Day Parade. My friend arranged a pass for me and I arrived at gate no 23 around 6:30 am. A lot of pushing and shoving happened as it was a huge milling crowd, and more than two hours later I am remained outside as police did not allow entry.

“I pleaded to the police personnel but to no avail. All I could see was a few aircraft showering flower petals. I will try will luck next time,” he rued. There was a massive gathering at the Rajpath to attend the annual celebrations and January 26 being a Sunday added to the crowds.

More than one lakh people had gathered near the India Gate for the Republic Day celebration, a senior police officer said. “Many people could not get entry, as the enclosure area was already full,” he said.

“I came here at 7 am and waited interminably long and then after reaching near the entrance to the enclosures, I was told by police personnel that entry is closed. They should have managed the crowd well. I saw one side of the street facing the entrance was quite thin, still all crowd was packed on one side,” she said.

Participants would also keep an eye on the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China and other countries, they added. The lethal virus has claimed 56 lives in China, and spread to about a dozen nations.

“Going ahead, markets are likely to be volatile due to monthly F&O expiry just ahead of the Union Budget that would be presented towards the end of the elongated week. Also, stock-specific action is likely to continue with the ongoing results season which has been mixed so far. Apart from these, investors would also watch out for the US Fed and Bank of England’s monetary policy,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Head - Retail Research, Siddhartha Khemka said.

He added that on the macro front, US Q4 GDP and India’s fiscal deficit data would be released. Further, heavyweights like SBI, HDFC, HUL and Maruti Suzuki would be announcing their results this week which would also keep markets busy.

“The Q3 result had solid expectations but actual results are marginally below expectation for sectors like IT and banks, leading to cautiousness in the market. We feel that this cautious trend will be maintained in the near-term since a lot has been factored in about Budget wish-list and expectation of revival in earnings growth, but the

actual Q3 results (has been) below par.

“Going ahead, market direction will depend on the actual Budget announcements and performance of Q3 result. Week ahead is eventful with Union Budget, US Fed and BoE policy meets,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The company, which plans to raise Rs 1,600 crore through a follow-on public offer (FPO), has a solar panel capacity of 18 MW currently.

“Given the kind of demand we are witnessing in the solar space, especially in the rooftop segment, from corporates and commercial establisments as well as the state governments, we want to be ready to tap that opportunity,” the company’s Chairman and Managing Director RM Agarwal told PTI.

He said the company will be investing Rs 150 crore for scaling up the capacity, which it hopes to get from the budget allocated to the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications.

The company is expecting at least Rs 500 crore from the government in the next fiscal for meeting its various capital expenditure (capex) requirements. The company has a solar panel manufacturing facility at Naini in Uttar Pradesh.

When asked if the company would utilise the funds raised through the FPO for the capacity enhancement in case the funds from the government do not come, he said, “The FPO proceeds will have to be used towards partial repayment of loans, funding our working capital requirements and general purpose. For our capex, we will have to wait for the ministry to release the funds.”

Agarwal further said the company is banking on capacities tendered by discoms in various states to supply its panels as well as to set up rooftop projects on turnkey basis, along with the expected projects under the national solar mission.

The company has executed various turnkey orders for Bharatnet, telecom towers, and Uttar Pradesh police headquarters. ITI has also deployed 15 MW solar power project for the Solar Energy Corporation of India.

As per latest depositories data, FPIs invested a net Rs 13,304 crore in equities and withdrew a net Rs 11,680 crore from the debt segment between January 1-24. This translates into a total net inflow of Rs 1,624 crore.

“After starting the year on a muted note, investments from FPIs has picked up pace and most of that flows came after US and China signed a trade deal putting the trade war between them on a pause,” said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

The latest investments came despite challenges such as enhanced geopolitical tension between the US and Iran and dwindling domestic economic growth, Srivastava noted.

On the domestic front, “there are some signs of India shaking away the slowdown with business activity picking up and this is reflecting in the investments coming into equities. Besides, after the limit to which FPIs can invest in debt instruments has been increased, more inflows into the debt category can be expected,” said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.

The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday raised the investment limit for FPIs in government and corporate bonds, a move that is likely to bring in more foreign funds in the country.

According to the current norms, short-term investments by an FPI should not exceed 20 per cent of the total investment of that FPI in either central government securities (including treasury bills) or state development loans. The same norms are applicable on investments in corporate bonds.

The short-term investment limit has now been increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in both the cases, the RBI said in a circular.

Additionally, the RBI has also made relaxation in the voluntary retention route (VRR) for FPI investments in debt. The investment cap through VRR has been doubled to Rs 1.5 lakh crore, the RBI said in another circular.

Going forward, “all eyes will now be on the upcoming Budget to get further cues.

The national carrier created history by becoming the first commercial flight to fly to Israel over Saudi Arabia and Oman in March 2018, seen by many as a diplomatic breakthrough and often presented by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a major achievement of his government signalling improving ties with Gulf countries.

The access to Saudi and Omani airspace shortens the flight path by almost two hours which lowers the fuel cost leading to reduction in fares.

The announcement was made by Indian Ambassador in Israel Sanjeev Singla during the Republic Day celebrations at the Indian Embassy here on Sunday.

“Direct Air India flight connectivity between New Delhi and Tel Aviv is a game changer in our bilateral relations reflecting the importance we attach to people-to-people linkages and connectivity.

50,27-1-20,"Banking sector is stressed, govt in no position to bail it out: Banerjee","Nobel laureate and economist Abhijit Banerjee here on Sunday said the banking sector in the country is “stressed” and the Government is in no position to bail it out.

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the 13th Jaipur Literature Festival, Banerjee said the demand slowdown in the automobile sector also shows that people are lacking confidence in the economy.

“Financial sector is the biggest stress point currently. There is no question that the finance sector is something we should worry about, the banking sector is stressed. The government really is not in a position to bail it out, so we are talking about a long process of attrition, that’s going to be costly.

“We also know that due to a demand deficit in the economy, cars and two-wheelers are not selling, and those things are signs of a general fact that people lack confidence that the economy is going to grow fast so they are holding back, they are not spending,” he said.

The author of “Good Economics for Hard Times” added that the slowdown in the economy will also adversely impact poverty alleviation in the country as urban and rural sectors are interdependent.

“Poverty alleviation has been happening mostly on the strength of the fact that urban sector creates low skill jobs, and a lot of rural sector works in the urban sector and sends money back.

“That’s the peak source of transmission of growth from urban sector to rural sector. And as soon as the urban sector slows down the rural sector, the people in construction work don’t have as many jobs. All of that will feed back on the rural sector,” the 58-year-old Indian-American economist said.

Answering to a question — how will economic policies work if people have a lack of trust in the data, he said the government “should worry about this issue” as foreign investors are getting “nervous”.

51,27-1-20,Keep growing,"Pruning serves a variety of functions, including shaping, removing dead matter and preventing the plants from sagging or drooping, say experts

Houseplants are quick to tell you when they need help. They display discoloured leaves, drooping stems and little or no growth. That usually gives you enough time to make things right. “Plants send signals simply by the way they look,” said Dawn Pettinelli, an Extension educator at the University of Connecticut. “If they aren’t getting enough light, the leaves will yellow or turn brown and they’ll be slow to develop.”

Off-colour leaves also can be the symptom of root problems, insect infestations, irregular soil moisture or unsuitable light conditions or temperatures.

African violets, one of America’s most popular houseplants, don’t like to be cold but also get stressed when it’s too warm. “They’ll start wilting if they’re chilled and they won’t bloom if they’re hot,” Pettinelli said. “Their buds will fall off.”

A good way to rejuvenate many kinds of tired houseplants is by pruning or giving them what some growers dub “horticultural haircuts.” Pruning serves a variety of functions, including shaping, removing dead matter, and cutting back to reduce stem loads and keep the plants from sagging or drooping, said Diana Alfuth, a horticulturist with University of Wisconsin Extension.

But don’t prune too soon. “Pruning can be helpful but it causes growth, so it’s best done in late winter when the days start getting longer and the plants become more active,” Alfuth said. “Pruning then results in strong new growth. Pruning is helpful to keep a plant bushier or to rejuvenate a plant, especially if it has vining type growth.”

Slow-growing or tree-type houseplants are less tolerant of major trimming, she said. Avoid pruning palms, pines and orchids. It also provides an opportunity to take cuttings — segments from the stems, leaves or roots — to develop new plants.

Some houseplants are more tolerant of neglect and need less maintenance than others. “Succulents are great because they can go without water for long spells and they grow slowly so rarely need pruning or re-potting,” Alfuth said.

A houseplant’s diet is important and so is the timing of fertiliser applications. “Houseplants should not be fertilised during winter when days are short,” Alfuth said. “Fertilise in late winter as days get longer and plants wake up and will need fertiliser to put on growth during spring.”

Houseplant maintenance doesn’t need to be confined to spring cleaning. “It can be done any time of the year but a good way to remember it is by making it a New Year’s resolution,” Pettinelli said.

Don’t forget to dust. “When plants start touching the floor, they start collecting dust,” Pettinelli said. “If covered with dust, photosynthesis is reduced and the plants start losing some of their chemical energy for growth.”

Be careful not to overwater, which is one of the leading causes of houseplant losses. “Plants lose oxygen when they get too much water,” Pettinelli said. “Especially the roots. They’ll drown.”

Check to see if your plants are root-bound and need re-potting. If so, then buy larger containers and fill them with loose potting soils mixed with perlite or peat moss. Be sure the pots have holes cut in the bottoms so any excess water can drain out.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/keep-growing-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/keep-growing.html
52,27-1-20,Bridging the gap,"Modern society might have surpassed many crossroads but real progress can only be attained when science and spirituality go hand in hand, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Without religion, science is lame and without science religion is blind, Albert Einstein once said. Most of us would agree with what he said. Undoubtedly, the modern society has surpassed many cross roads but real progress can only be attained when both science and spirituality travel together.

Though science has advanced vastly but it cannot answer why; instead it answers how on the basis of additions and subtraction. These form the root of all mathematical explanations. For example, why did Newton’s apple come down and did not go up? Science answered that gravity of the earth pulled it towards its centre. It explained the mechanism of falling, hence, it answered how, but not why. Similarly, if an object is pushed by another object, it moves forward and science explains the phenomenon as: applied external force causes the movement of objects. Again science answers the mechanism of separation. Hence, it answers how, not why. Why the application of force causes movement? Science cannot answer this. Two stones when rubbed together produces heat. But why? Science says that the haphazard movement of atoms and electrons generates heat. Here also the reasons for mechanism of heat production are not explained.

Now, think for a while that what could be the answer to this why? Well, the answer is that whatever comes in this material world is fixed or pre-destined. So the roles that we all are playing in this world is prefixed. One might ask that what is the proof about it? To begin with, we exist only in the present and not in the past or the future. The anticipated future might soon become the present. And the present turns into the past within a stipulated time period. The past is not physically but it is subtly existent. The future is neither physically nor subtly existent but is merely an imagination.

We all have experienced the magic of films on a celluloid where the series of pre-built pictures touch the light beam of a projector machine chronologically and ultimately, live and animated pictures are produced on the screen. Fixed and readymade past goes animated and returns as a live and existent present. Anything that has a beginning must have an end. It proves that the world drama is fixed. If it runs ahead and does not stop after the end, the past will appear as the present.

In spiritual parlance, one complete cycle of world drama is called a Kalpa in which the almighty plays the role of a director and the body takes different births and re-births in this world drama.

What each one is doing is fixed in the world drama and what is fixed is being done by each one. God, being the director, advises every actor (human beings) to think good, do good and play their role in the best manner possible so that it becomes glorious and memorable in entire cycle of life.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bridging-the-gap-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/bridging-the-gap.html
53,27-1-20,Master the awkward financial talk,"Avoiding conversations around managing money with family often yields worse results than simply facing them head on. Here are some tips that will help you get through such discussions

Money, it’s a gas. Unless you need to borrow some from your parents. Then it’s a conversation many adults will avoid at all costs, even if it means paying for groceries with couch nickels.

That’s not the only money conversation we avoid. More than 60 per cent of millennials have never asked for a raise, largely because they don’t feel comfortable doing so, according to the salary data site PayScale. In many couples, partners hide debt, sometimes to the detriment of their relationship.

Avoiding these conversations often yields worse results than simply facing them head on. These tips will help you get through tough money talks, like asking your parents for money, negotiating your salary and talking to your partner about money.

ASKING YOUR PARENTS FOR MONEY

Even bonafide adults need help from the bank of mom and dad sometimes. In fact, 70 per cent of young adults (ages 18 to 34) received financial support from their parents in the past year, according to a 2018 survey by Merrill Lynch.

Asking your parents for money can be humbling, but swallowing your pride is better than letting your car insurance lapse. Here’s how to approach the conversation.

— Be specific. Tell your parents where you could use their help, whether it’s covering some (or all) of your rent, paying your car insurance, or buying groceries. Say upfront if you need ongoing help, rather than going back to them each month for more money.

— Own your mistakes. This will play better than blaming other people or circumstances, says Nathaniel Ivers, an associate professor in the department of counseling at Wake Forest University.

— Present a plan. Create a budget to show your parents that you are trying to get your finances under control. Ask for their input and avoid getting defensive if they scrutinize your spending.

Taking this advice into account, Ivers suggests your ask could sound something like this: “I was wondering if you could help me with my rent this month. I had a lot of unforeseen expenses (give examples) and, honestly, I didn’t manage my expenses as well as I could have. I have already started a budget to monitor things more closely. Would you be willing to go over it with me? It’s kind of tight, but if I cut down on some of the extra things, I will definitely have enough to cover things next month.”

TALKING WITH YOUR PARTNER ABOUT DEBT

Debt is a reality in most relationships, so it’s wise to disclose any you carry when things get serious. Ripping off the debt Band-Aid may be terrifying, but it can ultimately strengthen your bond, says Marla Mattenson, a relationship expert.

“The more comfortable you get about talking about your finances together, the easier it will be for you to discuss all the challenges that arise in a relationship,” Mattenson says.

Ask your partner to set aside time to chat and give them a heads up on where the conversation is heading, she adds. Keep it simple, something like: “Can we set aside 30 minutes sometime this week to talk about my personal finances?”

Be transparent during your conversation about how you got into debt, whether it’s student loans, credit cards or a combination of the two, and articulate your plan to pay off your debt. You should also share with your partner any fears you have about how this might affect your relationship.

NEGOTIATING SALARY

Your salary serves as the basis for future raises and job offers. That’s why negotiating your salary — at the outset and throughout your tenure — is critical. Here’s how to approach the conversation.

— Research industry salary. Use sites like Glassdoor to research salaries by city and company and ask people in your network what someone with your experience can expect to earn. If you’re comfortable, talk to current coworkers about their compensation when angling for a raise.

— Bring a list of wins. Come to the conversation armed with tangible examples of how you’ve added value to the company (if you’re asking for a raise). Prepare a list of business you’ve brought on, successful campaigns you’ve run or other metrics you’ve moved. If you’re negotiating for a new job, articulate how your skills and experience will add value to your new employer.

— Be prepared for a ‘no.’ If your boss declines your raise request, ask for an explanation. Welcome any recommendations for how to improve your performance and set the expectation that you would like to revisit the conversation in the coming months. When negotiating for a new job, find out if there is any wiggle room and consider negotiating for benefits like more vacation time in lieu of a higher starting salary.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/master-the-awkward-financial-talk-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/master-the-awkward-financial-talk.html
54,27-1-20,"After Padma Vibhushan, Mary dreams of Bharat Ratna","The first woman sportsperson to be decorated with the Padma Vibhushan, celebrated boxer MC Mary Kom on Sunday said she hopes to win the Bharat Ratna by winning a Gold at the Tokyo Olympics.

“It is a dream to win the Bharat Ratna. With this award (Padma Vibhushan) I will now be inspired to do even better with the thought that I can win the Bharat Ratna,” Mary Kom, 2012 Olympics Bronze medallist and a six-time world champion, told reporters.

“Sachin Tendulkar is the only sportsperson to have won it and I hope to become the second one and the first woman. I want to emulate Tendulkar and I get inspiration from him.”

The 36-year-old Mary Kom, however, said her immediate target is to first qualify for the Olympics and then she would think about the “colour of the medal”.

“My immediate target is to first qualify for Olympics and then I will think about the colour of the medal. If I qualify and win a Gold in Tokyo I hope to get the Bharat Ratna. To be honoured with Bharat Ratna will be the pinnacle of achievement and recognition for not only a sportsperson but also for any Indian,” she said.

Asked how she felt to be the greatest Indian woman sportsperson ever, Mary Kom said, “I think I have brought so many laurels for the country and the only thing remaining is a Gold medal in the Olympics.

“I want to shine for the country. Tokyo is likely to be my last Olympics. I don’t know whether they (BFI) will allow me to participate in next Olympics (2024) at 40 years of age so this one is really important.

55,27-1-20,Bayern cut Leipzig’s lead,"Robert Lewandowski hit his 21st league goal of the season as Bayern Munich thrashed Schalke 5-0 to cut RB Leipzig’s lead at the top of the Bundesliga to one point on Saturday.

After Leipzig had crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern seized the chance to trim the advantage with an emphatic win over David Wagner’s young Schalke side.

“The Leipzig match beforehand didn’t interest me, the main thing is we took three points and had a stability in our game which is very important,” said Bayern coach Hansi Flick.

Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller scored first-half goals, then both had efforts disallowed for offside by VAR.

However, Leon Goretzka, Thiago Alcantara and Serge Gnabry netted second-half strikes as Bayern dominated at the Allianz Arena.

With less than six minutes played, Schalke goalkeeper Markus Schubert failed to deal with a cross and Lewandowski was on hand to hook the ball into the net.

The Polish star moved one clear of Leipzig’s Timo Werner at the top of the Bundesliga scoring charts.

Schalke’s Welsh forward Rabbi Matondo hit the crossbar soon after, but it was all Bayern after that.

Mueller fired home Goretzka’s header two minutes into first-half stoppage time.

It was Mueller’s 100th goal at the Allianz Arena.

The hosts came out flying after the break as Goretzka volleyed home against his former club on 50 minutes.

Lewandowski served up a simple tap-in for Alcantara eight minutes later as Schalke offered precious little resistance before Gnabry came on and marked his comeback from injury with a late fifth goal.

“It wasn’t fun for us and it wasn’t nice, but we’ll learn from that,” said Wagner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bayern-cut-leipzig---s-lead.html
56,27-1-20,‘Phenomenal’ Liverpool too good for City: Pep,"Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola conceded the Premier League title to Liverpool and believes no team in the world would be able to stay with the European champions this season.

Liverpool are well on course for a first league title in 30 years as they lead City by 16 points with a game in hand after winning 22 and drawing one of their 23 games.

City have won back-to-back titles with a combined 198 points, denying Liverpool last season despite Jurgen Klopp’s men posting 97 points — the third highest tally in top-flight English football history.

“Liverpool obviously will be champions of the Premier League, but they would be champions in Spain, champions in Italy, champions in Germany,” said Guardiola.

“They would be champions everywhere after 23 games, 22 victories, 1 draw.”

City have lost five league games this season, but Guardiola defended their record by pointing out it would still be good enough to mount a title challenge in Europe’s other top leagues.

“In the recent past when Chelsea won the league, the next season, they didn’t qualify for the Champions League, Leicester the same and Chelsea again the same. When we won the league we repeated the league,” added Guardiola.

“In Spain with the points we have we would be there, one or two points behind the leader, in Germany we would be there, one or two points behind the leader, in Italy as well.

“But Liverpool are just fantastic, phenomenal, overwhelming. So we have to accept it and learn from that.”

Guardiola won three league titles in a row at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, but believes the mental strength to bounce back of his current squad is just as good as any he has coached before.

And City could still end the season with three trophies as they look to defend the FA Cup and League Cup and take on Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month.

“Honestly, it is one of the best I have ever handled or faced in my career for how they react in the bad moments,” he said.

“The numbers, the results, not just in this season, I think are good. Even in the previous seasons I think it was phenomenal. That is why I am so proud.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---phenomenal----liverpool-too-good-for-city--pep.html
57,27-1-20,Atletico goal drought continues,"Atletico Madrid’s goalscoring troubles resurfaced as they drew 0-0 at home to a struggling Leganes side that finished with a defender in goal after the dismissal of Ivan Cuellar.

Atletico crashed out of the Copa del Rey in midweek after losing to third-tier Cultural Leonesa, and Sunday’s latest setback would appear to rule Diego Simeone’s team out of title contention.

They are now winless in four games and could finish the day 10 points behind city rivals Real, who travel to Real Valladolid later, ahead of next week’s Madrid derby at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Having sold French striker Antoine Griezmann to Barcelona, scoring goals has been Atletico’s fundamental weakness this season. They have managed only 22 in 21 league games, the same number as Real Mallorca in 17th.

Angel Correa and Alvaro Morata both tested Cuellar in the first half while Recio went close for Leganes with a curling strike that was deflected over by an Atletico Madrid defender.

58,27-1-20,Address policy issues stalling growth: Industry body to FM,"Leading industry body Indian Auto LPG Coalition has sought GST reduction on Auto LPG as well as on conversion kits for gaseous fuels to promote the adoption of clean automotive fuels.

LPG used as fuel in automobiles or Auto LPG, which is among the cleanest alternative fuels with a Global Warming Potential of ‘zero’ is currently taxed at 18 per cent GST. Also, the GST rates on Auto LPG/CNG conversion kits stand at a prohibitive 2 per cent, IAC said.

High GST rates on clean fuels and conversions kits are in complete variance to the government’s stated green mobility push, it said in a statement.

“We seek the attention of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman towards the imminent need for devising friendly policies to allow rapid growth of environment-friendly transport fuels such as Auto LPG. Auto LPG which is being promoted actively by governments across the world is facing discriminatory policies in India. It is taxed at a high GST slab of 18 per cent. Similarly, conversion kits for auto LPG and CNG are placed at the highest slab of 28 per cent which is meant for either luxury goods or demerit items like tobacco products,” said Suyash Gupta, Director General, Indian Auto LPG Coalition (IAC).

IAC said LPG is the most widely used alternative fuel in the world, with a proven track record of improvement in air quality. The global consumption of Auto LPG has risen by over 40 per cent over the past 10 years, fuelled by environmental concerns. Among the key nations that have successfully adopted this green fuel for their transportation requirements are South Korea, Turkey, Poland, Japan, Australia, Italy, Mexico and Russia.

The association said even as India plans a long-term shift to electric vehicles, it is missing out the environmental benefits that can be gained by adopting low hanging fruits like Auto LPG. Investing in a wider basket of clean alternative transport fuels that are more readily available can bring about an immediate improvement in air quality unlike EVs that are still a decade away from becoming commercially viable.

“Apart from the need to lower GST, another critical intervention required is the reform of the Type Approval norms governing conversion to gaseous fuels. The Type Approval norms require companies to renew extremely cost prohibitive Type Approvals for Auto LPG and CNG conversions every three years. This acts as a major hurdle to the industry and has resulted in a rapid dwindling of players in the retro-fitment market. The Type Approval regime must be made industry friendly and its validity must be made perpetual in line with European norms,” Gupta said.

More than 26 million vehicles run on Auto LPG globally, supported by close to 71,000 LPG Filling Stations with global Auto LPG consumption exceeding 26 million tonnes. Emissions of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) and harmful particulate matter PM 2.5 are almost negligible for Auto LPG, claimed IAC.

IAC is the nodal body for the promotion of Auto LPG in India. Members of the Coalition include the oil PSUs, private auto LPG marketers, kit suppliers and equipment manufacturers. The coalition works closely with the World LPG Association, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and Automotive Research Association of India.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/address-policy-issues-stalling-growth--industry-body-to-fm-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/address-policy-issues-stalling-growth--industry-body-to-fm.html

61,27-1-20,‘More Indians are choosing Washington’,"Elliot Ferguson, CEO and president of Washington DC Tourism, Destination DC, says that the seamless air connectivity between New Delhi and Dulles is helping more travellers plan visits. By Team Viva

What kind of Indian travellers are you catering to through this city-specific programme called Destination DC?

We are looking at a combination of business and leisure travellers and looking to make Washington a top bleisure destination. Which means that we get aware and selective visitors. They will be here only if they’ve businesses in the US, especially Washington DC. We are mainly targetting travellers who are looking for a high-end experience while on the go.

But there is an emerging group of Indian travellers from Tier-II cities who have spending power and are keen to travel...

In fact, we are widening the arc of our tourist experience at the same time. We do have something for those travelling on a fixed budget, are on a family vacation or travelling solo. They can book various kinds of packages, which involve places like local museums, community centres and weekly events, which they can be a part of. Our travel itineraries include value-added destinations from the Dulles International Airport to Downtown Washington. Also, the transportation in the city can be availed very reasonably to maintain one’s budget.

What of the festival circuit that you are consciously developing, like the Cherry Blossom and the International Jazz festivals? Do they have something in store for Indian travellers?

Yes, a lot of them are free and have been developed around seasons. For instance, in July, you should visit Washington because of the spectacle and scale of Fourth of July celebrations, the Independence day. The weather might be warm but there are a lot of outdoor attractions like great fireworks and some amazing cultural walks. On the birth anniversary of Martin Luther King, Washington witnesses a special parade — something unmissable if you’re in the city. There are all kinds of activities lined up for tourists to celebrate his life and legacy. This way we are even making people across the globe aware of him in a new way.

Fortunately, we have over 170 international embassies in Washington DC. Many cultural-based events are happening through these embassies. For instance, we celebrated the Chinese New Year, which is a major event in various parts of Asia as well.

I would say that DC’s food scene is very underrated. We have some of the best-rated Indian restaurants in the US and that’s an amazing and compelling reason to not only stay in the city but experience a slice of its nightlife.

Latest data suggests that people like to plan their own vacations through online aggregators and do not rely on travel agents so much. How do you take advantage of this shift in preferences?

Most Americans travel on their personal time without consulting a travel agent. We do our own research. I think there’s sophistication and technology tied to this and we provide the most comprehensive website with cross-linkages so that you can research and make your own itinerary online. If you go to our website, you will find elaborate recommendations and itinerary suggestions for the number of days that you want to spend in DC. When you select the dates, you will also see which festivals or cultural or sports events are to take place on those dates in the city. Indians are technologically very astute and are an aware community. And now with an increasing number of millennials, they’re more likely to go out on their own. We have to hence study the patterns of each country to decide what would be the best for which kind of travellers. But the bottomline is that the easy access to technology today and fixed budgets are making people smarter in making travel choices.

The number of Indian tourists travelling to Washington DC is increasing day by day. What are the reasons?

Yes, India is Washington DC’s third overseas market and its visitation to DC has more than doubled in the last five years with 11,700 visitors in 2018. And that’s because of non-stop flights. Such seamless connectivity makes a big difference. Indian travellers are very attracted to New York and what it has to offer. If you are using a travel agent or even if you are doing your own research, you’ll know that Washington is two hours 45 minutes by train from New York. You can tie into an itinerary and visit other major cities. In between you get Philadelphia and Baltimore. I think that’s the kind of flexi combination that is working for us.

What are the other major attractions for Indian travellers?

We are promoting the shopping scene. We tend to think that the traditional Indian community may know about our great museums but they do not know about our other assets. There are various “things to see and do” lists. We have good tie-ins with international conferences and so are aware of varied tastes and customisation.

There are many Indians living in the US. What’s in store for them?

We recognise the Indian community that’s in Washington DC which is pretty large. They also have their families coming and visiting them. So we have worked out tight itineraries.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---more-indians-are-choosing-washington----2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---more-indians-are-choosing-washington---.html
62,27-1-20,A retro appeal,"Fans hold on to paper planners, citing comfort and creativity

In a digital and increasingly paperless age, fans of paper planners remain enthusiastic and steadfast.

“There’s something comforting about using a planner. It’s very personal, and apart from the cacophony of screens,” says Jennie Tung, executive editor at Martha Stewart Living, adding that paper planners have “a retro appeal.”

“The act of writing things down by hand slows you down and makes you more mindful. A paper planner becomes a personal record, and for some people it’s almost like a diary,” she says.

Many paper planners today are so well-designed that they become a way to make a statement. “They are beautifully designed objects that are a joy to hold and use,” she says.

And contrary to what one might imagine, many of the biggest fans of papers planners aren’t older people who grew up with them but a younger generation embracing their comfortable vibe. According to Stephanie Fleming, co-founder of Me & My BIG Ideas, which makes The Happy Planner, “the age demographic is around 25 to the early 40s range, with a lot of movement toward college-age women.”

“I had imagined younger people preferring digital planners because they really want to slow down a bit. Having everything at their fingertips is not necessarily making people happy. There’s something about going back to basics. A lot of people are looking for some digital detox,” Fleming says.

Tung notes that paper planners now come in an array of designs and can be carried around all day. A few brands noted by the pros at Martha Stewart Living as chic and well-designed include Smythson, Appointed, and Sugar Paper, as well as the “bare bones but gets the job done” paper planners from Rollbahn.

All the planners offered by The Happy Planner feature encouraging words and positive messaging for those working towards health wellness, career or financial goals, for example. And with their accompanying planner stickers and customisable extension packets, they can be a creative outlet akin to scrapbooking.

“A planner is not just about being a calendar. It’s about so much more than that. There’s the aspect of focus and creativity, in addition to productivity,” Fleming says.

She admits that “digital calendars are nice because they keep your desk uncluttered,’’ but adds, “people engage more when they write things down.”

Paper planners range from minimalist versions costing a few dollars to fancy planners for over $100. And there’s always the option of using both digital and paper in some combination.

In the meantime, paper still has a place with many people trying to keep a complicated life in order.

63,27-1-20,Trend Blazer,"Being in love is important: Tahira

Filmmaker-author Tahira Kashyap, whose actor-husband Ayushmann Khurrana plays a gay protagonist in the forthcoming Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, says it is important to be in love, irrespective of gender.

“I am proud of the films that he (Ayushmann) is doing, and even this one,” said Tahira.

“I feel the idea is to celebrate love, and the day we stop thinking about whether it's a love story between a boy and a boy or between a girl and a girl, we will be developed as a nation. It is important to be in love irrespective of gender and I am happy that he did this film,” she added.

Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is a romantic comedy drama, themed on homosexuality. It is the second instalment of 2017 film Shubh Mangal Saavdhan.

‘I was pinching myself. I mean I was that girl who would watch Anil sir (Kapoor) again and again in Mr India, how he and Mogambo would talk and so on. The next thing happening is Mr. India sitting next to me and I am working with him. My Mr India looks the same even after so many years. I have to mention that I have learned the importance of discipline from him.’

64,27-1-20,Anyone can be a target,"WhatsApp is generally considered secure but it, too, can act as a conduit for malware. The lesson comes from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ recent hacking episode

You may not think you’re in the same league as Jeff Bezos when it comes to being a hacking target. Probably not, but you — and just about anyone else, potentially including senior US government figures — could still be vulnerable to an attack similar to one the Amazon founder and Washington Post owner apparently experienced.

Two UN experts this week called for the US to investigate a likely hack of Bezos’ phone that could have involved Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A commissioned forensic report found with “medium to high confidence” that Bezos’ iPhone X was compromised by a video MP4 file he received from the prince in May 2018.

Bezos later went public about the hack after the National Enquirer tabloid threatened to publish Bezos’ private photos if he didn’t call off a private investigation into the hacking of his phone. It’s not clear if those two events are related. The Saudis have denied any involvement in the purported hack.

The events could potentially affect U.S.-Saudi relations. On Friday, Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he is asking the National Security Agency to look into the security of White House officials who may have messaged the crown prince, particularly on personal devices. Jared Kushner, a White House aide and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, is known to have done so using WhatsApp.

Wyden called reports of the Bezos hack “extraordinarily ominous” and said they may have “startling repercussions for national security.”

But they could resonate at the personal level as well. As the cost of hacking falls while opportunities to dig into peoples’ online lives multiply, more and more people are likely to end up as targets, even if they’re not the richest individuals in the world.

Ultimately, that boils down to a simple lesson: Be careful who you talk to — and what you’re using to chat with them.

“People need to get out of the mindset that nobody would hack them,” said Katie Moussouris, founder and CEO of Luta Security. “You don’t have to be a specific target or a big fish to find yourself at the mercy of an opportunistic attacker.”

WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, is generally considered a secure way of trading private online messages due to the fact that it scrambles messages and calls with encryption so that only senders and recipients can understand them. What many people may not have realized is that it, like almost any messaging service, can act as a conduit for malware.

That encryption, however, is no help if a trusted contact finds a way to use that connection to break into the phone’s operating system. In fact, an infected attachment can’t be detected by security software while it’s encrypted, and apps like WhatsApp don’t scan for malware even once files are decrypted.

WhatsApp users can disable the automatic downloading of photos, videos and other media, which happens by default unless the user takes action.

Other messaging apps are likely also vulnerable. “It just so happens that this one was a vulnerability in WhatsApp,” said JT Keating, of Texas-based security firm Zimperium. “It could have been in any one of any number of apps.”

Prince Mohammed exchanged numbers with Bezos during a U.S. trip in spring 2018. On the same visit, the prince also met with other tech executives, including the CEOs of Google, Apple and Palantir, as well as sports and entertainment celebrities and academic leaders. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson gave the Saudi delegation a tour of the Mojave Air and Space Port in the desert north of Los Angeles.

Google and Apple didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment this week on whether their executives shared personal contacts after that trip. Palantir Technologies confirmed that its CEO Alex Karp met with the prince but said they never shared personal messages. Virgin Group said it was looking into it.

UC Berkeley cybersecurity researcher Bill Marczak cautioned that there’s still no conclusive evidence that the Saudi video was malicious, adding that it might be premature to jump to broader conclusions about it. Many other security experts have also questioned the forensics report upon which U.N. officials are basing their conclusions.

But Marczak said it is generally good advice to “always be on the lookout for suspicious links or messages that sound too good to be true.”

Even caution about avoiding suspicious links might not be good enough to ward off spyware — especially for high-profile targets like dissidents, journalists and wealthy executives. Hackers-for-hire last year took advantage of a WhatsApp bug to remotely hijack dozens of phones and take control of their cameras and microphones without the user having to click anything to let them in.

In such cases, said Marczak, “there doesn’t need to be any interaction on the part of the person being targeted.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/anyone-can-be-a-target-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/anyone-can-be-a-target.html
65,27-1-20,7 up,"Josip Ilicic hit a hat-trick, including a sensational strike from the halfway line, as Atalanta crushed Torino 7-0 in Serie A on Saturday, inflicting the worst home defeat ever on their northern rivals who finished the match with nine men.

The Slovenian forward opened the scoring on 17 minutes, adding two more in quick-fire succession eight minutes after the break.

Substitute Luis Muriel also bagged a late brace to add to first-half goals by Robin Gosens and Duvan Zapata.

The hosts played the final quarter of an hour a man down after Armando Izzo was sent off, with Sasa Lukic joining him with just a minute to go.

Torino coach Walter Mazzarri blasted an “indefensible performance”.

“All we can do is apologise,” he said. “In so many years of my career I had never had such a game.”

But the Torino coach ruled out quitting.

“Resignation? No, in difficulties I never leave.”

Gian Piero Gasperini'’s Atalanta hit back after last weekend’s shock defeat to lowly SPAL, following a draw against Inter Milan.

They now join Roma in fourth place on 38 points.

Martinez sees red

Milan: Radja Nainggolan grabbed the equaliser in a 1-1 draw for Cagliari to dent the title ambitions of his parent club Inter Milan, who struggled to a third consecutive stalemate on Sunday.

Tensions reached boiling point in the San Siro as Inter’s goal scorer Lautaro Martinez was sent off in injury time for arguing with the referee.

The Argentinian risks a long suspension as he roared, kicked the ball and punched the plexiglass at the side of the pitch, after being dragged away by his teammates.

Antonio Conte’s second-placed Inter are now three points adrift of leaders Juventus, who travel to 13th-placed Napoli.

The northeners can also be caught by Lazio, in third, who are three points behind before their derby clash against fifth-placed Roma.

A win would see Simone Inzaghi’s Lazio join Inter in the standings, with a game in hand to be played in February against Hellas Verona.

Martinez’s frustration mirrored that of his team who have now been held to three consecutive 1-1 draws — at home against Atalanta and Cagliari and at Lecce.

Inter had gotten off to a promising start with Ashley Young having an immediate impact on his debut after arriving from Manchester United, providing the cross who allowed Martinez to head in just before half an hour.

But the hosts failed to build on the momentum and the Sardinians stayed in the match until Nainggolan’s long-range equaliser which took a deflection into goal on 78 minutes.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/7-up.html

67,27-1-20,Pitch became hard for batting as game progressed: Guptill,"Senior New Zealand opener Martin Guptill blamed the sluggish Eden Park track for their flop show with the bat in an absolute surrender to the Indian side.

Guptill scored a quickfire 33 off 20 balls but Indian bowlers kept a tight leash on the Black Cap restricting them for 132 and then reaching the target in only 17.3 overs.

“We certainly felt that the pitch was getting slower and slower when we were batting. It got harder and harder to bat as the game progressed. We needed one of the top three-four to bat majority of the innings. We weren’t able to get partnerships to add up the total,” Guptill told reporters after his team lost second successive game.

The surface was slower compared to the first game where New Zealand scored 203.

“It was a slightly different wicket. Earlier on, it was coming nicely. Colin (Munro) and I were off to a reasonable start. We lost momentum thereafter the sixth over, and we had to sort of rebuild from there,” he said.

The target was not a tough one to chase down admitted Guptill.

“We probably knew we were light on runs. But we had to try and defend that, and get early wickets upfront. Thought the bowlers did well in the front six overs, we needed more wickets after Virat got out. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul batted very well and we were not able to break that partnership,” he added.

Guptill and Colin Munro put up 48 for the opening stand after 80 in the first game.

“Our role in the team is to be aggressive and we go out there to do that. One of us would have been good to bat 15 overs to set the innings up and have guys bat around us. It was not supposed to be today and we have time to try to do that in the next game and do a better performance,” he added.

The opener felt that India once again out-batted them on a difficult track.

“They played very well, as hard as they did the other night. They built partnerships to put pressure on us. We were not able to do that and got out-batted tonight. India have got some great players and match winners. It is hard for the boys to go out there and try their best. Sometimes you come up short,” Guptill further added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pitch-became-hard-for-batting-as-game-progressed--guptill.html
68,27-1-20,Bowlers stood up & took control: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli lauded his bowling unit for taking control of the proceedings from the onset after an emphatic seven-wicket victory against New Zealand in the second T20.

“I think we had another good performance today, especially with the ball. The bowlers stood up and took control of what we wanted to do out there. Sticking to one side of the wicket was a very good feature for us as a team to restrict a good New Zealand team to 132 which I think was below par,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

The low target led to India chasing down the total with 15 balls to spare.

“The low total led us to bat in that manner but we thought the pitch was good for 160 in the first half. We understood the angles of the field better, how the pitch was playing and I had to think on my feet as a captain,” he added.

Kohli’s opposite number Kane Williamson reckoned that the pitch was tough for batting compared to the first match and that they were 20 runs short.

“It was a tough day. The wicket was quite different from the first game. I think as a batting unit we needed another 15 or 20 to make it a little bit more competitive. But credit to the way India bowled,” Williamson said.

He termed India as a “class side” which put them under constant pressure.

“They’re a class side in all departments and they put us under pressure in that middle period. Even though we only had 130 on the board on a small ground, we still knew if we were able to take early wickets and build pressure like they did, then you never really know.

“But they showed their experience and took the game much deeper than we were able to in the first innings and they were very clinical.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bowlers-stood-up---took-control--kohli.html
69,27-1-20,Walk in Eden Park,"India tightened their grip on the T20I series with a seven-wicket drubbing of New Zealand in the second match after their bowlers stifled the hosts on a pocket-sized Eden Park on Sunday.

Boasting a formidable batting line-up, chasing 133 proved to be a cakewalk for the visitors on a pitch that was slightly on the slower side.

The very short boundary ensured the match ended with as many as 15 balls to spare.

The trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami allowed no respite to Kane Williamson’s team after New Zealand surprisingly chose to bat, restricting them to 132 for five.

K L Rahul then scored 57 not out off 50 balls while Shreyas Iyer scored 44 off 33 balls, the duo adding 86 runs for the third wicket and after Rohit Sharma’s twin failure.

Tim Southee took 2-20 as India had to do without major contributions from both Sharma and skipper Virat Kohli.

Sharma (8) was out caught at slip in the first over off Southee. New Zealand’s new ball bowlers were compact and didn’t let the Indian top order get away unlike the first T20I on Friday.

Even so, Rahul and Kohli added 31 runs for the second wicket. The latter then was caught behind off Southee in the sixth over with Tim Seifert taking a brilliant diving catch.

Kohli scored 11 off 12 balls and the wicket’s slow nature was starting to impact proceedings. New Zealand held back their spinners too, but Rahul-Iyer settled down in this passage of play.

They rotated strike well and added 50 in 55 balls by minimising risks. Rahul brought up his 11th T20I half-century off 43 balls.

Overall, Rahul hit three fours and two sixes, while Iyer hit one four and three sixes.

India crossed 100 in the 15th over after which Iyer cut loose to approach the finish line. He fell just prior, holing out off Ish Sodhi (1-33).

But Rahul stuck around while Shivam Dube finished the job with a six over midwicket.

This was after Indian bowlers made good use of a slower pitch.

Opting to bat, the Black Caps couldn’t generate enough momentum in the middle overs and finished with a sub-par total.

Martin Guptill top-scored with 33 off 20 balls, while Tim Seifert was unbeaten on 33 not out off 26 balls.

Guptill and Colin Munro (26) provided a measured start to New Zealand putting on 48 runs for the first wicket.

Surprisingly, India held back Jasprit Bumrah (1-21) as Shardul Thakur (1-21) and Mohammed Shami (0-22) bowled four overs in the power play. The tactic worked as Thakur got rid of Guptill at end of six overs.

India then used the slow nature of the used-wicket to put brakes on the New Zealand middle order. Wickets came at a regular interval as the Black Caps struggled to get the big shots out.

Yuzvendra Chahal (0-33) and Shivam Dube (1-16) combined well after the powerplay, while Ravindra Jadeja was the stand out bowler with figures of 2-18 from four overs.

Overall, India also raised their fielding effort barring a bizarre drop from Virat Kohli late in the innings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/walk-in-eden-park-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/walk-in-eden-park.html
70,27-1-20,Sebi plans to rationalise margin system in derivatives segment to bring down trading cost,"Markets regulator Sebi is planning to rationalise margin system in the equity and commodity derivatives segments as part of its effort to boost liquidity and bring down trading cost, industry officials said.

The regulator is expected to come out with the new margining system this week, they added.

The framework has been prepared on the basis of recommendations by the capital markets regulator’s Risk Management Review Committee.

Margin, in market parlance, is the minimum fund or security an investor is required to pay to the stock broker before executing a trade. This is basically part of the money collected by bourses from brokerages upfront, before giving exposure for trading in equity and commodity derivatives.

Under the new framework, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is likely to lower margins for hedged position, which will benefit market participants, especially hedgers, officials said.

The new margin system will be based on standard portfolio analysis of risk-model, developed by NSE Clearing Corporation and International Organization of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) principles, they added.

Market participants believe that currently margins are on the higher side as compared to those levied by global exchanges.

In addition, there are numerous margins levied by exchanges on members, which pushes up the overall cost of trading. These include initial, premium and assignment margins.

An initial margin paid by the broker is based on the ‘standard portfolio analysis of risk’ model. Also, it charges members a premium margin and an assignment margin, in addition to the initial margin.

Premium margin, charged to members, is the client wise premium amount payable by the buyer of the option and is levied till the completion of pay-in towards the premium settlement. An assignment margin is levied on assigned positions of members till the payment towards settlement obligations is complete.

As part of the margin rationalisation, Sebi is likely to lower margins, which will help market participants to transact more, eventually leading to improved liquidity situation and reduced impact cost.

In November 2019, Sebi had asked trading and clearing members to compulsorily collect upfront certain margins from their clients in the cash segment. The move became effective from January 1, 2020.

Under the guidelines, trading and clearing members need to report to the stock exchange about the about the actual short-collection or non-collection of all margins from clients.

From April 1, non-compliance of this would be penalised, which brokers would have to pass on to their clients, which in turn would impact trading volumes.

Derivatives in financial markets typically refer to the forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre-determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfilment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities.

Broadly, there are two types of derivative contracts — futures and options.

A futures contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date, while options contract gives the buyer or holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at end of a specified

period.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sebi-plans-to-rationalise-margin-system-in-derivatives-segment-to-bring-down-trading-cost.html

World number nine Ng clinched victory after Nishimoto took the first game in a 16-21, 21-13, 21-12 duel.

But missteps in the second and third game by the 25-year-old Japanese player allowed Ng to move forward in a decisive victory — coming back swiftly after a five-point low.

75,27-1-20,Coco’s run end in tears,"Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer swept into the Australian Open quarter-finals but 15-year-old Coco Gauff exited in tears on Sunday after her quest to become the Open era’s youngest Grand Slam winner came screeching to a halt.

As Melbourne marked Australia Day with formation jets and a 21-gun salute, world number one Ashleigh Barty had home fans celebrating before crowd favourite Federer dismantled Marton Fucsovics in the night match.

Djokovic, hunting his eighth Melbourne title, was remorseless against Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman, crushing the 14th seed 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to book an 11th appearance in the last eight.

The Serb’s reward is a match-up with big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, who is back in form after a run of injuries and dismissed 2018 finalist Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-3, 7-5.

“I’ve got to be ready for missiles coming from his side of the net,” said Djokovic, the 16-time Grand Slam winner.

Gauff’s giant-killing Australian debut generated hype dubbed Cocomania as she attempted to become the youngest Major winner in the post-1968 Open Era, breaking the record set by a 16-year-old Martina Hingis in 1997.

Gauff beat seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams in round one and title-holder Naomi Osaka in the third, but she came unstuck against a determined Sofia Kenin.

Arab first

Gauff raised hopes by edging the first set but then her fellow American took control and it was one-sided at the finish as Kenin won 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-0.

“The thing I’m most proud of myself is how I handled it on the court,” said Gauff, who shed tears after her defeat. “Even though today I lost a set 6-0, I was still believing I could win it.”

Kenin, already on the best Grand Slam run of her career, next faces Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur, who beat China’s Wang Qiang to become the first Arab woman to reach a Major quarter-final.

Wang stunned Serena Williams in the third round but the 27th seed ran out of steam against Jabeur, who fought back from a break down in the first set to win 7-6 (7/4), 6-1.

Jabeur, the highest-ranked Arab woman in history — she reached a career-high 51 last year — is the first Tunisian woman to win a main-draw match at the Australian Open.

“I’m really shaking right now, it’s unbelievable, I can’t describe how I feel,” said the 25-year-old.

Australia’s Barty had some nervy moments against American Alison Riske, dropping the second set and briefly losing her way before recovering to win 6-3, 1-6, 6-4.

She now has an improving chance of becoming the first home-grown winner since Chris O’Neil in 1978 after six of the top 10 seeds exited in the previous round.

“I just had to hang in there and try and give myself a chance,” said Barty, who next plays Petra Kvitova, after the two-time Wimbledon champion beat Maria Sakkari 6-7 (4/7), 6-3, 6-2.

Later, Federer sent ripples of consternation around Rod Laver Arena when he dropped the first set against Hungary’s Fucsovics, the world number 67.

But the 38-year-old Swiss, pushed to a fifth-set tie-breaker by Australia’s John Millman on Friday, came alive in the second set as he rattled through the match 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.

“It just took me some time, I tried to mix it up a bit and just had to figure it out. From the beginning of the second set it got a little bit easier,” Federer said.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion’s quarter-final is against unseeded American Tennys Sandgren, who upset Italian 12th seed Fabio Fognini in four tough sets, 7-6 (7/5), 7-5, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coco---s-run-end-in-tears.html
76,27-1-20,England close to series win,"Joe Root made a patient half-century as England set South Africa a world record target of 466 to win the fourth and final Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.

The England captain scored 58 and played an anchor role before he was last man out as England were bowled out shortly before the close for 248.

Root decided not to enforce the follow despite England leading by 217 runs on the first innings.

Fast bowler Mark Wood took five for 46 as South Africa were bowled out for 183 in their first innings.

Quinton de Kock (76) and Dwaine Pretorius (37) kept England in the field for most of the morning and probably made sure England would decide to bat again.

De Kock and Pretorius put on 79 for the eighth wicket and prevented England from wrapping up the innings early.

De Kock scored his fourth half-century of what has been a poor series for the South African batsmen.

His team-mates have contributed only five other 50-plus scores between them.

Vernon Philander was out to the sixth ball of the day, reducing South Africa to 93 for seven, at which stage a follow-on seemed a strong possibility.

It was an unhappy day for Philander, who will be retiring from international cricket at the end of the match as he pulled up with a hamstring injury after bowling just nine balls in the second innings.

He left the field immediately and was sent for a scan.

Despite the loss of their leading bowler, South Africa bowled and fielded better than in the first innings when England scored 400.

Left-arm seam bowler Beuran Hendricks claimed a five-wicket haul on debut, finishing with five for 64 when Root was last man out to a sensational diving catch by South African captain Faf du Plessis at a wide slip.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/england-close-to-series-win.html
77,27-1-20,Philander fined for Buttler send-off,"South African opening bowler Vernon Philander, who is playing in his final Test, has been fined 15 percent of his match fee after a send-off of England batsman Jos Buttler during the second day of the fourth Test at the Wanderers Stadium.

The International Cricket Council announced on Sunday that Philander had been found guilty of a level one offence for “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal in an international match.”

Buttler was fined 15 percent of his match fee after the second Test in Cape Town where he was caught on camera swearing at Philander.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/philander-fined-for-buttler-send-off.html
78,27-1-20,Iyer learnt art of chasing watching Kohli bat,"There is no one better than Virat Kohli when it comes to chasing down totals in white-ball cricket, something that India’s newest No 4 Shreyas Iyer wants to emulate on a consistent basis in coming days.

With a half-century and 44 off 33 balls in the successful chases in the first two T20 games, Iyer is fast becoming another viable option for the Indian team apart from its talismanic skipper when it comes to tricky run-chases.

“I personally feel that you have a fair idea how many runs you are going to chase and at what run-rate you have to chase them. Virat Kohli is the perfect example when he goes out to bat and the way he plans his innings. I learn a lot from him personally, the way he grinds out and he tries to finish the game. That’s the best part about him,” Iyer told mediapersons.

He also learns a lot from his senior Mumbai teammate Rohit Sharma, who can demolish any attack on his day.

“(I) Also (learn from) Rohit Sharma, whenever he’s given an opportunity, he makes the best use of it. All these amazing characters in the team set a really good example for us youngsters.

“There’s a lot to learn from them and that’s what I try to apply whenever I go out there. I think that I have to stay not out and it really helps me grind throughout that middle period and when the time comes, I take on the bowlers. That’s how you plan your innings when you are chasing,” Iyer said.

The 25-year-old is known for his penchant for hitting big sixes but he also understands the value of rotating the strike as a middle-order batsman.

“You have to play all sorts of shots and take singles. As well as when you want to hit sixes, you have to be aware of the fact that you have to create that moment for yourself. You have to give yourself that time to get set. That’s what I usually do.”

He has now played 34 white-ball games for India (15 ODIs and 19 T20Is) and realises that staying at the crease an important virtue.

“I have realized playing so many matches that as long as I stay on the wicket, I tend to see the ball really well and I can take on the bowlers,” he opined.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/iyer-learnt-art-of-chasing-watching-kohli-bat.html
79,27-1-20,India A suffer five-run defeat,"Ishan Kishan was left stranded on an unbeaten 71 as India A lost four wickets in nine balls to suffer a narrow five-run defeat in the deciding third ODI against New Zealand A on Sunday.

Chasing 271 for a series-win, India A needed seven runs from the final over with two wickets in hand but wicket-keeper batsman Kishan took a single off the second ball after playing a dot to expose the tail.

It proved quite costly as pacer Kyle Jamieosn (4/49) knocked off Sandeep Warrier and Ishan Porel off consecutive balls to end the match with two balls to spare.

In the 49th over, India A lost well-set Axar Patel (32) and Rahul Chahar (0) to left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, as New Zealand snatched the momentum when it mattered the most.

India had got off to a good start with young opener Prithvi Shaw (55) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (44) putting on a confident 79-run stand for the opening wicket. Skipper Mayank Agarwal (22) got a start but could not convert it into a big knock.

After the top three, only Kishan and Axar offered resistance as Suryakumar Yadav (5) and Vijay Shankar (19) could not last long.

New Zealand A’s left-arm spin duo of Ajaz Patel (3/44) and Rachit Ravindra (2/43) did considerable damage to India’s middle and lower order.

It was Mark Chapman, who got New Zealand back into the match with an unbeaten 110-run knock.

India had reduced the host to 68 for four and then 105 for six at one stage with dismissals at regular intervals but Chapman and Todd Astle (56) raised a 136-run partnership for the seven wicket to put up a fighting total.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-a-suffer-five-run-defeat.html

93,27-1-20,NBA legend Kobe Bryant killed in helicopter crash,"NBA legend Kobe Bryant died Sunday when a helicopter he was riding in crashed and burst into flames in thick fog, killing all nine people on board including his teenage daughter and plunging the sports world into mourning.

Bryant, 41, was travelling with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when their Sikorsky S-76 helicopter slammed into a rugged hillside in Calabasas, west of Los Angeles. There were no survivors.

Bryant, a five-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medallist, is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history, an iconic figure who became one of the faces of his sport during a glittering two-decade career with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Dozens of firefighters and paramedics battled across steep terrain to reach the flaming wreckage at the crash site but found no survivors, officials said.

The National Transportation Safety Board said an 18-strong team of investigators would be sent to California to probe the causes of the crash.

Bryant's death sent shockwaves throughout the world, with basketball stars stunned by the news. ""Laker Nation, the game of basketball & our city, will never be the same without Kobe,"" former Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson wrote on Twitter.

Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan said Bryant was ""like a little brother"" to him. ""Words can't describe the pain I'm feeling,"" Jordan said. ""We used to talk often and I will miss those conversations very much.""

Tributes to Bryant flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the ""Black Mamba"" had transcended basketball.

""Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,"" former US President Barack Obama wrote on Twitter.

American football star Tom Brady wrote simply: ""We miss you already Kobe."" Brazilian soccer star Neymar paid tribute to Bryant after scoring for his French club side Paris Saint-Germain, making the number 24 -- Bryant's old shirt number -- with his fingers.

At the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, several hundred shocked fans gathered to pay tribute as the venue which witnessed many of Bryant's career highlights hosted the music industry's Grammy Awards.

""This dude is everything to me man. It makes no sense,"" said distraught Lakers fan Bobby Jimenez, sobbing as he stood outside the venue.

The Grammys got under way with a somber tribute from singer Alicia Keys.

""To be honest with you, we're all feeling crazy sadness right now,"" Keys told the audience. ""Los Angeles, America and the whole wide world lost a hero. And we're literally standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built."" Across the NBA, tributes were held at several of the eight games scheduled for Sunday.

Denver Nuggets fans began chants of ""Kobe, Kobe"" as a minute's silence was held before their game against the Houston Rockets.

In New York, Madison Square Garden was lit up in purple and gold colors of the Lakers, alongside a giant image of Bryant captioned: ""Kobe Bryant, 1978-2020."" The crash came only hours after Bryant was passed by current Lakers star LeBron James for third on the all-time NBA scoring list in a Saturday game at Philadelphia. Bryant's final post on social media had been a tweet congratulating James on surpassing him. ""Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames,"" Bryant wrote. ""Much respect my brother #33644"".

Bryant was a five-time NBA champion in a career that began in 1996 straight out of a high school and lasted until his retirement in 2016.

He also was a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helping spark the US squad of NBA stars to titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.

Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in his final appearance before his adoring fans at the Staples Center.

It was a fairytale farewell to a sporting career which had begun two decades earlier.

The son of former NBA player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia in 1978 while his father played for the 76ers.

The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA.

He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player and first guard to make such a leap.

At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

With Bryant paired alongside Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers captured three NBA crowns in a row from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988.

Bryant's career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery.

Bryant was accused of rape. He admitted to adultery but said he did not commit rape. The case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify in a trial.

A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private.

Bryant saw out his career with the Lakers, successfully branching out into the entertainment industry following his retirement.

In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film ""Dear Basketball"", a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nba-legend-kobe-bryant-killed-in-helicopter-crash-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nba-legend-kobe-bryant-killed-in-helicopter-crash.html

95,27-1-20,No power can stop Kashmiri Pandits from returning to Kashmir: DM,"No power can now stop Kashmiri Pandits from going back to Kashmir, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, forcefully defending the NDA government's decision to reorganise Jammu and Kashmir and abrogating its special status under Article 370.

In an address at a rally here, the Defence minister also sent a strong message to Pakistan and said India will not let anyone live in peace if it is harmed.

""We will not touch anyone, but if someone bothers us, then we are not going to let them live in peace,"" he said.

Referring to the exodus of a large number of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley in the late 1990s at the height of militancy, Singh said no power now can stop them from returning to their homes.

On the Citizenship Amendment Act, the minister said it is not a law to hurt the sentiments of any religion but to give relief to victims of religious persecution.

Mahatma Gandhi had told Nehru to give citizenship to minorities like Hindus and Sikhs if they come to India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fulfilled that vision by bringing in the law, Singh said.

On several non-BJP states refusing to implement the CAA, the defence minister said it it is a central law and everyone should follow it.

96,27-1-20,Keto diet may bring health benefits in short term: Study,"A ketogenic diet -- which provides 99 per cent of calories from fat and protein -- may produce health benefits in the short term, but negative effects after about a week, according to a study conducted in mice.

The study, published in the journal Nature Metabolism, suggests that the keto diet could, over limited time periods, improve human health by lowering diabetes risk and inflammation.

The keto diet has become increasingly popular as celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian, have touted it as a weight-loss regimen, the researchers noted.

The diet tricks the body into burning fat, said lead author Vishwa Deep Dixit from the Yale University in the US.

When the body's glucose level is reduced due to the diet's low carbohydrate content, the body acts as if it is in a starvation state -- although it is not -- and begins burning fats instead of carbohydrates.

This process in turn yields chemicals called ketone bodies as an alternative source of fuel.

When the body burns ketone bodies, tissue-protective gamma delta T-cells expand throughout the body.

This reduces diabetes risk and inflammation, and improves the body's metabolism, said Dixit.

After a week on the keto diet, mice show a reduction in blood sugar levels and inflammation, he said.

However, when the body is in this ""starving-not-starving"" mode, fat storage is also happening simultaneously with fat breakdown, the researchers said.

When mice continue to eat the high-fat, low-carb diet beyond one week, they consume more fat than they can burn, and develop diabetes and obesity, the researchers said.

""They lose the protective gamma delta T-cells in the fat,"" Dixit said.

Long-term clinical studies in humans are still necessary to validate the anecdotal claims of keto's health benefits, the researchers noted.

""Before such a diet can be prescribed, a large clinical trial in controlled conditions is necessary to understand the mechanism behind metabolic and immunological benefits or any potential harm to individuals who are overweight and pre-diabetic,"" Dixit said.

""Obesity and type 2 diabetes are lifestyle diseases. Diet allows people a way to be in control,"" he said.

With the latest findings, researchers now better understand the mechanisms at work in bodies sustained on the keto diet, and why the diet may bring health benefits over limited time periods.

""Our findings highlight the interplay between metabolism and the immune system, and how it coordinates maintenance of healthy tissue function,"" said Emily Goldberg, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/keto-diet-may-bring-health-benefits-in-short-term--study-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/keto-diet-may-bring-health-benefits-in-short-term--study.html

98,27-1-20,Report: Bolton says Trump tied Ukraine funds to Biden probe,"President Donald Trump told his national security adviser he wanted to maintain a freeze on military assistance to Ukraine until it aided political investigations into his Democratic rivals, according to a report in The New York Times on Sunday.

The newspaper said John Bolton's description of his exchange with Trump appears in drafts of his forthcoming book. The revelation challenges the defense offered up by Trump and his attorneys in his Senate impeachment trial and raises the stakes as the chamber decided this week whether to seek sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses.

Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president's order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment Sunday night. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who has played a prominent role in the Ukraine affair, replied to a request for comment with a text: “I used to like and respect John and tell people they were wrong about how irresponsible he was. I was wrong.” Democrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to seek witness testimony. Those prospects looked unlikely in recent days and it's unclear if the new revelations about Bolton's book will sway any GOP senators.

Democrats quickly sought to ramp up the pressure on their Republican counterparts.

“John Bolton has the evidence,” tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had no immediate comment, according to his office.

The Associated Press has not confirmed the content of Bolton's draft book. A person familiar with the matter told the AP the book had been submitted to the White House for pre-publication review, which is standard for the work of former officials with security clearances. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.

The book's publisher, Simon & Schuster, declined to comment.

Sarah Tinsley, an adviser to Bolton, said: “The ambassador's manuscript was transmitted to the White House in hard copy several weeks ago for pre-publication review by the NSC. The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period.”

Bolton attorney Charles J. Cooper said in a statement that the pre-publication review process had been “corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript.”

Democrats accuse Trump of abuse of power in withholding the military assistance to Ukraine to push that country to mount investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma, while his father was in office.

On Saturday, the president's attorneys said during their opening day of defense arguments that there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden.

The Times also reported that Bolton says he told Attorney General William Barr that he was mentioned by Trump on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A Justice Department official on Sunday disputed Bolton's account that he had told Barr about the president's call with Zelenskiy but did say that Bolton had called Barr to raise concerns about Giuliani's shadow diplomacy efforts.

Trump on Wednesday told reporters in Davos, Switzerland, that he didn't want Bolton to testify before the Senate.

“The problem with John is it's a national security problem,"" Trump said. “He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country?” He added: “It's going to be very hard. It's going to make the job very hard.”",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/report--bolton-says-trump-tied-ukraine-funds-to-biden-probe-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/report--bolton-says-trump-tied-ukraine-funds-to-biden-probe.html
99,27-1-20,Nine people dead in Kobe Bryant helicopter crash,"Nine people were killed in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of NBA star Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Los Angeles officials confirmed on Sunday.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said eight passengers and the pilot of the aircraft died in the accident.

""There were no survivors... There were nine people on board the aircraft, the pilot plus eight individuals,"" Villanueva said.

The helicopter crashed in foggy weather in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas. Authorities said firefighters received a call at 9:47 am about the crash, which caused a brush fire on a hillside.

The Los Angeles Times quoted police as saying that weather conditions were such that the Los Angeles Police Department's air support division grounded its helicopters until the afternoon, when the fog lifted.

""The weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,"" said police spokesman Josh Rubenstein.

Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said firefighters had to hike to the site with medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the blaze.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed that Bryant's daughter Gianna was among the victims.

""L.A. Is grieving with the Bryant family over the loss of Gianna, who perished with her father and friends in today's tragedy,"" Garcetti wrote on Twitter.

Gianna was one of Bryant's four children with his wife Vanessa.

The retired NBA star, 41, and Gianna were flying to a game his daughter was expected to play in when their helicopter crashed, according to US reports. Local media said the other victims included another player and a parent.

Orange Coast College confirmed that its baseball coach, John Altobelli, 56, was also on board the helicopter.

CNN said Altobelli's wife, Keri, and one of their two daughters, Alyssa, were aboard the chopper, as well.

Villaneuva told reporters the authorities would not identify the victims pending notification of family members and identification from the coroner's office.

""It would be extremely disrespectful to understand your loved one has perished and you learn about it from TMZ,"" Villanueva said, referring to the celebrity news website that first broke the news about the crash.

""That is just wholly inappropriate, so we are not going to be going there. We are going to wait until the coroner does their job."" The National Transportation Safety Board said it was dispatching an 18-person team to California to help with the investigation into the crash.

""Our team will be looking at the history of the pilot and whatever crew was on board,"" said Jennifer Homendy, a member of the NTSB.

""We will be looking at maintenance records of the helicopter. We will be looking at records of the owner and operator of the helicopter and a number of other things."" She added that the helicopter was a Sikorsky S-76B that has a black box which investigators will seek to recover.

According to data from flightradar24.Com, a flight tracking site, the chopper took off from John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana at 9:06 am.

It headed northwest, reportedly to Mamba Sports Academy in Newbury Park, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) away.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nine-people-dead-in-kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nine-people-dead-in-kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash.html

103,27-1-20,"Amit Shah dares Kejriwal to visit Shaheen Bagh,asserts Modi govt will not spare anti-nationals","Stepping up attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday dared the AAP chief to visit the anti-CAA protest site at Shaheen Bagh so that the people of Delhi can decide whom to vote for in the assembly election.

Addressing a rally in Rithala in northwest Delhi, Shah said Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were against the construction of Ram temple, the scrapping of provisions of Article 370 and were not bothered about the country's image and soldiers.

The opposition fears that they will upset their votebank, he said and asked, ""Are you their vote bank? Where is their vote bank?"" To this, the crowd replied, ""Shaheen Bagh"".

The BJP leader claimed the Delhi Police has booked Sharjeel Imam, a JNU student, on the charge of sedition for his comment of ""trying to cut chicken's neck"" and breaking the North East from the rest of the country.

""I want to ask Kejriwal whether he is in favour of apprehending Sharjeel Imam or not? Whether you are with the people of Shaheen Bagh or not, please tell the people of Delhi,"" Shah said addressing an election rally in Rithala in northwest Delhi.

Imam was one of the initial organisers of the Shaheen Bagh protest.

Hitting back at the BJP, Kejriwal alleged that the saffron party does not want to open the Shaheen Bagh stretch of the Kalindi Kunj road as it is doing ""dirty politics"" over it.

He said law and order in the national capital lies entirely with the Centre and ""if they are saying that they need permission from me, I am giving them permission, open the road in one hour"".

""I can give it to you in writing, the BJP does not want to open the route in Shaheen Bagh. The Shaheen Bagh route will remain closed till February 8 (election day) and it will open February 9,"" Kejriwal told reporters.

Calling Kejriwal a member of the 'tukde tukde' gang, a term used by the BJP to attack groups it accuses of working to promote violent leftists and separatism, Shah sought to return fire and said the protestors of Shaheen Bagh will not listen to his party.

""They will not listen to us. You people (AAP leaders) say that you are with Shaheen Bagh, if you have the guts then go and sit with them and let Delhi decide,"" Shah said.

At another election rally in Janakpuri, Shah accused Gandhi and Kejriwal of doing politics of ""vote bank"" on national issues and ""supporting"" the protest at Shaheen Bagh.

""The Modi government will not spare anti-national elements,"" he warned.

The former BJP president also attacked the Kejriwal government for not fulfilling promises like regularising temporary employees, providing free wifi, opening new schools and colleges, constructing roads and cleaning the Yamuna.

He claimed that Kejriwal came to power with the help of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement but ""completely changed"" later on.

""He had said that he would not take any government accommodation or vehicles and other facilities but after becoming chief minister he availed all these facilities,"" Shah said.

He also slammed the Delhi government for not sanctioning the prosecution of former JNU students union leader Kanhaiya Kumar in a sedition case.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/amit-shah-dares-kejriwal-to-visit-shaheen-bagh-asserts-modi-govt-will-not-spare-anti-nationals-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/amit-shah-dares-kejriwal-to-visit-shaheen-bagh-asserts-modi-govt-will-not-spare-anti-nationals.html

Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro, who was the chief guest for this year’s ceremony, watched the dazzling parade at the historic avenue in the national capital as President Ram Nath Kovind took the salute, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and a host of other leaders in attendance.

This was the third time that a Brazilian President was the Chief Guest at the Republic Day.

There were several firsts in the celebration this year, including the PM paying homage at the National War Memorial, display of Chinook and Apache helicopters in the fly past and showcasing of the A-SAT weapons system.

The band played the national anthem with a 21-gun salute in the background when the Tricolour was being unfurled at the Rajpath before the start of parade. Earlier in the day, Modi took to Twitter to extend his greetings to countrymen. “Wishing everyone a happy #RepublicDay. Jai Hind,” he tweeted. After Republic Day parade, he waved at the cheering crowd while walked on the Rajpath.

Twenty-two tableaux were on display during the parade, of which 16 were of various States and UTs and six were of Ministries, departments and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

Jammu & Kashmir, which participated in the parade for the first time as a Union Territory, had the “Back to Village’’ programme as the theme for its tableau.

While Goa’s tableau highlighted its biodiversity and “save the frog”, its anti-frog poaching campaign, Indian Air Force’s tableau was a scaled down model of Rafale aircraft, Tejas aircraft, Light Combat Helicopters, Akash Missiles System, and Astra Missiles against a sky blue background.

The tableau of the Ministry of Jal Shakti showcased Government’s new initiative “Jal Jeevan Mission” which aims to provide a functional tap connection to every rural household by 2024.

The National Disaster Response Force’s tableau showcased the cutting-edge technology used by the agency during rescue operations in flood-hit areas and Delhi’s Anaj Mandi inferno last year.

The “Dhanush” gun system, commanded by Captain Mrigank Bharadwaj, was part of the celebrations for the first time on Sunday. The gun with a maximum range of 36.5 km has the capability of automatic gun alignment and positioning. Helicopters Chinook and Apache, both recently inducted in the Indian Air Force, also took part in the flypast for the first time.

The Chinooks can airlift diverse loads in remote locations. It is a heavy lift, twin rotor helicopter which has enhanced IAF’s lift capability across a range of military and HADR missions.

The Apache, on the other hand, is a versatile helicopter capable of firing air to air and air to ground missiles, rockets and front gun aided through fire control radar which can unleash havoc on the adversary.

Captain Tania Shergill, a fourth generation Army officer, led the marching contingent of the Corps of Signals. Keeping up with the pace of technical advancement in the 21th Century, the Corps of Signals has effectively achieved electronic and information superiority to empower the Indian Army against adversaries.

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday paid homage to the fallen soldiers at the newly-built National War Memorial here on the Republic Day for the first time instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti beneath the India Gate arch. The iconic memorial in the India Gate complex behind the canopy was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25 last year.

Amar Jawan Jyoti is symbolised by an inverted bayonet and soldier’s helmet over it with an eternal flame burning beside it. It was built in 1972 underneath the India Gate arch to commemorate soldiers martyred in the Indo-Pak War of 1971.

Spread over an area of approximately 40 acres, National War Memorial comprises four concentric circles, namely — the “Amar Chakra”, “Veerta Chakra”, “Tyag Chakra” and the ‘Rakshak Chakra’ with names of 25,942 soldiers inscribed in golden letters on granite tablets.

It also includes a central 15.5-m obelisk, an eternal flame and six bronze murals depicting famous battles fought by the Indian Army, Air Force and the Navy in a covered gallery (Veerta Chakra).

The memorial is dedicated to soldiers killed during the Indo-China War in 1962, Indo-Pak Wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971, Indian Peace Keeping Force Operations in Sri Lanka and in the Kargil Conflict in 1999, and also those in the UN peacekeeping missions.

The 42 m-high India Gate was built during the British Raj as the All India War Memorial Arch to honour the soldiers who died in the First World War (1914-1918) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919). The landmark has the names of soldiers inscribed on its surface.

Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were among those who attended the celebrations.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cultural-diversity-displayed-on-r-day-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cultural-diversity-displayed-on-r-day.html
106,27-1-20,India in touch with China over 250 Indians stuck in Wuhan,"Death toll due to coronavirus in China rises to 56

India on Sunday said it is examining “all options” in consultations with the Chinese Government to address the concerns of over 250 stranded Indians, including students, in Wuhan, the epicentre of the fast spreading coronavirus. India has also stepped up vigil in districts bordering Nepal where a person has been found to be affected with the virus.

The death toll due to new coronavirus in China rose to 56 on Sunday with confirmed cases of viral affliction reaching 2,008, including 23 from abroad. The Indian Embassy in Beijing said India has opened a third hotline in view of “large number” of phone calls from the Indians who are mostly students.

“In view of the large number of calls received in the two hotline numbers set up by @EOIBeijing in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus infection, @EOIBeijing has decided to open a third hotline number +8618610952903,” the Embassy said in a tweet.

The other two hotline numbers are 8618612083629 +8618612083617, the Embassy said. The Embassy has also said it is “examining all options” and holding consultations with the Chinese to provide relief to the Indians holed up in Wuhan.

“Over the last two days our hotlines have fielded nearly 600 calls to respond to concerns regarding this difficult situation. GoI and @EOIBeijing are also examining all options, including through consultations with the Chinese authorities, to provide relief to our affected citizens,” another tweet by the Embassy said.

The reference to “all options” was seen as a pointer to explore the option to evacuate the stranded Indians. About 700 Indian students are believed to have been enrolled into several universities in the city and surrounding areas.

Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading.

While the majority of the Indian students, mostly medical students reported to have left a few weeks ago to avail the Chinese New Year holidays, over 250 to 300 are still reportedly stayed put in the city causing concerns to them and their parents back home about their safety.

A number of Indian PHD students also studied in different universities in Wuhan and the surrounding areas.

Some students managed to leave before the city just before it was sealed off on January 23.

The Indian Embassy on Sunday also cancelled the Republic Day ceremony, owing to the rising concern of the virus which has spread to all provinces except Tibet.

Meanwhile, Union Health Ministry issued a statement here saying that health teams have been deployed at border areas of Nepal at Jhulaghat and Jauljibi, district Pithoragarh.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), which on Saturday reviewed India’s preparedness to deal with any situation arising out of the outbreak, is keeping a close watch in the matter.

India has already issued travel advisories for Indians travelling to China as the fast-spreading coronavirus became a major cause of worry. The virus, which originated in Wuhan city of China in December, has spread in various cities around the world including United States, Australia and France. Around 2,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported in the east Asian country.

The outbreak also has struck at possibly the worst time for China, when hundreds of millions of people are travelling across the country or overseas to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s most important festival.

In India, 11 people in four cities have been kept under observation after they returned from China and showed mild symptoms of viral infection. But none has found to be tested positive so far.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-in-touch-with-china-over-250-indians-stuck-in-wuhan-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-in-touch-with-china-over-250-indians-stuck-in-wuhan.html
107,27-1-20,FIR against the brains behind Shaheen Bagh stir for hate speeches,"The Delhi Police has registered a First Information Report (FIR) on Sunday against Sharjeel Imam, an activist who came in limelight during the ongoing protest in Shaheen Bagh against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the planned National Register of Citizens (NRC).

According to the police, Imam, a resident of Bihar and former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student, delivered “very inflammatory and instigating speeches in his opposition to CAA and NRC”.

“He had previously delivered one such speech in Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13 last year and thereafter one even more inflammatory against the Government which is being widely circulated on social media,” a senior police official said. These speeches have the “potential to harm the religious harmony” and the unity and integrity of India, for which the case was registered against him, police said.

A sedition case was lodged against Imam on Saturday for a speech he delivered on the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus on January 16. The Assam Police have also filed an FIR under the anti-terror law UAPA against Imam for his speech.

Imam was seen in a video that has gone viral on the social media delivering inflammatory speeches against CAA and NRC outside Jamia. Imam was heard saying in an audio clip that Assam should be cut off from the rest of India and taught a lesson, as Bengalis — both Hindus and Muslims — are being killed or put into detention centres.

He reportedly said if he can organise five lakh people, it would become possible to “permanently cut off Assam with rest of India...If not permanently, then at least for a few months”.

A case against Imam under IPC sections 124 A (an offence by words, either spoken or written causes disaffection against Government established by law), 153 A (promoting enmity between different religious groups with an intent to create disharmony) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) has been registered, the Delhi police said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fir-against-the-brains-behind-shaheen-bagh-stir-for-hate-speeches-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/fir-against-the-brains-behind-shaheen-bagh-stir-for-hate-speeches.html
108,27-1-20,ULFA(I) owns up to 4 blasts in Assam on Republic Day,"Banned outfit ULFA (Independent) has claimed responsibility for the four powerful explosions in Assam earlier on Sunday prior to Republic Day celebrations in the State.

The ULFA(I), in a statement signed by Lt Joy Asom of its Publicity Department, claimed that all the four blasts were carried out by the outfit.

The Paresh Barua-led ULFA(I), along with a few other militant outfits of the Northeast, had called for a boycott of the Republic Day celebrations in the region.

Three blasts had taken place in Dibrugarh and one in Charaideo districts of Upper Assam in a span of 10 minutes — between 8.15 and 8.25 am on Sunday, a police officer said. There has been no report of any casualty, as Republic Day being a holiday, people were mostly indoors, he said.

The first blast was reported outside a shop at Teokghat in Sonari police station area of Charaideo district.

Three explosions followed soon after in Dibrugarh district -- two at Graham Bazar and AT Road, beside a gurudwara, and another at the oil town of Duliajan Tiniali, just 100 metres from the local police station, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Padmanabh Barua told PTI.

CCTV footages available at Duliajan Tiniali showed two motorcycle-borne youths lobbing a grenade and speeding away, the ASP explained.

The blasts at Graham Bazar and AT Road were carried out with time-induced Improvised Explosive Devices, he stated.

Taking to Twitter, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal condemned the blasts and vowed to take strong action against the culprits.

“Strongly condemn the bomb blasts in a few places of Assam. This cowardly attempt to create terror on a sacred day only exhibits the frustration of the terror groups after their total rejection by the people. Our Govt will take the sternest action to bring the culprits to book,” he tweeted.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ulfa-i--owns--up-to-4-blasts-in-assam-on-republic-day.html
109,27-1-20,620-km serpentine anti-CAA human chain in Kerala,"After Shaheen Bagh like sit-in protests in different parts of the country, now human chains are coming up to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). On Republic Day, the ruling Left Front held a massive 620-km human chain in Kerala involving millions of protesters, while a 11-km long human chain was held in Kolkata. In Bihar, thousands of people, including a large number of women and children, formed a human chain to protest against CAA-NRC-NPR on Saturday.

The LDF organised the human chain from Kasaragod in north Kerala to Kaliyakkavilai in the southernmost part of the State. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI leader Kanam Rajendran joined the protest in Thiruvananthapuram. The LDF leaders claimed that around 60 to 70 lakh people participated in the human chain. The human chain was formed at 4 pm, following which the preamble of the Constitution was read out.

Later, an oath was taken to protect the Constitution from the “attempts of the Central Government” to destroy it. CPI(M) polit bureau members S Ramachandran Pillai was the first link of the 620-km-long human chain at Kasaragod, while MA Baby was the last link at Kaliyakkavilai. Many prominent personalities from all walks of life participated in the human chain. In Kolkata, the United Interfaith Foundation India (UIFI), an inter-faith group organised 11 kilometer human chain from Golpark to Shyambazar.

“We have formed a human chain on Republic Day as we want to drive home the message that we — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains — are one. Everyone stands united as an Indian citizen and we will never allow anyone to sow the seeds of discord among us,” UIFI general secretary Satnam Ahluwalia told PTI.

He said leaders of different communities and members of their communities actively participated in the human chain, covering areas like Park Circus seven-point crossing, Mullick Bazar, Ripon Street-AJC Bose Road crossing, Nonapukur, Raja Bazar and Maniktala.

The ruling Trinamool Congress continued its protest against CAA and NRC at four venues in Kolkata. At Rani Rashmoni Avenue, the women’s wing on Saturday protested against the remark of Kailash Vijayvargiya, the BJP national general secretary and its Bengal minder, who had said on Thursday that he found the eating habits of some of the construction labourers working at his house in Indore “strange” as they were eating only ‘poha’ (flattened rice).

The Opposition parties, including the CPM and the Congress, also organised separate protests across West Bengal and took oath to uphold the Constitution.

On the occasion of the Republic Day, Left-wing students of universities and colleges in the city took out a rally from Nakhoda Masjid to Jorasanko, the birthplace of Rabindranath Tagore. Protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed NRC, they took a pledge that “they will not allow the country to be divided again”. “Nakhoda Masjid represents cosmopolitan and inclusive character of Kolkata on Eid and other festivals while Tagore began his ‘padayatra’ against partition of Bengal from Jorasanko to Baghbazar in 1905. Hence, in the troubled times, we chose the two places,” Sayan Chakraborty, a student of Presidency University, said.

Anti-CAA protesters in Lucknow’s Ghantaghar area celebrated the Republic Day by hoisting the Tricolour and reading out the preamble to the Constitution. Meraj Haider, a protester, said,”The day started with the hoisting of the flag at Ghantaghar (Clock Tower), which was followed by the rendering of songs by those gathered there. The preamble to the Constitution was also read out.” He said it was a unique day as people from different walks of life gathered at Ghantaghar in large numbers to protest the CAA and the NRC. Rajiv Yadav, a member of the Rihai Manch that backed the protest, said the agitation against the CAA-NRC-NPR at the Ghantaghar have assumed an artistic dimension.

In Bihar, on Satruday five Left parties formed one-hour human chain in Patna and district headquarters demand withdrawal of CAA and protest on proposed NRC. CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI state secretary Satya Narayan Sing, CPM leaders Subhashini Ali and Sarvoday Sharma joined the human chain in Patna. Leaders from Congress, Hindustani Awam MOrcha(Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Vikassheel Insaan Party also joined the human chain organized from Buddha Smriti Park to Gandhi Maidan in Patna.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/620-km-serpentine-anti-caa-human-chain-in-kerala.html

114,27-1-20,Facebook blames Apple iOS for Bezos' phone hacking,"Facebook has blamed Apple's operating system for the hacking of Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' phone, saying WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is unhackable.

Investigators believe that Bezos's iPhone was compromised after he received a 4.4MB video file containing malware via WhatsApp - in the same way when phones of 1,400 select journalists and human rights activists were broken into by Pegasus software from Israel-based NSO Group last year.

In an interview to the BBC last week, Facebook's Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, said it wasn't WhatsApp's fault because end-to-end encryption is unhackable and blamed Apple's operating system for Bezos' episode.

""It sounds like something on the, you know, what they call the operate, operated on the phone itself. It can't have been anything on the, when the message was sent, in transit, because that's end-to-end encrypted on WhatsApp,"" Clegg told the show host.

Clegg compared the hack to opening a malicious email, saying that ""it only comes to life when you open it"".

According to a report from FTI Consulting, a firm that has investigated Bezos' phone, after that the video file was received, Bezos' phone started sending unusually large amounts of outbound data, including his intimate messages with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez.

According to Clegg, ""something"" must have affected the phone's operating system.

""As sure as you can be that the technology of end-to-end encryption cannot, other than unless you have handset, or you have the message at either end, cannot be hacked into,"" he was quoted as saying.

Apple was yet to comment on Facebook's statement.

The NSO Group has denied it was part of Bezos' hacking.

WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption by default, which means only the sender and recipient can view the messages. But the piece of NSO Group software exploited WhatsApp's video calling system by installing the spyware via missed calls to snoop on the selected users.

According to leading tech policy and media consultant Prasanto K. Roy, end-to-end encrypted apps (E2EE) do provide security, and messages or calls cannot be intercepted and decrypted en route without enormous computing resources.

""But once anyone can get to your handset, whether a human or a piece of software, the encryption doesn't matter anymore. Because on your handset, it's all decrypted,"" Roy told IANS recently.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/facebook-blames-apple-ios-for-bezos--phone-hacking-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/facebook-blames-apple-ios-for-bezos--phone-hacking.html
115,27-1-20,Democrats demand Bolton testify as impeachment trial resumes,"The stakes over witness testimony at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial are rising now that a draft of a book from former national security adviser John Bolton appears to undercut a key defense argument.

Bolton writes in the forthcoming book that Trump told him that he wanted to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with politically charged investigations, including into Democratic rival Joe Biden.

Trump's legal team has repeatedly insisted that the president never tied the suspension of military assistance to the country to investigations that he wanted into Biden and his son.

The account immediately gave Democrats new fuel in their pursuit of sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses, a question expected to be taken up later this week by the Republican-led Senate. The trial resumes Monday afternoon with arguments from Trump's defense team.

Bolton's account was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity to discuss the book, “The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir,"" ahead of its release March 17.

When the Times report went online Sunday night, the seven House Democratic managers immediately called on all senators to insist that Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other relevant documents. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, issued the same call.

Trump denied the claims in a series of tweets early Monday. “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”

Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call, and statements by Ukraine President Vlodymyr Zelinskiy that there was no pressure for such investigations to get the aid.

Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president's order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.

“Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President — that starts with Mr. Bolton,"" the impeachment managers said in a statement.

First, though, Trump's legal team will begin laying out its case in depth, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.

The lawyers revealed the broad outlines of their defense in a rare but truncated Saturday session, where they accused House Democrats of using the impeachment case to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.

The legal team is expected to pick up on that theme and also dive into areas that received negligible attention during the Democrats' presentation, including the now-concluded investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.

Trump's lawyers aren't expected to take as much time for their arguments as the Democrats, whose impeachment managers spoke for about 24 hours over three days. But they also don't need to: Acquittal is likely in a Senate where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction. Still, they see an opportunity to counter the allegations, defend the powers of the presidency and prevent Trump from being weakened politically ahead of November's election.

Trump faces two articles of impeachment. One accuses him of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, at the same time that his administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from the country. The other alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by directing aides to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.

The legal team will portray Trump as having been harassed by investigations from federal agents — and Democrats — since he took office, and seize on the FBI's recent acknowledgment of surveillance errors during the Russia probe. The lawyers have already hinted that they will focus attention on Biden just as he campaigns for a first-place finish in next week's Iowa caucuses.

Monday's presentation is expected to include appearances by Alan Dershowitz, who will argue that impeachable offenses require criminal-like conduct, and Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is also expected to make arguments.

Many legal scholars reject Dershowitz's arguments, saying the Founding Fathers meant for impeachable offenses to incorporate a broad range of conduct by presidents. Dershowitz told The Associated Press last week that he understood that some critics thought his argument was “bonkers” but encouraged them to listen nonetheless.

Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.

117,27-1-20,Nighttime rocket attack on US Embassy in Baghdad injured 1,"A nighttime rocket attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad injured at least one embassy personnel member, staffers there said on Monday.

The two staff members, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media, did not specify the injured person's nationality or the severity of their wounds. They said the rocket slammed into a restaurant inside the embassy compound.

Violence between Iraqi security forces and anti-government protesters also continued to seethe overnight, with one protester shot dead in a violent crackdown in the country's south. Unrest was also ongoing in the capital Baghdad with fresh clashes near the central Khilani Square.

The US Embassy is within the Iraqi capital's Green Zone, and has been a flashpoint amid wider regional tensions between the US and Iran, which have played out inside Iraq in recent weeks. Iraqi supporters of an Iran-backed militia stormed the embassy compound on December 31, smashing the main door and setting fire to the reception area.

At least five katyusha rockets landed inside the Green Zone on Sunday, according to a US military statement. It was the third rocket attack targeting the US Embassy this month, and the perpetrators were not immediately known. Previous attacks caused no injuries.

The US has accused Iran-backed militias of targeting US interests by attacking military bases housing Americans and diplomatic missions.

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi condemned the attack in a statement, asserting Iraq's commitment to protecting diplomatic missions in the country.

Iraq has been roiled by over four months of demonstrations criticizing alleged government corruption, high unemployment and Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. Security forces have killed at least 500 protesters. The country is also facing a political clash over naming the next prime minister.

Near Baghdad's Khilani Square, security forces fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Security forces also chased after demonstrators and beat them.

A female anti-government protester was overpowered, dragged by the hair and pinned down by a member of the security forces outside Baghdad's municipality building, a rare occurrence in the largely male-dominated front-lines of the demonstrations.

The security personnel conducted a search of the female protester and tore off a protective face mask she was wearing as a witness threw stones.

The latest protester's death came amid a violent pre-dawn crackdown by security forces on a protest camp in the southern city of Nasiriyah, an activist and a medical official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Police fired live rounds to disperse crowds from a central square in Nasiriyah where protesters were staging a sit-in, prompting demonstrators to flee. The encampment site was later burned. It was not immediately clear whether security forces or unknown groups had torched it. The city has been a center of unrest since the protests began.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nighttime-rocket-attack-on-us-embassy-in-baghdad-injured-1-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nighttime-rocket-attack-on-us-embassy-in-baghdad-injured-1.html

119,27-1-20,"94,000 personnel hit as in-red SSB puts on hold two months allowance","Funds shortage has hit hard 94,261 officers and jawans of Sashastra Seema Bal, who guard the frontiers along Nepal and Bhutan borders. The SSB has decided to stop the payment of arrears and allowances for the months of January and February due to “paucity of funds.” The SSB is barely able to pay the salaries minus the allowances and arrears.

Earlier, the CRPF had stopped ration allowance due to non-sanction of `800 crore sought by the force. However, the ration money allowance was said to be resumed subsequent to media reports about stoppage of the same. Allowances like Children Education Allowance, Leave Travel Concession (LTC), leave encashment and Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) will not be paid to the SSB personnel and they will be entitled only to the salary for January and February.

“It is informed that available funds under code head 1 salary is hardly sufficient to clear the regular salary bills for the month of January and February, 2020. Therefore, due to paucity of funds, it is requested that available funds under code head 1 salary be earmarked for regular salary bills for 2 months i.e. January and February-2020 only and no other arrears of pay & allowances, ACP/MACP and CEA/LTC/Leave Encashment claims should be preferred,” reads the communication issued by the SSB headquarters here on January 23 and sent to all the formations of the force across the country.

The letter further said, “It is requested not to entertain RPT (repeat) not to entertain any other claims except regular bills of January 7 February-2020. This issues with the approval of IG (Administration), FHQ (Force Headquarters), New Delhi.”

Without denying the move, a peeved SSB Director General Kumar Rajesh Chandra said, “Write whatever you wish to, I don’t care.”

Earlier, Chandra did not respond to a text message seeking the reasons for the paucity of funds leading to the stoppage of the allowances and arrears of the force’s personnel and a timeline for restoration of the dues under allowances and arrears of pay.

The copy of the letter has been sent to SSB formations in Lucknow, Patna, Guwahati, Tezpur, Ranikhet, Siliguri, Srinagar, Bhilai, Jammu and academies and training centres in Bhopal, Alwar and Gwaldam among others.

Confirming the development, officials said additional funds have been sought from the Union Home Ministry to meet the shortfall and the allowances will be restored once the grants are received from the Government.

They said this is the first time they are facing such an exigency on the financial front and is bound to be demoralising for the ranks.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/94-000-personnel-hit-as--in-red-ssb-puts-on-hold-two-months-allowance-2020-01-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/94-000-personnel-hit-as--in-red-ssb-puts-on-hold-two-months-allowance.html
