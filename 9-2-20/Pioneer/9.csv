0,09-2-20,CAA vs UCC: Duplicity of expedient secularists,"It’s a small incident that was barely covered in the media. But it is a very revealing incident that tells you why identity issues are in the political forefront these days.

Last Friday, a day when parliamentary time is kept aside for Private Members Bills, the Rajya Sabha listed a Bill to be moved by BJP member Kirori Lal Meena entitled The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill 2020. The Bill called for the “constitution of the National Inspection and Investigation Committee for preparation of Uniform Civil Code and its implementation throughout the territory of India and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” In plain language, the Bill sought to constitute a committee that would draft an actual Uniform Civil Code, applicable to all citizens of India, as a precursor to its acceptance by Parliament. This Bill, therefore, sought to make the UCC more than just a mere idea and actually formulate concrete proposals on subjects such as marriage, divorce and inheritance that would form the basis of a secular discussion on personal laws. In short, it tried to take the discussion of personal laws outside denominational personal laws that are in vogue now.

The Bill, unfortunately, lapsed since its mover was not present in the Rajya Sabha that afternoon. That is besides the point. What is more significant is that a CPI(M) member wrote to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha to stop the Bill from being discussed. According to a letter written by Elamaram Kareem, a CPI(M) member from Kerala, “This Bill violates the fundamental aspects of the Constitution and there is a chance to affect the communal harmony of the country. As you may be aware of the protests going on in different parts of the country against Citizenship (Amendment) Act; introduction of this Bill in the current circumstances will further aggravate the situation. Considering all these, you are earnestly requested not to allow permission to introduce the The Uniform Civil Code in India Bill 2020…”

Kareem’s letter is revealing in two respects.

First, he has suggested that any discussion on the subject is violative of the Constitution. This comes at a time when the anti-CAA protests, in which the CPI(M) has assumed a significant role — at least in intellectual circles — have made the defence of the Constitution a major feature. Yet, it has chosen to debunk a specific feature of the Directive Principles that calls upon subsequent governments to formulate a UCC. True, the Constitution-makers did not specify any time when a UCC should be on the statute books. However, they legitimised the idea. Today, the CPI(M) describes any discussion on the subject as provocative and violative of the Constitution.

This prompts the inevitable conclusion that the Constitution is an expedient device of politicians to veto anything they don’t approve of. They organise mass recitations of the Preamble, as modified in 1976, but they are unwilling to look at the Constitution in totality. What comes through is their conviction that the provision on UCC in the Directive Principles is actually violative of the Constitution. If that is their belief, it should be stated explicitly.

Secondly, any discussion on the UCC is as yet totally theoretical. There is the idea that Indian personal laws should be one, rather than faith specific. However, the debate suffers from an absence of specifics. What will be the clauses that determine divorce? Will gender equity be a feature of the UCC? How are customary laws to be accommodated within the UCC? These are legitimate queries whose answers will go a very long way to disabuse fears of the UCC in some communities. Yet, how can the discussions proceed if the exercise of drafting a UCC is deemed illegitimate? In the past, Supreme Court judgments have pressed governments to urgently consider a UCC. This is now being resolutely opposed for the flimsiest of reasons.

For a very long time, any progress towards a UCC was stalled by the assertion that the demand for uniform laws must come from within the minority communities. In effect, the Muslim community, which was vehemently opposed to any UCC since it was deemed to be against their faith, was given a political veto. This veto was additionally based on not knowing what a UCC would look like. Thus, the first attempt a back bench MP makes to introduce some clarity into the debate is met by the assertion that it is violative of the Constitution. This implies that “secular” forces would like this Muslim veto to continue in perpetuity. Additionally, they would like no debate on the subject to proceed.

For the past two months, the government has been pilloried for its insufficient faith in secularism. However, when it comes to the crunch and the details of a secular legislation are being debated — and only to press for a committee-made draft — the secularists have bared their fangs. Is it any wonder that large numbers of people in contemporary India believe that what passes off as secularism in India is religious vote bank politics.

What did and did not transpire in the Rajya Sabha last week will barely merit a footnote in the future. That may be so but it joins the list of double standards that has given secularism a bad name in India.

The government should not be deterred by the fact that a Private Member’s Bill has lapsed. It should suo moto delegate the drafting of a UCC to the Law Commission.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/caa-vs-ucc--duplicity-of-expedient-secularists.html
1,09-2-20,Junk may strengthen economy: Poddar,"Member of Parliament Mahesh Poddar today said that junk can be a means to strengthen country's economy. “At present, only 5.5 million tonnes i.e. 60 per cent of the total plastic waste is recycled in our country. We have to take such measures so that the remaining 40 per cent of the plastic can be recycled.

Likewise, only 40–45 per cent of ferrous metals can be recycle, we have to ensure that we recycle 100 per cent of the waste generated,” he said addressing the 7th Conference of the Material Recycling Association of India #MRAI held in Gurgaon on ""Responsible Recycling for Nation Building"".

Poddar said that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman mentioned ""Poddar"" in order of discussion of Harappan culture in the Budget speech, calling them to convert metal into fund. In the 21st century, we can all become poddars, recycle waste and increase the revenue of the country.

He said that India's recycling industry currently adds a value of Rs 12 lakh crore to the economy. This means that it contributes about 5 per cent to India's total GDP, generates over 50 million jobs and greenhouse gas emissions Reduces by more than 23 per cent. Recycling provides employment to the lowest strata of society, mostly in the unorganized sector.

Poddar said, “Around us there are garbage pickers or small scale businessmen; we should be grateful to them. It is a different matter that we often ignore them. These are in fact the most important contributors to the recycling series.

After this, local bodies have a role to recycle various types of waste. The topmost link to this important series is some bodies like MRAI, which promote and promote awareness about recycling in India.”

In his address, Poddar stated the need for a body at the national level which can advise and advise the policy, programs, targets and operations in relation to waste management and recycling to the Central and various state governments and the implementation of the current legislations.

Poddar has also introduced a private member bill in the House titled ""National Council for Waste Management Bill 2020"" while proposing the establishment of such a body.Poddar also thanked the Minister of State for Shipping, Mansukh Mandavia for the Recycling of Ships Act, 2019. India is the global hub of the ship recycling industry with a share of over 33 per cent and because of this the act was long needed.

With the passage of this act, India will now follow the Hong Kong Convention which complies with aspects related to the design, construction, operation and preparation of ships to facilitate safe and environmentally sound recycling of vessels.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/junk-may-strengthen-economy--poddar.html

4,09-2-20,JD(U) MLC expresses concern over Lalu’s health,"JD (U)’s MLC Mohammed Javed Iqbal visited the State Capital from Bihar on Saturday to meet RJD Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Saturday. Former MLA Ajit Kumar Jha also met the RJD chief.

Lalu Prasad is convicted in the Fodder Scam cases. He is incarcerated under Birsa Munda Jail of the State Capital and is currently getting treatment for illnesses at RIMS in Ranchi. Saturday is the day which is scheduled to meet Lalu Prasad. On this day a maximum of three people can meet him. However, he can be met on other days also under certain circumstances.

While coming outside the hospital talking to media Iqbal expressed concern over Lalu Prasad’s poor health and he said that he visited the hospital to know about health of RJD Supremo. Avoiding a direct answer to the question of leaving JD (U) and joining RJD Iqbal informed in a gesture that Bihar needs a young leadership. If I will make decision in this direction then must inform, said the MLC. About Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he said, “You all know, I do not need to tell anything about him.”

“Lalu ji has become very weak and need better treatment. There is a need for youth leadership in Bihar assembly elections. The people of Bihar want change. Nitish Kumar was a good leader and media persons know everything. Lalu Prasad had made him an MLA by giving him the party ticket three times,” said Iqbal.

Former MLA Ajit Kumar Jha, who came out after meeting Lalu Prasad, expressed concern about Lalu’s health. After the meeting, it was found that his health continued to fluctuate a lot, he added.

Jha said that there was no discussion with Lalu Prasad about the Bihar election and politics. On the election in Delhi, he said that Kejriwal's Government is going to be elected once again with thumping margin and BJP will be defeated in Delhi elections also.

On the question of contesting RJD candidates in Delhi elections, he said that RJD has fielded four of its candidates there in consultation with Arvind Kejriwal to defeat the BJP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jd-u--mlc-expresses-concern-over-lalu---s-health.html
5,09-2-20,Mercury likely to drop below normal by 2-4 degree Celsius,"The erratic weather conditions being experienced across Jharkhand are likely to continue for the next few days. Ranchiites too need to brace themselves as the mercury level is expected to fall further by another two to four degrees.

According to the Meteorological Centre, Ranchi from February 9 onwards, the clouds are expected to clear away and the weather will also become dry with no chances of rainfall for the next few days.

“The normal minimum temperature for this time of the year is around 11 degree Celsius. Once the cloud cover clears, this is expected to fall by two to three degrees. North west Jharkhand along with parts of central Jharkhand can also experience cold wave conditions for the next few days,” said Deputy Director, MET Centre Ranchi, Abhishek Anand. As per the weather bulletin released by the MET Department, on February 8, isolated places in the central and southern parts of Jharkhand received rainfall. The capital city is also expected to remain cloudy and light showers are being predicted in the evening hours. It also stated that in the next 24 hours, the minimum temperature will fall by two to four degree Celsius across the State.

“Currently, an induced western disturbance which is a normal phenomenon throughout the year is causing cyclonic circulation over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining interiors of Odisha. This is not touching Jharkhand directly but is interacting with the winds close to the region and having an effect over the State,” added the official.

As per the weathermen, most of the places across the State will have fog or mist in the early morning hours. This will continue for a few days and after that Jharkhand is likely to have clear weather conditions.

The weather conditions have not only affected human life but the severe cold along with rains occurring in the month of February is also having an adverse effect in the agriculture sector across the State.

7,09-2-20,Mines auction: Majority mining offenders in race,"While e-auction of mines is underway now, a majority of companies participating in the bid process are found to be mining offenders.

According to the State Government’s plan, 100 mines would be put to e-action for 50 years. According to the MSTC website, the first phase of auction bidding notice was issued in February 2016 for two limestone mines followed by second phase auction notice for four mineral blocks in December 2016 and third phase auction notice issues for three blocks in 2017 and notice issued to five mines in fourth phase in 2018. In 2019, the Director mines notified for auction bidding of seven mines in July, two mineral blocks in September, nine in October and 20 mines in December. Notices were issued for two more mineral blocks in January 2020.

So far, the Sirajuddin and Co has succeeded in retaining the Balda iron ore mine of 135 hectare in Keonjhar district at a premium of 118.05 %. The Arcellor Mittal has bagged the Thakurani mines at a premium of 107.5%. The Syam Ores has quoted the highest bid of 135% premium to take over Jilling Iron Mines. The Jindal Steel Works (JSW) has grabbed the Ganua mines in Sundergarh district at 132% premium, Nuagaon mines at 95.2% premium, Aryan Mining and Trading Corp, Narayan posi at 98.55% and Jajang Iron Mines at a premium of 110%.

Majority of the mines are lapsing on March 31, 2020 and many existing lessees have been fined for illegal mining by the Supreme Court. Most of the existing mining companies bidding in the auction are serious violators of mining, environment and forest laws, illegal mining and some have vigilance cases and forest cases pending against them.

It is a debate if tainted miners should be allowed to take part in the auction.

Another question arises as to whether these companies who have taken the mines on auction will be able to operate them with such non viable high premium rates.

For example, Syam Ores has to pay 135% of the sale value of iron ore, as set by the IBM, to the Government. Apart from this, the company will pay a royalty 15% of base price, District Mineral Fund contribution 30% of Royalty and NMET (National Mineral Exploration Trust) 2% of Royalty. This does not include the sales tax, GST and other commercial taxes levied on the sale of mineral and its transportation. At least 50% expenditure of the sale price will incur towards mineral raising cost per tone and the hefty dues of crores for NPV, Forest Clearance, surface rent etc to be borne by the lessee too. It means if iron sale price is Rs 1,000 per tonne, then Syam Ores would require paying Rs 1,548 per tonne as premium, royalty, DMF, NMET deposit to the Government and spending Rs 700 per ton to do the mining. Hence by selling ore at Rs 1,000 per tonne, the company would spend Rs 2,248.

The high premiums are set to put iron ore prices on a different orbit altogether. Since many of the large companies are emerging as the winners, they are expected to become new price makers in the

market.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mines-auction--majority-mining-offenders-in-race.html

A 10-year-old girl was killed after a van carrying schoolchildren overturned in Kushinagar district on Saturday.

According to reports, the van was carrying nine other children who escaped unhurt.

The van had picked up the 10 schoolchildren from Madanour Sukrouli village and it overturned near Sarangchapra village, Station House Officer of Khadda, Ram Ashish Yadav said, adding that the van was being driven at a very high speed.

“The girl, Pratibha, came under the van as a door of the vehicle was missing,” he said.

Locals rushed the girl to the Khadda primary health centre where doctors pronounced her dead, the police said, adding that the driver escaped after the accident.

“An FIR has been registered against the driver and he will be arrested soon. The body of the deceased has been sent for an autopsy and the van has been impounded,” Yadav said.

“An FIR has also been registered against the school manager, Shashikant Chaturvedi, and principal, Akhilesh Chaturvedi,” he added.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed grief over the death of the girl, a statement issued by the state government said in Lucknow.

The chief minister also directed the officials of the local administration to take all necessary steps to provide best treatment to those injured.

9,09-2-20,Posters of ‘missing’ Akhilesh appear in Azamgarh,"



|

Irked by the prolonged absence of local parliamentarian and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav from the district during crisis, posters of ‘Missing MP’ appeared on the walls in Azamgarh on Saturday.

Adorning the walls of the district collectorate and prominent localities of the city, the posters questioned the reason for the silence of Akhilesh over the recent lathi-charge on women protesters by the police.

The SP claimed that Congress leaders of Azamgarh were behind the conspiracy to malign the image of Akhilesh Yadav.

On February 6, the police had cane-charged and fired tear gas shells at the people staging protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Azamgarh. Later 19 protesters were arrested and charged with sedition. Those arrested were sent to jail and FIRs were lodged against 35 persons.

Local Muslim women had gathered at Johar Park in Bilariyaganj area to protest against the CAA when they were cane-charged by the police. To prevent them from continuing the dharna, the police also flooded the park with water. The protesters alleged that they were pelted with stones by the police and later cane-charged.

While denying lathicharge, the police admitted that tear gas shells were fired to disperse the protesters from the park and that women were hurt due to stone-pelting by people who had gathered near the park.

Angered by this, locals in Azamgarh, especially Muslims, hit out at Akhilesh Yadav for his long absence from the constituency.

Akhilesh has visited the constituency only once after winning the election in May last year.

So far, the SP chief has not issued even a formal statement condemning the police action in Azamgarh. He has confined his displeasure on the action through some tweets and defended the right of the people to protest.

Meanwhile, the SP set up a committee to enquire into the incidents of police lathicharge on anti CAA protesters on February 5. The committee comprises local MLA Durga Prasad Yadav, former minister Ram Murti Verma, MLAs Nafis Ahmed, Sangram Singh and Subhash Rai, MLCs Ramratan Rajbhar and Rakesh Kumar and former Azamgarh SP unit chief Havaldar Yadav.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/posters-of----missing----akhilesh-appear-in-azamgarh.html
10,09-2-20,Govt may rename Basti after sage Vashishth,"After renaming Allahabad as Prayagraj and Faizabad as Ayodhya, the Yogi Adityanath government is likely to change the name of Basti district to Vashishth Nagar or Vashishthi.

The Basti district administration has sent a proposal to the state government in this regard.

A year back, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had named Basti medical college as Maharishi Vashishth Medical College that led to the demand for renaming the district after the Vedic sage.

A proposal in this regard was sent to the Board of Revenue two months back and it sought some clarifications form the Basti administration.

Official sources said that the cost of renaming the district would be around Rs 1 crore.

It may be mentioned here that BJP MP from Basti, Harish Dwivedi, and BJP MLA Ajay Kumar Singh have already written a letter to Yogi Adityanath demanding renaming of the district.

One of the oldest and most revered Vedic rishis, Vashishth is the subject of many mythologies, according to which he was in possession of divine cow Kamdhenu and her child Nandin who could grant anything to their owners. The sage is famous in Hindu mythology for his legendary conflict with Sage Vishwamitra too. It is believed that the original name of Basti was Vashishthi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-may-rename-basti-after-sage-vashishth.html

12,09-2-20,DefExpo has given a new identity to UP: CM Yogi,"

|

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the DefExpo 2020 had changed the perception of the state at the global level and its successful conclusion had given a new identity to Uttar Pradesh.

“The DefExpo 2020 was both a huge challenge and a big opportunity as 23 MoUs were signed entailing investment of Rs 50,000 crore and employment potential for nearly three lakh youths. People will cherish the memory of the event for a long time,” Yogi said at the valedictory function on Saturday.

The 11th edition of DefExpo, a flagship biennial event of the Defence Ministry, concluded in Lucknow on Saturday.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh presided over the valedictory session. He said that during the four-day DefExpo, people witnessed a fast emerging new India.

“It is a prosperous, powerful and competent India and the DefExpo heralded its arrival. The expo has given a global identity to Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh,” the defence minister said.

The chief minister said that the defence expo was a unique event which gave an opportunity to the people to have a close view of chivalry and bravery of the Indian armed forces and their preparedness to deal with any eventuality.

“The defence expo was like a mahakumbh. The event has given the much needed push to the defence (industrial) corridor being developed in UP. I am confident that the state will emerge as an important hub of defence manufacturing,” Yogi said.

“After the success of the DefExpo, no one will ever a point the finger at our ability and competence. We have achieved new heights with each such event and other states will have to put in lots of efforts to equal the performance of UP government,” the chief minister said.

Yogi further said that the defence expo was a memorable event which was successfully organised in association with the Defence Ministry.

“We had to face the naysayers when UP Investors’ Summit was organised in February, 2018. Who will invest in UP, was the common refrain. We proved all sceptics wrong and MoUs worth Rs 5 lakh crore were signed and investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore has been achieved so far,” the chief minister said.

Yogi also listed Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj in 2019 which was visited by over 24 crore pilgrims, Pravasi Bhartiya Diwas at Varanasi, and National Youth Festival and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meet this year in Lucknow as the achievements of the UP government.

The DefExpo 2020 will remain open for general public till Sunday afternoon.

This year’s DefExpo emerged as one of the largest gatherings of defence exhibitors and delegates, particularly in aerospace sector. Growth of indigenous enterprise has been an encouraging facet of the DefExpo.

Over 200 partnerships involving signing of memorandums of understanding (MoUs), transfer of technology (ToT) and product launches were concluded on the third day of the DefExpo.

Minister of State for Defence Shripad Yasho Naik said that the UP government successfully organised the event and it emerged as the best ever defence exhibition.

Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar said that the government was working on intellectual property rights and transfer of technology to boost the export of defence equipment.

A large number of people thronged the DefExpo venue in Lucknow to get a glimpse of India’s growing defence prowess as the event was opened to public on Saturday.

All roads led to the venue in southern part of Lucknow.

The crowd swelled as the day progressed and there were traffic snarls in adjoining areas.

At the venue, long queues of visitors could be seen at various entry points but it did not deter visitors as they patiently waited for their turn for security checks.

Santosh Singh of Chinhat said that he stood in a long queue at 10 am and was finally able to pass the security check around 1 pm.

“Like me, thousands of people came from other parts of Lucknow and other districts to have a first-hand idea of the event,” he said.

“There is undoubtedly a high quotient of excitement among visitors. Tanks on display are the most sought after as they provide the best background to click selfies,” Singh said.

Anupam Chauhan of Indiranagar, said, “The response to the mega event is definitely positive among the residents. Live demonstrations at the DefExpo venue are the biggest crowd-pullers.” A resident of IIM Road, Bharat Singh, said, “The DefExpo is a good platform to showcase India’s military prowess and also a good occasion to highlight India as a defence manufacturing hub.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/defexpo-has-given-a-new-identity-to-up--cm-yogi.html

14,09-2-20,Training programme for MLAs from Feb 11-12,"The Government will hold a special two-day training and sensitization programme for the newly-elected legislators of the State in order to brief them about their primary duties and guide them about effectively serving the people of the State, Assembly Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto said on Saturday.

The training programme, which is expected to see participation of all the 81 legislators in the State Assembly, will be held on February 11 and February 12 at Project Building in Ranchi, added Mahto. “It will be a basic training programme for all the legislators. The ministers too will be a part of it,” he said.

The training programme, Mahto added, will be hosted by knowledgeable personalities who have worked in the field of governance and public welfare in the past. “Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha, Harivanshji will attend the programme on the second day. We are expecting that all the legislators turn up for the training sessions,” Mahato said. The first Assembly session under the current Government was held on January 6 in the old Vidhan Sabha building this year.

At present, there are 11 ministers in the State Cabinet including Chief Minister Hemant Soren. The tripartite alliance of JMM, Congress party and RJD dethroned the former BJP Government here by crossing the magic figure of 41 in the Assembly.

Results for the Assembly elections were declared on December 23 last year.Training and sensitisation of legislators has been a regular practice in Jharkhand. Some former Governments also planned to rope in premiere B schools such as the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) for imparting trainings to the legislators here. Some legislators have made it to the State Assembly for the first time in the current Government, while many have decades of experience, sources said.

Mahato on Saturday clarified that the training programme was aimed at making the legislators aware of the various ways to address public issues effectively and the steps that a legislator can take to address issues under his or her jurisdiction.

“Most of our legislators have years of experience in dealing with public issues. However, the training programme will only be helpful for them and make them aware of the powers vested in them,” said Mahato.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/training-programme-for-mlas-from-feb-11-12.html

The National Citizens Register (NRC) is only meant for Assam.

The Government has taken no decision to implement it across the whole country. By the implementation of CAA the Muslims won’t be affected in any way. The Opposition parties are only doing politics on it, the Minister said.

22,09-2-20,Social sector underfunding to hit growth,"Participating in a consultation on ‘Resource Adequacy for Social Sector: Impact of Union Budget 2020-21 on Odisha’ held at CYSD here, noted economists, academia and society leaders expressed concern over low allocations in social sector.

Given the current state of economy, with a slump in rural demand, unmet demand for teachers, paramedical staff and care givers, quality education and health for all, and rural employment, an expansionary budget with a focus on social sector front starting with allocating additional resources for health, education, nutrition, employment guarantee could have made an economic sense. An analysis of Odisha Budget and Accountability Centre of CYSD reveals that the allocation for key human development concerns this year failed to deliver the country’s poor and marginalised, they said.

The 15th Finance Commission recommendations has suggested the devolution from Centre to States at 41 per cent for the year 2020-21, one point decrease from 42 per cent suggested by the 14th FC. Based on this, the overall devolution to the States has been fixed at Rs 78,4,181 crore in 2020-21. In the inter se distribution (distribution among States), Odisha’s share has been fixed at 4.629 percent, which is a little lower than the 14th FC recommendation of 4.642 per cent.

With the new formula, the loss of revenue for Odisha is Rs 102 crore. The grants-in-aid recommended for local self-Governments (both rural and urban) and post devolution revenue deficit grants are in line with the previous Finance Commission’s recommendations.

However, it is good to notice that there is an overall increase in the devolution to rural urban local bodies from Rs 75,918 crore in 2019-20 BE to Rs 99,925 crore in 2020-21 BE, they told.

Prioritising and fast-tracking actions for the last mile are crucial if the goal of “no one is left behind” is to be realised. Yet, there exist significant disparities in the achievement of some of the vital human development components such as IMR - 41, MMR - 130, Under 5 mortality rate – 50, Children Anaemic 38.5 percent, women Anaemic 58.5 percent which are far behind when compared to the global average. On the other hand, health and education didn’t see any significant increases in allocation in the Union Budget 2020-21. The increase in allocation for health and education remained at Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 6000 crore, which are again flat, considering the present inflation rate (around 5 percent), they said.

Even the schemes like Mid Day Meal (MDM) and ICDS have almost stagnated allocation in the budget. Allocation for MDM in budget 2020-21 is Rs 11,000 crore, same as in 2019-20 BE and for ICDS, the allocation has increased by Rs 1,000 crore as compared to the allocation in 2019-20 BE.

If we assume the number of children covered under these schemes remain same in the next year, the real price rise may put problem to serve food and nutrition to the children in the country, they added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/social-sector-underfunding-to-hit-growth.html

45,09-2-20,"AAP favourite among poor, middle class","General mood of the voters on the day of voting appeared to have tilted towards the ruling dispensation led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The voters also appeared inclined towards AAP's main challenger Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Lower and middle group people rooted for AAP whereas upper middle class and the rich backed BJP albeit reluctantly, as they were said to be voting for BJP leadership and not for the local BJP leaders.

People were unhappy with Municipal corporations controlled by the BJP and another factor which harmed the BJP was the Union Budget that failed to offer anything substantial for the honest taxpayers. The fence sitters ran into the lap of AAP while Shaheen Bagh failed to impact other parts of the national Capital including New Delhi Lok Sabha seat that houses 10 Assembly seats.

Voters hardly discussed about 'National' issues - abrogation of 370, Citizenship (Amendment) Act and construction of Ram Mandir.

In Kasturba Nagar constituency -congress's candidate Abhisehk Dutt was quite popular as locals are happy with his work as local municipal councilor.

Talking to The Pioneer, Saurabh Kaushal in Kasturba Nagar constituency - 54 said that Dutt visits us quite often and is active in RWAs. ""He is our representative in government. Issues pertaining to installation of CCTVs, street lights or beautification of parks , have bene taken care of by him,"" said Kaushal.

Delhi's voters appeared sure about their choice for the government in Delhi. Smog, Crime, Traffic Jams, Untreated Sewage, Water logging, Encroachment, Unchecked Migration, Overloaded hospitals, Public Transport, Lack of School and College seats are important issues for which Delhiites cast their votes.

In Delhi Cantonment, voters were seen supporting Congress candidate Sandeep Tanwer. Same was the case in Karol Bagh, Sadar, (Shaheen Bagh -Jamia) Okhla, East of Kailash, Lajapat Nagar, Dwarka, Jasola Vihar , Matiala, Kasturaba Nagar, where majority of people were with AAP and willing to being AAP back.

Another important factor which has harmed BJP is the Union Budget as the Union government has failed to offer anything substantial has decisively shifted the fence sitters into AAP,

Tapan Thakur, en employee of IT firm, residing in East of Kailash said that Delhi is at transition mode where current government has work on basic necessities, like education, health, but lot has to be done on infrastructure also,"" said Thakur.

While many of few have believed that Arvind Kejriwal government has done good so far, there are many voters who believe that structural reform of governance model will become subject matter of election discourse, be at National level, state or at municipal level and Delhi being the Capital of India will have to cross the three levels to gain voters' trust in government formation.

Aditya Sahay, a resident in South Extension, and a government employee said, ""AAP is good in education and health but sanitation and supply of safe clean water is important issues in Delhi.""

Adding furthermore on Delhi governance through parliament structure, Sahay said, ""AAP has involved general public with it. And when a common people is become the part of government, he feels connected with confidence.""

Karol Bagh, Sadar Bazar , Jhandewalan, voters have come out to practice their vote.

In Karol Bagh constituency, very few voters showed their support to BSP while majority of them were clapped for the AAP as primary education and healthcare services to their wards keeping them mentally and economically relieved and satisfied.

Sujata Devi, a resident in Sadar Bazar and worker in Delhi government hospital said that Delhi government has favored us with free water/electricity and DTC travel. ""Every day, I travelled GB Pant from Sadar, earlier, I used to pay 2000-2500 Rs per month in DTC however, now, amount is my saving now beside the cost of water/electricity,""

Delhi's current epicenter has also witnessed warmed response of the voters.

In Jasola Vihar, Sukhdev Vihar, people came out in support of Aam Aadmi Party and BJP both because of metro connectivity and Mohalla clinics.

""We are happy with BJP in Center and AAP in Delhi, as public hearing are held with AAP government and we have been involved as citizen in town planning,"" said Rohit Khurana, a resident of Jasola Vihar.

Manish Tiwari, a resident in Dwarka sector 21said that the multiplicity of authorities has crippled Delhi's functioning and it is financially unviable to maintain two, three power centers with overlapping responsibilities."" ""With one set of Administrative Officials taking orders from Centre, Delhi Government, Municipal Council may save time and money and will favor to governance more,"" said Tiwari.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-favourite-among-poor--middle-class.html

66,09-2-20,Amarinder proved liar as no jobs created: SAD,"The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday alleged that Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had proved that he was a “bare faced liar” by presenting false data on government jobs, fudging employment given under private placement drives and even including work given under MGNREGA to defend the lies uttered during the Delhi assembly election campaign.

In a statement here, senior SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra and Jathedar Tota Singh said “we understand that lies come easily to someone who has even taken false oaths in the name of the Dasam Pita and the holy Gutka Sahib. However we would only like to State that however much the Chief Minister thinks otherwise, the people are not fools. They have seen through the CM’s web of deceit and he cannot whitewash the manner in which he has failed an entire generation by throwing false statistics at them”.

The SAD leaders said the party had only asked the Chief Minister to substantiate his claim to have given eleven lakh jobs. “He could have released a pdf file with the names of the eleven lakh youth along with the job given to them as well as the remuneration. Instead of doing this he has chosen to politicise a most sensitive issue by trying to bad mouth the Opposition. Such behaviour does not behove a Chief Minister”.

The Akali leaders said practically no government job had been given by the Congress government in the last three years except for obligatory filling of some vacancies. Not one new job has been created. Not only this, the Chief Minister is trying to appropriate four lakh jobs which he claims have been given by private placement agencies. He has also compounded this crime against the youth of Punjab by appropriating 7.5 lakh jobs which he claims have been given by private companies like Uber and Zomato. We would only like to ask Capt Amarinder one thing. What is your contribution in this? The answer is nil”.

Chandumajra and Tota Singh said they would also like to educate the Chief Minister about job creation in the last fifteen years. “As per official Punjab government records only 24,683 government jobs were given when you were Chief Minister from 2002-07. During the ten year tenure of the SAD-BJP government headed by S Parkash Singh Badal as many as 2,28,780 government jobs were given. The SAD-BJP government also facilitated creation of eight lakh new jobs during this period”.

The Akali leaders also asked the Chief Minister to think twice before accusing others of being ignorant about ground realities and not having a connect with the people. “This sounds more like ulta chor kotwal ko daante. Punjabis accuse the Chief Minister and not S Sukhbir Singh Badal of keeping away from them and not visiting a single place in Punjab to ask about the grievances of the people in the last three years. Instead of rectifying this mistake you are manufacturing a new lie”.

The Akali leaders said it was part of public record that the Chief Minister had admitted that he would not be able to fulfill his “Ghar Ghar Rozgar” promise during the current term. They said the CM had even asked for another five year term to fulfill the promises made to the people during a recent Youth Congress programme in Chandigarh. “Rest assured the youth will not allow you to befool them again. It is the Congress party which is moving towards doom. Punjabis have seen the development done by the SAD-BJP government and the power and infrastructure push under the leadership of S Sukhbir Singh Badal as well as the complete freeze on all development works under the Congress. They will never trust you again”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/amarinder-proved-liar-as-no-jobs-created--sad.html

Manoj K Singh said, “The intention of this government does not look any pious. It appears it is against the poor and the marginal farmers.” He said if a government starts closing down people friendly schemes then it means the government hardly bothers for the people of the state and Hemant Soren’s government is an example of it here.

He said the government must explain as to why it is so going to overlook the needs of the poor and marginal farmers who were a great benefitted lot under this Krishi Ashirwad Yojna.

Singh said, “Hemant Soren’s government is anti development. It is putting on hold tenders even those finalized. Its claim to scrutinize the tenders and schemes of the previous government smacks too ill for the state and its people.”

He said MMKAY was for all farmers having one acre to 5 acres of agricultural land and was meant for all and now this government has put it off which is highly worrisome.

Singh said the closing down of MMKAY would seal the fate of 35 lakh farmers of the State who were the beneficiaries of this scheme and the BJP government had disbursed 3,000 crores of rupees among these 35 lakh farmers through DBT ( direct beneficiary transfer).

Singh said the new government claims it has not that much of funds, which is needed to run the schemes but the previous government led by Raghubar Das had carried them far ahead to the expectations of the common people.

Challenging Hemant Soren, who has said many times that his government will bring out White Paper to which Singh said, “We wait for it. There will be nothing in it then.”

He said on one hand this Soren’s government disbands MMKAY and on the other hand withdraws cases of sedition against those who were indulging in pathalgadi has sent out a wrong message to the society where criminals are rearing their heads again much faster than expected.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-bjp-attacks-govt-for-winding-up-mmkay.html

In addition, a micro-finance project has been launched and 17 beneficiaries have already been disbursed a sum of around 1.10 lakhs rupees for their various requirements. “It is noteworthy is that the loan requirement is shared with the Village Development Committee, which considers each case and then disburses the loan from its own money, and earns interest too. It empowers the rural communities to play a bigger role in the development of their own villages,” added Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/skill-development-projects-pay-dividends-in-bokaro-villages.html

74,09-2-20,Govt will stop ‘useless’ schemes: Min,"Days after Chief Minister Hemant Soren highlighted the poor condition of State’s treasury and blamed the former Raghubar Das-led Government for emptying the coffers, Finance Minister in his Cabinet Dr. Rameshwar Oraon has said that the lack of funds in the exchequer will not be a stumbling block for any of the Government’s schemes and works for the welfare of Jharkhand. However, the ‘useless’ schemes will have to stop, he added.

“We will not compromise with any of the Government schemes. However, the unnecessary expenditures will be cut down. The schemes that are useful will continue, but the schemes that are useless and cause unwanted burden on the exchequer will be stopped,” Oraon told this newspaper. He, however, did not specify as to which schemes he was referring to as useless. “You will get to know about it when we table the budget,” added the former IPS officer turned politician.

Oraon took to microblogging website Twitter on Saturday to share his views on the situation and claimed that unlike the former Government, the current Government will not drain the exchequer’s money extravagantly. “The former Government wasted a lot of money in unnecessary showbiz. This will not happen in our Government,” he said.

He also shared a cutout of a vernacular daily stating that most of the ongoing schemes will continue and the Government will arrange for funds to run all the necessary programmes. “We will spend on the right areas. Development works and welfare schemes will not stop,” said Oraon.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren had on Wednesday said that the State’s treasury was nearly empty and that the Government does not even have sufficient funds to pay salaries. “The former Government left no stone unturned in looting the State’s treasury. The money in State’s coffers also belongs to the tax payers, the backward and tribals. We will make sure that the crisis is addressed soon,” Soren had said during an event.

The Government held several investors’ summits and road shows under the leadership of former Chief Minister Raghubar Das. Opposition parties accused the Government of splurging tax payer’s money in ‘unwanted showbiz’ and also sought probe into the various business summits and road shows organised to lure investors. The former Government held at least five domestic and three international roadshows to lure investors to Jharkhand. In India, then chief minister Das and his team of delegates from the state attended road shows in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata and New Delhi. The delegates visited San Francisco in the United States of America, and Japan and Singapore to hold international road shows.

Oraon on Saturday said that the Government will come up with ways to boost the revenue of the State. However, he refused to share the plans he has in his mind to increase the revenue claiming that it was too early to disclose the Government’s plans to revive the funds in the State treasury.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-will-stop----useless----schemes--min.html

76,09-2-20,Time to love,"Péro showcase at Barakhamba Road in New Delhi is an episodic exhibition that presents the practice of the brand. Navneet Mendiratta speaks to its creator

Bungalow number 13 on Barakhamba Road is radiating love these days. Painted red hearts on its old-world yellow façade attract many a curious looks from the passerbys, tempting them to pause and take a look at what secrets the building holds inside.

This is the space where Péro, India’s leading clothing design label, is showcasing an episodic exhibition presenting the practice of Péro, titled Time for Love. The showcase commemorates the tenth anniversary of Péro.

From the characteristic edge of fabric woven on looms from all corners of this country to the silhouette and story of every garment passing through numerous hands — there is love, labour and time — the essential ingredients of Péro-making. An India Art Fair Parallel event, the showcase is an experience of detail where the principle artwork is the becoming of a Péro garment over 42 days, made with love, over time.

As we gather our first impressions of the showcase, we speak to Aneeth Arora, textile and dress maker and the founder of the brand. Excerpts from our conversation:

On the showcase

I felt it was time that people understood what goes into the making of a Péro garment. Even though it looks like a simple white garment, there is a lot that goes into making one. We do everything by hand. Once the garment is off the machine, every seam is hemmed on both sides. Thereafter, details are added. The buttons are handmade, the labels are hand embroidered… So, the idea is just to celebrate time and see what comes out when you are actually giving time and love to something.

The atmosphere here is very edgy, very shiny and it’s a very personal thing. We have always felt that even though we are in the world of fashion, we never really were a part of it. This is because our way of looking at things is very different. Fashion is all about change and pace. For long, we didn’t realise that we were spending so much time on what we were making, still trying to be a part of that world. The environment here is a symbol of that. It’s a showcase of how within this glamorous environment, this humble dress woven in so many regions of India still holds a place of its own. This is exactly what people have loved us for!

Playing revivalist

Revival is a big word. I wouldn’t say it is a conscious attempt, but our philosophy is such that we work with age-old techniques. We are very old school in the kind of things that we do and when we do work with those techniques, it brings back nostalgia. That is when people think it is revival. I am just enjoying the old school techniques and using them in our clothes.

To me, revival is when you do something over and over again and other people start following suit. Soon, you have a lot of people working on the craft and it is no longer lost. It happened with jamdani. The first season we used it, there were very few weavers doing it — at least not in this very fine cotton. We lost the order that season, because we could not weave the required fabric. You see, it takes a weaver a week to weave 3 metres of that fine cloth. We tend to use a lot of fabric when we make a flared garment. Eventually, we used it in the next season. Suddenly, there was this wave and there were almost 300 weavers weaving jamdani and people started calling this revival. For me, it was the fabric they found which was still in the market.

10 years-worth documentation

At NID, they taught us how to document the process well. And that is one thing that really stayed with me. From day one, we have been keeping a copy of every fabric, every button, every trimming that we have ever made. That was my way of documenting it. And now, I am using 10 years as an excuse to look at our archives, document each thing and show it to people. You feel the evolution when you see it all in its entirety.

We are using this opportunity to document it all digitally as well as physically, making note of each of our collaborations. We turn 10 this June 13. And that is when, we will close our archives.

The big reveal

In these 42 days, we will slowly unbox all that we have so painstakingly stored over the past decade and reveal our archives. Every day we will open and reveal a new segment. We will look at the prime elements of Péro — like the buttons that people identify us with or the hearts or the dolls. We will assign a room each to these elements — like the dolls of Péro, the hearts of Péro, button of Péro, textiles of People — and invite people to see our world.

India art fair connect

Initially, when we thought of doing things together, it was a collaboration between a fashion label and Art Fair. But eventually they realised that what we do is also a kind of art. So we thought of this showcase. Just like an artist works on his installation or art, we have our people working on each and every piece that comes out of Péro. Each of our garment is unique like any other art piece.

Unlike the usual Péro event, which is all fun and frolic, this event is a very quiet one. Visitors can clearly see that it is about understanding quality and time invested in it. And that is what makes everyone, including ourselves, pause.

Inspirations from other cultures

We do it all the time. If you look at the showcase garment, you will notice that the sleeves are Spanish and the yoke reminds you of a kediyu from Gujarat. Péro is all about mixing — we mix fabrics, we mix techniques, we also mix cultures.

I always give the example of an angrakha. In India, you look at it as an ethnic garment because you know the context. But when it goes overseas, you see it as a wrap. Perhaps to be worn as an overlay with a pair of jeans and T-shirt. So we like to put the same piece out for people to interpret it in their own way. We are not emphasising on the fact that it is an Indian silhouette. Because it is mix of a lot of things, it is an angrakha with a European lace. The moment you put a garment outside its context, people look at it differently.

On being sustainable

This is the other part of our messaging. When you spend so much on a piece… so much that when you own it, it becomes like an heirloom. You take care of it. And because you own that beautiful piece, you don’t want more. And when you do give it to someone else, you also reduce the demand for that person.

That’s what we say about our clothes. When you own, let’s say, 10 of our beautiful couture pieces, you don’t feel the need to own more. Because we are not about fast fashion. And when people see a piece and they see that someone has spent time on it, they do not want to discard it and that is where sustainability comes, where we reduce fashion waste. You may spend more but you are really investing in quality and time.

77,09-2-20,The art of ageing gracefully,"The secret lies in following a simple lifestyle, eating simple, exercise, stop worrying, meditation and a regular skin and hair care programme, writes Suparna Trikha

I find most people today find ageing to be a malady, seeking solutions in jars and bottles, potions and lotions of promises of timeless youth and beauty. If there were such a remedy, believe me, the discoverer would have become a multi-billionaire ten times over!

Ageing is something that affects everyone in today’s world. I find that even the late 35 year olds start worrying about ageing, little realising that their worry itself could lead to a stray wrinkle here or there.

So where lies the answer to ageless beauty? Is it in the use of never ending beauty products? Or in the new age injectables like Botox and the miracles of plastic surgery and fillers?

How does one find the answer to the elixir of youth and eternal glowing skin?

My answers would perhaps be conservative. Not that I completely believe that the old age rishis and munis had flawless skins and did not age while meditating in the jungles, but to a very large extent it definitely makes me ruminate about their lifestyles.

Many years ago, when I was in college, my mother had organised for a group of people to visit Indonesia on an educational and cultural tour. A certain Professor Bendre who was heading the JJ School of Art at that time also accompanied her with his wife. Mrs Bendre must have been in her 50s and looked no more than to be in her late 20s! Except for her graying hair, her dusky skin was flawless and taut. Her timeless beauty remains ingrained in my mind to date. The secret to this was perhaps the simple diet that she followed — she only ate fresh fruits, dry fruit and juices.

I have travelled quite extensively in my younger years and met people from various walks of life. Once I met a young 92 year old Colonel, retired from the Kumaon regiment. He had a perfect eye sight, walked straight and did all his driving and gardening himself. He was a living legend of sorts and passed on very recently at the age of 102! His secret, as he shared, was meditation in the morning, breakfast of a king, lunch of a prince and dinner of a pauper. Although that did not stop him from having his two whiskies every evening! He enjoyed being one with nature, pottering around in his herb garden, planting his favourite rosemary, chamomile, lettuce, etc. At 102, that was quite an achievement.

So besides my natural remedies, I always tell people (who come asking for suggestions to slow the ageing process) to follow a simple lifestyle, eat simple, exercise, destress, stop worrying, meditate and of course follow a regular skin and hair care programme.

We abuse our bodies and minds so much that we spend double the amount of time trying to find solutions to undo the damage we have already done.

The other day, I was sitting with the chairman of a well known domestic airline whose skin looked completely dehydrated. As I was trying to offer solutions to the problem, I noticed that his exquisite chamber overlooked a plush green expanse of never ending trees and beautifully trimmed bushes and the rarest of the flowers. There was a huge window to overlook this but no balcony to breathe in the fresh air. Hydrating your skin with fresh air and keeping it away from the maladies of air conditioning is so important.

So to make things easier for you, the answer to ageless youth and beauty is a combination of good health, simple diet, exercise, less stress and a regular skin care programme which would mean taking care of ones skin from an early age.

I am astounded at mothers who tell their daughters at 13 to not bother about their skin as now was not the time. I know for sure that the same mothers 10 years down would run to dermatologists to find a fix for their daughters’ acne marks since that might affect the marriage proposals.

Skin care must be a lifestyle just like brushing your teeth in the morning which we are taught to do from the age of 2 years. Infact, you would be surprised to know that a 5 minutes of skin cleansing, toning and moisturising routine takes you a long way as to what our skin will look like later in the day.

Lots of fresh raw food, plenty of water, regular exercise, sleep, destressing whenever you get the time to do so, regular skin care, meditation is what will define how you are going to look like at 90.

78,09-2-20,Astrology and destiny indications,"A professor of Philosophy came the other day looking for what lies in store of his habitually errant daughter’s destiny. In his opening statement he said: “My teenaged daughter is erratic, haughty, and impulsive, and could offend anybody with her caustic remarks. She is in the habit of rebuking all socially accepted norms. Her behaviour is causing us worry. Sir, on the advice of a friend who has been following your column for a long time, we are reaching out to you to seek answers to our questions.”

“However, before a reading of her horoscope, I request you to please dispel my doubts over the efficacy of astrology. How can planets’ gravitation pull, so distant from earth, affect our lives, and that too reflecting varied ways on different people. How can imaginary division of zodiac influence our life pattern? In a world, subject to continued change every moment, how can a being’s destiny be defined in finite terms? And if the whole course of life is bound by a predefined trajectory, what then would be left in the hands of a human being? Is it possible to change one’s attitude through conscious efforts?” he asked

Well, the planets are not to be seen just as physical objects moving in the cosmos influencing us with their gravitational force. It will be worth mentioning here that a planet needs to be seen as an energy ball — as marker of energy stream passing through a particular region with that planet in the centre. A zodiac sign is again marked with a cluster of energy emitting stars grouped in a particular formation. And the energy streams marked with a particular planet or a zodiac sign would vary from those identified with other planets.

Having exposure to various disciplines of Indian philosophy, you would know that energy streams excited from the primordial source, following a course of progressive evolution, eventually manifested into a world of name and forms. So, all form existences in the world are rooted to the energy orchestra of the cosmos, all sourced to a singularity — the primal source.

Here again, it has been scientifically established that energy particles emerging from a common source are in immediate and intimate connect with the rest. So, looked at in energy frame, the whole world is framed as a unified organism. This fact of life has been highlighted in the Kathopanishad through the metaphor of inverted Ashvata tree standing for the whole world. Here I quote the observations of an Australian physicist Paul Davies: “For a naive, the world is a collection of objects. For a quantum physicist, this world is an inseparable web of energy patterns, where no individual component has a reality independent of the entirety, included in that entirety is the observer.”

It, thus, comes out that any change at one end of the cosmos, its reverberations would get carried over far and wide. And we know that all energy balls in the cosmos are ever on their move. Seen with reference to earth, which is moving at a great speed, almost 30 km per second, the energy flux excited in the cosmos, would vary widely every moment. Being a part of the larger world, we can’t evade the influence of that continual cosmic change.

Efficacy of astrology is thus established, as it is premised on energy mapping of the cosmos at the time of one’s birth. That reflects upon the basic frame of mind one is born with, which throws light on the probable trends of life. That, however, is subject to three variables — Kaala, Patra and Samaya.

Kaala speaks of the overall environmental condition. Patra reflects upon the personality trends with all the changes that it would have undergone so far. Samaya here stands for probable destiny indication. So, a being is not fully bound by destiny indicators. But how we respond to energy changes in the cosmos, depends on us. This is where the power of freewill comes into play, and which applied rightfully, can help bring about the desired change through conscious efforts.

To sum up, astrology allows enough of scope to change the course of destiny. Remember, energy serves as a double-edged weapon — if used rightfully, it can be productive, and when misused may turn self-defeating. All that is needed is to exercise one’s power of freewill to self-reflect upon one’s own inherent trends, identify and acknowledge the fault lines. Having known thus, one could make conscientious choice to make amends with the help of educative inputs.

The discussion continues...

79,09-2-20,‘I’ll never compromise on individuality',"Gul Panag | Panag who was last seen in the film Bypass Road, speaks with Musba Hashmi about what made her take up The Family Man, experience of working with Manoj Bajpayee, her fitness regime and how she time manages everything

You were seen in The Family Man. What made you say yes?

The fact that I have been wanting to play an armed forces character for a long time is one big reason. I come from an armed forced background and Saloni’s character is the one that has come most naturally to me and more effortlessly as well. The mechanism, body language and the attitude is something that I have subconsciously imbibed for many years. The second reason was when I met Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK (the directors), I enjoyed the fact that we share a similar viewpoint. It is great to work with such people.

How was the experience working with Manoj Bajpayee?

Manoj is one of the most powerful and talented actors that we have today. It was an honour to work with him. I have known him for a long time but have never worked with him before. It was interesting to see him interpret the dynamics of both his and my character. I have played the role of his commanding officer which is a difficult place for any Indian male to be in, in the armed forces. And Manoj brought out an interesting angle to the character. The fact that he had a female boss made him uncomfortable. So he subtly flirted with me in a respectful manner. That’s what something that Manoj devised. I thought that it is interesting that he complied two pre-existing complexities in a relationship conflict to make it one. That was interesting.

Also I have said this multiple times with regards to Manoj that acting is all about reacting. If you have a good actor to react to your job becomes so much easier.

How was the experience doing Bypass Road?

It was an amazing experience. I played Romila, a grey character. It was fun to work with Neil Nitin Mukesh. He convinced me to take up the project since I have not played grey roles. So I thought of giving it a chance and it worked well.

Did you have to go out of your comfort zone?

Yes, a little bit. I am not used to play antagonists. There are some elements that don’t come naturally to me. I had to go out of my comfort zone. The good thing is when Neil writes a script he is clear with what each actor will be doing and how will they be doing it. He performs the part and shows it you so that the actor can have a clear idea of what exactly does he wants. He is clear with his expectations and is able to demonstrate the clarity.

A lesson learnt in the industry.

The best lesson that I have learnt is do your own thing. You can’t try and fit into somebody else’s side of the mold. There will always be certain pressures that will force you to conform to a preset format. I have always done my own thing. The only thing that I have and can celebrate is my uniqueness and individuality. And I wouldn’t want to compromise on that.

What kind of fitness regime do you follow?

I am focusing on my fitness since I was 15. My father forced me into exercising and working out and I asked him ‘why do I have to exercise if I am already slim?’ He said you should exercise so that you can remain the same and to be the best version of yourself. Since then, I am pursuing fitness for more than 25 years now and as I grew old I realised that the biggest takeaway of fitness is mental. Physical fitness is great, people appreciate you for looking great but the bigger picture is that you have the flexibility to bend and the energy to continuously run after your child and play with them. This is what wellness is about and not about looking a particular way.

How do you time manage?

Acting is just one part of my life. I am an entrepreneur, I run a production company, I attend women festivals and a lot of other things. The only way you can be true to everything you do is compartmentalise well. It is the key to manage everything.Gul Panag | Panag who was last seen in the film Bypass Road, speaks with Musba Hashmi about what made her take up The Family Man, experience of working with Manoj Bajpayee, her fitness regime and how she time manages everything",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i---ll-never-compromise-on-individuality--2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i---ll-never-compromise-on-individuality-.html
80,09-2-20,Kia ora with new connect,"With reduced visa processing time and new tourist partners, this island nation kissing the Antarctic makes for a must-visit due to its Maori culture and picturesque landscape, says SHALINI SAKSENA

We may be two down in the ongoing India versus New Zealand ODI series hosted by the latter but the one bright spot is that we gave them a drubbing in the T20 and beat them 5-0. While we don’t know how the Men in Blue will perform in the Test Matches, it doesn’t mean that we can look past the beautiful and picturesque locales where Team India is playing. Most of us would want to be away from the daily grunge of work and roam the streets of the Wellington, Auckland or Hamilton. If you have missed an opportunity this time round, the upcoming T20 World Cup being hosted by Australia is the perfect chance to not only watch your team compete and win but also go on to experience the diverse culture and beautiful places in New Zealand.

There are reasons why visiting Kiwiland is so much easier now. First, Tourism New Zealand has announced its new campaign creative — Good Morning World, Second, expansion of Tourism Industry Partnership (TIP) for quicker visitor visa application processing. Now Indians wanting to visit NZ don’t have to wait for 15 days as was customary. The time has been reduced to seven days. This means that Indians who are famous for making last-minute bookings can now take advantage of this. The Indian leisure travellers will benefit from a more streamlined visa service with a faster processing time.

The success of the TIP programme can be gauged from the fact that the programme that was launched in November 2014 was valid only for incentive visas in the first year and a total of 876 applications were processed. Last year, June 2018-July 2019, 5,492 applications (which included incentive and leisure visas) were processed under the partnership which is a positive 627 per cent increase compared to the first year.

Venessa Chen, regional consumer marketing manager, Asia, Tourism New Zealand speaking at the launch of the campaign said: “In Maori culture, dawn is a significant time of the day — every dawn, we celebrate life and new beginnings. With each morning, we acknowledge its potential. The Good Morning World content series, which is part of a global brand marketing initiative, aims to share the warmth of the people while showcasing the stunning landscape and activities visitors can enjoy. The series is a unique way to highlight the warm and welcoming nature of NZ people. We want to encourage Indian travellers to visit the country as we open our hearts and homes to the world and welcome them to an unforgettable experience in New Zealand.”

She tells you that unlike some travellers in other countries plan and book coming to NZ at least a year in advance, for Indians, it is always last minute. The TIP with three more additions to the list taking the total to seven partners in all. Marcelle Foley, Head of Operations Immigration New Zealand commenting on the partnership said: “INZ is pleased with the success of the TIP programme over the last five years. This is a positive development to extend our partnership and include an increasing number of travel agents.”

Chen tells you that India and NZ share a great bond. “We have a great bond that has grown over the years and continues to have. There are a lot of similarities that the two countries share; both are great hosts. This is probably one of the key reasons why the country has become a popular destination for Indian traveller,” Chen says.

Steven Dixon, Regional Trade Marketing Manager, Asia, Tourism New Zealand on a live web chat tells you that there are certain parts of NZ that sees more visitors from around the world than other parts of the country, however they are not at a point where there is over tourism. “We want to encourage tourists to go outside of popular destinations and see places that are not outside of the main destinations. From the numbers point of view, we till get only one international traveller per 100 NZ. But its really important that we have the infrastructure in place for experience for future generations.”

81,09-2-20,Law is juvenile needs to grow up,"In 2013, a five-year-old girl was abducted, gangraped and left mistaken to be dead by culprits. Six years later, on January 18, the rapists were sentenced for 20 years. MUSBA HASHMI looks into the reasons why it took so long for the Judiciary to serve justice

Just after four months of the spine-chilling Nirbhaya case that shook the nation to the core, Delhi saw another Nirbhaya but a much younger one. She is as brave as one can be and fought for her life till she won. Gudiya (name changed) was just five when she was abducted from her home in Gandhi Nagar, East Delhi, on April 15, 2013 gangraped and left for dead. The quest for justice spanned the same period as the one for Nirbhaya and the little braveheart has finally got justice after six years.

April 15 was just another day for Gudiya as she went down from her apartment to play in the colony lawns. It was then that Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar, who used to live in the basement of the same building, lured her into Manoj’s rented room where she was gangraped, brutalised and left by the two, who believed her to be dead.

“When she didn’t return for a couple of hours, we went searching for her but couldn’t find her. Her mother informed the police and an FIR was filed. After two days of searching, she was found in the basement of our building in a horrific condition — unconscious, tied and bleeding. There was a cut on her neck and bottles and candles had been inserted into her private parts,” Gudiya’s father Rajesh (name changed) tells you with a heavy voice.

Rakesh went to the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) for help in seeking justice. The BBA team took up the matter and assured legal, financial and medical help.

Due to the fear of being caught, the two had tried to murder the girl and assuming she was dead, they had left. Gudiya was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where six corrective surgeries were performed on her. After a lengthy stay in the ICU, she was finally released to the Young Women's Christian Association for further care and protection.

The culprits were arrested a week later from Bihar and a chargesheet filed on May 24. Later in July, the Delhi court framed charges for raping a minor, unnatural offence, kidnapping, attempt to murder, destruction of evidence, wrongful confinement and aggravated sexual assault under the Protection Of Children Against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Things took a U-turn when Pradeep moved the court claiming to be a juvenile at the time of the incident. In 2017, he was declared a juvenile and the case transferred to Juvenile Justice Board.

However, in 2018 the Delhi High Court, after an intervention by BBA, declared Pradeep an adult and the bail order, given on the basis of juvenility was cancelled. This year on January 18, the court announced the two guilty and awarded them 20 years’ imprisonment.

“Pradeep produced false certificates of juvenility in court. The matter was taken up by us in High Court. We challenged the order and intervened to get a bone ossification test done. Also when we got through the certificate produced by him, it was from the school’s principal and not a photocopy of the register that students fill at the time of admission. As per the law, one has to submit the school leaving certificate or the copy of the register where you have entered your birth date during the time of the admission. Therefore, the certificate was not accepted at the High Court. Later, the bone test revealed that he was around 22 years old at the time of committing the crime,” Sampurna Behura, Director (legal), Bachpan Bachao Andolan, tells you.

It seems that the culprits are now taking the alternate route by faking juvenility and seeking mercy. Is there a way to stop it? “A section of the POCSO Act says that when an accused is arrested and claims to be a juvenile, a bone ossification test is mandatory. The police also has to take out school documents or the birth certificate to validate the offender’s claims. If this procedure is followed, the offender cannot make any false claims. In Gudiya’s case, the police could have conducted the test. It is just a tool used by the convict to appeal for less punishment. The accused cannot provide false information and if they do, the court can hold them liable. That’s what happened in Gudiya’s case too. In such cases, the mindset of the judge has to change from being accused centric to victim centric and POCSO in itself is a victim centric law where the burden of proof lies on the accused,” Behura says.

Since it took seven years for the judgement to come, Behura has a lot to say on that. “India has one of the strongest laws in the world when it comes to child abuse. We have prosecution and victim compensation schemes. Gudiya’s case is a landmark one as it brought changes in the law. For instance, the Doctrine of Presumption would apply in all cases of a missing child. The police has to now register an FIR within 24 hours. If the police will do this many cases can be prevented. Also, a missing children portal has come up. Special Juvenile Police Units are to be formed in all districts. Each police station must have a trained Juvenile Welfare Officer. All this happened because of the Gudiya case. But yes, justice is delayed. Giving a judgement in six years where the survivour has to go to the court again and again is like revictimising her. The mandate of the Act is to get justice in all POCSO cases in one year. But the problem is that chargesheets are not filed on time, regular case hearing doesn’t happen, many times, the judges go on leave, there is lack of victim protection and because the protection mechanism is not in place the culprits are able to create a threat atmosphere around the victim. All this leads to delay in cases. In the Gudiya case, four years went by in deciding whether the culprit is a juvenile. It's high time that the Judiciary should look into its responsibility and justice should be delivered on time,” she tells you.

The other reason why Gudiya’s case took so long is because there are a lot of cases in Delhi and no sufficient POCSO courts to attend to them. After the recommendation of BBA, 11 special courts were set up in Delhi to attend to POCSO cases.

Gudiya’s family and the BBA team is now challenging the judgement and will move the High Court to demand life imprisonment for the culprits.

However, things haven’t gone too well for Gudiya and her family. These seven years have been a constant struggle to make the society realise it’s never the victim’s fault. “It was a tough time. We had to change so many places as we were not getting a home anywhere. Anyone who knew about the case wouldn’t let us stay in their area. Now I live outside Delhi and my daughter goes to school there. We had seen so many hardships and had to face the indifference of family and friends. The fight becomes even more difficult because the society doesn’t support the survivour. More so, because people are still living in a shell. This mentality of not blaming the culprit is wrong and there should be no place for this sick thought process,” Rajesh says.

Even after so many years, Gudiya is still under psychological therapy. “Back then, she was too young to understand what has happened to her. But now since she is attaining puberty, we are well-prepared to provide her with therapy and care. She is doing fine now but as for the therapy is concerned, she will be needing it for a longer period,” Behura says.

Much to your horror, a report of Kailash Satyarthi Children Foundation ‘Children Cannot Wait’ says that based on the number of POCSO cases pending in courts till 2016, provided there is no additional new case, some States will take more than 50 years to dispose of the pending cases. Moreover, the POCSO Act, 2012, calls for trials to be completed within a year in cases related to sexual abuse of children. However, a latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report shows that by the end of 2018 as many as 1,08,129 registered POCSO cases, which is 90.35 per cent of the total cases filed, remained pending in the courts. These facts are enough to show how justice is being delayed in such cases. No wonder that Nirbhaya’s convicts are yet to be hanged.

Advocate Siddh Vidya who has been handling such cases for a while now says that the need is to have better infrastructure to ensure any claim of juvenility accurately. “There are specific procedures laid down in law for ascertaining juvenility. There is a board and Committee which decides age of accused on the basis of physical appearance and some documents, if available, viz matriculation or other matriculation certificate, birth certificate issued by the school, panchayat and corporation. In the event of absence of documents medical examination is to be done. This is required in such cases where the age of a person claiming to be juvenile cannot be ascertained by his/her physical appearance as well as by documents. Accused of rape take advantage of this. They claim to be juvenile and get the matter delayed since the process by which juvenility can be proved, can be claimed at any point of time. Even after disposal of matter , offenders try to take shelter from this provision. Further, as per law in case of any medical ambiguity benefit of doubt is to be given to the accused. Due to such provisions even those culprits who have attained age of 18 years get benefit of doubt. Furthermore, unfortunately the judicial process is very slow. Culprits claim juvenility and in case of concrete proof of their age they enjoy benefit of doubt. The need is to have better infrastructure for ensuring that any claim of juvenility is decided fast and accurately,” she tells you.

There are cases wherein accused claiming to be juvenile are apparently adults but having matriculation certificates from school which prove them to be juveniles. This is a matter of experience that even today there are parents who deliberately hide the age of their child at the time of admission in school for getting benefits in different competitive exams.

There is misuse of law as well. There are many who are behind bars despite there being scientific evidence as the law considers the version of victim sufficient for conviction. “In a matter which we handled, a school teacher was convicted despite there being a DNA report in his favour which proved that the victim girl was not impregnated by him. He tried to commit suicide in jail, his children are out of school. In that matter prosecution did not bother to take DNA samples of other persons who could have perhaps impregnated the victim girl. Entire investigation was focused on proving that teacher guilty but no effort was taken by the prosecution to find out who impregnated a 13 year old girl,"" she tells you.

She adds that unless the police and judiciary is not made well-equipped with best infrastructure and sensitised, any amount of law and punishment would not achieve result, so far as pendency of matters and speedy disposal of matters are concerned.

Pooja Sareen, an advocate and a POCSO expert says that lack of awareness among the parents and the children is the reason behind the increased number of crimes.

“There are different types of crimes that the parents should know about. Knowledge is power. Many cases go unnoticed because either the child or the parent is living in oblivion, unaware of what happened was wrong. First, paedophilia. It is a psychiatric disease wherein an adolescent experiences a primary or special sexual appeal to prepubescent kids. Someone who’s identified with paedophilia ought to be at the least 16 years old and at least five years older than the prepubescent child. Such incidents are not reported, though they happen often, especially in boarding schools, close vicinity of houses or by grown up cousins. Second, sodomy. It is a crime not reported most of the times. It refers to male child expoitation — Male to male abuse and exploitation. In such cases, most of the survivors don’t speak up at all. Moreover, only one small section is dedicated to this offence in our constitution — Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Third, infant sexual abuse. It is rising at an alarming rate in India. Ironical is that the criminal regulations in India are insufficient in a lot of respect to cope with such sensitive and critical problems,” she tells you. Any kind of exploitation to children is not only limited to physical or sexual abuse, but it affects them mentally and emotionally as well.

Handling such cases is no child play. “Children usually take time to open up and talk about the incident. There are always chances that the defence may mislead them with the sexual connotations as they are not well-versed with the sexual terminologies and are not able to comprehend instances,” she says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/law-is-juvenile-needs-to-grow-up-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/law-is-juvenile-needs-to-grow-up.html
82,09-2-20,Meet the flying beast,"KANAN PARMAR chats up new YouTube sensation Gaurav Taneja who has taken to promoting Indian destinations

A new sensation has emerged on YouTube and in an entirely new mould. Meet Gaurav Taneja, officially a pilot with Air Asia. No, he does not make his presence felt as a sensational pilot but as a vlogger promoting fitness and Indian destinations through his YouTube channels.

His travel and lifestyle channel has 2.1M+ subscribers and the fitness one 1.3+ million. But do not mistake this IITian to be just a vlogger. He takes his flying seriously too.

Taneja is a proud winner of the ‘The Great Visioners Award 2020’ for Best Lifestyle and Travel Content Creation. A tweet by the YT Creators India lists him second among the top five travel and vlogging creators in India.

Taneja, all of 33, says he is joyfully immersed in the world of flying, fitness and travelling. A graduate from IIT Kharagpur in civil engineering, he decided to reach the skies with an aviation degree.

“As a teenager, flying fascinated me. I could hear the engines of the flight from my rooftop. I first flew IndiGo in 2011, both in the domestic and international sectors and then joined AirAsia, flying only domestic,” he tells you.

Taneja started his first YouTube channel FitMuscle TV back in November 2016 to give his viewers fitness tips. With more than 1.31M subscribers today, he is a proud professional.

“Since childhood, I have been interested in bodybuilding. Now I follow my passion by giving fitness advice. At the gym, everybody would ask me for tips and not the instructors. So, my gym instructor fired me,” Taneja says with a chuckle.

That’s when he has his eureka moment and decided to open his YouTube fitness channel.

He started his second YouTube channel Flying Beast in December 2017 where he vlogs lifestyle and travel. Here he features his co-pilot wife and three-year-old daughter Kaira too.

“Initially we started sharing fitness and health-related advice on FitMuscle Tv, but soon realised that the platform was suggesting our vlogs only to people who were into fitness. So, we decided to start a new channel about lifestyle,” Taneja says.

Being a successful YouTuber was a vertical four-five years climb for him in a medium new to him. “For FitMuscle TV, my scientific approach in body building and gymming worked well. For Flying Beast our chemistry as a couple worked out,” he asserts.

This year, he aims to showcase unexplored places in India and promote tourism as he feels that there are many places in the country that are beautiful travel destinations but remain unexplored because people find foreign tourism more fascinating. “Kashmir is so beautiful that people need not visit Switzerland,” he says.

Taneja’s favourite travel destination is Vanya Dam in Kerala. Then there is the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and the pristine glory of Meghalaya. Arunachal Pradesh is the next on his list.

As a YouTuber he said his golden moment was a meeting with former US President Barack Obama. “There was a conference in Singapore organised by The Growth Faculty where Google had invited my wife and me. From the Asia-Pacific region, only six content creators were invited and we were amongst those. Obama attended that conference to talk about what kind of leaders the world requires. Ritu and I got some personal time with him. We told him that we have a voice, there are so many people following us and we can contribute our bit in whatever way we can to bring a change in the society,” he narrates.

Gaurav has his set of fans too. Frequent flyer Aksh Baghla recently tweeted a photo of him with Taneja and captioned it saying that every time he travels via Air Asia, he wishes that he gets a chance to meet the Flying Beast (Taneja).

Being a celebrity-pilot, Gaurav plans his monthly schedule to match his flying roster. “I utilise every minute of my day in the pursuit of promoting India and fitness,” he tells you.

Most may think Taneja must require a big team and sponsors to help him manage his YouTube channels but he says, “We fund our own videos and this is the best part about vlogging that we don’t need a big team. Our camera is all we need.”

Taneja is also a responsible husband and father. He met his wife Ritu Rathee while working at IndiGo. Rathee is a pilot who flies IndiGo.

Taneja is a votary of outdoors and feels the depression assailing the younger generation is all about being cooped up. “People shouldn’t spend so much time indoors and there should be minimal connection with digital multimedia. People should socialise with friends rather than through Facebook,” he advises.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/meet-the-flying-beast-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/meet-the-flying-beast.html
83,09-2-20,NSUI burns effigy of rival ABVP,"Expressing vehement protest over the choice of place by the ABVP to hold its regional convention, the members of National Students Union of India (NSUI) burned the effigy of the ABVP at the DAV- PG College here on Saturday. The agitated members also shouted slogans against GRD institute where ABVP would hold its convention.

On the day large number of NSUI activists assembled in the college and consigned the effigy to flames.

Speaking on the occasion, NSUI leader Aditya Bisht said that the ABVP is planning to hold its 20th regional convention at GRD institute.

He said that everyone knows that a heinous crime of gang rape of a minor was reported from the GRD residential school, Bhauwala on August 14, 2018. Very recently, the court has sentenced 20 years of imprisonment to the accused and the Principal of the school in the case.

He said that it is unfortunate that on one hand the ABVP makes lofty talks about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and on the other hand its leaders are planning to hold their convention in such an institute where heinous crime of gang rape occurred in one of its branches. Bisht said that the ABVP should change the venue of its convention failing which the agitation would be intensified against it.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nsui-burns-effigy-of-rival-abvp.html

86,09-2-20,Coronavirus: Fifth suspected patient of examined at AIIMS Rishikesh,"A Yoga instructor of Rishikesh who has recently returned from Coronavirus infested city of Wuhan in China has been kept in isolation by the doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh. Though the person is not showing any symptoms, he has been kept in the category of suspected case of dreaded Coronavirus.

The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of AIIMS, Rishikesh, Prakash Thapliyal said that, the 36 year old instructor was working as a yoga instructor in China from last five years.

“He had been in Wuhan city from last one year and arrived in India on January 23 this year. He had no history of visiting fish market, overcrowded places two weeks prior to leaving Wuhan city. He is also showing no symptoms,’’ he said.

After arriving in India, the suspected patient has claimed to have stayed at home with his family members that have not developed any symptoms.On finding out about the Yoga instructor, the members of the IDSP team referred him to AIIMS Rishikesh.

Since the patient has returned from a high risk area, he was examined by doctors and his sample was sent for testing the Coronavirus.

Thapliyal said that the sample has been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. He informed that till now five suspected cases of the disease have been examined at AIIMS, Rishikesh. “Two reports are negative while two pending. One was not tested due to low-suspicion,’’ he said. Following the advisory issued by the Union government, the state health department is kept in state of alert.

The teams of the department are keeping watch over all transit points on Indo Nepal border and on airports.The symptoms of the Coronavirus are similar to that of normal influenza. The symptoms include incessant fever, cough, irritation in throat, difficulty in breathing and pneumonia. The first infections were detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan and traced back to a wild animal and fish market. The virus is now spreading through human to human contact.

The medical experts advice that people should cover their mouth and face while sneezing and should wash their hands and face regularly to prevent spread of the disease. People should avoid going to crowded places and refrain from shaking hands with others. Those suffering from fever and cough should immediately take medical advice. People are also being asked not to eat raw or semi cooked meat and egg.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus--fifth-suspected-patient-of-examined-at-aiims-rishikesh.html

89,09-2-20,Eat safe to live well,"Focussing on scoring right nutrition and safe food is the only solution to combating the adulterations that have invaded our plates, writes KAvita Devgan, as she lists a five-point plan to staying healthy

Looking at the frequent outbreaks of stubborn virus and food-related allergies and illness, there is no doubt that an un-wellness pandemic is engulfing us. And the sad part is that while we see this happening — to us and to everyone around us — there really isn’t much that we can do about it, except worrying and cribbing about it, maybe!

Well, the good news is that a lot of this is preventable by a simple tool at our disposal — just changing what we plate. Focussing on scoring right nutrition and safe food is the only solution. All you need to is to follow a simple five-point plan to add health to your diet.

Focus on nutrition

My get healthy philosophy is clear and simple: if we focus on nutrition, rest everything will fall in place, automatically.

When our diet is loaded with empty foods, which are low on nutrition (that is, the basic vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and enzymes that our body needs) then sustenance does not happen. I define sustenance as not just filling of the stomach with the required calories, but with nutritional satiety. And without sustenance, there is no satisfaction, without which the urge to continue eating continues. It is that often familiar feeling of eating without being able to stop when we should, and the gnawing utterly uncontrollable avalanche of cravings that rule our food choices!

Secondly, unless we are nutritionally fit, we won’t function at our optimum — and that is a real deal breaker. For example, you may be at a risk for anaemia, one side effect of which is constant fatigue. And this will interfere with your ability to exercise, which will lead to weight gain.

Similarly if you are a fan of low or no carb diets and restrict cereals excessively in your diet, you may not get enough B vitamins, which are essential for fat metabolism in the body. Result: more fat deposition. Yes, that’s how diets that restrict carbs too much fall flat!

Make sense of science

It’s a sad fact that science, sometimes doesn’t discover knowledge, it “constructs” it, and then the marketers market it smartly. And we can’t just wish away this reality. Apparently, the sugar industry in the US paid three very influential scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat (SF) as the devil instead. Thankfully, sugar is back to being the devil and saturated fat is being exonerated.

Also, there is no way to making sense of the constant yo-yoing of what research says and then unsays. A theory that may appear right today may be debunked tomorrow. It happened with milk, eggs, coconut oil, ghee, to name a few, making all of us bonafide food schizos.

So what does one do? For one, we must understand that nutrition is an ever evolving science, and facts change at breakneck speed. So read the ‘breaking news’ but take it with a pinch of salt; use it only as a guiding light not gospel. Read all sensational headlines (like so and so extract will help you dodge Alzheimer's) objectively and apply the principle of common sense before following them. For example, a research says that wine is good for our heart, but that does not mean that you must begin downing a glass or two everyday! Maybe, it is the exercise that you are doing in the morning and the two fruits you are snacking on that are keeping your heart in the pink of health, and it doesn’t need any extra help.

Too much information can often do more harm than good. Listen to your gut feel, and the golden rule of moderation — no food is bad per se, it is only bad in excess — and you will be fine.

Cut down processed foods intake

There are enough red flags about processed foods to convince anyone who values his health to go off them. According to the World Health Organisation, processed foods are to blame for the spike in chronic disease around the world. Multiple studies have found correlation with higher incidence of heart disease, diabetes, depression and even early death with more intake of processed foods.

The reason is simple — they come packaged with a deadly cocktail of chemicals, and way too much of sugar and salt, all of which wreak havoc inside the body. They leave you short on fibre and antioxidants. Plus they are addictive as they are designed clearly to attack the reward centre of the brain (and not really to provide you nutrition) — and that is always a bad thing.

Plus, giving up processed “diet” food is a big part of this strategy to knock off weight successfully. I have seen people up their calories intake and yet lose weight just by going clean! The explanation is simple. When people eat minimally processed foods, they produce more of the hormone that suppresses appetite and less of the hormone that causes hunger. Translated in simple terms, this means that when you eat more processed foods, your body chemistry works in a manner that makes you eat more, even if you are trying not too. Result obviously is loss of control and yes, weight gain. And if you can put a lid on the consumption of junk and processed then your hormones can be tipped in the favour of weight loss.

Keep away from these baddies

In 2015, high lead concentration and traces of MSG were found in a batch of a brand of instant noodles in Uttar Pradesh. The regulatory authorities asked for a recall of that batch and a clamour for banning it began. A survey conducted by the Kolkata-based All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (under the Health Ministry) in 2016 had found presence of 5 toxins in the soft drinks packaged in PET (polyethylene tereph-thalate) bottles. These harmful metals — antimony, lead, chromium, cadmium and a compound DEHP (Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) — apparently leech in from the PET bottles. Now think of all that we consume out of the PET bottles and the sheer number is enough to raise an alarm.

Why is it scary? you would ask. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), lead and cadmium are two of the top ten chemicals of “major public health concern” and can have serious consequences for our health, particularly children. Lead exposure affects the brain and central nervous system, causing mental retardation and behavioural disorders at high level of exposure. Cadmium attacks the kidney, skeletal system and the respiratory system and is a known carcino-gen.

The other three: chromium, antimony and DEHP can also be harmful. While, chromium is needed by the body in very small amounts, an overdose has been associated with lung, nasal, and sinus cancer. Antimony may lead to problems with the lungs, heart, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach ulcers, and DEHP (EU had banned and classified it as a reproductive toxicant a while back) is associated with adverse effects on the liver, kidneys and the reproductive system.

Even the humble bread, that many of us eat almost on a daily basis was in the eye of the storm because of the dangerous, cancerous additives (potassium bromate and potassium iodate) found in multiple brands. Plus, there is the omnipresent danger of consuming multiple toxins like acrylamide, BPA or bisphenol A and diacetyl (found in something as ubiquitous and considered healthy as pop corn) found in processed foods.

In India, right now we don’t have any laws banning anything, even known harmful additives. So the onus is upon us to steer clear of them. We can always try and replace PET bottles for storing (and selling) everything with time-tested and traditional alternatives such as glass or even earthen pots/bottles! Giving up may not be practical option for a lot of us, considering the way we all live today, rationing them in the diet is only the next best.

Eat safe meat

Meat is an important part of a balanced diet, there is no denying that. In fact, some nutrients and our body’s protein requirement often demands that we incorporate it in our diet. That said what one needs to be super careful about its overload.

Eating meat may be good for us, but too much of this can be bad too. Especially if you are consuming unsafe meat. The science is solid on the fact that there is a huge cost involved in eating cheap meat. “Overuse of antibiotics in animal farms endangers us all as it multiplies drug resistance in the environment,” explains author and CDDEP Director Ramanan Laxminarayan.

This, in fact, has been proven beyond doubt. Antibiotic use in animals can over time promote the development of hard-to-treat antibiotic-resistant superbugs that make people sick. So we are, slowly but steadily, becoming an antibiotics resistant race. The concerns over the use of antibiotics for more growth promotion (read higher production) in farm animals is serious and the threat to public health from the overuse of antibiotics in food animals is very real.

Source your meat and eggs carefully. To prevent antibiotic resistance, avoid antibiotic medications unless absolutely necessary; eat less meat (or give it up entirely) to help reduce demand and buy from small, organic farms which raise antibiotic-free animals. It’s not easy, but then catching (and being apart in spreading) a superbug and becoming antibiotics resistant is a far scarier prospect by any stretch.

Drink safe milk

You can thrive on good food, if it is safe. According to Ayurveda, the best kind is the milk that is absolutely fresh from the cow, still warm. But as that is not really an option any-more (unless there’s a cow in your backyard who you are feeding organic pasture), we need to cover other bases to ensure that the milk we drink is not adulterated.

This is important. The immediate effect of drinking adulterated milk can be gastroenteritis vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, but the long term effects are known to be far more serious. These adulterants are hazardous and can cause irreversible damage to the organs. Detergents in milk cause food poisoning and gastrointestinal complications. Other synthetic compounds cause impairments, heart problems, cancer and even death. The high alkaline level of milk can damage body tissue too. Caustic soda harms the mucosa of the food pipe, especially in kids.

So how does one check if milk is adulterated? The NDDB (National Dairy Development Board) website mentions that it has a kit with which you can do some simple tests at home. Check it out. Meanwhile some simple tests you can do on your own are:

To check for extra water in milk, place a drop on a shiny, polished slanting surface. Milk leaves no trail behind but if water is added to it you will find a white trail behind the drop.

For starch (wheat flour etc), add a drop of iodine solution (easily available in medical stores); formation of blue colour indicates adulteration. For detergent, just mix equal amounts of water and milk and shake for five minutes. Appearance of lather indicates presence of detergent.

90,09-2-20,Love on the Mediterranean coast,"There is this zing thing around the month of February that stokes your passion for everything indulgent. The weather is just right, love is in the air and food sits beautifully on your taste buds. All you need is an enhanced setting to spend an evening of joy with a platter to cap it all up by the time you reach the mid of the month.

Thankfully, there is Sevilla at The Claridges, the romantic oasis on a green stretch in the heart of central Delhi, to take care of your good-food good-life quotient. Just a lamb taco may not be enough to find the way to your heart through the stomach but when you are biting into its juicy, flavourful confines under a gazebo in the shade of an old banyan, with flame fired heaters warming your cockles next to live Russian girl duo band giving melody an old world charm, definitely it must have been love but is thankfully not over yet, at least till the 15th of this month!

The eight-course Mediterranean meal curated by the young chef duo from Spain, Maria Adrover and Rafael Barrientos, visiting India to breathe in the desi flavours and yet belt out souffle light, aromatic, tongue tingling variables from the Spanish platter, is a revelation on how food can be good without the spices too.

The shaven olive dust dotting the Lamb Bonbon, the cream cheese droplets on the amazingly innovative Compressed Eggplant, the out of the world carrot cake soup candied with walnuts, rum raisins and crispy duck flakes and a clear Gazpacho Consomme shot under a bruchetta do well to seduce your mindset and taste buds out of the mirchi haldi wallah desi platter.

The flavours are uniquely appealing. The juices flow into your mouth without overwhelming you. The texture gives smoothness a tall identity. And the presentation is a work of art. Under the gazebo, with a warm toddy paired with the solids on a dry pre-election night, you couldn’t have asked for more.

But first about the amazing Compressed Eggplant. The ever-smiling food enthusiast chef Vivek Rana leads you through the overnight compression that the good old baingan goes through at a constant 37-degree temperature to come out not as eggplant in taste or demeanour but as juicy crunchy logs of, say, pickled carrot. Savoured with flavoured cream cheese and corn dust, it comes as an expansionist veggie religion with potential to uniformly convert all brinjal haters into twirling their tongues in awe and saying ‘we are unabashed subjects of the baingan world’.

By the time you come to the mains at Sevilla on this lovely evening, Elton John’s candle in the wind has already teamed up with lady in red to give the young Russian violinist a toddy toast. It’s the time when the Chilean Sea Bass comes to you swimming in par seared beetroot and pink pepper sauce. The boneless blob of fish complements the appetisers to make room in your stomach and settle down without any heaviness. It is also seared with flavours all standing out for attention, even as the Mushroom Risotto doused in almond milk and cheese draw you into an indulgence late into the life of this wonderfully coursed meal.

Nuance this with Curry Crumble with Coconut tickled by lemon ganache and frosty coconut ice-cream and the end comes in wonderfully for those lucky few who can make it to Sevilla before the 15th of this month.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/love-on-the-mediterranean-coast-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/love-on-the-mediterranean-coast.html
91,09-2-20,"Tiwari rejects exit poll results, claims BJP will win 48 seats","Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari put up a brave face even as exit polls predicted a sweep for the AAP in the Assembly polls, voting for which concluded on Saturday evening, claiming his party will win ""48 seats"" and form a Government in the city.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah was expected to meet BJP's seven Lok Sabha MPs and other leaders late in the evening, a top party leader said. ""Shah will meet the MPs and other leaders to get their feedback of the voting on the 70 Assembly seats,"" he said.

Tiwari tweeted all the exit polls will ""fail"" and asked his detractors to save his tweet. ""All these exit polls will fail. Save my tweet carefully. BJP will win 48 seats and form government in Delhi...Please do not search excuses to blame the EVM,"" Tiwari asserted in his tweet in Hindi.

Shah and BJP president JP Nadda during the whirlwind campaign for the polls had claimed that the party will win more than 45 seats in Delhi.

Exit polls for the Delhi Assembly election on Saturday predicted a comfortable victory for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) despite a likely rise in tally for the BJP in the 70-member House.

Times Now-Ipsos exit polls predicted that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will retain his chair with the AAP winning 44 seats against 26 for the BJP.

Republic-Jan ki Baat survey gave the AAP 48-61 seats and the BJP 9-21 seats.TV9 Bharatvarsh-Cicero predicted 54 seats for the AAP, 15 for the BJP and one for the Congress.

92,09-2-20,Nationalism may help BJP clinch some seats,"Notwithstanding the exit poll results that project a clean sweep for the AAP, the BJP still appears to be in fight as the issues of nationalism and ""anti- Islamic"" sentiment seems to have helped the latter to attract voters in its favour.

The AAP is expected to retain most of its seats riding on its policy of providing free water, electricity and transport. Women voters went alone to vote AAP candidates, setting aside the view and ideology of men in their families.

""My husband is a daily labourer and earns money with that we can survive. I am now able to save thousands of rupees in a month. This is huge money for a family who earns to survive only. Earlier, I did not send my children to schools run by the Delhi Government but after I started sending them back to schools after listening the popularity of its schools,"" she said.

Sudha Devi, a housewife who casted het vote at 9 AM at a polling booth in Yamuna Vihar, C block said that she is overwhelmed by the performance of AAP. ""We are very ecstatic over the Government's decision to provide free electricity and water. I can save lots of money now to spend it on education of my child. My vote is going for Kejriwal,"" she said, adding that she was not sure that her husband will also vote for the same party.

A senior BJP leader said that the aggressive campaigning led by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, highlighting the issues of Article 370 and importantly anti- CAA protest helped the BJP to give a tough fight with ruling AAP. However, the situation in ground narrates other story.

""I vote for the BJP on the issue of nationalism. The interest of the country is always bigger than that of local issues. The command should be in one hand to deal with unsocial elements like protesters of Shaheen Bagh,"" said Anirudh Singh, a teacher at a private coaching center.

Some youngsters said they were not moved by the idea of nationalism while other appreciated the Government's ""efforts against tackling terrorism"". ""The BJP is surely going to improve its tally compared to last year. It may surprise you as well,"" said Raghav Shahtri, a 38 year old businessman who lives in Timarpur area of North Delhi.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nationalism-may-help-bjp-clinch-some-seats.html
93,09-2-20,"Deserted in morning, turnout rose in afternoon","For the high-stakes Delhi Assembly polls that kick started at 8:00 am with a few voters at polling booths but gained momentum as the sun rose in the national Capital's long winter season. Majority of the votes were polled in the afternoon. With tough fight in many seats across the 70 constituencies, developmental work such as education, CCTV cameras, health, free electricity, water and bus ride were the talk of RK Puram constituency which houses a number of Government officials as well as slum clusters, while in Malviya Nagar, the response were mixed from the public. People were mixed with diplomatic answer, while in other hand; many openly accepted that they cast their vote for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and AAP.

""See, the Government colonies are already well developed and have quite good infrastructural arrangements with daily basic needs near home but in a overall perspective, be it in education, health, water, electricity and empowerment of woman, safety and CCTV cameras. Kejriwal Government has done a lot which is visible on ground. Thus, my vote is based on works done in the city,"" said Simi, a resident of Sector -1 R K Puram.

While a first time voter, Aishwarya, a resident of Sector 6 R K Puram, said, ""My vote is for the developments done in my locality and of course my city. Now, I see woman safety in bus, CCTV cameras in every corner. When I was young in class 8, coming from school, a person harassed and touched me and I cried and yelled but none of passengers came for my support and I was scared to use the bus but now there is a marshal guard in the bus and even the driver and conductor have been sensitised that they also come for support when a women raises an alarm, so, my vote will be based on works.""

""Hum to BJP samarthak hain aur humara vote unka hi jayega (I am a BJP support and my vote will go for the party). I live in the Munirka area for the last 15 years. There is no work done in the inside the Munirka Village, it is very congested, no platforms, footpaths to walk. Also, AAP government has done a lot for the people free electricity, water but not for the tenants. Even after the 'Kirayedar bijli yojana', implemented, the tenants are nowhere to go because here per unit rate goes to Rs 8-12, if they will fight, will lose their house and finding an accommodation in the city is hard to find,"" said Indrajeet Singh, who owns a furniture shop.

The poll which began at 8:00 am on Saturday and end at 7.30 pm. The Pioneer visited number of polling booths to gauge the mood of the people, came across mixed response, whereas in R K Puram constituency, large number of people especially the government servants supported AAP while, the people living in their independent house and rented accommodation backed BJP saying they are looking at the developments done in national level. Malviya Nagar which accommodates rich, middle class and traders had mixed a response with diplomatic answers.

""Both BJP and AAP have done good work for the people of Hauz Rani, so it depends upon the lot of work done in our society. However, AAP should be given another chance in the city. They have done many developmental works for the people. It was the central government led Central Board Secondary Education (CBSE) that hiked fees for the 12th class board exams but the Delhi Government paid the fees, so it is doing good job in school, mohalla clinics have been opened, and bus rides are free for woman. Dusra mauka to banta hai,"" said Babita Rani, a vegetable seller in Hauz Rani.

While, Madhav Pandey, a senior citizen, diplomatically answered, saying, ""Jo jeetega usi ko humne vote diya, (The person who will win, my vote has gone to him."" ""I see at national level, national security, thus my vote is for Modi,"" said Dharampal. There were others who did not disclose their choices but were lined up to cast their votes.

98,09-2-20,EU's manoeuvring after Britain's departure,"Down one country with the departure of Britain, the European Union’s main goal is to secure to future of the union. Among the most important tasks for the EU are the requirement of the hard work for building a new economic relationship between the bloc and its ex-member, and enlargements of the bloc by including more members.

The European Union has already linked any access to its market for British products directly to the access that EU boats will be given to UK waters, the bloc’s chief negotiator said on February 3. EU negotiator Michel Barnier underscored the difficulties of the trade negotiations with Britain ahead for the rest of the year when he highlighted the small but emblematic fisheries industry, which was a key issue in the protracted Brexit talks in the UK too.

Barnier told France Inter radio that “there will be no trade deal with the British if there is no reciprocal access deal for our fishermen”. “We will negotiate access to the British territorial waters for European fishermen at the same time that we negotiate access to European markets for British fisheries products. I hope I make myself clear.”

Overall, the EU is willing to grant the UK the fullest possible access to its lucrative market of some 450 million consumers but only if Britain abides by EU standards on such things state aid, social legislation or environmental protections.

British Prime Minister Boris Jonhnon has already indicated he does not want to make a binding commitment to remain in line with EU law, saying it was an essential principle in the move to walk away from the Union.

The official break-up came last Friday and Johnson has said he wants a trade and cooperation deal by the end of the year, a time frame which the EU has called unrealistic.

As for expansion, EU’s executive has proposed a new system for adding members in a move made all the more urgent by French objections to open enlargement talks with two Western Balkan nations.

The European Commission hopes the streamlined rules will avoid further delaying the start of accession negotiations when aspiring members to what is now the 27-country bloc have met the conditions for such talks.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on February 5 that the proposal was a “good message” to North Macedonia and Albania, who were both desperately disappointed when their hopes for the swift commencement of accession negotiations were rebuffed in October. And perhaps crucially, France acknowledged that the proposal was good, “a significant change, a big step in the right direction.”

“This is a major element that allows positions to move — not only France’s position,” said a top official at the French presidency, who asked not to be identified in accordance with Elysee customary practices.

The EU is hoping that a breakthrough for Albania and North Macedonia can be found in March. The bloc also has a major Western Balkans summit planned for May.

There are worries that if the EU doesn’t open its arms, then several countries in the strategically important Balkan region could pivot instead to Russia and China. For a bloc that’s just lost the diplomatic and geopolitical clout of Britain, that could be a hard pill to swallow.

“EU enlargement is a WIN-WIN situation,” von der Leyen said in a tweet.

Enlargement is especially contentious in some capitals in the EU over such issues as corruption and the rule of law.

North Macedonia and Albania were left aghast when their hopes of starting accession talks late last year were dashed, with France insistent that the enlargement process was revamped first. Both aspirants voiced their initial satisfaction at the developments.

“This renewed approach will result in a double victory in the coming weeks: opening negotiations together in an advanced process,” North Macedonia Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov said in a written statement.

And Albania’s acting Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj said the expectation is that membership negotiations would commence this year and that the country would continue its “reforms and the fundamental transformation in line with the new methodology.”

He added that the EU has its sights on the “stability, development and democratisation of the Western Balkans in general.”

The EU hasn’t added a member state since Croatia joined in 2013. It started out with six nations in 1958 and lost its first member state when Britain pulled out last weekend.

Over the past dozen years, as first the financial and then the migration crisis hit the continent, the appetite for taking in new, poorer nations has dwindled.

99,09-2-20,PM hopes Lanka will take Tamil reconciliation forward,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sought a devolution of powers to the Sri Lankan Tamils as he took up their cause with the visiting counterpart of the island nation Mahinda Rajapaksa. Modi said he was confident that the Sri Lankan Government will realise the expectations of equality, justice, peace and respect of the Tamil people within a united Sri Lanka as per its constitution.

After holding wide-ranging talks with Rajapaksa, Modi said the issue was discussed with an “open mind” and hoped that the Tamil reconciliation process would be taken forward by Colombo.

The two leaders also deliberated on several key issues like bolstering anti-terror cooperation, expansion of trade and investment ties, implementation of joint projects in Sri Lanka and resolving the long-festering fishermen issue with a “humane approach.” In his comments, Rajapaksa thanked Modi for his Government’s ‘neighbourhood first policy’ and the priority he attaches to ties with Sri Lanka.

On the long-pending Tamil issue, Modi said it will be necessary to implement the 13th amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution. The 13th amendment provides for devolution of power to Tamil community in the neighbouring country.

“We held a discussion with an open mind on issues relating to reconciliation in Sri Lanka. I am confident that the Government of Sri Lanka will fulfill the expectations

of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace, and respect within a United Sri Lanka,” Modi said.

“It will be necessary to implement the 13th amendment of (Sri Lankan) Constitution and take forward the reconciliation process at the same time,” he said.

India has been urging Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment which was brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987 which envisaged devolution of powers to the Tamils.

Rajapaksa’s five-day visit to India assumes significance as his tenure as Sri Lanka’s President from 2005 to 2016 saw expansion of China’s footprints in the Indian Ocean island nation, triggering concerns in India.

The Chinese influence in Sri Lanka covers infrastructure development including the construction of the Hambantota sea port there, growing investment, economic aid and trade. Moreover, Sri Lanka in the last few years is favouring the Chinese over the long-standing ally India thereby causing concern in New Delhi.

The growing ties between Sri Lanka and China, moreover, signifies Beijing’s clout in the countries located on the rim of the strategically important Indian Ocean region where India is the key player. Also, the growing maritime prowess of China and its increasing presence in the Indian Ocean region in the last ten to 12 years is also posing a challenge to India’s strategic interests.

In this backdrop, Modi said “stability, security and prosperity in Sri Lanka is in India’s interest, but also in the interest of the entire Indian Ocean Region,” in his media statement. He said India has been a “trusted partner” in Sri Lanka’s development and will continue to assist the country in its journey for peace and development.

Calling terrorism a major threat facing the region, Modi mentioned about the ‘Easter Day terror attacks’ in Sri Lanka last year and asserted that both countries will expand cooperation to deal with the challenge.

“We both countries have fought this problem firmly. There were painful and barbaric terrorist attacks on Easter Day in Sri Lanka in April last year. These attacks were not only a blow to Sri Lanka, but also to humanity. In our talks, we discussed furthering our anti-terror cooperation,” Modi said.

Rajapaksa said a part of the discussions centred around ensuring security for

both the countries, and expressed gratitude to India for helping his country in countering terrorism.

“India is our closest neighbour and long-standing friend. The close historical links have provided solid foundation to our ties,” Rajapaksa said. India had announced a financial assistance of USD 450 million to Sri Lanka, including USD 50 million to fight terrorism, during the visit of the country’s President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in November last year.

Referring to the fishermen issue, Modi said both sides have decided to adopt a humanitarian approach in dealing with it. “It directly affects the livelihood of the people of both countries. Therefore, we agreed to continue to adopt a constructive and humanitarian approach in dealing with the issue,” he said.

The Prime Minister said the history of India-Lanka relationship has been woven with countless threads like culture, religion, art and language.

Rajapaksa, elder brother of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, arrived here on Friday on a five-day visit, his first overseas tour after being appointed as prime minister of the island nation in November last year. After his official engagement in Delhi, Mahinda Rajapaksa will travel to Varanasi, Sarnath, Bodh Gaya and Tirupati.

In the morning, the Sri Lankan Prime Minister was given a ceremonial welcome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

101,09-2-20,Time is ripe for legislation containing compulsory pre-litigation mediation: CJI,"Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Saturday said the time is ripe to devise a comprehensive legislation which contains “compulsory pre-litigation mediation” that would ensure efficiency and reduce the time of pendency for parties as well as courts.

Speaking at the 3rd edition of an international conference on ‘Arbitration in the Era of Globalisation’, Justice

Bobde said a robust “arbitration bar” is critical to the development of institutional arbitration in India as it would ensure availability and accessibility of practitioners with knowledge and experience.

Justice Bobde said on Saturday arbitration plays an essential role in the global infrastructure of international trade, commerce and investment and as an integral member of the global community and a trading and investment giant, how India engages with international arbitration has important ramifications on international trans-boundary flows of trade, commerce and investments as a whole.

“The pre-institution mediation and settlement as mentioned in the Commercial Courts Act would pave the way for many more institutions to emphasise on the need of pre-litigation mediation considering its very many benefits.

“I think the time is ripe to devise a comprehensive legislation which contains compulsory pre-litigation mediation and a remedy for the biggest drawback in a mediation agreement that is to say the unenforceability of an agreement arrived at a mediation would ensure efficiency and also reduce the time pendency for parties as well as the courts,” he said.

While talking about India’s role in international arbitration, Justice Bobde said, “In recent times, globalisation has led to the dramatic growth in cross-border transactions involving India, which has led to an increasing demand for cross-border arbitration. This has resulted in establishment of transnational practices to deal with growing quantum and complexity of matters.”

He added arbitration was not meant to mirror litigation. “The time-consuming methods of long oral arguments, long written submissions and a reference to precedence are bound to bring about the same effect in arbitration as it is done in litigation,” he said.

Justice Bobde said in the 21st century, the “global and economic integration, filled by technological innovations, enhanced communication and affordable transportation” have sharply reduced the relevance of national border for trade commerce and economic activities.

“I do agree that the globalisation seems to stay. Exponential growth of trans-boundary interactions necessitates formation of complex regulatory frameworks, including provision of effective and efficient methods of dispute resolution.

“Yet attempts to resolve international commercial or investment disputes in jurisdiction-tethered-state-forums have met with little success. This void has been successfully plugged by various alternate methods of dispute resolution, in particular international arbitration.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/time-is-ripe-for-legislation-containing-compulsory-pre-litigation-mediation--cji.html

EoLI 2019 will facilitate the assessment of ease of living of citizens across three pillars: Quality of Life, Economic Ability and Sustainability which are further divided into 14 categories across 50 indicators.

According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, all participating cities have appointed nodal officers whose responsibility is to collect and collate the relevant data points from various departments both within and outside of the ULB and upload the same along with supporting documents in the exclusive web portal designed for this purpose.

Officials said the Ministry has made several provisions for providing assistance to cities in this process of collection, collation and uploading of data. For the first time, as part of the Ease of Living Index Assessment, a citizen Perception Survey is being conducted on behalf of the Ministry (which carries 30 per cent of the marks of the Ease of Living Index).",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ease-of-living-index--municipal-performance-index-launched-for-cities.html

106,09-2-20,Posters of ‘missing MP’ Akhilesh in Azamgarh,"Irked by the prolonged absence of local parliamentarian and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav from the district during crisis, posters of ‘Missing MP’ appeared on the walls in Azamgarh on Saturday.

Adorning the walls of the district collectorate and prominent localities of the city, the posters questioned the reason for the silence of Akhilesh over the recent lathi-charge on women protesters by the police.

The SP claimed that Congress leaders of Azamgarh were behind the conspiracy to malign the image of Akhilesh Yadav.

On February 6, the police had cane-charged and fired tear gas shells at the people staging protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Azamgarh. Later 19 protesters were arrested and charged with sedition. Those arrested were sent to jail and FIRs were lodged against 35 persons.

Local Muslim women had gathered at Johar Park in Bilariyaganj area to protest against the CAA when they were cane-charged by the police. To prevent them from continuing the dharna, the police also flooded the park with water. The protesters alleged that they were pelted with stones by the police and later cane-charged.

While denying lathicharge, the police admitted that tear gas shells were fired to disperse the protesters from the park and that women were hurt due to stone-pelting by people who had gathered near the park.

Angered by this, locals in Azamgarh, especially Muslims, hit out at Akhilesh Yadav for his long absence from the constituency.

Akhilesh has visited the constituency only once after winning the election in May last year.

So far, the SP chief has not issued even a formal statement condemning the police action in Azamgarh. He has confined his displeasure on the action through some tweets and defended the right of the people to protest.

Meanwhile, the SP set up a committee to enquire into the incidents of police lathicharge on anti CAA protesters on February 5. The committee comprises local MLA Durga Prasad Yadav, former minister Ram Murti Verma, MLAs Nafis Ahmed, Sangram Singh and Subhash Rai, MLCs Ramratan Rajbhar and Rakesh Kumar and former Azamgarh SP unit chief Havaldar Yadav.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/posters-of----missing-mp----akhilesh-in-azamgarh.html

Subsequently after the police intervened and detained some of the agitators a large number of them raided the Bidhannagar North Police Station and beat up men in uniform including women constable sources said, adding the anti-CAA protesters were questioning the reason behind what they called “selective arrests” made by the police.

One of the agitators said they were protesting outside a saffron bookstall where Sinha was visiting when “some BJP workers came out and attacked us. When we resisted the police indiscriminately lathi-charged us and arrested our friends. The BJP workers who had started the fight were allowed to go. The police did not even take our complaints.”

BJP workers who were present at the place said they had reacted only after the protesters started heckling the senior leader. “We had first ignored them but when they blocked him much the way they did Babul Supriyo at Jadavpur University we had no other way but to teach them a lesson that it was not JU but somewhere else.” Subsequently the inspector in-charge of the police station said the complaints of both the sides had been taken.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tension-after-rahul-sinha-gheraoed-at-kolkata-book-fair.html

The two officers are the Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council of the White House.

Both Vindman and Sondland were key witnesses during the impeachment hearings by the Democrats-controlled House of Representatives.

Two of them were discharged after recovery, the ministry said without disclosing details. Earlier reports said that four Pakistanis and two Australians contracted the virus.

Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana who at 38 is a fresh face on the national stage, defended himself against charges of inexperience and, in a dig at Sanders, urged Americans to elevate a nominee who will “leave the politics of the past in the past.”

The 78-year-old leftist Sanders, eyeing the moderate Buttigieg as his possible chief adversary, aimed his own shots at his far younger rival in the Manchester, New Hampshire debate — casting him as the candidate of Wall Street.

“I don’t have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign,” Sanders said.

Buttigieg and Sanders finished atop the pack earlier this week in Iowa’s chaotic caucuses, and both hope to renew the performance Tuesday in New Hampshire, as the Democratic Party seeks to pick a challenger to Trump in November.

But Sanders, a veteran senator calling for “political revolution,” was in the firing line from several rivals, including former vice president and fellow septuagenarian Joe Biden who branded his policies too radical to unite Americans.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/top-hopefuls-buttigieg--sanders-under-fire-in-democratic-debate.html

Explaining the proposals in the Union Budget 2020-21 presented by her in Parliament recently to traders and industry here, Sitharaman said if the banks are denying loans without reason then the MSMEs can send a complaint to the special centre to be announced shortly.

She said a copy of the complaint should also be sent to the concerned bank manager.

Stressing that the macro economic fundamentals are good Sitharaman said our focus is on creating assets and investing in infrastructure.

131,09-2-20,Govt plugging loopholes in GST with data analytics: FM,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the Central government is plugging the loopholes in the Good and Services Tax (GST) with the use of technology and is working towards eight per cent growth rate.

She also said micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can make a complaint if banks deny them loans without reason.

Sitharaman was here to explain the Budget proposals to traders, industrialists, economists and the media.

According to her, during the last three months the GST collections have exceeded `1 lakh crore.

She said at the GST Council, State Finance Ministers had said that owing to loopholes tax revenue is not increasing and now that is being plugged.

The GST collections during November and December 2019 were about `1,04,000 crore and `1,03,000 crore respectively and in January it was `1,11,000 crore, said Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Revenue Secretary.

According to Pandey, the Government is taking various measures like use of data analytics, data from Income Tax filings, exports and imports and identify where taxes are not being paid.

Pointing out that there are about 1.20 crore entities registered under GST, he said red flag reports are prepared every month and SMS messages are sent to those on whom red flag reports are made.

Pandey said if the tax paid and the tax due difference is large than the taxpayers and also tax officials are notified.

“This has resulted in higher tax collections,” he said.

According to him, the government will continue to use targeted approach and also use data analytics and artificial intelligence.

When asked about the pending GST dues of `4,000 crore to Tamil Nadu, Sitharaman said it would be setting in two months and the due is not targeted at the state alone.

On bringing petrol and diesel under GST regime she said the GST Council consisting of state Finance Ministers have to decide on that and once they agree then it would be done.

Pandey also said once the Finance Bill is passed by Parliament the government will put out the procedure to be followed under ‘Viwad Se Vishwas’ scheme for settling pending direct tax issues.

He also said where the tax department of the government has filed an appeal against the taxpayer then that would be withdrawn.

Queried about the new tax slab rates that would turn India from a saving economy to spending economy, Sitharaman said that an earning individual with additional money on his hands can decide what to do with it and the government need not guide his savings through tax deductions.

According to her, it is just eight days since the Budget for 2020-21 was presented. It will take some time to see whether demand boosting measures stated in the Budget would give results.

Earlier addressing the traders and industrialists, Sitharaman said micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) can complain if banks deny them loans without reason.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPI) put in Rs 6,350 crore in the debt segment between February 3-7, the data showed.

However, FPIs pulled out Rs 1,172.56 crore from equities during the period, resulting in a total net investment of Rs 5,177.44 crore.

On investment in the debt segment, Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India said that it was “largely on the back of RBI maintaining an accommodative stance in its recent monetary policy review, which leaves room for further rate easing.”

Besides, he also added that markets have been overwhelmed by the spread of novel coronavirus and the impact that it could have on the Chinese economy and global growth.

This would have pushed FPIs to maintain a cautious stance on emerging markets like India until more clarity emerges.

Regarding the future course of FPI flows, Alok Agarwala, head research and advisory, Bajaj Capital, said India could continue to attract FPI inflows as “union budget has announced plenty of measures to attract the foreign capital.”

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors, adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent.

134,09-2-20,Laid foundation for USD 5 trillion economy in budget: FM,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said the Centre, in the Budget, has laid the foundation of increasing consumption while ensuring that the government's investment is deployed to build infrastructure leading to a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25.

She also pitched for rationalisation of GST rates once a year and not every three months as was the trend so far.

""I think we have laid the foundation for increasing consumption, ensuring that capex (capital expenditure) and government's investments will go towards spending on building of assets in infrastructure which should have cascading effects both in the short term and in the long term,"" Sitharaman told reporters.

She said, ""In order to address rural distress, 16 focused action points have been announced in the budget. So I expect all this will lead to a five trillion dollar economy.""

Asked about what West Bengal has received from the budget, she said, ""I do not know how I answer this question of kisko keya mila (which state gets what). I am looking at the point of macroeconomic stability, building assets in the country, money directly going to hands of individuals because of reduced tax rates and so on.""

135,09-2-20,Merkel fires official following far-right fiasco,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday fired a government official whose congratulating of a state governor elected with a far-right party’s help angered Merkel’s coalition partners.

Christian Hirte, a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union who was the government’s commissioner for the formerly communist east and a deputy economy minister, tweeted that he resigned after Merkel told him he could no longer do the job. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, confirmed his dismissal.

Hirte’s departure is the latest fallout from the shock election Wednesday of pro-business politician Thomas Kemmerich as governor of the eastern state of Thuringia. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, enabled it by supporting him in a vote in the state legislature — as did the regional branch of Merkel’s CDU, against the wishes of its national leadership.

Kemmerich’s acceptance of AfD’s votes appalled left-leaning parties and many in his own center-right camp. Merkel called his election “inexcusable.” The politician from the small Free Democrats announced the day after he was elected that he planned to step down, though it isn’t yet clear when that will happen or whether the state will hold a new election.

Hirte, a deputy leader of the CDU’s Thuringia branch who sits in the national parliament, had congratulated Kemmerich on his “election as a candidate of the center,” tweeting that it showed the state had voted out its previous left-wing government, and making no mention of AfD’s role. The center-left Social Democrats, Merkel’s junior partners in her often-tense national governing coalition, said Hirte couldn’t stay in his job.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/merkel-fires-official-following-far-right-fiasco.html
136,09-2-20,U-19 WC: India favourites in All-Asian final,"Defending champions India are overwhelming favourites to win a record fifth U-19 World Cup title here today but a tough fight is expected from first-timers Bangladesh in an all-Asian final.

If the India squad for the 2018 edition had the likes of Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill, who have expectedly gone on to play for the senior team, the exploits of opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, spinner Ravi Bishnoi and pacer Kartik Tyagi in the current edition have made them overnight stars.

Irrespective of what happens in today’s final, India have reinforced the fact that they are undisputed leaders at the under-19 level and the cricketing structure the BCCI has developed is working better than any other board in the world.

India, who walloped arch-rivals Pakistan by 10 wickets in the semifinal on Tuesday, will be playing their seventh final since 2000 when they lifted the trophy for the first time.

Heading to the mega event, India colts played about 30-odd games in different part of the world. To get used to the South African conditions, they played a quadrangular series before they played their World Cup opener against Sri Lanka.

In the final, India run into Bangladesh, a team which too has reaped the benefits of meticulous planning since their quarterfinal loss at the 2018 edition.

Though the Priyam Garg-led Indian side got the better of them in the tri-series in England and Asia Cup last year, Bangladesh have always come up with a fight and fielding coach Sharma expects it would be no different today.

“They are a very good side. There is a lot of mutual respect. I can tell you that,” he said.

Considering it is their maiden final, it is a bigger game for Bangladesh. If they win, it will be a sweet revenge against the sub-continental giants, who have found a way to tame Bangladesh at the senior level in close finals.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/u-19-wc--india-favourites-in-all-asian-final.html
137,09-2-20,"Shan, Babar help Pak dominate B’desh","Sparkling hundreds from Babar Azam and Shan Masood put Pakistan in command against Bangladesh on the second day of the first Test at Rawalpindi on Saturday.

Azam scored a career best unbeaten 143 for his third successive hundred in as many Tests — fifth of a burgeoning career — while opener Shan Masood made 100 as they pulverised a hapless Bangladesh attack at Rawalpindi stadium.

At close, Azam was still batting with Asad Shafiq on 60, piling agony on the visitors during their unbroken 137-run stand for the fourth wicket.

Masood said he and Azam have done their jobs.

“We have batted our way to take the team in a strong position and hope that the remaining batsmen come and score so that we can build a good lead,” said Masood, who hailed Azam as world class.

Pakistan lead Bangladesh’s first innings total of 233 by 109 runs with six wickets intact.

Since his fighting century against Australia at Brisbane (104) in November last year, Azam has notched 102 not out and 100 not out against Sri Lanka in two Tests — making this his fourth hundred in five Tests.

In between he missed a hundred at Adelaide by a mere three runs.

But it could have been an early exit for Azam had Ebadot Hossain not dropped him off Islam at long-off when his score was only two.

That lapse cost Bangladesh dearly as Azam added an invaluable 112 for the third wicket with Masood, who also knocked his third Test century — second in successive Tests.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shan--babar-help-pak-dominate-b---desh.html

Tokyo: Injured Japanese badminton world number one Kento Momota had surgery on a bone near his eye on Saturday — dashing hopes of an early recovery, local media reported. The 25-year-old Japanese — hurt in a Malaysian car crash earlier this year — was diagnosed with an orbital floor fracture after he said he suffered double vision during practice, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Doctors anticipated the bone would take three months to fully heal, the station said, adding he had already been discharged following the surgery. Momota had prepared to return to action at the March 11 All England Championships but would miss the competition, NHK said.

USA, Canada book Olympic berths

Leicester: The United States will try to follow their women's World Cup triumph with Olympic Gold after punching their ticket to the Tokyo Games on Friday with a 4-0 victory over Mexico. Samantha Mewis scored twice and Rose Lavelle and Christen Press added a goal apiece as the United States secured one of two Olympic berths on offer in the semi-finals of the CONCACAF regional qualifier at Dignity Sports Park in Carson, California. They'll face Canada in today's tournament final, but the main objective has been achieved by both teams, with Canada securing their Tokyo berth with a 1-0 win over Costa Rica in the first semi-final.

Bologna hit roma’s top four hopes

Rome: Roma's chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League suffered another blow on Friday as a 3-2 home defeat by Bologna extended the capital club's winless streak to three Serie A games. Paulo Fonseca's fifth-placed side remain level on points with fourth-placed Atalanta, who visit Fiorentina, before the two teams meet in Bergamo next weekend. “At this moment, we are too anxious, so I must consider what I can do to change this situation,” Roma boss Fonseca told Sky Sport Italia. “We must work to change this. It's not overly dramatic, it might all seem negative right now, but we just need courage.”

Sathiyan to play in Japan's TT league

New Delhi: G Sathiyan on Saturday became the first Indian to sign for Japan's premier table tennis league — the T League. Sathiyan will be representing Okayama Rivets in the league, which began in 2018 and is the first ever professional league in Japan. The switch to Japan for India's top-ranked paddler comes after two fruitful seasons in Germany. Sathiyan had won the German Cup with his club ASV Grunwettersbasch last month. ""I made the decision to move out of Germany as Japan is much better for practice and the level is higher than Europe,"" Sathiyan said.

139,09-2-20,Saini regrets untimely dismissal that cost India,"India pacer Navdeep Saini lamented his dismissal at a crucial juncture which resulted in team’s series-conceding defeat in the second ODI on Saturday.

Saini’s 76-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Ravindra Jadeja kept India in pursuit of a 274-run target but the former’s dismissal crushed team’s hopes.

Saini had smacked Kyle Jamieson for a six but was bowled in the next ball. Skipper Virat Kohli was even seen asking Saini to stay clam after he hit the ball out of park.

“I will regret when I go back and see the video. If I hadn’t got out, maybe the result could have been different. Will regret that I took it so close and maybe could have gotten closer,” Saini said at the post match conference.

“We felt the wicket was flat and if we could stay till the end, the match could go close. So we were trying to contribute as much as possible and take the match to the end. Jadeja had told me that if you get a boundary ball hit it. Otherwise take singles or doubles, try to keep patience and we can take the game to the end.”

Saini was seen batting long in the nets pre-match and it paid off as he scored 45 off 49 balls, including five fours and two sixes. The pacer said it is important for the lower order to contribute runs for the team’s cause.

“It is a good thing that the lower order is performing like this. If everyone performs, it is called a team effort. If batsmen cannot score, bowlers should. If bowlers are not taking wickets, fielders should help. It is a team, after all.

“I was thinking that I got to bat after a long time. As soon as I hit the boundary, I was in shock. Wow, the ball is coming really well off my bat, I thought. Among the support staff, Raghu (throw down specialist) helps me with batting and is always encouraging me to do well. Even in hotel, he keeps telling me that I bat well and should do better. He keeps motivating me and always talks about my batting,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/saini-regrets-untimely-dismissal-that-cost-india.html
140,09-2-20,Surreal to get man of the match on debut: Kyle,"New Zealand’s debutant pacer Kyle Jamieson has called his maiden international game surreal after he won the man-of-the-match in their 22-run win.

“Pretty surreal. You kind of grow up dreaming of these moments. Get your first cap and hope to make an impact and to play some sort of role in helping us first to get to a total and then restrict a pretty good batting line-up is very pleasing. And to have a series win tops it all,” he said on Saturday. Talking about his 76-run partnership off 51 balls with Taylor, Jamieson said,”Firstly, we were just trying to get to the 50 overs. We had plenty of time and that made it pretty simple.

“It was just about getting through that 50 overs and then my role became about how do I get Ross on strike and what end do we attack and what total do we need to get to and we ended up getting a little bit more because we kind of extended a wee bit, which was good. Pretty simple from Ross!”

He then took a brace including Prithvi Shaw as his first wicket. Later he bowled Navdeep Saini who was playing the rescue act with Ravindra Jadeja late in the Indian innings.

“The debut wicket (was more special than the runs). I think hitting the six was a bit of a bonus. My role is to bowl and take wickets and restrict runs. To get that first one under the belt is quite special. But I think being able to perform that role, my core role, is special to me.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/surreal-to-get-man-of-the-match-on-debut--kyle.html
141,09-2-20,Black Caps avenge T20 routing,"Jamieson’s dream debut, India’s middle-order slump helps NZ seal One-Day contest

New Zealand exorcised the ghost of a nightmarish T20 whitewash with a series-clinching 22-run victory against India in the second ODI on Saturday as the visitors paid the price for poor shot selection.

Revenge as they say is a dish best served cold and on a chilly Auckland night, New Zealand defended a total of 273 by restricting India to 251 in 48.3 overs taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

The victory also completed a hat-trick of ODI wins for the Black Caps starting from their World Cup semi-final win in Manchester last year.

The win was more creditable as regular skipper Kane Williamson along with top bowlers Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson were unavailable.

New Zealand’s 6 foot 8 inch debutant Kyle Jamieson (2/42 and 25 off 24 balls) got the Player of the Match award for his all-round show.

“I’m impressed with how we finished. We let things slip away from 197-8 to 270 plus in the first half but came back strongly with the second half of our batting. We were in trouble with the bat, but Saini and Jadeja played really well, as did Shreyas,” skipper Virat Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

In fact the skipper felt that ODIs are less relevant in a T20 World Championship year.

“ODIs aren’t too relevant this year compared to Tests and T20s, but to find people who can play that way under pressure is a big revelation for us and a big plus.”

Ravindra Jadeja (55 off 73 balls) along with Navdeep Saini (45 off 49 balls) raised visions of pulling off an improbable win with a 76-run partnership, which ended in vain.

Tim Southee despite running temperature (2/41 in 10 overs) was brilliant with the new ball as his incutter got rid of Virat Kohli but it was poor shot selection from a set Shreyas Iyer (52) and Kedar Jadhav (9) in the middle overs did cost India dearly after the inexperienced pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw had a second successive poor day.

Earlier, in-form Ross Taylor produced a rearguard act with an unbeaten half century to rescue New Zealand to a competitive 273 for eight in 50 overs.

Taylor scored 73 not out (74 balls, 6 fours, 2 sixes) — his 51st half-century — and put on 76 off 51 balls for the ninth wicket with Jamieson to lift the hosts from 197-8 to a competitive score.

Opener Martin Guptill smashed a run-a-ball 79 to give the Black Caps a good start but they lost seven wickets for 55 runs to look down the barrel at one stage.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/black-caps-avenge-t20-routing-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/black-caps-avenge-t20-routing.html

While Indian pair of Ramanathan Ramkumar and Purav Raja bid to extend Indian challenge came to an end against third seed pair of Jonathan Earlich and Andrei Vasilevski in the doubles semi-final after suffering 7-6, 6-4 defeat.

Andre Goransson and Christopher Rungkat have already made their way into the doubles summit clash with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-1) in the first semi-final on Friday.

In an intense fight between Vesely and Berankis in the last-4 clash that saw all three sets going in to decider. While Berankis won the first set, Vesely bagged the second to keep his challenge alive during his third appearance at the Tata Open Maharashtra. When Vesely and Berankis met last time in the round-of-128 during 2019 US Open, the Lithuanian star clinched the marathon five-setter encounter. Six months later both played with the same grit and hardly game each other any chances to score in the neck-and-neck match at the South Asia’s only ATP Tour tournament which is organised by Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA) in association with Government of Maharashtra.

While, Berankis entered the semi-final with 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win over Japanese Yuichi Sugita, Vesely overcame Ilya Ivashka of Belarus 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (11-9).

The 26-year-old Vesely, who stunned then NextGen star Alexander Zverev in the first round of 2019 Wimbledon, made World No 73 Berankis work hard in the last two sets in the epic three hours and two minutes clash to clinch the thrilling encounter.

With win over Berankis, Vesely made his way into his first final at the Tata Open Maharashtra.

143,09-2-20,Key member of Pakistani Taliban killed in Afghan,"The Pakistani Taliban has confirmed that one of its key leaders and another member of the group were killed in a clash with security forces in Afghanistan.

In a statement published by the SITE monitoring group Friday, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said Sheikh Khalid Haqqani, who served on the group’s consultative council and had been a deputy leader, had been killed January 31.

Haqqani’s close confidant Qari Saifullah Peshawari was also killed in the clash that took place inside Afghanistan during a “mission”, a senior Pakistani Taliban leader told AFP.

Afghan security forces declined to comment, and it was not immediately clear what type of mission Haqqani may have been on. Haqqani was not thought to be related to the Haqqani network, which is also affiliated to the Afghan Taliban.

Both Islamabad and Kabul have long accused each other of allowing militants to shelter in the border regions and launch bloody attacks that threaten regional stability.

144,09-2-20,Iran must become strong to end ‘enemy threat’: Khamenei,"Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday that the Islamic republic must become strong enough to ward off the “enemy’s threats” and prevent a war.

Khamenei also said Iran had a strong air force despite decades of US pressure and sanctions on the country since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

“We must become strong so that there will not be a war, become strong so that enemy’s threats will end,” he told a gathering of air force commanders and staff.

“We do not want to threaten anyone... This is to prevent threats, to maintain the country’s security,” he added in a speech aired on state television.

Tensions escalated between Tehran and Washington after a January 3 US drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

Iran retaliated days later by firing a wave of missiles at American troops stationed in Iraq. Its defence forces had been braced for US retaliation when they shot down a Ukraine International Airlines flight a few minutes after take-off from Tehran on January 8.

“Our Air Force, which had no right to & couldn’t even repair parts of aircrafts (before the revolution) now builds planes,” Khamenei was quoted as saying on his English-language Twitter account.

“Sanctions are literally crimes, BUT they can be turned into opportunities,” he added.

In 2018, the United States withdrew unilaterally from a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and began reimposing sanctions as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign on the country.

145,09-2-20,‘Think about your people’ UN chief tells South Sudan rivals,"UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Saturday said it was “unacceptable” South Sudan’s warring parties had yet to make peace as a deadline approaches for the rivals to join forces in government.

President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar have failed to break a deadlock over key terms of a power-sharing agreement with just two weeks until they are to form a unity government.

The pair have already missed two previous deadlines to settle their differences and enshrine a lasting peace to put an end to six years of bloody civil war that has left 380,000 people dead and millions more in dire poverty.

“Think about your people, respect your people, you have not the right to continue the confrontation when your people are suffering so much,” Guterres told reporters in Addis Ababa ahead of an African Union summit.

“It is your moral and political responsibility to put an end to this and to find the agreements that are necessary to make South Sudan enter into a normal life.”

Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018, pausing the bloodshed that erupted in 2013 when the president accused his former deputy of plotting a coup.

They agreed to come together in a coalition in May the following year, however disputes over territory and security arrangements dogged negotiations and the deadline was missed, followed by another six months later.

In November, the pair were given 100 more days to resolve these sticking points as fears grew that the tenuous ceasefire could be derailed if a breakthrough was not achieved.

But progress has been piecemeal as the new February 22 looms nearer.

“It is for me totally unacceptable that we are again closing to a deadline ... And there is no agreement on a number of issues,” Guterres said.

“It is time for the South Sudanese leaders to agree to cooperate, and to deserve the wonderful people they have.”

148,09-2-20,Sixers win Big Bash title,"Sydney Sixers were crowned Big Bash League champions for a second time on Saturday after Melbourne Stars fell short during the run-chase in a rain-affected match that capped a near two-month competition.

Chasing 117 to win a game reduced to 12 overs, Glenn Maxwell’s Stars could only manage 97 for six as they suffered a second finals defeat in a row after imploding against the Melbourne Renegades last year.

“It’s fantastic, it was an entertaining game of cricket,” said Sixers captain Moises Henriques after the 19-run win at the Sydney Cricket Ground secured their second title and first since the inaugural season in 2011-12.

“The wicket played pretty well after so much rain. Well done to the ground staff and congratulations to the Stars on a great season.”

It was remarkable the match went ahead with Sydney drenched by torrential rain for two straight days, which only let up as the final was due to start, with the game getting underway more than an hour late.

Unlike most other Twenty20 events around the world, no finals reserve day is built into the BBL structure which would have meant the Sixers claiming victory as the host team if no play was possible.

Nathan Lyon (2-19) and Steve O’Keefe (2-27) were the pick of the Sixers’ bowlers after they made 116 for five in their innings, spearheaded by impressive opener Josh Philippe's 52.

“The boys can hold their heads up high, we’ve had a great year,” said Maxwell. ""Unfortunately we let ourselves tonight, but they can be proud. Two finals in a row. We’ve been extremely consistent.

149,09-2-20,Indian women’s chase record win,"Smriti Mandhana struck a sublime half-century as India finally produced a good batting display to record a seven-wicket win over Australia here on Saturday, keeping their hopes alive for a place in the final of the women’s T20 tri-series.

Australia posted 173 for 5 courtesy a 57-ball 93 from Ashleigh Gardner and Meg Lanning’s 22-ball 37 after India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur elected to field at the Junction Oval.

India then overhauled the target in 19.4 overs, largely due to opener Shafali Verma’s 49 off 28 balls and Mandhana’s 55 off 48 balls.

With the win, India moved to the second position in the points table, behind England. The winner of the final league match between Australia and England today will decide the finalists for the title clash on February 12.

After two failures, sixteen-year-old Shafali gave India a flying start with her innings containing eight fours and a six. Her senior opening partner Mandhana on the other hand anchored the case with a solid knock comprising seven fours.

After Shafali was caught by Nicola Carey off Ellyse Perry’s ball, Jemimah Rodrigues came into the crease and made a quickfire 19-ball 30, studded with five hits to the fence.

Her innings was cut short when she holed out to Alyssa Healy off Megan Schutt’s delivery in the 13th over.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 not out off 20 balls) then joined Mandhana and added 42 to take India close to the target. Mandhana was trapped LBW by Carey in the 19th over. Harmanpreet and Deepti Sharma (11 not out off 4 balls) then took the team to a resounding win.

Bernard, Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals for the Toffees, who have won five and drawn two of eight league games since the Italian took charge in December.

“Since I arrived the team did a fantastic job,” Ancelotti told BT Sport. “Now we have a possibility to think about Europa League.”

At the other end of the table, Palace are looking over their shoulders at the relegation zone.

Roy Hodgson’s men still have a six-point lead over the bottom three, but have not won in eight games and just once in the league since early December.

“I can’t fault the players’ effort, but it’s another defeat and another we go home without points,” said Hodgson.

“We know what we have to do. When we moved the ball quickly we asked questions and were close to getting more than one goal.”

Bernard gave the hosts a deserved first half lead with a thumping finish from Theo Walcott’s cross to the back post.

However, Palace were gifted a route back into the game six minutes into the second half thanks to another error from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

Just as Everton were wobbling, though, a moment of magic from Richarlison swung the game back in their favour seven minutes later.

The Brazilian stormed onto Calvert-Lewin’s flick-on to carry the ball from just inside the Palace half and past Gary Cahill before placing his shot into the far corner.

The same two players were involved when Everton sealed the points two minutes from time as Richarlison's header from a corner came off the bar and Calvert-Lewin turned home his 13th goal of the season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/toffees-charge-into-european-contention.html
151,09-2-20,Veteran RSS 'pracharak' P Parameswaran passes away,"P Parameswaran, one of the senior-most 'pracharaks' of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and former leader of the erstwhile Bharatiya Jana Sangh, passed away in the early hours of Sunday, Sangh Parivar sources said. He was 91.

The founder director of the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram took his last breath at 12.10 am while undergoing Ayurvedic treatment at Ottappalam in Kerala's Palakkad district, according to the sources.

Parameswaran, who had worked with leaders like Deendayal Upadhyaya, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani during the Jana Sangh days, was honoured with Padma Vibhushan, the country's second highest civilian award in 2018 and Padma Shri in 2004.

Fondly called as Parameswar ji by Sangh Parivar and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, Parameswaran was a prolific writer, poet, researcher and a widely-respected RSS ideologue. He was the Bharatiya Jana Sangh's secretary (1967–1971) and vice president (1971–1977), as well as the director of the Deendayal Research Institute (1977–1982), New Delhi.

Born in 1927 in Muhamma, Alappuzha district, he joined the RSS during his student days.

His body will be brought to the RSS headquarters in Kochi on Sunday morning for people to pay their last respects. The cremation will be held in Muhamma in the evening, the sources said.

During the days of Emergency, he courted arrest as part of the all India Satyagraha against it and was jailed for 16 months.

Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram was established by Parameswaran in 1982 ""to promote nationalist thoughts among Keralites"".",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/veteran-rss--pracharak--p-parameswaran-passes-away-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/veteran-rss--pracharak--p-parameswaran-passes-away.html

154,09-2-20,Punjab bans movie based on gangster,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a ban on the movie 'Shooter', which is based on the life and crimes of notorious gangster Sukha Kahlwan and 'promotes violence, heinous crimes, extortion, threats and criminal intimidation'.

The Chief Minister has also directed Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta to look into the possible action that could be initiated against one of the film's producers, K.V. Dhillon, who had reportedly promised in writing back in 2019, that he would shelve the movie, originally titled 'Sukha Khalwan'.

The DGP has also been asked to look into the role of the promoters, directors and actors of the movie.

An official spokesperson told IANS on Sunday that the Chief Minister has made it clear that his government will not allow any movies, songs, etc, that seek to promote crime, violence and gangsterism or crime in the state.

The Chief Minister had directed the police to ensure that nothing is allowed to disturb Punjab's peace and communal harmony, said a governemnt spokesperson.

The DGP said the matter of banning this controversial movie in Punjab had been discussed at a meeting with the Chief Minister on Friday, along with a proposal from ADGP Intelligence Varinder Kumar, recommending a ban on the movie, whose trailer, released on January 18, suggested that the film was highly radical.

In view of the expected repercussions of the movie on the youth and apprehensions of disturbance of public order, ""it would be appropriate if the release and screening of the movie be banned in the state of Punjab,"" the ADGP had further stated, in a letter to Additional Chief Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs and Justice.

The producer had earlier given his commitment after the Mohali police received a complaint about the movie glorifying gangster Kahlwan, who used to describe himself as ""sharpshooter"" and was allegedly involved in more than 20 cases, including murder, kidnapping and extortion.

The decision to ban the movie comes less than 10 days after Mansa Police registered a case against Punjabi singers Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu or Sidhu Moose Wala and Mankirat Aulakh for propagating violence and crime through a video clip uploaded on social media.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has already directed the DGPs of Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory of Chandigarh to ensure that no songs are played glorifying the liquor, drugs and violence in any song even in the live shows.

The Court further directed that District Magistrates and SSPs of each district would be personally responsible for strict compliance of these directions.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/punjab-bans-movie-based-on-gangster-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/punjab-bans-movie-based-on-gangster.html

158,09-2-20,Raptors edge Pune 7 Aces in thrilling semis,"Bengaluru Raptors continue their quest to become the first team at the Star Sports Premier Badminton League to win back-to-back titles as they edged Pune 7 Aces 4-3 in a thrilling second semi-final at the GMC Balayogi SATS Indoor Stadium in Hyderabad on Saturday. Bengaluru’s World Championships Bronze medallist Sai Praneeth was upset by Pune’s World No 73 Kazumasa Sakai but the defending champions rebounded with wins from Tai Tzu Ying, Brice Leverdez before the mixed doubles pair of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won sealed the tie for Bengaluru.

Today, the Raptors will vie for the trophy with the North Eastern Warriors, who have made it to the final for the very first time.

With the two teams locked at 3-3, it all depended on the mixed doubles rubber to decide the outcome of the tie. Olympic Silver medallist Soon and two-time World Championships medallist showed their fireworks in a fabulous 15-13, 15-10 victory over Pune’s Commonwealth Games Gold medallists Chris and Gabrielle Adcock.

World No 2 Tai Tzu Ying was the heavy favourite coming into her women’s singles clash with Pune’s Rituparna Das. But the World No 100, who had upset the 14th ranked Beiwen Zhang earlier in the season, gave a good account of herself in her first-ever meeting with the former World No 1. But Tai’s spectacular net game made all the difference as the Chinese Taipei ace wrapped it up 15-12, 15-12.

In the other men’s singles match of the day, World No 131 Mithun Manjunath of Pune put up a gallant effort against World No 39 Brice Leverdez in their first-ever encounter. Leverdez pulled through ultimately 15-14, 9-15, 15-6 but not before surviving a scare from the rising star.

Earlier, Pune began the tie with a solid display in their Trump match. World champion Hendra Setiawan and World No 10 Chirag Shetty’s sizzling partnership has been the backbone of the Aces’ success this season and they put up yet another brilliant show of power and precision to beat Bengaluru’s Arun George and Rian Agung Saputro 15-12, 15-10.

159,09-2-20,Bale returns to Madrid squad,"Gareth Bale will return to the Real Madrid squad for the first time in five games today when Zinedine Zidane’s side take on Osasuna in La Liga.

The club announced on Saturday that Bale has been called up, despite the Welshman being left out of Madrid’s last four matches against Real Valladolid, Real Zaragoza, Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad.

Bale has only made two appearances so far this year. He played 90 minutes against Getafe on January 4 and then 53 minutes against Unionistas de Salamanca two weeks ago in the Copa del Rey, when he came off with an ankle sprain.

Yet he has been fit for the last three fixtures and not been selected. Zidane said in a press conference on Saturday he has no problems with the way Bale has been training.

“Gareth is here and I am happy with all the players I have,” Zidane said. “I know the answer you’re looking for but I have 25 players and I have to choose. There are no issues or problems. I am sure Gareth is going to keep working as he has been.”

Asked if leaving Bale out of the squad amounted to a lack of respect, Zidane said: “I don’t think so, the most important thing is he is here, working hard and he wants to train.

“There are times when he isn’t named in the squad but I wouldn’t read too much into it. Everyone has a role and Gareth is a player I will need between now and the end of the season.”

After almost leaving Madrid last summer, Bale has endured another stop-start season under Zidane.

A calf injury ruled him out four weeks in October and November, when Bale provoked anger in Spain by playing for Wales and then celebrating victory behind a flag that read: “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.”

A thigh strain forced him to sit out for a week in December before a throat infection meant he missed Madrid’s success in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.

The ankle problem sustained against Unionistas was minor but he has not played since. “We talk regularly but I am not going to tell you what I tell my players in private,” Zidane said.

“We know what he can bring to the team and he has to be fit and ready so he is in the best shape to play.”

Zidane was asked if he would have a problem with Bale seeing out his Madrid contract, which expires in 2022. “None whatsoever,” he said. “He has a contract and he wants to stay here.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bale-returns-to-madrid-squad.html
160,09-2-20,Belgian waffles for dessert,"Indian men's team climbs up a place to become World No 4 side after beating World Champions 2-1 in Pro League match

Aggressive play by Indian men’s hockey team ensured they beat World No1 Belgium 2-1 in a thrilling encounter to keep up their winning form in the FIH Hockey Pro League 2020. It was goals by Mandeep Singh (2’) and Ramandeep Singh (46’) that saw India gain the winning points against the World Champions at the iconic Kalinga Hockey Stadium in Bhubaneswar on an overcast Saturday evening. With this sensational victory, India consolidated their World Ranking from No 5 to World No 4 for the first time since the World Ranking system was introduced in 2003.

After getting off to a rollicking start in their maiden FIH Hockey Pro League with a formidable 5-2 and (3-3) 3-1 win against the Netherlands, hosts India did well to halt the World Champions’ winning streak in the on-going Pro League 2020. Coming into this match with (2-2) 4-2 and 4-2 win against Australia and a splendid 6-2 and 3-1 win against New Zealand, the World No1 side struggled to convert their chances against India.

Despite dominating with ball possession, making as many as 38 circle entries, taking 24 shots on goal and 12 PCs, the Belgian unit could not muster much success in the circle, thanks to stand-out performance by Indian goalkeepers PR Sreejesh and Krishan Pathak who lived up to the billing hooter-to-hooter, backing India’s defence by knocking off pretty much every opportunity created by the Belgian strikers.

Belgium Skipper Thomas Briels did not mince his words as he rued his team’s missed chances. He said, “It was a tough match and playing India at home is never easy. Too bad we could not convert our chances. There have been many times when PCs have saved us but today the Indian goalkeepers were outstanding and hopefully we can seek revenge for this loss tomorrow (Sunday).”

India were quick to get off the blocks with debutant Raj Kumar Pal setting up a fantastic goal within 90 seconds of play as he passed from the left flank to Dilpreet Singh on top of the circle. Young forward Dilpreet, making his comeback in the Indian squad after over a year, took a powerful shot on goal which found a perfect deflection from Mandeep Singh who was positioned in front of Belgian goalkeeper Vincent Vanasch.

Although it was striker Mandeep Singh who put India ahead in the first-quarter, it was Krishan Pathak who ensured Belgium did not bounce back. He was kept busy all of 15 minutes in the first quarter with Belgium creating plenty of opportunities which included as many as five penalty corners. India almost threatened to double their lead in the 12th minute when Ramandeep Singh and Raj Kumar Pal teamed up in the circle but could not find success.

Belgium’s wait to convert a goal ended only in the third quarter when they made a good variation of a PC, opening up the angle to trick India’s rushers and made enough space for Gauthier Boccard to put the ball past Krishan Pathak to level scores in the 33rd minute. Even though India made a couple of PCs in the following minutes, they could not convert.

With scores reading 1-1, it was a tense final quarter but India pushed back Belgium by scoring another goal. It was Ramandeep Singh, who after injecting the ball during a PC battery, picked up a rebound off Belgium’s first rusher to score the goal. Though Belgium created PCs in the dying minutes of the match, India held their nerves and experienced goalkeeper Sreejesh ensured India sealed the game and earned the winning points to stay at second position in the FIH Hockey Pro League points table. Belgium are still on top with 11 points from 5 games.

The victory is India’s 50th win against Belgium and the most memorable one as it has helped the team consolidate position of World No 4 pushing defending Olympic Champions Argentina to No 5.

This is the first time since the introduction of the FIH World Ranking system that India have attained top 4 ranking in the world.

161,09-2-20,Sweden's Duplantis breaks world pole vault record,"Armand Duplantis of Sweden set a world pole vault record of 6.17 metres at an indoor meeting in Poland.

Duplantis, the US-born 20-year-old who won silver at last year's world championships in Doha, cleared the bar on Saturday on his second attempt in Torun to break the previous record of 6.16m set by French vaulter Renaud Lavillenie in February 2014.

""It's something that I wanted since I was three years old,"" Duplantis told the website of World Athletics.

""It's a big year, but it's a good way to start it."" Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion, said he was not surprised his record had been eclipsed.

""It's not a surprise. For two years now I knew he had the potential,"" the 33-year-old Frenchman told RMC Sports after competing at a meeting in Rouen.

""Records are made to be beaten. He has got time on his side to definitely do even better and that's a great thing.""

Duplantis had almost broken the record at a meeting in Duesseldorf on Tuesday. His performance marks him out as a clear favourite for the Olympic title in Tokyo this year.

Long considered the man most likely to push the event forward, Duplantis began breaking age group records aged seven.

He announced his prodigious talent to a wider audience when he won the European outdoor title in Berlin in 2018 with a vault of 6.05m, a world junior record.

Coached by his American father Greg -- himself a former pole vaulter who cleared 5.80m -- Duplantis was a product of a track and field-crazy family which had their own vaulting apparatus in the garden.

He competed for Louisiania State University in the United States last year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sweden-s-duplantis-breaks-world-pole-vault-record-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sweden-s-duplantis-breaks-world-pole-vault-record.html

163,09-2-20,ICC U19 WC final: India fold for 177 against fiery Bangladesh,"Sharp bowling from the fiery Bangladesh pacers and good fielding coupled with some slack running between the wickets led to India folding for 177 in the ICC U19 World Cup final on Sunday in Potchefstroom. India are looking to win their fifth title while this is the first time that Bangladesh have reached the final.

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal was the standout performer for India, scoring 88 off 121 balls. He has scored at least a half century in all but one match in this tournament, and ends it as top scorer with a whopping 400 runs.

However, his team mates fell in a pack to Bangladesh who came out all guns blazing.

India were put to bat first after Bangladesh won the toss and openers Jaiswal and Divyaansh Saxena were greeted with a barrage of deliveries angled at the body and cramping them for space. Saxena was, especially, targeted by Tanzim Hasan Sakib with the ball and verbally. It took India 14 balls to finally get their first run.

The constant pressure from Sakib and Shoriful Islam eventually did the trick when Saxena flashed at a delivery outside off stump and drove it straight to backward point. Avishek Das was the man who got the wicket and it was his first over of the match.

After this came the most stable period of the Indian innings as Jaiswal and Tilak Varma stood their ground to the Bangladesh attack. Runs began to flow and Jaiswal scored his fifth 50 of the tournament. The pair also took India past the 100-run mark and their partnership was worth 94 runs.

It was Sakib who eventually got the breakthrough for Bangladesh with a short delivery that Varma looked to cut. The ball flew into the hands of the fielder at deep backward point.

Jaiswal then found able company in wicketkeeper Dhruv Jorel but ended up falling to Shoriful Islam eight overs later. He cramped Jaiswal for room and his attempted shot flew to short midwicket where Tanzid Hasan was standing.

India went on to lose their next six wickets for 21 runs in the next nine overs. Islam dismissed Siddesh Veer off the very next ball of the over after which Jorel and Ravi Bishnoi were both run out due to mix-ups between the wicket. Atharva Ankolekar and Kartik Tyagi were dismissed by Avishek while Sushant Mishra fell to Sakib.

164,09-2-20,SGPC bans making TikTok videos inside Golden Temple,"The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has prohibited making TikTok videos inside the Golden Temple in the wake of such videos showing the visitors dancing and playing songs, going viral on social media.

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex religious body of Sikhs, on Saturday pasted posters inside the Golden Temple complex, warning devotees not to shoot TikTok videos inside the Harmandir Sahib.

""TikTok is prohibited here,"" read one such poster.

The move comes a day after Giani Harpreet Singh, head priest of the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, had said banning mobile phones inside the Golden Temple complex would have to be ""thought over"" if visitors continued to shoot TikTok videos inside the holiest Sikh shrine.

TikTok is a short-video platform which is extremely popular among youngsters globally, including India. Owned by China-based ByteDance, it has about 200 million users in India.

""We want all devotees to visit the Golden Temple without any hassle and are not in favour of imposing any such (mobile) ban, but the way the incidents of TikTok are surfacing, I think imposing the ban on carrying mobile phones inside (Golden Temple) will have to be pondered over in the future,"" Jathedar had told reporters in Amritsar on Friday.

The Jathedar (head priest) had also pointed out that some of the devotees even argued with 'sewadars' (workers) upon being stopped from clicking photos inside the premises.

Photography and videography in the precincts of the Golden Temple have already been banned by the SGPC to avoid any ""disturbance"" to the spiritual atmosphere.

A few days ago, a TikTok video shot inside the temple by three girls with a Punjabi song playing in the background had gone viral on social media, prompting the SGPC to take a stern view.

It was the second such incident in a short span of time as in January, a police complaint was lodged against a girl for hurting religious sentiments of Sikhs after she shot a dance video inside the Darbar Sahib complex.

Later, the girl had to apologise.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sgpc-bans-making-tiktok-videos-inside-golden-temple-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sgpc-bans-making-tiktok-videos-inside-golden-temple.html
165,09-2-20,Raj Thackeray leads mega-morcha to oust infiltrators,"Over 100,000 activists led by the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray, marched in a mega-procession to demand the ouster of Pakistani-Bangladeshi infiltrators living in the country, here on Sunday afternoon.

Accompanied by the MNS top brass, the Thackerays headed the procession from Girgaum Chowpatty as it wend its way to the historic Azad Maidan, around 4 kms away, where more enthusiastic crowds awaited Thackeray, who is expected to address a rally later.

Earlier, starting from his Shivaji Park home, Thackeray, wife Sharmila, their son and MNS leader Amit Thackeray, first stopped to perform an 'aarti' and avail 'darshan' of Lord Ganesha at the famed 220-year old Siddhivinayak Temple in Prabhadevi and a 'darshan' of his uncle and Shiv Sena founder the late Balasaheb Thackeray's memorial, before proceeding to Girgaum Chowpatty.

Thousands of MNS activists from all over Maharashtra have been trooping to Mumbai since Saturday night to join the procession, by public or chartered buses, private vehicles, trains and even motorcycles, braving the mild chill in the atmosphere.

The entire route from Girgaum Chowpatty to Azad Maidan resembled a sea of the MNS' new saffron-hued flag with the symbol of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Royal Seal, and the marchers donning arm-bands of the party symbol, some sporting matching t-shirts and caps.

Marching peacefully and in an orderly fashion, many raised slogans demanding that the illegal migrants living in the country should be driven away as they are a drain on the country's economy, resources and jobs, besides posing threats to national security.

However, Raj Thackeray has made it clear that the morcha is not in support of the CAA-NRC-NPR which have created massive socio-political upheavals in the country over two months.

This is the MNS' first public show of strength after it donned a new 'avatar' on January 23, with a new flag, symbol, 'Hindutva' agenda and right-wing direction as it struggles for survival to create its own political space in Maharashtra politics, particularly after the recently changed state political scenario.

A couple of days ago, some posters were seen outside the Chief Minister's residence, Matoshri in Bandra seeking the eviction of illegal Pakistani-Bangladeshi residents.

Mumbai Police have made elaborate security arrangements by deploying over 600 personnel, besides specialized forces and other units on standby, and plainclothes personnel mingling with the crowds, to avert any untoward incidents.

""Apart from the Mumbai Police, we have deployed State Reserve Police Force, Riot Control Police, Quick Response Team, Bombay Detection & Disposal Squads, Dog Squads and monitor the entire morcha through CCTVs and drones,"" Mumbai Police Spokesperson and DCP Pranaya Ashok informed the media.

The Traffic Police have implemented stringent regulations, diversions, closures of certain routes, no-parkings, restrictions at Nariman Point, Gateway of India, etc for the smooth movement of the procession.

At the MNS mega-convention on January 23, Raj Thackeray had announced the Febuary 9 procession, amidst speculation that the party was cosying up to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.

""We are not against any Indian Muslims. They are ours. There can be a debate on the CAA, but why should we permit those who have illegally entered the country and continue living here,"" he demanded.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/raj-thackeray-leads-mega-morcha-to-oust-infiltrators-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/raj-thackeray-leads-mega-morcha-to-oust-infiltrators.html
166,09-2-20,Attention seeking comic station,"Birds of prey

*ing: Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell

Rated: 6/10

Where super villains and their villainy go, the racy violence, the cranky pace of the motion picture, the hard and fast changing rules of survival and, of course, the will to be on the top of the game, that too in style, dot the landscape of crime and action.

In this one from the Marvel blockbuster outlet, all this and more is attempted to be doused in woman emancipation and empowerment through catty fights and a troika coming out of the maze of male superdom with a snazzy narrative and a psychedelic dive into the crime world of old-world New York.

Marvel generally endears and ensnares with its heroes and villains but this one is hyperly feminist and deals with Joker’s girlfriend driving a force of life that needs her own brand of killer instinct in a world where other super crime bosses are after her life in the absence of her loony, abusive, overpowering Mister J who used to keep her on her toes when he inhabited the spectrum.

But now that he is not there, the Joker-free Harley Quinn devises her own scatterbrain combat plan to keep you sometimes interested, sometimes irritated through the film which is actually quite a screech that may ultimately annoy you no ends.

Having said that though, Margot Robbie and her pigtailed appearance along with her female partners in crime define personalities on edge driving you mad too with their antics soaked in violence, deceit and me-first concoction.

This super villain, despite the best effort, fails to draw in the juice as most Marvel movies do. It is not even about Joker but his catty, red lipstick bearing outlandish blond girlfriend who has been emancipated and has to float in the upper echelons of the criminal world edging out male domination. High pitched music, all over the place voice-over to the staccato visuals, fight scenes that make you feel like the bird of prey and a female get-together that is highly unstable is not the coolest idea of a blockbuster one might say.

Touching & emotional

shikara

*ing: Aadil Khan, Sadia

Rated: 6/10

In order to truly understand, be involved and find a connect with Shikara, the latest movie directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, one has to undergo what the Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley went through in the early 90s. As the credits role at the end of the movie, this film is dedicated to his mother Shanti Devi, who left J&K never to return.

One is surprised that the director took so long to tell a story on a subject that is so close to home. However, the reel is totally removed from what really the Pandits from the Valley had to endure when they left their homes — leaving everything behind them. The generations of legacy, home and business. They became refugees in their own country, the minute they crossed Banihal Pass. How they were looked down upon by the rest of the people, how they had to pick up the pieces of their life and build it from scratch, has not been done justice to.

Shikara, sadly only gives a tiny peek into what really transpired. Hence, even though the subject is touching, there is little that people not from the region will find to connect.

Brainless beef cake

Malang

*ing: Aditya Roy Kapur, Disha Patani, Anil Kapoor, Kunal Kemmu

Rated: 5/10

Unleash the madness, so goes the tagline for this Mohit Suri directed Malang. The director who has movies like Aashiqui and its sequel and Ek Villain to name a few has kept to his true format — a love story where the hero is on a self-destructive path. In this regard, Malang is no different, just the backdrop is different — Goa and its drug underbelly.

However, this is not the first movie with this setting. The director could have chosen to tell a different story. We are somewhat tired of watching the hero wronged and walk the revenge path.

But not all is lost here. The hero Aditya Roy Kapur is all buffed up — six-pack abs and shirtless to boot; maybe he can give our bhai a run of his money. Then there is Kunal Kemmu. He has definitely reinvented himself in this film. As Michael Rodriguez, his performance is worth a mention since the actor is known to do comic roles with aplomb. Sadly, in an era where content is hero, Malang doesn’t have much to offer.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/attention-seeking-comic-station-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/attention-seeking-comic-station.html

168,09-2-20,‘I was apprehensive to play Zara’,"TUNISHA SHARMA, who is seen in Zee TV’s Ishq Subhan Allah, speaks with CHANCHAL GOYAL about the preparations that she had to do for the role, among other things

Were there any apprehensions before taking up the role?

Yes, it was a big step for me since I was replacing Esha who has been playing Zara for almost two years. I was nervous and excited at the same time. I decided to take it up because it was a new experience for me.

What preparations did you do for the show?

I have to sometimes speak urdu and I have a Punjabi accent so there are times when Adnan or our director keep on correcting me about the pronounciation of certain words. I also had to learn few Muslim traditions like how to wear a hijab.

With whom you share cordial relations behind the scenes?

Everyone is lovely. But I bond well with Ruksar. We both are Punjabi so that’s why we resonate well.

How has your journey been thus far ?

It has been a wonderful journey and I have evolved a lot. When I signed my first show, Maharanapratap, I wasn’t mature enough. Back then, I believed in exploring new opportunities and taking up whatever project I was offered. I had done a couple of historical shows after that because audience appreciated and loved me playing a princess. I too enjoyed playing such roles. Then I moved to daily soaps and it was a big shift. When I was approached for Internet Wala Love, I immediately said ‘yes’ to it. I felt that it would give me a break from the genre that I was doing for so long. Also, I didn’t want to get typecaste.

You have done TV and films. What is the difference?

In TV, we shoot daily for long hours. We get the scene a day before the shoot or even get scenes on the spot. But in movies you get everything in advance film. It gives you ample amount of time to work on your character. But in TV there is no experimenting. You just have to go with whatever is happening.

Where do you find yourself most comfortable working in?

I do not have any preference. I would like to work in different mediums. If you see my journey, I have worked in TV and films simultaneously. I have had an amazing experience. However, I would now love to do theatre.

Has your journey to the top been easy?

Since I have always had my mother with me, the journey was not that challenging. I am an introvert. But I have learnt a lot as an actor. I have learnt the art of talking to people which means I am no longer an introvert.

What is your success mantra?

No mantra as such. My mother has been my biggest support. When she is with me I don’t have to worry about anything.

Any actor that you would like to work with?

I adore Ranveer Singh and would love to work with him.

A genre that you would like to explore?

There is no particular genre. I have always been passionate about movies so I would like to take up any project which would come my way.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-was-apprehensive-to-play-zara----2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-was-apprehensive-to-play-zara---.html
169,09-2-20,TellyTale,"Rahil dons a rugged look

Star Plus is all set to launch their new show titled Dil Jaise Dhadke Dhadakne Do. As interesting as the title, the show is created by the veteran filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and produced and directed by Guroudev Bhalla. The show revolves around two children whose souls have been damned by destiny and in spite of their bond being unadulterated, their love does not find salvation.

Rahil Azam will be seen playing the role of Dev-guru with an affable and endearing personality. Rahil has always been a trendsetter in the TV industry, from starting a trend of having big physique to becoming the first actor to don the look of a woman, to portraying an underplayed character in the tv industry, he has always outnumbered the expectations of his fans.

And now, the actor is going the extra mile to ace his character’s persona and the overall look. In order to make his character relatable to a younger audience, Rahil has been investing time at the gym every day and has lost about 13 kg to get a rugged look. Sharing his experience, Rahil Azam said,“I am very fond of huge physique and rugged look since my childhood. And I had to present my character of Devguru, who is a young doctor. I had only two months in hand for my transformation into the character. Moreover, I had stopped weight training and was onto Yoga. One day, luckily, I encountered Mohit Arora (renowned fitness entrepreneur) and with his guidance, I achieved my target. I hope the audience enjoy watching me in this new avatar.”

‘Anil will soon look younger’

Star Plus’ biggest dance-based reality show, Dance+5 has swayed the hearts of audiences with phenomenal performances showcased by the super talented contestants. With the race to the finale, the competition has got tougher and the dance champions are leaving no stone unturned to impress the judges with their mindboggling acts. This week, the viewers will be in for a treat as evergreen and legendary actor, Jeetendra, will be honouring the stage to encourage the contestants and judge them.

Amidst all the fabulous performances, Veteran actor Jeetendra took the opportunity to express his immense love and affection for his dear friend Anil Kapoor along with the young actors Kunal Khemu, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Disha Patani. Interestingly, the proficient actor Jeetendra and the handsome actor Anil Kapoor were last seen together 31 years ago, sharing a great camaraderie in their popular film Aag Se Khelenge.

Talking about Anil Kapoor, Jeetendra couldn’t resist and shared that “Anil is really timeless! He will soon look younger than his son Harshvardhan. It's just a matter of a few days. People know how talented, hardworking and popular an actor Anil Kapoor is, but I think he is a wonderful human being.” Anil Kapoor shared Jeetu ji has always been an inspiration for him in his life, shared a source present on the sets of the show.

Contestant Monark’s performance to Chori Pat Jaye compelled the judges to join him on-stage and applaud his act. Moreover, Monark invited them on stage to shake a leg together! In a heartbeat, the generous gentlemen took to the stage and grooved to the evergreen song Taki Taki.

Dharmendra unveils trophy

Sony TV’s Indian Idol 11 is coming to its end and since its first episode the audience is seen going gala over the contestants. This season the judging panel consisted of Neha Kakkar, Himesh Reshammiya and Vishal Dadlani. The top six this season are Sunny Hindustani, Rohit Raut, Ankona Mukherjee, Adriz Ghosh, Ridham Kalyan, Shahzan Mujeeb who will be fighting to become the next Indian idol.

Dharmender unwrapped the trophy of the season in the upcoming episode. The contestants were excited to see a glimpse of the trophy of Indian idol season 11.

With the finale of this season around the corner, viewers are eagerly waiting who will pick up the trophy.

Reema’s priority is script

Sony Entertainment Television’s popular show Ek Duje ke Vaaste, which has been a rage among the audience, is all set to return with its second season soon on popular demand. Produced by StudioNEXT, the show will see two budding actors — Mohit Kumar and Kanikka Kapur — playing the lead roles of Shravan and Suman respectively. Set against an army backdrop, Ek Duje ke Vaaste 2 is a stunning love story with a present-day touch. The story also highlights how ego, and the absence of an apology during a misunderstanding, can spell the death knell for a relationship.

Talented actress Reema Worah who has been a pivotal part of many shows in the past would be seen in the role of Suman’s mother in the show. The 31 year old actress would be seen in the role pf a teenager’s mother in the show and while many actresses of bher age refrain to take up such shows, she happily accepted this role as it came to her. She is one pf the few actors for whom the script holds key importance and not the age of the character.

Speaking about her new project and her role, Reema Worah said: “’I would be seen playing the role of Anjali Tiwari who is Suman’s mother. Ek Duje ke Vaaste 2 is a show based on army backdrop and I am playing the wife of Colonel Vijay Tiwari who belongs to a family which has a long background in army. Anjali is an ideal mother, ideal wife and an ideal daughter in law who understands her responsibilities and fluently carries them too. She binds the family together when her husband is away from home on his duty. When I read the script of the show, I found it quiet interesting and engaging and for me it is the script and the character that matters and not the age of my character. One can always play same-aged characters as we relate to them but it is always challenging to essay a character bigger than your age.”

Talking about the shoot, she said: “The show is based in Bhopal and is being shot in real locations of Bhopal with majority of it being shot in the cantonment areas. I find myself very lucky to have got a chance to interact with real army families during our show.”",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tellytale-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/tellytale-tellytale.html
170,09-2-20,"Sleep duration linked to mental illness, brain structure changes in children: Study","Depression, anxiety, impulsive behaviour, and poor cognitive performance in children are linked to the quality and quantity of sleep they get, according to a study which also suggests that insufficient sleep is associated with brain structure changes in kids.

The researchers, including those from the University of Warwick in the UK, said good sleep supports reorganisation of nerve connections in the brain, making it particularly important for children, whose brains are developing rapidly.

In the study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, the scientists examined the brain structures of 11,000 children of 9-11 ages, and compared them with data on their daily sleep duration.

The researchers found that measures of depression, anxiety, impulsive behaviour, and poor cognitive performance in the children were associated with shorter sleep duration.

According to the study, the depressive problems were associated with short sleep duration one year later.

The scientists said lower volume of brain areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex -- present in the front portion of the brain and involved in decision making -- and the temporal cortex -- important for hearing -- are associated with shorter sleep duration.

Size reduction of other brain regions like the precuneus, which is essential for episodic memory recollection, and the supramarginal gyrus, involved in the perception of space and limbs location, are also linked to poor sleep, the study noted.

""The recommended amount of sleep for children 6 to 12 years of age is 9-12 hours. However, sleep disturbances are common among children and adolescents around the world due to the increasing demand on their time from school, increased screen time use, and sports and social activities,"" said study co-author Jianfeng Feng from the University of Warwick.

According to the study, the brain structure changes are associated with sleep problems, whether or not children experience depressive problems.

""Our findings showed that the behaviour problems total score for children with less than 7 hours sleep was 53 per cent higher on average, and the cognitive total score was 7.8 per cent lower on average than for children with 9-11 hours of sleep,"" Feng said.

""It highlights the importance of enough sleep in both cognition and mental health in children,"" he added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sleep-duration-linked-to-mental-illness--brain-structure-changes-in-children--study-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/sleep-duration-linked-to-mental-illness--brain-structure-changes-in-children--study.html

172,09-2-20,Coronavirus death toll in China climbs to 811,"The death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak rose to 811 on Sunday, surpassing the number of fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, while over 37,000 people have been confirmed as being infected with the deadly virus that has spread to more than 25 countries.

Eighty-nine deaths were reported on Saturday - the highest single-day death toll - and there were 2,656 new confirmed cases of the deadly infection, China's National Health Commission said in its daily report on Sunday.

A total of 811 people have died of the disease so far and 37,198 confirmed cases have been reported in 31 provincial-level regions in China, according to the commission.

The death toll surpassed the number of fatalities in the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere.

Among the 89 deaths, 81 were from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, two in Henan, and one each in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, it said.

On Saturday, 600 people, including 324 in Hubei province, recovered and walked out of the hospitals, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

As per the data released by the commission, confirmed cases in Hubei, the ground zero of the epidemic, showed a drop perhaps for the first time since the virulent virus first emerged in the province in December.

On Saturday, Hubei reported 2,147 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, the commission said.

The figure is 694 less compared with the new confirmed cases reported in the previous day, it said.

Hubei's capital Wuhan reported 1,379 new infections and 63 new deaths, and the cities of Xiaogan and Huanggang reported 123 and 100 new confirmed cases, respectively, according to the provincial health commission.

Hubei alone reported 27,100 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, with 780 deaths and 5,247 cases in severe or critical condition.

Also, 1,439 patients have been discharged after recovery from the hospital, it said.

Across China, 6,188 patients remained in severe condition and 28,942 people were suspected of being infected with the virus, it said.

A total of 2,649 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery.

By the end of Saturday, 26 confirmed cases and one death had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 17 in Taiwan.

One patient in Macao and one in Taiwan were discharged from hospital after recovery, it said.

On Saturday, an American woman and a Japanese man became the first foreigners to have died from the new coronavirus in China.

The 60-year old American citizen died in Wuhan, the US embassy here said, the first confirmed foreign death from the outbreak in China.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry last week said that 19 foreign nationals in China have been confirmed to have contracted the virus and undergoing treatment in hospitals.

Two of them were discharged after recovery, the ministry said, without disclosing details. Earlier reports said that four Pakistanis and two Australians contracted the virus.

A Japanese man hospitalised in Wuhan with pneumonia has also died, Japan's foreign ministry announced in Tokyo.

Meanwhile, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday that the UN health agency will send an international mission to China as it received a response from Beijing.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team leader will leave early next week with the rest of the experts to follow.

The UN health agency said the number of cases of the coronavirus in China is ""stabilising"", which is a ""good news"".

It, however, cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked.

""There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei,"" Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme said at a briefing in Geneva.

""We're in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn't advanced. That's good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place,"" Ryan was quoted as saying.

But he added that it was ""very early to make any predictions"".

173,09-2-20,"Omar's PSA dossier cites his 'considerable influence' over people, Mehbooba's pro-separatist stand","Former chief minister Omar Abdullah's ""considerable influence"" over people, including the ability to attract voters to polling booths despite poll boycott calls and the potential for channelling energies of public for any cause, has been cited in support of his detention under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).

His political opponent and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti has been accused of making anti-national statements and extending support to organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islamia of the state, which has been banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).

The PSA dossier prepared by the police against the 49-year-old Omar, who had served as minister of state for external affairs as well as commerce and industries, states his ability to convince electorates to vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycott calls by separatists and militants.

The grounds of detention against Omar, who was chief minister of the state from 2009-14, state that on the eve of reorganisation of the state he had made attempts to provoke general masses against the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A.

The grounds also mention his comments on social networking sites to instigate common people against the decisions on Articles 370 and 35-A which had the potential of disturbing public order.

However, the police have neither mentioned any of Omar's social media posts in the dossier nor in the order for grounds of his detention.

""To the people of Kashmir, we don't know what is in store for us.......Stay safe and above all please stay calm,"" was the last few tweets of Omar before he was taken to Hari Nivas for preventive detention.

Restrictions have been put on communication links since August 5 last year. These were subsequently eased. Internet is functional at a few places through leased lines. Mobile internet facility has been made functional but with a speed of 2G with special instructions that it would not be used to access social media sites.

Omar and the 60-year-old Mehbooba Mufti had been under preventive detention since August 5 last year, when the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution granting a special status and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two union territories -- Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir.

They were booked under the PSA on the night of February 6, barely a few hours before their preventive detention was to end.

According to rules, preventive detention can be extended beyond six months only if an advisory board, constituted two weeks before the completion of the 180-day period, recommends for that.

Mehbooba has been slapped with the PSA for her remarks which included challenging accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India in case the Article 370 was abrogated.

The statements of the former chief minister, whose party PDP was an ally of the BJP till June 2018, on security forces killing militants was also made a part of the PSA dossier against her.

Her support to the Jamaat-e-Islamia group of Jammu and Kashmir after it was declared as a banned organisation by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) also figures in the dossier.

Omar's father, Farooq Abdullah, who is a five-time chief minister and currently a member of Lok Sabha, was booked in September last year under the PSA, a law which was enacted by his father Sheikh Abdullah in 1978 to fight timber smugglers in the state as they would easily get away with minimal detention those days.

Sheikh Abdullah brought the Act as a deterrent against timber smugglers as it provided a jail term, without a trial, for up to two years.

However, this Act came in handy for the police and security forces during the early 1990s when militancy erupted in the state.

174,09-2-20,"Exit polls will 'fail', we will form next govt in Delhi, say BJP leaders","BJP leaders on Sunday maintained that the exit poll results that have predicted its defeat in Delhi polls will ""fail"" as the surveys did not take into account the votes polled in the evening.

The exit poll results of news channels aired immediately after voting time ended at 6 pm on Saturday showed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sweeping the election.

A top BJP leader said the exit poll results ""did not give a correct representative picture"" of the voting.

""The voting continued two hours beyond the stipulated time of 6 pm while the exit poll results started coming just after that. So, how can it be representative?"" he asked.

Also, the BJP leader said, the voting was ""sluggish"" in initial hours and picked up in the late afternoon when BJP workers actively urged voters to reach polling stations.

BJP's candidate from New Delhi Assembly constituency Sunil Yadav has claimed that AAP contender on the seat and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is going to ""lose"" the polls.

""I guarantee my victory and Kejriwal's defeat. If result proved otherwise, I will not contest any elections again in my life,"" Yadav said.

Voting for the 70-member Delhi Assembly was held on Saturday. Counting of votes and result declaration will take place on Tuesday.

The BJP leaders have rubbished the exit poll results with party's Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari saying it will ""fail"" and his party will win 48 seats in the election.

According to a senior official in the office of the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer said 62.59 per cent votes were polled in the Assembly election.

In a late night meeting at the BJP's Delhi unit office on Saturday, top leaders including Union minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda and others analysed the emerging situation and received feedback from various quarters, the party sources said.

""The party is confident that even in the worst scenario, it is going to win at least 25-32 seats in Delhi,"" the sources claimed.

Shah has asserted that the BJP will win more than 45 seats and form government in Delhi.

In campaigning for the elections, Shah had said the February 11 results will ""shock"" everyone.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/exit-polls-will--fail---we-will-form-next-govt-in-delhi--say-bjp-leaders-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/exit-polls-will--fail---we-will-form-next-govt-in-delhi--say-bjp-leaders.html

176,09-2-20,"Hat-trick for Kejriwal, rout for BJP","Exit polls give AAP resounding victory, zero to Cong; turnout at 61%

As the voting for much-talked about and keenly contested Delhi Assembly elections officially ended at 7.30 pm on Saturday, the exit polls by all the TV channels predicted a clean sweep for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP appears set for an impressive win against the BJP which put out all its resources to checkmate the former. However, the exit polls predict a repeat of 2015 when a nascent AAP had decimated the BJP by winning 67 seats, leaving just three for the BJP. The Congress, which had scored “zero” then losing power after 15 long years uninterrupted, appears to have repeated its pathetic performance this Delhi Assembly elections also according to the exit polls.

The high voltage elections for the 70 Assembly seats that kick-started at 8 am on Saturday with a polling percentage of just 4.33 at 9 am. According to the Election Commission of India’s (ECI) voter turnout app, the total turnout in Delhi was recorded at 61 per cent till 10.20pm, a decline over the 2015 polls when a 67.12 per cent of the voters came out to vote.

Meanwhile, as per the official data, the highest voter turnout was recorded in North East Delhi’s Mustafabad with a polling percentage of 66.29 per cent till 5 pm. Matia Mahal — in the Chandini Chowk Lok Sabha constituency — which witnessed numerous protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) bagged the second position with 65.62 per cent turnout. Another minority seat Seelampur was third with 64.92 per cent polling. The seat had also seen anti-CAA protests in December.

District wise, North-east recorded highest 50.75 per cent of voting, while New Delhi recorded 40.63 per cent, the lowest among 11 districts in Delhi.

As the clock ticked by, viewers were glued to TV sets to see the outcome of exit polls with India Today-Axis My India exit poll leading the race. India Today-Axis My India, which had predicted accurately during 2019 general elections and even during the recently held Haryana Assembly polls, predicted a landslide victory for the AAP which is expected to win 59-68 seats. “The BJP will once again remain a distant second with only 2-11 seats. The Congress will not be able to win any seat,” the exit poll results showed.

The Times Now-Ipsos exit poll predicted Kejriwal will retain his chair with the AAP winning 44 seats against 26 for the BJP.

The Republic-Jan ki Baat survey gave the AAP 48-61 seats and the BJP 9-21 seats. The TV9 Bharatvarsh-Cicero predicted 54 seats for the AAP, 15 for the BJP and one for the Congress.

Neta-India News exit poll predicts AAP: 53-57 seats, BJP: 11-17 and Congress: 0-2 seats. ABP-CVoter exit poll stated that the AAP is likely to win 49-63 seats, BJP 5-19 seats, while the Congress 0-4 seats.

Most exit poll results are consistent that the Congress, which had won zero seat in the last Assembly elections, will fare poorly this time also.

As most of the exit polls have shown a clean sweep for the AAP, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Saturday said that all the exit poll results will prove false. He exuded confidence that the BJP would win not lesser than 48 seats.

Polling has largely been peaceful in Delhi, which witnessed a communally charged campaigning amid anti-CAA protests, barring an incident involving Congress candidate Alka Lamba and an AAP worker in Chandni Chowk.

Kejriwal has said he is hopeful that the AAP would form Government for the third time. The people of Delhi will vote based on the works done by the AAP Government, Kejriwal said after voting along with his wife Sunita and son Pulkit at a polling booth in Civil Lines area.

The voting in Delhi started at 8 am with fewer votes but gained momentum after 3 pm. A voter turnout of 4.33 percentage was recorded at 9 pm, while it improved after 3 pm with over 41 percentage as the Delhiites queued up to cast their votes for the Assembly election on Saturday.

The polling was smooth and police maintained a strict vigil in sensitive areas, said the officials.

The polling which was scheduled to close at 6 pm extended as the people poured in long queues in last minute. In the national Capital, there are total number of 1.47 crore eligible voters to exercise their franchise in the polls that will decide the fate of 672 candidates in 70 Assembly constituencies which are seeing a triangular contest among the ruling AAP, Opposition BJP and the Congress.

When asked the poll officials about the low turnout in the first three hours, the officials said, the voting usually picks up as the day progresses. The city recorded 14.75 per cent voter turnout in the first three hours of polling.

Further, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said, “Today the poll for election to the Delhi Legislative Assembly 2020 passed off peacefully and smoothly. I particularly compliment persons with disabilities and the senior citizens who have come forward and cast their votes.” Among the 66 observers posted to keep a constant vigil and updating the Commission about the elections, three were special observers.

Further, facilities and special initiatives such as for the first time, poll body provided the facility of postal ballot for employees working in Government departments providing Essential Services and who were not able to cast their vote on poll day due to official duty on the poll day.

Also, for the first time, option of the postal ballot facility was provided to the PwD voters and 80 plus senior citizens to cast their vote at home. In total 2,429 and 488 Form 12 D was accepted from senior citizens and PwD respectively and out of that 2,257 and 429 senior citizens and PwD casted their vote through postal ballot.

177,09-2-20,Relay vote in Shaheen Bagh,"Protesters take turns to exercise franchise and keep protest on

For the indefatigable women and dadis of Shaheen Bagh, who have been on an indefinite sit-in since December 15, 2019 to protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Saturday was the day to press the buttons to vote for Delhi Assembly elections. Facing lots of criticism for blocking Road number 13 connecting Kalindi Kunj to Mathura Road and Noida, the women ensured that their agitation continued unabated while they exercised their franchise.

While women were away for voting, their places were taken by the men who had already voted to fill the gap. It continued throughout the day as women kept leaving the protest site to go to their respective polling booths to vote. It was a tactical move to ensure that everyone voted and the agitation was unaffected, they said. Shaheen Bagh saw a high turnout as the people could be standing in the queue to wait for their turn.

While some of the women voted in the morning, others chose to get their fingers inked in the afternoon and the remaining in the evening.

Mehzabeen Qureshi, a resident of Shaheen Bagh, who has been part of the protest ever since it started, had left the site to vote and then came back to continue with the part of the agitation. “I stayed at home to let other women in the house go out and vote. Now I have joined them here at Shaheen Bagh after voting. I voted today to secure democracy.”

Zaheeda Khan, another resident of Shaheen Bagh, said, “The women here had decided a day before voting that some of them would go out for voting in the morning, while others will stay back for chores. The others will go in the afternoon and then come back to the protest site.

“By the evening, we will be a full house again, all geared up to continue our protest,” she said. Zahra Sheikh said they are determined to exercise their right to vote as it is crucial for a democracy. “We started our day knowing that it will be of double importance for us. We want to ensure that democracy survives hence, every citizen of Shaheen Bagh is voting,” she said.

In the meantime, the men folk from Shaheen Bagh filled in at the protest site when the women protesters were away completing domestic chores.

Taking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s “biryani” remark, Mohammad Ayub, a resident, said they were voting to prove a point that they were not being served any “biryani”.

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister was served a notice by the Election Commission of India for his remark “Kejriwal is feeding biryani in Shaheen Bagh” comments. The Shaheen Bagh protest site had become a focal point in the BJP’s poll campaign.

“Many people have alleged that we were protesting for Delhi elections and that some political parties were funding us and serving ‘biryani’. They should know that we are still protesting as Delhi votes and will continue the agitation after the polling,” Ayub said. “No party serves us ‘biryani’. The women cook and bring food to feed the protesters,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/relay-vote-in-shaheen-bagh-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/relay-vote-in-shaheen-bagh.html
178,09-2-20,"India, Chile start talks for further expansion of trade agreement","India and South American nation Chile have started negotiations for further expansion of a trade agreement with a view to boost two-way commerce and economic ties, an official said.

Both the countries signed a preferential trade agreement (PTA) on March 8, 2006 and it came into force from August 2007.

In 2016, India and Chile expanded the scope of the agreement by including more products.

The two countries have again initiated talks for second expansion of the trade agreement, the official said.

The first round of negotiations with Chile on the second expansion of India-Chile PTA was recently concluded.

""Both sides have decided to hold the next round of the talks in Santiago in Chile during March or in the first half of April,"" the official added.

In a PTA, two trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate import duties on certain goods traded between them.

The official said India's export basket with Chile is diversified and keeping in view the wide variety of tariff lines (or products) offered by Chile, the expanded PTA would benefit both the countries.

Among the latin american countries, Chile is one of the largest trading partners of India.

India's bilateral trade with Chile has marginally declined to USD 2.22 billion in 2018-19 from USD 2.85 billion in 2017-18.

India's exports to Chile include transport equipment, pharmaceuticals, yarn of polyester fibres, tyres and tubes, manufacture of metals, articles of apparel, organic/inorganic and agro chemicals, textiles, readymade garments, plastic goods, leather products, engineering goods, imitation jewellery, sports goods and handicraft.

182,09-2-20,"OnePlus 8 series design, 120Hz display confirmed in new leak","With the forthcoming OnePlus 8 series launch around the corner, a new leak of the devices has surfaced that confirms the design language of the handsets and a 120Hz refresh rate display.

A fresh new leak claims to have a render of the upcoming OnePlus 8 Pro, alongside a few specs points. Some of these pretty obvious and easy to deduce, while others are rather interesting, GSMArena reported on Saturday.

Putting together all the rumours and speculations, the likely specs sheet could include an obvious Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip and Android 10 bits.

""The memory options are neither here nor there, honestly. 128GB or 256GB with 8GB of RAM is a perfectly valid guess. Perhaps 12GB is a possibility as well. OnePlus could even jump on the increasingly popular train of showing-off with a 16GB tier,"" the report added.

Meanwhile, the Chinese smartphone maker has filed a patent for a technology that hides the front camera when not in use, a report said earlier this week.

The patent seems to be similar to the implementation of the recently unveiled 'Concept One' smartphone by OnePlus that was showcased by the company at CES 2020 last month.

183,09-2-20,Southee behaved like a true leader in 2nd ODI: Bennett,"New Zealand pacer Hamish Bennett says Tim Southee showed exemplary leadership qualities when he played through pain and discomfort during the second ODI against India.

New Zealand were almost rendered a bowler short as Southee was hit by a stomach bug and bowled through the pain to get his side across the line.

He picked 2-41 as the Kiwis won the second ODI by 22 runs on Saturday, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series.

""For him to do that, it just shows how much wearing the silver fern on his chest means to him. He's a good leader in our side and his actions have a lot to do with that and last night we saw that. He led by example, to show that no matter what the situation is, you've just got to go out there and get the job done,"" said Bennett.

""As New Zealanders, that's what we pride ourselves on, getting the job done, whether we're fit or not fit. It was a pretty brave effort.""

Bennett said they were confident to defend the 270-run total despite Eden Park being a small ground.

""Eden Park is a funny ground, it is small boundary wise and scores here haven't been too high, as people would like to believe. It is not an easy ground to bat in the ODIs. We knew if we get early wickets we could put pressure on their batting order. ""They have a couple key players, and once we got them early, you can put pressure on any batting group doing that. Last night we were fortunate that our plans came off,"" said Bennett.

It was a debut to remember for pacer Kyle Jamieson. Playing on his home ground, he put up a valuable partnership with Ross Taylor to propel the score. Then, he took two wickets to rock the Indian line-up and steered his side to victory.

Bennett said India got too close at the end for comfort, but they managed to sneak through with the win.

""Kyle and I have played together in Auckland. We have trained together and I remember when we were at Lincoln University nets. He bowled to Tom Latham and almost hit him on the throat. He is tall, gets that bounce and was quick as well. I have always felt there will be a time for Kyle.

""Being big means he would have some problems physically, but he has got over them, and now has a bright future ahead of him, no doubt,"" said Bennett.

India are now staring down the barrel at a series' whitewash. New Zealand have the chance to make it 3-0 in reply to the 5-0 loss they had suffered in the preceding T20I series.

""Our young bowling unit has done pretty well. Energy is high in the group and we want to secure as much as we can and enjoy this challenge. We have done it well in the last two matches, although we weren't far off in the T20s either just needed a bit of luck. Fortunately through the ODI series, luck has been on our side.

""It has been a great challenge against India. They are a world-class side and have played some great cricket on this tour. I have loved every over I have bowled in this series. I have enjoyed playing out there for my country. Humbled to do that even if it is a cliche,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/southee-behaved-like-a-true-leader-in-2nd-odi--bennett-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/southee-behaved-like-a-true-leader-in-2nd-odi--bennett.html
184,09-2-20,Thai gunman among 27 dead in 'unprecedented' mass shooting,"A Thai soldier who killed at least 26 people before being shot dead in a mall by commandos went on the rampage because of a debt dispute, the kingdom's premier said on Sunday, offering the first official speculation for the motive of an ""unprecedented"" shooting spree.

After a night which seesawed between heavy exchanges of gunfire and terrifying dashes for mall exits by trapped shoppers, sharp-shooters brought an end to the 17-hour-ordeal when they killed the gunman on Sunday morning in Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat.

Twenty-six people including civilians -- the youngest a 13-year-old boy -- and security forces were killed by the rogue soldier, Thailand's prime minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha said.

""It is unprecedented in Thailand, and I want this to be the last time this crisis happens,"" he said outside a hospital where victims, including at least two undergoing brain surgery, were being treated.

Prayut, a gruff former army chief, blamed a ""personal problem"" over the sale of the house for the soldier's rampage, which began on Saturday afternoon near an army barracks and was for several hours relayed by the gunman via Facebook posts.

The attacker, a junior army officer identified as Sergeant-Major Jakrapanth Thomma, used a stolen M60 machine gun, rifles and ammunition from one of Thailand's largest barracks as well as a military humvee to carry out the attack.

Prayut said he overpowered security at the barracks' arsenal.

""This was not carelessness. We don't leave the arsenal depot alone -- we had people guarding it."" Most of the dead were killed in an around the mall.

Volleys of gunfire rang out as the siege ran into dawn, hours after Thai security services stormed the ground floor and freed scores of stunned, terrified shoppers from a bloody rampage.

Frightened shoppers sent cascades of messages to friends and family on social media from cupboards, toilets and under tables as the gunman stalked the mall.

Shocked evacuees recounted how an ordinary Saturday at the busy shopping centre descended into horror as the gunman entered, sparking an hours long ordeal.

""It was like a dream... I'm grateful I survived,"" Sottiyanee Unchalee, 48, told AFP, explaining she hid in the toilet of a gym inside the mall as she heard the gunfire.

A Filipina teacher Aldrin Baliquing said he was ushered into a storeroom by staff as the shooting began.

""We were there for six gruelling hours... I'm in shock,"" she said.

Scores of people made a dash for it as police and soldiers in masks and wielding assault rifles took control of the ground floor following a gun battle and scoured the fleeing crowds for the assailant.

Hours later he was shot dead. Photos showed smiling elite units of soldiers and police emerging from the mall.

Purported video from the scene -- shared on social media -- showed snipers in webbing on elevated walkways, aiming their rifles downwards as heavy gunfire echoed across a concourse below.

The gunman relayed his shooting spree through Facebook posts which charted the attack from an army barracks to the city mall.

Despite the prime minister's speculation Jakrapanth's exact motive remained unclear as Korat -- a sedate and mid-size town -- tried to digest the scale of the atrocity.

The bloodshed began Saturday afternoon when he shot three people -- among them at least one soldier -- at a senior officer's house and then at the nearby army barracks, before driving a military vehicle to the town centre.

There the gunman used the stolen weapons to unleash carnage in the town centre.

Throughout the day, he posted images of himself and wrote several posts on his Facebook page as the attack unfolded.

In one Facebook video -- since deleted -- the assailant, wearing an army helmet, filmed from an open-top jeep, saying, ""I'm tired... I can't pull my finger anymore"" as he made a trigger symbol with his hand.

There were also photos of a man in a ski mask holding up a pistol.

A Facebook spokesperson said: ""We have removed the gunman's accounts from our services and will work around the clock to remove any violating content related to this attack as soon as we become aware of it.""

The city is home to one of the largest barracks in Thailand, a country where the military is enmeshed in politics and society.

The nation also has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, and several shootings at courthouses last year renewed concern about gun violence.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/thai-mall-gunman-shot-dead-after-deadly-rampage-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/thai-gunman-among-27-dead-in--unprecedented--mass-shooting.html
185,09-2-20,Two US troops killed by Afghan soldier in Nangarhar attack,"Two American troops were killed and six others wounded when an Afghan soldier armed with a machine gun opened fire, the US military confirmed Sunday.

The deaths come at a sensitive time in the 18-year-old war, with President Donald Trump eager to bring troops home and end the longest conflict in US history.

The incident occurred late Saturday in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan when US and Afghan commandos were conducting a ""key-leader engagement"" at a base in Sherzad district.

""Current reports indicate an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on the combined US and Afghan force with a machine gun,"" US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Sonny Leggett said in a statement on Sunday.

Provincial governor Shah Mahmood Meyakhil said in an audio message to reporters that three Afghan commandos were wounded.

He said it was not immediately clear if the incident was a deliberate act by an ""infiltrator"" or an accident.

""It was not a clash between the forces. We are investigating,"" Meyakhil said. Leggett also stressed the cause or motive behind the attack were not immediately known.

In a tweet, the US Army's 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) said ""several"" of its soldiers had been killed or injured during combat operations in Afghanistan.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incident.

Last year was the deadliest for US forces in Afghanistan since combat operations officially finished at the end of 2014, highlighting the challenging security situation that persists.

Depending on how one qualifies combat deaths, about 20 American troops were killed in 2019. Since the US-led invasion in October 2001, about 2,400 US troops have been killed in combat in Afghanistan.

In December, Taliban infiltrators in the Afghan military killed nine Afghan soldiers in central Afghanistan.

In July, an Afghan soldier killed two US troops as they were visiting an Afghan army base in Kandahar. Such insider attacks are sometimes called ""green-on-blue"" incidents.

That came two weeks after another Afghan soldier shot and killed an influential Afghan army colonel while he was conducting a security assessment in Ghazni province.

US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been negotiating with the Taliban for about 18 months for a deal that would see the Pentagon pull thousands of troops from Afghanistan.

186,09-2-20,Woman priest takes Periyar’s self-respect wedding a step ahead,"Tamil Nadu played host to a silent social revolution on Friday which scholars rate as more revolutionary in nature than the self-respect marriages of the 1950s.

If the self-respect marriages, launched by EV Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) hailing from the Mysore Province, were a message against the monopoly of the Brahmins in religious matters, Friday saw another person from Mysore performing a traditional marriage which shattered the barriers to yet another male-dominated domain.

When Vignesh Raghavan, a Chennai youth tied the nuptial knots with Sushma Harini on Friday at Dakshin Chitra, a heritage museum in Chennai suburb, the priest who solemnised the marriage was a woman and it took everyone by surprise.

Till now no one had discussed about the possibility of women priests solemnising marriages in spite of the fact that women pilots guard the skies of the country against possible intrusion from outside. The Pioneer had reported last year about all-women crew of Indian Coast Guard flying along the East Coast and Palk Straits as part of recce missions.

As Vignesh and Sushma, a young lawyer, exchanged rings and garlands, Bramaramba Maheswari, vedic scholar from Mysore officiated as the priest and solemnised the marriage. The marriage venue reverberated with Vedic shloks and mantras recited by Maheswari. What made the event more striking was the pains taken by the priest to explain the meaning of each shlok and mantra to the couple as she moved on with the ceremony.

“One should learn the mantras and shloks by understanding their meaning. Then only it would be effective when you chant it,” Maheswari told The Pioneer after the marriage ceremony. She said there were 16 samskaraas (spiritual culture) associated with human lives from birth to death.

Friday’s marriage involved three steps, viz, Pani Grahanam (holding of hands), Kanya Pradaanam (transferring the responsibility of the safety, security and welfare of the bride to the groom) and Shilaarohanam (ascending of life to the heights of marriage and togetherness from which there is no coming back),” said Maheswari while explaining the meaning of the shloks she recited. When Suresh Reddy, the bride’s father performed the kanya daanam, Maheswari remined the groom with a shlok that what was being done is Kanya Pradaanam and not just kanya daanam.

For Sushma, it was a dream come true because of her commitment to inclusivity and equal representation. “We wanted to have a traditional south Indian marriage with all the traditions and customs but with a difference. I have read that women purohits perform marriages in North India and hence decided to have a woman priest for my marriage too. Since there were no women priests in Chennai our search took us to Dr Maheswari who is well known. She made our marriage meaningful and exciting. All guests told me that they were understanding the meaning of the shloks and rituals for the first time,” said Sushma.

Pandhappalli Gopala Menon, south India’s leading tantrik and vedic scholar said there was nothing which prevented women from becoming priests and solemnising marriages or any function. “The only condition for a woman to solemnise marriages is that she should be a mother,” said Menon. Maheswari is the mother of two daughters, both software engineers. So, yet another male bastion has been broken.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/woman-priest-takes-periyar---s-self-respect-wedding-a-step-ahead-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/woman-priest-takes-periyar---s-self-respect-wedding-a-step-ahead.html

Kartik, who has been part of several hit romantic-comedies, is all excited about doing some high octane action in the forthcoming movie, to be produced by Bhushan Kumar's T-series.

""I've been keen to do an out and out action film for a while, and Bhushan sir knew about it. I recently watched 'Tanhaji..' and was completely blown away by not only the spectacular visuals but also the narrative.

188,09-2-20,I don't want to make predictable choices: Alaya,"""Jawaani Jaaneman"" debutante Alaya F is in a happy space right now and says going ahead in her career she wants to make versatile choices.

The Nitin Kakkar-directed film, also featuring Saif Ali Khan, opened to positive reviews on January 31 and Alaya said she is glad with the response.

""I don't want to contain myself at all. I want to pursue all my options, see what feels the best... But I'm just excited to see what comes my way.

""I'm glad that people are liking and appreciating my work, taking note of me. I want to surprise people with what I do and not make predicable choices. I hope within my first five films, I'm able to do five vastly different characters,"" Alaya told PTI.

""Jawani Jaaneman"" chronicles the story of a 40-year-old man whose life turns upside down when he discovers he has a 20-something daughter.

Alaya, 22, wasn't jittery on the day of the film's release—as she knew the general feedback from the screenings held before—but recalls that she was ""quite scared"" on the first day of the shoot.

""I remember walking on the set, projecting that I'm very confident as I didn't want people to think I was scared. That was the day when I go back to Saif's place and tell him that there are chances he could be my father.

""It was a six-minute shot. It was a challenging first day but luckily it went well. After that the whole team was assured about me,"" she added.

Granddaughter of actor Kabir Bedi and daughter of Pooja Bedi, Alaya said she observed the ups and downs of the industry through both of them and learnt that one should be prepared for everything.

""For me, seeing how volatile the industry can be, what I just focused on is being very good at what I do. If you're good at your craft, no matter the ups and downs things will come back to you.

""That's what I mainly took from it. To be prepared for everything. I'm prepared for it a lot more,"" she said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-don-t-want-to-make-predictable-choices--alaya-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/i-don-t-want-to-make-predictable-choices--alaya.html

190,09-2-20,"Realme 5i: Great battery, good budget smartphone","Chinese handset maker Realme, which is growing exponentially in the Indian smartphone market, recently launched the '5i' smartphone with quad-camera rear setup that gives some tough competition to rival brands in the sub-Rs 10,000 price segment.

The Realme 5i comes in a single 4GB RAM/64GB configuration variant for Rs 8,999 in Aqua Blue and Forest Green colours.

Packed with a 5,000mAh battery, the smartphone houses Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 AIE octa-core chipset.

After trying the Forest Green variant, let's see how it fared.

The first obvious thing to notice is the design. The overall look and feel is good.

The device packs an AI quad-camera setup with 119-degree, ultra-wide-angle lens (8MP), main camera (12MP), portrait sensor (2MP) and ultra-macro lens (2MP), as well as an AI-driven selfie camera (8MP).

The quad-camera at the rear alongside the LED flash adds an extra charm to the device.

The images came out well -- both indoor and outdoor -- but lacked sharpness, which is the only disappointing part.

The smartphone comes with 4K video and 240 fps slow-motion shooting with electronic image stabilisation (EIS) that supports wide-angle and ultra-wide angle shots. We took some videos and the smartphone fared well.

On the lower-left corner at the back, the Realme logo is placed vertically in style. The fingerprint sensor also worked decently.

While the right edge of the smartphone has the power button, the left one has volume rocker keys and hosts a dual-SIM slot.

You can expand the storage by up to 256 GB by using the dedicated microSD card slot.

On the front, the device has an 8MP camera, with a 6.52-inch drop-notch display with HD+ resolution. The front panel is protected by Corning Gorilla glass shield.

On full brightness, the display worked well. However, in direct sunlight, it wasn't up to the mark.

One interesting feature is that the smartphone offers reverse charging, which essentially means that it can be used to charge other devices. The lower edge of the phone has dual speakers, micro-USB port and 3.5-mm standard audio jack.

Powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor, the smartphone runs Android 9.0 with ColorOS 6.1 operating system (OS).

The 5,000mAh battery helps the smartphone last for over a day. While using multiple applications, we didn't find any problem.

Basic daily tasks like switching between apps and using multiple social media applications were smooth. Playing games like PUBG Lite (lighter version) was also smooth.

Conclusion: With 5000mAh battery, quad-camera rear setup, reverse charging and new design, the new Realmi 5i looks promising and the overall experience was good in the affordable segment.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/realme-5i--great-battery--good-budget-smartphone-2020-02-09.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/realme-5i--great-battery--good-budget-smartphone.html
