No persons either from the local administration or from the banks have been deployed here to streamline the social distancing norms.

As the banks have no parking facilities, customers are constrained to park their vehicles on sides of the roads creating a chaotic situation.

When asked why people weren’t following the social distancing norms, a customer said everyone is in a hurry to get work done. ""People often forget the (social distancing) norm, but everyone is scared as well,"" he told.

Family members of the couple Amrit Patel of Nuadihi village and Sushma Patel of Jhargaon were also present during the marriage.

The families of couple had earlier scheduled the marriage on April 17 as the lockdown was supposed to be lifted on April 14. However, as the lockdown was extended till May 3, they couldn’t postpone the wedding. However, they decided to downsize the ceremony instead of making it big and lavish.

Amrit reached Sushma’s house for the wedding with only five of his family members. All of them had covered their faces with masks.

In a letter to the CM, the forum urged him to ask the School and Mass Education department to make necessary arrangements to reach out to the children and boost their self-confidence through interaction and providing textbooks and other materials to the children immediately.

All the teachers should be instructed to attend schools for at least two to three hours every morning during the lockdown period to facilitate providing textbooks and other materials and interact with the parents and children to guide on conducting different activities during the summer holidays.

It further suggested online programmes for skill development of teachers and teaching of children.

But the forum proposed that tribal and Dalit students should be engaged in community-based creative activities while keeping the social distancing norms as non-negotiable. Mentioning that private schools are charging a hefty fee for online coerces, the forum demanded that the Government nstruct private schools to reduce school fees for at least three months.

The Government should take all measures to see that dropout does not occur as many of children are expected to help their parents in earning livelihood post lockdown.

The forum said the Government should not implement its decision to close schools with 20 or less than 20 enrolments of children as many children from the underprivileged background would be out of school at this juncture.

7,19-4-20,‘Fortified’ training camps for Uyghurs,"As China fears the rising Islamic terror may turn Xinjiang into China’s Libya or Syria soon, it, therefore, feels it necessary to train them into becoming ‘good citizens’. For Beijing, these large camps are voluntary vocational training centres where people imbibe job skills. However, according to the Western media, these heavily fortified camps are persecution camps

Last year in October, two groups of nations debated the grave accusations of Uyghurs’ human rights violations in Xinjiang. This episode revealed a global divide on the abuse of basic rights of the ethnic community, particularly Muslims, in China’s western province. It also highlighted the long arm of influence of Bejing’s money, muscle power and diplomatic influence across the world.

Xi Jinping regime’s carefully constructed narratives around the so-called “vocational training centres” in Xinjiang came to light last year via a leaked report in the Western media. For Beijing, these large camps are voluntary vocational training centres where people imbibe job skills before returning to their native places. However, according to the media reports, these heavily fortified camps are designed to turn the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities into good citizens who can learn and speak Mandarin. China is running these re-education camps since 2017. And the fact is that these repressive camps for the Muslims are meant for cultural genocide and brainwashing. However, China strongly rejects the accusations and calls it as an internal affair of the state.

Xi is a dab hand at manipulating his power and authority to consolidate his position within and outside the party. He is fast changing the global power order as well. Thus he has been rightly described as the reincarnation of Chairman Mao. With the gradual decline of the global liberal order, China has broadened its soft power and strengthened its position around the world. Also, America’s anticipated drawdown from many troubled and hotspots is directly encouraging China to gain a foothold in the global power structure.

The authorities in Beijing apprehend that with a global Islamic terror spiral, Xinjiang might turn into China’s Libya or Syria soon. In fact, China’s fear about separatism and terrorism, particularly about Islamic jehad, is quite understandable. And it’s real, not imaginary, in that province. The state intelligence officials and secret army data reveal that the Uyghur separatist groups and Islamist militants are backed by foreign nations, including the US. As the popular Government propaganda goes, the only intention of the outsiders is to destabilise China, particularly Xinjiang. Once it happens, i.e. the Islamic fundamentalists gain a firm ground, this will plunge the province into a year-long civil war. And the Communist leadership in Beijing has long been haunted by this fear. Hence, it is adopting best of its strategies against the radical elements and has put the entire region under surveillance.

However, is it justified to restrict the basic minimum freedoms of the locals in Xinjiang? Should all the Uyghurs pay the price for some of its compatriots raising the banner of revolt against the mainland?

Human rights are fundamental liberties. And imposing curbs on such basic rights is a grave crime. But then the Communists occupying the power corridors of China since 1949 have scant regard for fundamental rights and freedoms of anyone, not even the dominant Han ethnic ones.

What China says about Xinjiang is entirely different from what appears in the Western media and elsewhere. Particularly, “Global Times”, the only daily tabloid published by the Chinese Communist Party, offers the world a purely nationalistic perspective on the Xinjiang issue. To this newspaper, the Western reporting on Xinjiang and Uyghur is full of double standards. These media outlets report only the results, but sincerely fail to report underlying reasons, background and processes that led to the actions of Beijing in Xinjiang. For the party mouthpiece, the reporting about Xinjiang “vocational education and training centers”, as it calls, is nothing but misleading headlines, groundless accusations, obscure interviewees and double standards. The paper admits that such malicious campaign in the West seriously damages the image of China. It also highlights that the selective use of pejorative words such as “camps” instead of vocational education and training centres reminds one of Nazi concentration camps that existed during the Second World War to eliminate the Jews in Germany. Unlike the Nazi concentration camps, these education centres aim to minimise the actions of those who try to involve in committing crimes and particularly engaged themselves in terror activities.

Last year on October 1, while delivering his maiden speech on the occasion of the country’s 70th Independence Day celebration at the Tiananmen Square, Xi emphasized that ‘No force can shake the status of our great country; no force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation from marching forward’. Dressed in a traditional Mao suit, he reaffirmed that China is on its way to achieve peaceful rise, steered by the Communist Party, the People’s Liberation Army and unity of its people, based on One China principle. This reminds the people of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, Macao and lastly, Xinjiang that Beijing will not allow any force to violate the territorial integrity of greater China at any cost. The country has displayed indigenously developed intelligent weapon system (HSU 001), quantum computing, artificial intelligence and big data. In fact, the entire power show was simply to indicate that China can deter the US and its allies in any future conflict. Henceforth, in no uncertain terms, the separatists in Xinjiang and an external campaign accompanied by massive funding would really find it difficult to shake Beijing.

However, a constant pressure on the Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang would send a negative signal to the outside world. If it’s a peaceful rise, China must see to it that its people are guaranteed the basic minimum fundamental freedoms and rights. Else the Uyghurs would become soft target for the global jehadi networks such as the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. China’s rise will not be peaceful as it will be countered by both its immediate neighbours and the existing dominant powers around the world. Hence, while chasing the grand “China Dream”, and One Belt One Road, Xi must be extremely careful not to raise another boiling point like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and South China Sea in Xinjiang. While curbing the major terror game plans instigated by the Islamic radicals, Beijing should see to it that the ordinary Uyghurs and the rest of the locals remain faithful to the mainland. Re-education camps, the way it is conducted, may add anti-China feeling in this western province of the country. Restricting the movements of millions of Uyghurs may be counter-productive. The carrot and stick policy of the Communist power elite towards the minority Muslims may turn Xinjiang into another Syria or Libya of China. It’s better for Xi and China to lie low while handling the wounds of the Uyghurs.

8,19-4-20,Communal strains in Covid war a concern,"Hopefully, the global concern over coronavirus will recede by the second half of 2020 and the focus will shift to repairing the devastated economies. However, the task of reconstruction is certain to get vitiated if the communal strains aren’t immediately attended

A monumental and unprecedented exercise such as the national lockdown that began on March 25, and is still continuing, is bound to have unexpected and unforeseen consequences. This is more so in a country such as India where, apart from its sheer size and physical and social diversity, human occupations and economic practices aren’t fully documented. Compared to countries in the West and the developed East which are compact and even codified and documented, there are patches of life in India that exist in a twilight zone between modernity and something else.

The lockdown, to cite the most prominent example, brought to the forefront the sheer scale of the migrant labour issue. Despite the progress made over the past few years in creating the architecture of welfarism — voter cards, Aadhaar cards and Jan Dhan bank accounts are examples — there are large numbers of people whose livelihood patterns, which include migration within India, are still undocumented. Many businesses too are completely out of range of the regulatory framework — a reason why the implementation of the GST was marked with so many unforeseen hiccups. Migrant labour belongs to this category of people whose livelihood is often linked to both the urban and rural economies and seasonal. The formalising of this informal sector will take a very long time. There are even those who insist that formalising in the Indian context is unnecessary.

In any case, despite the well-publicised human problems associated with migrant labour who were stranded in cities and unable to make the journey back to their families, it can be said that the Indian response to the challenge has been phenomenal. Where the Government machinery hasn’t been able to penetrate, voluntary organisations of citizens have stepped in to provide food and shelter to the migrant workers. True, this hasn’t resolved their emotional distress and their anxiety, but if the interplay of State and society hadn’t been in place, things would have become controllable. It is impossible at present to say whether the lockdown that ends on May 4 will persist in some or be repeated if the spread of coronavirus continues. However, assuming some break in the present phase of the lockdown, all State Governments will be better placed to handle this social issue the next occasion.

The same can hardly be said for the second social problem that surfaced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic: the rise in communal tensions involving Muslims and others.

The tensions undoubtedly have their origins in the wilful defiance of official instructions and abdication of common sense by the Tablighi Jamaat leadership in hosting a convention in Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month where large numbers of coronavirus infected foreigners were present. It was bad enough that the convention became the epicentre of the spread of coronavirus in India. What compounded the offence was the persisting defiance of the Tablighi members, many of whom are continuing to evade all medical tests and merrily spreading the infection to all those who come in contact with them. There are estimates that the Tablighi gathering in Delhi was in some way responsible for nearly 34 per cent of all coronavirus cases in India.

To compound matters, this unwillingness to seek medical advice has been accompanied by incidents of medical workers being viciously attacked and seriously injured for the ‘crime’ of entering Muslim-dominated zones. This has happened in Indore, Ahmedabad, Moradabad and elsewhere. In a State such as West Bengal, where it is believed the numbers of those who attended the Tablighi convention exceeded 300, the State authorities have, fearing political and other retribution, not even bothered to locate them. Reports indicate that apart from foreigners who came on tourist visas, there were a number of Rohingyas who have disappeared inside ghettos and can’t be traced except by undertaking drastic steps which in turn will trigger a political storm. Finally, the response of many Muslim communities to social distancing has been one of wilful defiance unless coerced. This criminal behaviour has jeopardised the national effort seriously.

It is quite understandable that in view of this non-cooperation and unwillingness to be part of the national community, there has been a sharp deterioration in communal relations. More than anything else Muslims have become objects of suspicion. This is unfortunate. However, the only way the fears of Muslims actually inviting the coronavirus into the country could have been disabused would have been for the Muslim leadership at different levels to undertake consciousness raising programmes inside the community.

Unfortunately, this has happened very patchily. Instead, the anti-Government feelings that were generated during the anti-CAA mobilisation has been allowed to spill over into the war against the coronavirus. What is particularly galling is that a section of the Muslim middle classes who should have played a role in seeing that the community stayed safe from coronavirus have instead directed their ire at the Government and, worse, their Hindu neighbours — blaming them for Islamophobia for expressing their anger at the Tablighi bigotry. In particular, the role of some Muslims in media and academia have been absolutely disgraceful.

Hopefully, the global concern over coronavirus will recede by the second half of 2020 and the focus will shift to repairing the devastated economies. However, the task of reconstruction is certain to get vitiated if the communal strains aren’t immediately attended. I believe every Indian has a part to play in this social reconciliation, but the Muslim leadership has to initiate the process inside their own communities. It is hoped that good sense will prevail.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/communal-strains-in---covid-war-a-concern.html
9,19-4-20,Corona: BMC forms 13 teams for sample collection,"With the State capital turning into a Covid-19 hotspot, the State Government has ramped up testing of samples from the affected pockets. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday constituted 13 special teams for collections of samples for virus tests in different places in the city.

As per reports, the teams comprising doctors, teachers, police personnel and sanitary workers would collect samples in two shifts from 8 am to 11 am and 4 pm to 6 pm on a daily basis.

The teachers attached with each team will ensure proper documentation, filling up of forms at the sample collection centres. As per the guidelines of the Health and Family Welfare Department, the sanitary workers attached to the teams would take up necessary sanitation activities in the camp under the supervision of the team leader.

Besides, the teams attached to the zone offices of BMC will be monitored by the Zonal Deputy Commissioners, who are supposed to ensure all required arrangements at collection centres like drinking water, electricity, fan and toilets. They would also make seating arrangements for public. Any lapses in the matter will be viewed seriously, the BMC warned in a release.

12,19-4-20,"War of words between CM, Harsimrat on Covid funds","Soon after Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Saturday claimed that the Central Government had given funds and foodgrains to the state to combat Covid-19, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh lashed at her""for trying brazenly to mislead"" the people, categorically rejecting her claims of central relief being provided to the state on account of Covid-19.

“Your information is absolutely incorrect,” said Capt Amarinder, in response to Harsimrat’s series of tweets in which she claimed that “Punjab received funds & grains to deal with Covid-19 crisis.”

“The State has received absolutely no money from the Central Government in its fight against Covid-19,” said the Chief Minister, terming Harsimrat’s remarks as another manifestation of her compulsive habit of lying and being ill-informed about even the basic facts relating to her own State.

Asking her to cross-check her facts before shooting out of her mouth, the Chief Minister said instead of using her office as a Central Minister to help out her own State, Harsimrat was shamelessly indulging in petty politics based on blatant falsehoods.

“You should be ashamed of spreading such false propaganda on such a major issue,” said Capt Amarinder to the Akali leader, pointing out that a time when political parties rising above petty considerations were joining hands across the country to fight this unprecedented crisis, including in Punjab, Harsimrat was using it to flagrantly promote her political agenda.

Sharing details of the funds sent by the Centre to the Punjab Government in a series of tweets, the Bathinda MP and Union Minister Harsimrat Badal said,“Punjab received funds & grains to deal with #Covid_19 crisis. I am sending you details @capt_amarinder. People want to know where are the things that came from Centre? Why no relief being given to them? Better you first distribute relief sent to u before making out a case for more.

“As far as funds received by Punjab after March 20 when #coronavirus broke out, please note the state received Rs 3,445 cr including Rs 2,366 cr on account of GST compensation & arrears, Rs 638 cr as RDG, Rs 247 cr for Disaster Mgt, Rs cr for MNREGA & Rs 72 cr under NHM,” she tweeted.

The Union Minister said the Centre had also sent wheat and pulses to the State Government. “This isn''t all CM Sahib. Centre has also sent 15 kg wheat & 3 kg pulses for 1.4 cr people which is half of state''s population. It''s still lying in Pb godowns & not reached a single household. Shouldn''t you prioritise work & ensure this relief reaches the needy at the earliest,” Harsimrat said in another tweet.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had been seeking the special package and release of pending Goods and Services Tax (GST) arrears of Rs 4,400 crore from the Centre. The special package includes Rs 729 crore for hospital upgradation and Rs 550 crore for setting up an institute for advanced virology.

However, the Chief Minister pointed out that the Rs 2,366 crore referred to by Harsimrat Badal on the GST count was Punjab’s money, in lieu of the GST owed to the state against arrears. And even there, Rs 4400 crore of the State’s money was still pending with the Government, he added. “You couldn’t even get our own pending arrears released, leave alone get us the much-needed relief package to fight the Covid battle,” he quipped. Even the other amounts mentioned by Harsimrat in her tweets were normal dues of the state, against various routine heads, “which have nothing to do with the Covid battle,” said the Chief Minister, expressing shock at the Akali leader’s attempts to lie her way out to cover up for her own failure to get any support for Punjab in this difficult hour.

As opposed to the 10,000 tonnes claimed by Harsimrat, the state had received only 42 tonnes of pulses so far, which was a joke considering the state’s requirement, the Chief Minister pointed out. He recalled that he himself had suggested that the Centre should arrange for 6 months of ration for the poor in all the States.

In fact, the Centre had even turned a blind eye to his suggestion to expeditiously lift the surplus grains lying in Punjab to free the storage space for the Rabi crop, Captain Amarinder said. “But they prefer to let the grains rot, and get the State Government to pay for the losses, instead of using it to feed the poor and needy people around the country,” he added.

Leave alone a relief package for Covid, the Centre was yet to even clear the pending bonus for farmers and insurance for employees, the Chief Minister noted.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/war-of-words-between-cm--harsimrat-on-covid-funds.html

The senior Congress leaders took no time in unleashing an attack on the BJP leadership after Bhagat accused Hridayesh of telling lies in claiming that she was instrumental in ensuring return of migrants of state to their homes after end of quarantine period. Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19 and enforcing of lockdown, the Congress party in the state appeared in supportive role of the Government but the utterance of Bhagat has given a chance to Congress to hit back.

Launching into an assault on Bhagat, Hridayesh said the BJP leader being senior and after becoming MLA for many times and holding ministerial charges, knows is perfectly well that lie is an unparliamentarily word. She said that it would have been better had Bhagat before making any statement cared to talk to CM or herself. Hridayesh said that she on occasions give suggestions to CM and he always reciprocates positively. She said that the time is not to engage in accusation and counter accusation when people of the country are fighting a battle against Coronavirus. Hridayesh reminded Bhagat that she along with PCC President Pritam Singh brought a proposal in the business advisory committee which helped the government in passing the budget in one hour.

The vice president of Uttarakhand Cong, Dhirendra Pratap also slammed the state BJP President for his statement. He said that in 40 years of her political career, no one has termed Indira Hridayesh a liar. Pratap added that it appears, Bhagat has lost his mental balance.

32,19-4-20,"Vegetables, fruits being kept out of essential items, regrettable: BJP","Former state BJP farmers’ cell president Sandeep Sharma on Friday said the decision of the state government of keeping vegetables and fruits out of the purview of essential goods during the three-day total lockdown, is both objectionable and impractical.

The Congress government citing social distancing has taken the decision but after the three-day total lockdown is over and when the vegetable markets and banks reopen on Monday, there is bound to be heavy rush of people at both the places, which will result in violating social distancing norms.

“So, it is an impractical decision to ban sale of fruits and vegetables,” said Sharma.

A large quantity of fruits and vegetables, which are perishable, will decay during the three-day total lockdown so farmers and vendors are now being forced to sell their produce at Rs 5 per kg, he said.

The government has to ensure that it is sold at a minimum of Rs 20 per kg, Said Sharma.

“Vegetable and fruit farmers will face huge losses. Who will be responsible for it as the produce will be rot in three days, which is an injustice towards the farmers and vendors?”

Fruits and vegetables should be included among essential items and the ban on its sale during the three-day lockdown should be lifted by ensuring that the perishable goods are sold while maintaining social distancing, the BJP leader said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vegetables--fruits-being-kept-out-of-essential-items--regrettable--bjp.html

He said that on March 18, the annual school examinations in the state were postponed and the schools were closed on March 19. The new academic session generally starts from April 1 every year, but it could not be done this year due to the nationwide lockdown, so students had faced many uncertainties whether or not there would be exams or when they would get admission to the next class.

The Chief Minister State that the State Government had already decided to promote all the students studying from class I to XI grade to the next classes based on the results of the examinations that took place till March 18.

He said that if more time is taken to conduct the science examination, then the State Government is considering to admit such students on a provisional basis, without appearing in science examination.

46,19-4-20,"Palamu MP raises issues of stranded labourers, poor power supply","Palamu MP VD Ram has raised issues of stranded labourers and acute crunch of electricity supply. In the second phase of 19 days of lockdown Ram is battling on two major fronts – first stranded labourers of Jharkhand in other states and second extremely pathetic condition of electricity supply in Garhwa district.

Ram said, “I have taken up the issue of 5 stranded labourers of my constituency in Sikandarabad in Hyderabad with minister of State Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy who has communicated to me that my concern has been forwarded to MHA Control Room to be taken up on priority.”

The MP said much the State government of Jharkhand claims it has taken measures to mitigate the sufferings of our State’s stranded labourers in other states like Odisha, Chhatisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, MP, West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh our stranded labourers are having a substandard life there with hunger and deprivation all writ large on their faces.

He said, “The State government has given Helpline but to me the helpline needs more help itself to operate. It is non-functional. Earmarked officers for stranded labourers in various states just do not take calls or if they pick up calls no response is made.”

Similar dismal fate is of Jharkhand Sahayta App, which again is a non-starter. V D Ram quipped as to how State government will credit 1,000 rupees in the accounts of the stranded labourers when it has no details of it here.

“See how Bihar went about this task of crediting money to labourers’ accounts. Its CM deputed senior most IAS officers to ensure availability of accounts of the stranded labourers but here the basic need which is the account number of the labourer is yet to be tracked down.”

This BJP MP who refrains from making any unwarranted criticism of government is too pained to call all these measures of this government of Hemant Soren as a mere ‘ Eye Wash’.

The MP’s second top priority is supply of electricity in Garhwa district which is reeling under acute crisis of it. Here MP’s anger knows no bound. Speaking to the Pioneer he said, “ It is more than 4 years that transmission line between Daltonganj Bhogadee Garhwa is lying in limbo. The agency which was to erect towers and stringing works in all these 4years has been dropped only this February 2020.”

51,19-4-20,Tribal villagers travel 4 km for water,"Pando tribes people of Bhunda village in Surajpur district’s Odgi block, have to trek more than 4-km every day to fetch drinking water from the Mauri stream.

The tribes people from the village, around 450-km from the state capital Raipur and 110-km from the Surajpur district headquarters, trek downhill twice a day through inhospitable forest terrain to reach the only stream in the region.

Usually men, women and children trek to the hill stream to fetch water for their daily need. The tribes people also use the stream to wash clothes and have their bath.

In May 2019, based on media reports, the public health engineering (PHE) department had dug four tube-wells in village. The hand pumps and the digging machinery had to be transported to the remote village via Sonhat in Koriya district.

The district PHE officials, had then assured the villagers that they will install solar water pumps and a water storage tanks near the tube-wells.

But even after 11 months, the solar pumps have not been installed, villagers said.

Due to geographical barriers the problem still exists, said Bhatgaon legislator Paras Nath Rajwade. Officials of the PHE had said that necessary arrangements to install the pumps have been made.

“Until now arrangement has been made for the supply of drinking water at the village,” he said and added that if no arrangement has not made, he will make efforts to ensure that drinking water is supplied to the village.

Digging for four tube-wells in the village was carried, however the level of water was below 200ft therefore, no hand pumps were installed, said district PHE department executive engineer SB Singh.

“As there is no electricity supply in the village, the department had sent a proposal for installing solar-powered pumps. The proposal was sent in February but has not been sanctioned until now,” Singh said.

Former panchayat sarpanch of Khohir village Tejbali and the present sarpanch Phool Sai Pando said every morning women, accompanied by their minor children leave the village carrying utensils while men take along kawwar or wooden slings to carry water from the stream.

After completing other chores like washing clothes and having their bath, they return to the village, the village headwomen said.

“The stream is also frequented by wild animals that come to drink water, and that is why the villagers always have to travel in groups for safety,” the two village head said.

Even though the villagers do most of their washing and other chores at the stream itself, they still have to carry water for drinking and cooking, said Urmilla Cherva, a villager.

“The PHE department dug four tube-wells for installing hand pumps but until now, there is no drinking water in the village,” they said.

Tube-wells were dug in the remote inaccessible villages in the district last year and solar-powered pumps were installed, said district collector Deepak Soni.

“We will evaluate the situation and take appropriate action,” he said.

67,19-4-20,Salute to saviours of humanity: Das,"Former Chief Minister Raghubar Das said that the mantra of ‘Vayam Rashtriya Jagurayam’, which has been given to people by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fight the corona infection, has started to show its effect. The corona virus has devastated the world's powerful countries. “The fire of this catastrophe reached us as well, but we had a close shave with the grace of God.

The heroes of our success are doctors, nurses, health workers, policemen, scavengers and administrative officers. They are doing their duty as service to humanity. During work, they do not even care about their health, what effect it would have on himself and his family.

While performing their duties, the doctors, nurses and other health workers of the hospital are themselves getting infected with the corona virus. In addition, health care workers, police and administration officials are also facing violence,” he said.

The former CM said that the Hindpiri in Ranchi is a vivid example of how health workers, sweepers and policemen are discharging their duties despite conditions not being favorable.

“A police officer’s hand in Punjab was cut off, which was later rejoined by operation. Such Corona heroes are fighting a two-sided battle, while protecting lives. A 3-month-old girl from Chhattisgarh is being looked after by the hospital staff.

Similarly, in Kolkata, a 7-month pregnant woman doctor is traveling on a two-wheeler to treat the corona victims. A medical technician returned to work in Rajkot, Gujarat, from the second day of his father's death.

Many women police officers are taking care of both their duty and mother's duty by keeping their milkmen with their children in the police station.

In order to get people to follow the law, our police personnel are doing duty on the road even in the scorching heat, as well as making food arrangements for the poor in the police stations and making masks for them. Such warriors have written a new chapter in the field of human service.

The families of these duty-bound persons are also supporting them with all possible responsibilities while fulfilling their responsibilities towards the country. Due to such people engaged in Jana Gana Mangal, Corona has remained largely under control in India till now. We salute such corona heroes,” said Das.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/salute-to-saviours-of-humanity--das.html
68,19-4-20,‘Covid-19 likely to cool down in next 3 weeks in India’,"Dr Ranjit Shail, a Consultant Physician in Acute Medicine and Nephrology and Honorary Senior Lecturer at St. George’s University of London believes that the number of COVID-19 patients in India is likely to go up initially because of more testing, but should cool down within the next two-three weeks.

For the Indian perspective, WHO has praised the Indian Government’s efforts, efforts of ICMR and Department of Health and Research in curtailing the spread of Coronavirus, he said.

“With a strict and successful lockdown, the morbidity and mortality (sickness and death) graph is likely to take a bell shape curve. In other words, as the numbers go down, the time taken to slow down would be about the time taken to peak. This has been about three weeks,” said Dr Ranjit.

He also considers that the Indian environment is not friendly for the Coronavirus. Many infectious diseases increase and decrease with a season as ‘flu’ usually comes in colder months while ‘typhoid’ and ‘measles’ in summer, said Dr Ranjit over phone.

Explaining the role of weather and incidence of Corona infection he said, there is evidence that Corona and related virus survives longer at low humidity and low temperatures. They survive shorter in high humidity and temperature. Body temperature is about 37 degrees Celsius while outside temperatures are usually much lower than this, he said.

“It should also be noted that people wear more clothes in winter, wash less, and have poor ventilation,” he added.

COVID-19 started in China in December and is receding as the temperature is going up. Most of the large outbreaks have been in regions where the weather is cooler. The spread of Corona around the world seems to suggest it has a preference for cool and dry conditions. But it is notable that the virus has appeared in countries with a wide range of climates, including hot and humid, he said.

Research papers in China are suggesting that high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that high temperatures and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of influenza. But scientists are not yet in agreement with this, said Dr Ranjit.

We must remember that Corona spread is multifactorial. Overcrowding plays a significant role in the transmission of diseases with epidemic potential; outbreaks of disease are more frequent and more severe when the population density is high, he said.

Be careful with joint family overcrowding. Avoid crowded public areas including public transport, recreation. Keep good hygiene and wash hands regularly. Take extra precautions with older people in the family and those with medical conditions, he said.

As of now, there is no definite answer about the treatment options from COVID-19 though they are mainly supportive of treatment. UK is producing more of smaller ventilators called CPAP machines. These are the smaller versions of actual ventilators to help deliver oxygen to lungs, said Dr Ranjit adding “India has joined the International research teams in search of both vaccine and drugs for treatment.”

78,19-4-20,2020 An Immigration Odyssey,"How did immigration become such a predominant trend in the world? Is it waxing or waning in 2020, and what are the long-term trend lines? Naren Nath attempts to answer some of the questions related to human movement with profound effects on the shape of the world to come

Few sociological trends have had a bigger impact on state of the world today than immigration. Look around and you see its effects everywhere. Countries across the globe are becoming melting pots. Populaces in nation after nation are becoming distinctly more diverse. Colleges and universities the world over are becoming more international, with increasing immigrant representation on campus. Doctors and other professionals are increasingly from immigrant backgrounds. Major companies are now being run by immigrants from other countries. Even Olympic athletes and other sports stars often hail from countries other than those they represent. You can see evidence of diaspora all around the world.

Why is this so? How did immigration become such a predominant trend in the world? To understand immigration, you have to first understand the immigrant. Who, exactly, is an immigrant? Well, look in the mirror. Do you find yourself in a city or town other than where you grew up? Did you happen to move to a better place for a better livelihood, or living conditions, or environment for you and your family? Did you adapt to new conditions, new environments, new neighbours and communities, perhaps even a new language, to make your transition more effective, and to fit in better? If you did, you are an immigrant at heart! You already understand and appreciate where the immigrant spirit comes from, what the underlying motives are behind it, and what makes for a successful immigration experience.

Immigration is nothing but this spirit playing out across national boundaries. This is and always has been the clarion call of immigration to people at large. The quest for a better life. For safety. For real emancipation. Fur the well-being of future generations. For greener grass. These urges and aspirations are as fundamental as life itself. Pure Darwinian adaptation and evolution at work. These are such powerful motivations that they propel immigrants to take leaps of faith, sometimes even taking inordinate risks, to make it to their promised lands.

From time immemorial, the world has seen many flavors of what can broadly be termed immigration. There was immigration in small trickles. There was immigration en masse. There was immigration that was largely peaceful, and immigration that entailed the use of overwhelming force. You could look at the mega invaders and conquistadors of the past, and classify them in two categories — those that invaded and ravaged and left, such as an Alexander the Great and a Genghis Khan, and those that stayed and built societies, such as the Aryans and the Moghuls in India. Then there were the European colonizers — English and French and Dutch and Spanish — colonising entire continents from Asia to Africa to South America. They were propelled by the immigrant spirit too, just happened to have sufficient economic and military might to take charge by force. And then there were people forcibly brought to foreign lands to serve as slave or bonded laborers, for instance in the Caribbean and Fiji, and of course the United States of America.

These were all different flavours of immigration. They all entailed mass movements of a people from their native land to another, and they brought with them their own variations of motivations, dynamics, trajectories and assimilations. The underlying factors, however, were always the economic, social, lifestyle and political empowerment and emancipation of the groups in power.

While there were many trials and tribulations, and triumphs and tragedies associated with immigration, one of the great success stories is often considered the United States of America. It is a country that is proud to call itself a nation of immigrants. It was founded in its current form by the most famous group of immigrants in the world who left what they believed to be the tyranny and persecution of the British monarchy to create a new nation founded on profoundly democratic ideals and principles. Ever since, America has opened its doors to immigrants from around the world, and become a beacon of hope and prosperity for the world that has attracted millions of immigrants to its shores.

Many other countries also saw significant rises in their immigrant populations during this time. Many of the colonies of the European powers, such as India, Pakistan, Algeria, Senegal, Mexico, and Brazil saw large swathes of people moving to their respective colonial lands. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe saw a surge of immigrants moving westward in search of better lives. Economic hardships in Central and Latin America saw significant immigration towards the prosperous North. And war-torn suffering and economic hardships saw poignant and sometimes tragic immigration from Syria and the Middle East into Europe and elsewhere.

While immigration has been a global phenomenon for centuries, in the last forty years it has seen a decided acceleration. The biggest reason for this is the consumer revolution and ensuing consumer empowerment brought about by the instant access to information and connectivity now afforded to billions of people around the globe. This has enabled unprecedented visibility and exposure to life in more prosperous countries with substantially elevated standards of living. Ironically, while the world has gotten better connected, it has also undergone a substantially widening economic disparity, with an ever-decreasing minority of the population possessing an ever-increasing proportion of societal wealth. This further reinforces the gap between haves and have nots, propelling the latter to venture out to foreign lands to seek better lives.

So extensive has global immigration been that it is starting to become a victim of its own success. The increasing scale of immigration and its after-effects are now starting to create significant social, economic and political stresses. While the motivations to immigrate remain as pure and profound as ever, these stresses are now beginning to create fault lines in destination countries. As the influx of immigrants gets larger and larger, receiving countries are beginning to grapple with its impacts and implications. Economic hardships of the local populace are beginning to get attributed to immigration. Crime and scarcity of public resources are often blamed on immigrants who are portrayed as using up national resources and not adhering to the laws of their adopted lands. Loss of cultural identity and conformity, including dilution of national languages and religious values are often pinned on immigrants. Drugs and diseases often have fingers pointing at immigrants too. A case in point is the current novel Coronavirus, increasingly attributed to immigrants from China carrying it to their adopted countries and regions.

These fault lines have given rise to massive nationalistic movements around the world. Starting with the modern mecca of immigration, the United States, significant forces are now questioning the merits and modalities of immigration, while others are questioning their ethics and moralities. There is a dramatic retrenchment of immigration policies at work, in particular when it comes to illegal immigrants, who while driven by the exact same motivations, haven’t yet found the time or resources or circumstances to come in via the legal route.

Emboldened by this credible challenge to a wide-open immigration policy posed by the flag bearer of immigrant nations, other countries are following suite. In the United Kingdom, one of the biggest motivators of the Brexit movement was the disenchantment and even perceived threat from immigrants. Even in the most progressive and pro-immigration nations of the world, such as France, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries, the tide of immigration beliefs and policies has been turning, with the emergence of conservative, nationalistic forces and political power.

What happened here? How did we go from a laissez faire, open door immigration mindset to this dramatic push back and retrenchment towards nationalistic orientation?

To understand this, you have to go back to the core dynamic of the immigration experience itself — on all parties. Being an immigrant is a bit like being a guest. There are ways to be a good guest and ways to be a bad one. For instance, you show up as invited under the guidelines established by your host. If you show up unannounced via the backdoor you won’t be as welcome! Also, the host will appreciate and incorporate you more if you bring a skill or talent, and add something to the party. If you are going to bring the party down, or worse, disrupt it in any way, you will clearly not be welcome.

Similarly, as an immigrant, you have to bring some expertise or quality considered valuable in your adopted country. This will automatically draw appreciation and accommodation from the host nation. You have to fit in with your new home and community. Everyone appreciates and even enjoys new thinking, a different point of view coming from a different vantage point, and unique cultures and customs. But within the fabric of a society, so it can be woven into the mosaic, and enrich all parties, not rip or ruin the fabric. Fundamentally, immigration implies a change of venue, but not a change in socio-economic parameters and work ethics. You still have to endeavor and compete. You still have to create and add value — in fact more so than in your native land. Immigration is not just a way out, it also has to be a way in.

Like any successful association, immigration is about forming a win-win partnership between the immigrants and host nations. There has to be a positive outcome for each side for immigration to be successful and viable in the long term. Immigrants have to find a higher, safer quality of life and standards of living. They have to feel like they belong, assimilating while at the same time being able to preserve their cultures and traditions.

But concurrently, their host nations and communities have to realise some benefit from having immigrants there too. They have to have their quality of life and standards of living enhanced too. They have to have their jobs completed, or other purposes served. They have to see immigrants making an effort to integrate and assimilate themselves into their communities, to enhance them rather than disrupt or undermine them.

At this juncture in human history, the fate of the immigration wave hangs decidedly in balance. The forces of nationalism and self-preservation are forcing a re-think on the societal costs and benefits from immigration. And of course, all the calculus around it is now being thrown in complete disarray because of the novel Coronavirus pandemic. Borders are being closed, lockdowns are being enforced, and economies are winding down. Travel worldwide has slowed down to a trickle, and in many places even come to screeching halt. Immigration has largely been shut down, and there is a strong undercurrent brewing to be self-sufficient and reduce reliance on foreign companies or workers. Immigrants are now much more hesitant to travel, and countries are much more reticent to accept them. In certain regions, the immigration wave has truly reversed, with intra-national workers trekking back to their native lands from major metropolises to escape the health and economic distress. There is also extreme concern about local economies and the livelihoods of local workers, with a heavy emphasis on employing local workforces, thereby pushing immigration opportunities further into the background. 2020 is quite a shock wave to the immigration system.

What then is the prognosis for immigration in the months and years ahead? Will the current Coronavirus crisis and the nationalistic self-preservation forces throttle the flow of immigration around the world? Or will the historical forces of the economic emancipation trump these? How will the Coronavirus pandemic impact immigration in the long term? These are fundamental questions facing governments and societies around the world, with profound implications on the shape of the world to come. Time will tell which path is chosen by the world, and history will judge if it was a path well chosen!

79,19-4-20,Cops wish happy birthday to GK resident,"Roshina Gautam, a 71-year-old resident of Greater Kailash, was on Saturday serenaded on her birthday – by the police.

They came into the colony with sirens blaring and then proceeded to play music outside her home, much to her surprise.

She isn't the only one. Hoping to infuse some cheer in the lockdown to stem the spread of Covid-19, police officials are wishing residents on their birthdays and anniversaries in the south Delhi locality.

Gautam said she was really surprised when the cops landed up.

""Around 12, I got a call from the police and they reached my society around 1.30 pm. Initially, the sound of the sirens scared us as we thought somebody had tested positive for coronavirus.

""Later, policemen came in front of my house and called my name. They played beautiful music and wished me on my 71st birthday. They also gifted me a plant,"" she said.

Gautam, too, did her bit by baking a cake for them and thanking them for the gesture.

“I am a member of the GK residents association and they might have got information about my birthday from there,” she said.

Police personnel also landed up outside the home of Greater Kailash residents Rajat and Vartika Juneja on their 25th wedding anniversary.

""I am on the group of GK residents. A friend of mine, who was also in the group, informed the SHO of Greater Kailash about my marriage anniversary. The SHO, along with five-six other policemen, came around 1 pm.

“They did not enter the house and maintained social distancing. They placed a pre-recorded message that was very nice and gifted us a plant,” Varika said.

Jairam and Varsha Tekwani said a friend informed the police about their wedding anniversary.

""We have a resident group in which the SHO is also there. They ask about birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations daily. My friend told them about my anniversary,” Jairam said.

""They called me around 12.30 pm and said that they want to come and wish me. They were at my place within half an hour. It is my 24th anniversary and they played a pre-recorded message on a speaker. They maintained social distancing and were wearing masks. Everyone in the area appreciated their move,"" Jairam said.

Greater Kailash Station House Office Som Nath Paruthi said police officials have several WhatsApp groups with residents, including senior citizens.

""We have a list of senior citizens and their dates of birth. During the lockdown, people are inside their houses. Through these initiatives, we cheer them and celebrate their special day,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cops-wish-happy-birthday-to-gk-resident.html
80,19-4-20,Rlys transports record foodgrain to help poor amid lockdown,"In order to ensure enough availability of food grains for Public Distribution system (PDS), Indian Railways loaded 4.2 million food grains during the lockdown period between 25th March and 17th April which is double the amount transported last year.

Indian Railways making all efforts to ensure that farm products like food grains are picked up on time and also to ensure uninterrupted supply chain, the ministry said in a statement, adding that to ensure that kitchens of all Indian homes continue to run normally, on 17th of April, 83 rakes in 3601 wagons of food grains were loaded (One wagon contains 58-60 ton consignment).

81,19-4-20,25 pets abandoned over virus fear,"Over 25 pets have been abandoned by their owners since the lockdown began in the national Capital.

The major cause of concern is pets being abandoned due to fear of contagion amongst pet owners. Such cases have increased to misconceptions revolving around the transmission of the disease, or a lack of funds or medical resources to treat sick pets. These animals are being taken of by self help groups and non governmental organisations (NGOs) for treatment at animal hospital run by the Friendicoes SECA in Jangpura where they are provided ample food, rest and treatment for injuries or infections.

According to SECA, an NGO, In these tough times, when stray animals on the streets are in need of help more than ever, we ensure that food and emergency care reach as many animals as possible.

“Ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced on the 24th of March, a group of dedicated caregivers from Friendicoes SECA (Society for the Eradication of Cruelty to Animals) have been preparing massive quantities of fresh food to feed over a thousand stray dogs and cats on the street.” “Usually, the animals rely on easily available food from concerned citizens or leftovers from neighbourhood markets, restaurants and food stalls, but the sudden and absolute isolation has left a large number of dogs and cats starving, thirsty and utterly lonely.”

SECA is preparing over 500 kilograms of food daily for them with 4 ambulances covering the areas of Netaji Nagar, Kidwai Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Chankyapuri, JLN stadium, Soochna Bhawan, Vinobapuri, Srinivaspuri, Hari Nagar, Ashram, Siddharth Extension, Delhi Jal Board, Bhagwan Nagar, Vidyut Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan Bus terminal, Bhairon Mandir, Pragati Mandir and towards ITO as well as the Saket-Qutub Institutional area.

Dr Prabhakaran, Veterinary Officer at Friendicoes SECA, said, “We are treating over 35 cases a day. In these tough times, people are abandoning their sick pets. Our staff is working 24x7 on an emergency basis putting their own lives at risk. Keeping with health and safety guidelines, all staff members have access to gloves, face masks, alcohol based hand sanitizers and other necessary equipment to stay safe.”

Geeta Seshamani, Vice President of Friendicoes SECA, said, “We are trying to cover as many areas as possible, but of course, it is in no way enough. Thousands of animals are still going hungry or sick on the streets and every day we wonder if we have done enough. Please don’t start abandoning your pets due to the fear of contagion. There is no direct evidence proving that pets playing a role in transmitting this infection. Human to human transmission is still one of the key infection source of COVID-19 and we must continue to take preventive measures against this outbreak.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/25-pets-abandoned-over-virus-fear.html

86,19-4-20,Jnanpith gets Akkitham,"The great poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri’s works have played a major role in demolishing orthodoxy and conservatism associated with the Brahmin community, writes Kumar Chellappan

That was how Malayalam literary critic, M Satheesan, described the momentous occasion when Jnanpith Award Committee conferred the biggest literary prize for the year 2019 upon Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri late last year.

Akkitham, as he is popularly known, is South India’s one and only Maha Kavi (great poet) whose works have played a major role in demolishing and destroying orthodoxy and conservatism associated with the Brahmin community — to which he too belongs. Aged 94, he is the last surviving social reformer, who revolutionized the lives of not only the Namboodiri households but even that of people belonging to lower strata of the Kerala society.

“I would like to be remembered as an astrologer,” remarked the nonagenarian, when he learnt of the award. “My forte has been astrology, a science. I learnt scientific astrology. Poetry is only a hobby. I scribble occasional thoughts that came to my mind,” he said, from Devaayanam, the poet’s mana (traditional Namboodiri house) at Kumaranalloor in Kerala’s Palakkadu district. Despite his age, the poet is alert and well in control of his faculties.

Powerful with words, Akkitham set the state’s cultural and political platforms ablaze with his revolutionary poems in 1950s and 1960s. He had forecasted the collapse of Communism and disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR) way back in 1970s. He has not written much of poetry in the last two decades as he has been busy with translation of Sree Mahabhagavatham, the great purana of Bharata, into Malayalam.

“We could not have asked for more. I rate this as literature at its peak,” said Rameshan Nair, a poet and long-time associate of Akkitham of the translation. Nair himself is the winner of 2019 Sahitya Akademi Award for poetry. Akkitham’s friends including Jeevan Kumar, editor, Yajnopaveetham and Prof K P Sasidharan of Kozhikode feel the award should have been conferred upon poet at least two decades ago. “Akkitham is a natural poet. The new age writers are light years behind him. They are yet to pen down lines which would get engraved in our minds,” said Prof Sasidharan, former head of the department, Malayalam, Guruvayurappan College, Kozhikode and Kerala’s leading literary critic.

The author of The Epic of the 20th Century, the best poetical work to emerge in Malayalam literary landscape sans any media blitzkrieg was his humble self when we caught up with him. “Everything is decided by God. Daivadheenam Jagatsarvam! Nothing belongs to us. Everything is pre-destined,” he said, pointing to the sky.

“All aberrations in our educational system began the day Nehru decided to make Hindi the national language. Had Sanskrit been the national language, the country would have been much richer in terms of knowledge,” said Akkitham.

He attributes his powerful expression to his knowledge of Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature. “The great poets of yesteryears, namely, Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, P Kunhiraman Nair, Kumaran Aasan, Vallathol Narayana Menon, Edassery Govindan Nair, Olappamanna Subramanian Namboodirippadu, Vailoppilli Sreedhara Menon were all Sanskrit scholars. Their works had originality in them and they wrote literature unparalleled anywhere in the world. Where do we find such writers now? Sure, novelist M T Vasudevan Nair fits the bill. But others do not have that power to move,” said Akkitham.

Even as the grand old man of Malayalam poetry laments the missing spark in the Malayalam literature, he points that literature — be it poem, novel, short story or drama — is an ongoing process. “What Valmiki and Kalidasa wrote were based on their own world of experiences. Every person on this earth has his/her own universe of experiences and they should be able to realise the same. Remember the old Persian saying: ‘You fool, look into the heart and write!’,” he points out.

A rebel and reformist at heart, Akkitham played a major role in getting rid of some of the outdated and irrelevant traditions prevailing in the Namboodiri community. Re-marriage of Namboodiri widows and Namboodiri women going out for work were unthinkable and unimaginable even during the early years of the 20th century. He, together with V T Bhattathirippadu and E M S Namboodirippadu (the first chief minister of Kerala), worked overtime and made use of all platforms and avenues to end the social evil and dogmas in the community.

The poet blames the complacency which had set in the Namboodiri community as the reason behind these social evils. “We ourselves are to blame for the same as the Namboodiris were financially sound, up in the social hierarchy and had nothing to worry about. But when they hit a low in life and faced difficulties, they had to change and permanently at that,” said Akkitham.

The same was the case with the oppressed classes who were denied opportunity to learn Sanskrit, Vedas and Upanishats for centuries. Akkitham led the social revolution which turned the prevailing customs upside down and threw the doors opened for people from the lower strata to learn the great Indian system of knowledge and tradition. “I was totally against the practice of Brahminism by an exclusive class. Nothing should be denied to the people of this great land in the name of religion, caste and class,” said Akkitham.

The Sri Ramaswamy Temple at Kadavallur near his hometown is a standing monument of Akkitham’s tenacity. The annual anyonyam (an intellectual debating event) on Rig Veda held in the months of November-December sees vedic scholars from all over the globe assembling at Kadavallur. Only the best scholars graduate as champions. The age-old vedic debate contest is held under the supervision of Kadavallur Anyonya Parishath and is described as the only event of this kind taking place anywhere in the world.

Akkitham who has authored thousands of poems in his 94 years (and counting!) and who was described as ‘Left of the Centre’ writer suddenly became a persona non-grata for the comrades when he questioned and challenged the social evils being practiced by the Marxists. The CPI(M) is known for its ideology of physically annihilating the enemies. This was unacceptable to the poet in Akkitham who questioned the practice in his works like The Legend of the 20th Century and other poems.

The poet blames the inertia that has set in the governments which ruled India since 1947. “The first thing they (the governments) should have done was to ban religious conversion. Besides the creation of Pakistan by tearing apart India, the unbridled freedom given to the foreigners to convert Hindus to other religions played havoc with the soul of the country. Mahatma Gandhi was against religious conversions. It is sad that we failed to read what was in the heart of Mahatma,” said Akkitham, while addressing the Gandhi Peace Foundation delegates at Kozhikode in Kerala. “Even a Gold Vessel cannot cover the power of truth,” he went to quote from a shloka.

Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri is not enthusiastic about discussing poetry, any longer. “My mission as a poet is over. It is my passion in astrology which sustains my energy and spirit. Now it is for the younger generation to take off from where me and my colleagues left. The world of literature is vast and is in an ever-expanding mode. So, there is lot to write and a lot to speak… It is an Akshaya Paatra, which is eternally overflowing. Those who are keen to write poems and stories can derive unlimited spirit and energy from it. But please remember, don’t write just for the sake of writing. If you do that, it will never be literature,” advises the poet before rounding up our session.

True, such legends are rare to come by. We are lucky to have him among us.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jnanpith-gets-akkitham-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/jnanpith-gets-akkitham.html
87,19-4-20,Give your home a new look,"With the lockdown extending till May 3, people have started angsting more. SUNDAY PIONEER brings DIYs to tide you over

For comfortable evenings

COVID-19 is wreaking havoc across. Factories, offices and shopping malls remain shut, social distancing is the norm and our daily lives have come to a halt. Perhaps for the first time in their lives, people are now forced to spend their time at home. And while it may seem relaxing at the beginning, it will also be quite agitating to be confined to the four walls of your home. With outdoors no longer an option, this provides an opportunity to give ones balcony a plush makeover during lockdown.

To make a balcony comfy, one must consider the space that he/she has to work with. It is also important to consider any existing structures such as doors, walls, flower beds and others as they will play a part in how your space will look. It is also essential to avoid cluttering your balcony with too many objects. Instead one should look to build around a focal point, only adding in necessary accessories where needed. Creating a cosy nook in the balcony isn’t difficult and can be done by adding a simple pendant light or casually placed candles making it a perfect spot in this weather to savour with a glass of wine. And finally, one must have comfy seating, as this will be the only place where one can get some fresh air, at least temporarily.

Minimalism is new normal

Books that are lying in the drawers — bring them out for the stack. Cushion covers lying packed — bring them out for a freshness. Expensive art pieces only meant for parties — time to display them for yourself. Move that furniture around for your evening zoom hangouts. Opening up the picture frame gifts and start planning a gallery wall. Create a space for family because everyone is in it together. De-clutter the spaces because minimalism will be the new normal. These small changes can help make your space look bigger, fresher and more personalised. These spaces should reflect the person inhabiting them to infuse positivity and creativity

Style it up

With our surroundings remaining static due to the lockdown, each day seems monotonous with a mundane setup at home; this not only dissolves one’s productivity but also impacts their psychological stability. To break this monotony, a refreshing home styling curriculum is quintessential. The rearrangement of furniture in order to alter the perception of a space is ideal to start with; enhancing the circulation pattern, augmenting the corners with art, rearrangement of existing art can help in rejuvenating the space while birthing a new hobby during these tough times. Creating layers through fabric and soft furnishing such as throw cushions helps in adding drama in the visual scape. Bold display of souvenirs and sculptures helps in tying the spaces together. To enhance the home workspaces, creating a stimulating context through colour coded books, organised documents and uncluttered surroundings is crucial.

88,19-4-20,Covid lessons: Govt should rethink PSUs’ disinvestment,"The worst-ever crisis faced by mankind has exposed the ugly face of certain sections of the private sector. Rather than rehabilitating the infected patients, private doctors have halted their ‘service’ out of the fear of self-infection. One of the reasons Covid-19 assault in India is lesser is the availability of wide infrastructure of public sector units

The unprecedented loss of life and wealth due to spread of Covid-19 has taught numerous lessons to the entire world, and India in particular. The highly revered model of economic growth based on international trade, consumerism and overexploitation of nature has failed to sustain itself.

In such times, the complete dependence on the vagary of market, and above all the withdrawal of Government from the basic public services may prove extremely fatal.

The worst-ever crisis faced by mankind has exposed the ugly face of private sector. Rather than rehabilitating the infected patients, private doctors have closed their ‘service’ to avoid self-infection. Private firms producing essential drugs, masks, and sanitisers have raised the selling prices of these necessary goods.

Most private firms are giving their workers pink slips, instead of helping them to survive in the same cities during lockdown. Private schools and colleges are not ready to offer their buildings, either for quarantining infected individuals or to accommodate migrant labours.

However, the purpose of the writing this article is to show that how BSNL, a public sector unit which Government is planning to sale, is helping the country during crisis.

Since prevention is the best cure for Covid-19, when most of the means of communication are on hold, mobile phones could be the most effective tool to create awareness among masses. That is why the Department of Telecommunication issued an advisory to all telecom companies to provide awareness related to Covid-19 through caller tune.

Unfortunately, most of the private telecom companies did not pay any heed to the advisory for a long time as they were aware of the possible loss of profits earned through caller tunes. Moreover, BSNL and MTNL were the first ones to start spreading awareness through caller tune. They also announced extension of validity period of their prepaid mobile services till April, 20 and in addition offered `10 additional talk time even after zero balance to ensure connectivity.

Now the question arises: Can we measure the awareness campaign by BSNL to stop further spread of Covid-19 and help the poor by giving free talk time merely in terms of money?

Sadly, the Government has been arguing for long disinvesting in BSNL just on the basis of monetary losses, ignoring its possible usefulness at the time of crisis.

However, the opponents of disinvestment, are citing many reasons for the losses in BSNL i.e. lack of corporate governance, accountability and incentive mechanism, slow decision making, unaggressive market policy, less aggressive market skills, unhealthy practices adopted by private players, Government interference, nepotism and bribing of government officials by rival private players in delay of schemes.

Further, there are some institutional reasons as well, which are responsible for the damage caused to BSNL. The use of BSNL’s infrastructure by rival private players at a negligible price and strategic blunder of transferring unqualified employees at the time of formation of BSNL are the strategic institutional reasons for its failure. Cheap mobile internet connections to politicians and Government employees also drained its resources.

Looking back at the history, we will find that BSNL stood as a top performer among all PSUs in 2003 but came down to be the worst one by 2014.

In the first half of the 2000s, the main reason for its increase in profit was the expansion of telephonic services all over the country. It was in the later half that BSNL started losing its monopoly due to tough competition given by private players despite the fact that its landline infrastructure reached the remotest areas. By 2010, the company was caught up in heavy losses and bore the same fate in the following years as well.

However, despite availability of mobile number portability and expensive services provided by the BSNL, customers have not hitherto abandoned it. Unlike private players, BSNL does not indulge in offering various deceptive schemes just to attract customers.

It is due to the transparency of BSNL that despite poor marketing, customer share is falling at a slow rate. Perhaps, public faith is still very high in BSNL, that is why BSNL has added around 9 lakh new mobile customers, taking its total subscriber base to 11.62 crore till February, 2019.

It has happened at the time when BSNL is still providing 3G services while others have shifted to 4G.

Historically, BSNL has been institutionally damaged by the Government itself. It can be understood by an information obtained through RTI from Alwar district office of BSNL which reveals that on January 1, 2015, there wasn’t even a single employee at the post of lineman and mechanic who had any degree/diploma in science or technology.

While the same for JE/JTO/SEO/SDE and DE/DGM/GM were 71 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. This was simply because when BSNL was founded, a lot of non-technical employees of Department of Telecommunication were transferred to BSNL. More so, majority of them were absorbed in technical positions i.e. lineman, phone mechanic, engineers and managers.

Since the nature of technology used in telecommunication is highly volatile and fast changing, the technically qualified staff finds it difficult to comprehend or communicate the problems at hand to the senior officials who are not technically qualified. Even the employees at lower levels of a technical work, like a lineman, also faces trouble when dealing with the public.

Moreover, a lot of Government policies have directly or indirectly disfavoured BSNL. For instance, only Jio or other private players’ connections were provided to farmers and students, under Digital India scheme.

Even TRAI has also favoured Jio by allowing it to run its free scheme. Similarly, BSNL was deliberately not allowed to participate in the auction of 4G. Though, BSNL was made a separate company but it could never free itself from Government, especially DoT in its decision making. Its social obligations are very high. Whenever an MLA or an MP demands network in an area where number of households are very less, where private players are not interested, and the ratio of profit to cost is as low as 0.001 per cent, the Government resorts to BSNL.

Similarly, BSNL is made to continue landline phone services in some areas where it is completely unprofitable for them. Such restrictions cannot be imposed on private players.

A look at the previous trend in oil corporations, Navratana companies, railways and airports shows that the announcement of privatisation came soon after the huge investment was made in the improvement of their infrastructure. There is an apprehension among BSNL employees that its massive investment in the Bharat Fiber scheme (to connect all the panchayats with internet network) may also meet the same fate or may be sold to Jio.

Interestingly, a lot of loss of BSNL is due to outstanding due on Reliance Jio which is `167.97 crore.

Thus, the outbreak of Covid-19 has provided us the opportunity to rethink our policy to disinvest in PSUs. One of the reasons why India has been comparatively less affected from Covid-19, despite all odds like high density of population, poor education, delay in preventive measures, mass movement of casual labourers and return of high number of infected persons from abroad, is due to India’s massive “public” infrastructure in health, banking, telecommunication and transport. Once all public sector units are sold, it will be difficult to rebuild them, and India will not be able to cope with similar kind of crisis in the future.

89,19-4-20,Tablighis did it? Muslims must find truth,"Tablighi Jamaat has been accused of spreading the coronavirus by its members’ unruly behaviour. It’s high time the Muslim community came clean about the accusations

The coronavirus pandemic has changed the contours of world politics. The outburst of US President Donald Trump against World Health Organization’s alleged mishandling of Covid-19 is loud and clear. Besides accusing WHO of hiding the outbreak and delaying decision to declare it a pandemic, Trump also blamed China for letting the virus travel around and ravage the world.

While China is leaving no stone unturned to gain supremacy in world hierarchy, Covid-19 has proved a hurdle in its path. Moreover, Islamic clerics have declared the Wuhan tragedy is a punishment for China’s sin against the Uyghur Muslims. When coronavirus afflicted dozens of Islamic countries, Islamists issued fatwa that mosques are the safest place against the virus.

Seen in this perspective, some Islamic clerics accused the Indian Government of plotting social distancing as a ploy to malign and weaken the Muslim community.

A transnational Islamist movement Tablighi Jamaat, by holding large gatherings in Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia caused the virus to export to multiple countries, from Southeast Asia to West and South Asia. Its four-day gathering of 16,000 at the Sri Petaling Mosque in Kualampur at the end of February spread the disease to six Southeast Asian countries. Its March congregation in Lahore attracted up to a quarter of million participants and ended up as the largest viral infection in the world.

The videos and audios doing the rounds showed Jamaat clerics say, “There is a virus but more than 70,000 angels are with me and if they cannot save me, who will?”

In Delhi, the Emir of Tablighi Jamaat, Maulana Saad, had slammed the lockdown and social distancing rules as a conspiracy against Muslims to gather for religious purpose. “This (lockdown) is a plan to end amity among Muslims, alienate them from each other. Social distancing is a conspiracy against Muslims,” the Maulana had said.

Some radical Islamic clerics believe the virus has been sent by Allah to punish disobedience and sins of mankind. Islamic State pointed out that Covid-19 is good for Islam. It also said if a natural calamity can cause this much harm, jehadis can cause destructions using man-made methods.

It seems the Islamists have turned a deaf ear to the teaching of Prophet Muhammad: “Cleanliness is half of the faith done... If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; if the plague breaks out in place you are in, do not leave that place.”

Tablighi Jamaat has been accused of spreading coronavirus in India after it held a congregation in Delhi during the time the Kejriwal Government had imposed Section 144 restricting gathering to five persons at a place only.

Media reports claimed that many of the Tablighis were infected with coronavirus, but they hid information about it and sneaked into different parts of the country, thus increasing the Covid cases many times.

The moot question is, was it a deliberate attempt? Tracing Tablighi Jamaath history and its major activities for almost three decades, one finds mixed results. While it has not been found involved in anything illegal directly, the way the Tablighis defied the health instructions of the Government, it is clear that they did it intentionally.

Also, there are various reports which put Tablighi Jamaat in a bad light. The organisation exists in more than 150 countries with 60 to 70 million Muslim followers. In the British town of Dewsbury, Tablighi Jamaat functions as regional headquarters coordinating activities throughout Northern Europe. In Asia, Tablighi Jamaat has a great following in Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Thailand.

However, despite their ostensible pious Islamic works, some of their actions are hidden in the religious garb. They have been accused time and again. Secret US documents released by Wikileaks in 2011 revealed that some al-Qaeda operatives used Tablighis to get visas and fund their travel to Pakistan. Al-Qaeda used Tablighi Jamaat to facilitate and fund the international travels of its members. In nutshell, it created an amicable environment for the recruitment of jehadi.

Tablighi Jamaat was banned in five Central Asian states in 1995 to 97 for its involvement in terrorist activities.

As the world is struggling to find a solution to the Covid pandemic, it is high time authorities looked into the intension of the Tablighis because of whom the virus has affected many thousands in India. Also, onus is on the Muslim community and Islamic scholars to find out the truth and support the cause of the humanity.

90,19-4-20,India eyes China's spoils amid Covid-19 outbreak,"As India eyes gains from China’s losses post-Covid-19, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and the Tuticorin Port Trust have geared up to set up Renewable Energy Equipment Manufacturing Parks (REMP) to accommodate companies shifting their base from the dragon nation.

Their move comes after the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) wrote to various States and port authorities to identify land parcels of 50-500 acres for setting up the REMPs citing it as “an opportune time for India to bring policy changes to facilitate and catalyse manufacturing in India”.

Maintaining that it’s time for India to bring policy changes for facilitating manufacturing in India, the MNRE said it has already set up RE Industry Facilitation & Promotion Board to facilitate investment. The ministry has also got in touch with trade commissioners / representatives of various countries inviting them to invest in this promising sector in India.

Recently, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari too had asked his Ministry officials to gear up for gaining from companies shifting out of China.

MNRE Secretary Anad Kumar sought collaboration and investment by US firms as he addressed the US India Strategic Partnership Forum earlier this week through a webinar.

Many companies have already started shifting China prior to the coronavirus outbreak due to the rising input costs and the US-China trade war. Jaguar Land Rover has started shifting to the UK from China while Samsung electronics decided to shift its production of premium flagship phones to Vietnam. If Japan has earmarked $2.2 billion of its record economic stimulus package to help its manufacturers shift production out of China as the coronavirus disrupts supply chains, Wistron Corp, one of Apple’s manufacturing partners, is keen to shift some plants to India.

The Government last month notified three schemes with incentives totalling Rs 48,000 crore to boost mobile phone manufacturing in the country and the dominant production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has the lion’s share of close to ?41,000 crore with sops to be spread over three years. The aim is to attract top smartphone players like Apple, Samsung, Oppo and Vivo to set up their entire value chain in India, and make the country their export hub.

According to ASSOCHAM, a large number of engineering exports from India can fill up the market vacated by China.

“The three power and renewable energy sector non-banking financial companies, namely, Power Finance Corporation Ltd, REC and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), have reduced their repayment charges to 2 per cent to enhance funds availability for new projects. Moreover, IREDA has brought out a scheme for project specific funding to promote renewable energy manufacturing in India,” the Ministry said.

“These hubs will manufacture equipment such as silicon ingots and wafers, solar cells and modules, wind equipment and ancillary items like back sheet, glass, steel frames, inverters, batteries, among others,” the MNRE said.

India has around 10 GW of wind equipment manufacturing capacity. It imports about 85 per cent of its solar cells and modules requirement. To incentivise domestic manufacturing, the Centre has announced provisions to enable levy of basic customs duty on import of solar cells and modules.

Earlier, the Yogi Adityanath government has also asked bureaucrats to chalk out a special package to be offered to multinational companies which are looking to shift their manufacturing basis and units out of China. Gujarat is also eyeing on the investment from Japan.

According to Chinese Customs data, the trade between China and India fell 12.4 % year-on-year to $12 billion in the first two months amid the coronavirus outbreak.

China is the third-largest trade partner for India when it comes to exports with a total trade value over $16.3 billion in 2018. The massive MSME sector in India also relies heavily on Chinese imports due to low manufacturing cost in mainland China and the high demand for products, especially consumer electronics, in the domestic market.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-eyes-china-s-spoils-amid-covid-19-outbreak.html
91,19-4-20,NHAI to resume toll collection on NHs from Monday,"The Centre on Saturday granted permission to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to resume toll collection on National Highways from April 20. The transport fraternity is, however, protesting against the move.

""In view of the relaxation provided by the Ministry of Home Affairs for the interstate and intrastate movement of all trucks and other goods/carrier vehicles, NHAI should take actions necessary for compliance of the orders of Home Ministry of Home and tolling operations be resumed w.e.f. 20th of April 2020,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a letter to NHAI.

The Government had on March 25 announced temporarily suspending toll collection on national highways to ease emergency services in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

Replying to a letter from the road-making agency, the ministry said the NHAI in letters dated April 11 and 14 has highlighted reasons for resuming the collection of user fee on national highways, saying that the Ministry of Home Affairs has allowed a lot of activities with effect from April 20, including commercial and private establishments and construction activities.

It has been further highlighted that user fee collection contributes to the government exchequer and also provides financial strength to NHAI in terms of budgetary support,"" the letter mentioned.

However, transporters' apex body All India Motor Transport Congress has opposed the move.

""This is undeserving. On one hand the Government want the continuity of essential supplies and which our fraternity is doing against all odds and at even loss, in service of the nation and another hand they will now tax us when the business is already at bottoms,"" said AIMTC president Kuktaran Atwal. AIMTC represents about 95 lakh truckers and transport entities.

""The entire transport fraternity is financially broke and does not have finance for operations and bringing back drivers either, which is another big challenge. Yet the government instead of extending this sector a helping hand by giving a bare minimum rescue package, submitted by AIMTC, it is burdening it with toll charges that account for 20 percent of the operating costs,"" Atwal said.

Earlier, the road transport and highways ministry had advised the NHAI to follow the Home Ministry's guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown. The prevailing condition may be treated as ""Force Majeure"" of concession or contract agreement in terms of the Finance Ministry, it had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nhai-to-resume-toll-collection-on-nhs-from-monday.html
92,19-4-20,ICMR gets nod for clinical trial of plasma therapy for Covid treatment,"The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given nod to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) proposal for the clinical trial of plasma therapy to treat critically-ill Covid-19 patients.

After developing the proposal for the trial, the ICMR had sought DCGI permission and submitted a list of institutes, which have shown an interest in the trial.

The Plasma therapy treatment involves blood transfusion from a patient who has recovered from Covid-19. Hospitals in New Delhi and Mumbai have already used this therapy to treat severely ill patients, which has aided their recovery.

Now with the DCGI giving green signal to its proposal, the ICMR will officially start clinical trials. If shown to be effective, the therapy can be a breather for severely ill patients until a vaccine hits the market.

Plasma Therapy is an age-old therapy that is used to treat infections, especially viral infections. In the therapy, the antibodies of the person who has recovered from the virus are taken and transfused into the critically-ill person to help boost his/ her immune system.

Generally, when a person gets infected, it takes about 5-7 days for the anti-bodies to kick in and help the person fight the virus.

However, in case of critically ill patients, by that time, they may get sicker.

However, the plasma therapy will not be used for all patients. It will be used to treat only the critically-ill patients, who are on ventilator support. It will not be used for mild or asymptomatic cases. Several countries have conducted limited trials using plasma therapy and have found it to be successful. Due to the absence of any potential drug or vaccine, many countries including the US and China have started clinical trials to test plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients.

A group of Chinese researchers had recently published a study, in which they reported that plasma therapy could be a promising rescue option for severely ill COVID-19 patients.

According to researchers, plasma therapy was used to treat 10 severely critical adult patients in Wuhan in China.

The result showed that infusion of the plasma was well-tolerated and it could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, resulting in patients showing improvement in their symptoms.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/icmr-gets-nod-for-clinical-trial-of-plasma-therapy-for-covid-treatment.html

94,19-4-20,From Esther Luella to Ragini Devi,"Name : Dancing in the Family

Author : Sukanya Rahman

Publisher : Speaking Tiger, Rs 499

An ode to three remarkable dancers, Sukanya Rahman’s book, is an intergenerational memoir recounted with a frank authenticity which makes for a compelling read. An excerpt:

The Bajpai apartment at 209 Sullivan Place in Brooklyn became a gathering place for Indian émigrés and their nationalist and political activities-a hotbed for the Independence Movement. Ragini was by now resigned to her husband sharing his roof and his purse with indigent political refugees from India. He was working full time for his political mentor, Lala Lajpat Rai, the nationalist leader and champion for Indian Home Rule. As councillor of the Indian Home Rule League, Bajpai had been thrust into the centre of nationalist activities. From the time it was founded in New York in 1915 by Lala Lajpat Rai, the Home Rule League had attracted the attention of British Intelligence agents operating in America. Its office at 1400 Broadway was constantly under surveillance. Radical nationalists, in an ultimate act of opposition to Britain, had sided with Germany during World War I. Several Indians, and American sympathizers of Indians, like Dr Taraknath Das, Sailendra Ghosh and Agnes Smedley, suspected of being a part of a “German-Hindu conspiracy” and a “Hindu-Bolshevik clique,” were picked up and deported or imprisoned at the jail known as the Tombs in downtown Manhattan.

Young India, a monthly journal brought out by the more moderate League, was now being used successfully to lobby Congressional support for India’s cause in Washington. Quarrels which frequently arose between more militant factions of Indian groups and institutions were usually arbitrated by Bajpai, who had a reputation for being a brilliant, fair and kind mediator.

Ragini, married to Bajpai now for almost ten years, had established herself as a respected authority on Indian dance and music. In 1928 she wrote Nritanjali, the first book on Indian dance to be published in English. Based on her studies of The Mirror of Gesture by Ananda Coomaraswamy, some translations from the Natya Shastra and her own dances, this small book simply and eloquently sought to unravel the spiritual complexities and intricacies of the classical Indian dance vocabulary for the uninitiated. Critical acclaim of the book had made a name for her both in America and in India.

She believed dance and music, one of the finest phases of Hindu life, must not be allowed to remain unknown to the world. “The world should know of it, and the great masters should ponder over the possibility of its revival and renovation for the whole world… Some people who love Hindu music and dancing must give their lives to it. I love India and I am trying to find the beauty of my life through Hindu music and dancing to which I have consecrated my life.”

She came to understand that Indian dance was an act of worship and not for entertainment. “Sadly enough, to us the phrase Oriental dancing has pretty generally brought up little else than the picture of the ‘danse du ventre’ which was for many years the particularly spicy feature of every carnival or fair from Maine to California,” wrote John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times; “…it is, therefore, a happy circumstance that there should be a few devotees like Ragini who are able not only to perform the classic dances but also to write about them in such a form that we of the West may acquire some appreciation of them before they disappear from the earth.”

And The Dancing Times, London, wrote: “It is difficult to study dancing of all arts, from a book: yet expert guidance, accurate description, and careful explanations… are offered in this valuable volume by Sri Ragini. It carries its own commendation upon every page being the work of an artist for artists.”

Ragini was now sought after among both wide and select circles of the public for her lively, illuminating programmes of Indian dance and music. Audiences responded enthusiastically to her interpretations of ancient and modern dances of India’s gods and goddesses. With structured rhythmic development, graceful hand gestures and facial expressions, she communicated to audiences the charm and vivacity of the divine flute player, Krishna, and his beloved, Radha.

She toured the country with two colourfully costumed North Indian musicians who accompanied her dances. In 1928 she booked this “Trio Ragini” into the Booth Theatre on Broadway for a series of performances which sold out. The New York Times described the performance as “an exotic evening of East Indian Music at the Booth Theatre last night, marked by half lights of subtle atmospheric suggestion and by highlights of appealing lyric beauty-the songs and dances of Ragini won her audience with simple truth of graceful interpretation rare to be seen in the theatre. Several of Ragini’s numbers had to be repeated, beautiful plastic poses accompanied by sinuous serpentine movements of the arms and hands.”

Her husband, meanwhile, had given up a lucrative job with a pharmaceutical company in order to devote his time to Lala Lajpat Rai and the freedom movement, often travelling across the country to raise funds for the cause. For Ragini this led to a variety of experiences since she was constantly devising ways to augment her income. She appeared in Carnegie Hall in a prologue to The Light of Asia, Himangshu Roy and Devika Rani’s film based on Edwin Arnold’s poem on the life of Buddha. The film received a lukewarm reception, but Ragini’s brief song and devotional dance, invoking Shiva, created a stir. “Sri Ragini is a native of India,” wrote one American critic, “she is as naturally imbued with the traditions of her country as any other artist who ever entered this country… Ragini Devi has a truly beautiful voice, a mysterious manner of intoning her songs, and with a sensuous style of dance to add to the atmosphere.”

95,19-4-20,Turn isolation into opportunity,"We have been homebound for more than three weeks now. Those working from home would be fully engaged as usual, in fact, relieved of spending hours commuting to their workplaces. A large majority, however, would be just engaged in attending to usual chores of life. Not knowing how to spend the spare time would be making them restive. Why not turn the forced isolation into an opportunity? How?

Let us invent ways and means to use the time constructively. Those having some creative passion should revive them, otherwise neglected because of occupational engagements. Thirty five years back, I was without any work for a year. I spent the entire time learning Astrology, which is now giving returns. Again, post demonetisation in 2016, there was hardly any work for a long stretch of time, which I utilised completing my book, expected to be published sometime next month.

Those having no idea on how to use this period constructively, I will advise them to try getting better empowered by working upon their mind-self, step-by-step. Remember, mind is the prime mover of a being. All actions out in open originate in mind. First arises a desire, which leads to corresponding thoughts, which when gravitate further in mind, translate into action, with related bearing in terms of fruits of actions thereto — pleasant or frustrating. Mind, thus, ideates and then drives through the functional mandate of a being. It is again the mind, which responds or reacts to external stimuli, whether intelligently or unmindfully, depends on how individual mind is framed, which varies from person to person. Remember, we are all born unique, each manifesting varying mind-trends.

It is pertinent to note here that mind is driven by a sense of duality, which makes it a double-edged weapon, carrying negative implications no less than its creative abilities. If rightfully used, it could add quality and value to life. It is on this strength that we have evolved thus far out of our primitive stage. But when inadvertently or unmindfully used negatively, it may not simply prove self-defeating but could unsettle even societal balance and harmony. Hence the need to orient our mind so that its creative side plays to our advantage.

In terms of the process to be followed, first, one needs to relax the mind. Remember, more the physical efforts, higher would be the produce. When it comes to mind, its chemistry works just to the contrary. More the mind is relaxed, its creative ability multiplies. Remember, human mind is fragile which continuously keeps flirting with thoughts, many of them inconsequential and even negative. That makes the mind restive, not allowing much of scope for processing thoughts objectively. It is something like a wild monkey unmindfully hopping from one branch of the tree to the other. It is said that human beings attend to nothing less than 60 to 70 thousand thoughts every day. It is only during 45 to 50 minutes of deep slumber that the mind is at rest. Even during dream stage, one keeps attending to thought impressions picked up during waking state. So, the first calling is to bring one’s monkey like mind in check. But for which, it would be difficult to pursue the steps to follow.

The process is quite simple. Lie down on your back on a hard surface, say a yoga mat or a carpet. Close your eyes and turn your attention inward. Let loose the mind — let the thoughts flow in and out unhindered. Train your mind to remain disengaged from the thoughts playing within mind. Remember, it is only when you pay attention that you get affected. You won’t get affected if the street dogs would be barking. Not an easy task. Never try to forcefully stop those thoughts. Otherwise, they will continue chasing you from within. Instead, keep making auto-suggestion to the mind by internally saying: ‘Neti, Neti’, which means I don’t care these thoughts. Over a period of time these thoughts will go out of reckoning, and you may feel relaxed.

The other day, when I was giving this lesson to someone, he asked: “How can such a simple process reign in the ever-active mind?” “Well, when you get into the process, you may realise that it is not as easy as it looks. In fact, your mind will be flooded with volumes of thoughts, difficult to bear with, which will make you restive. It is only after a while that you may relatively feel relaxed, and that too, provided you let loose your mind.” I responded.

The issue continues...

96,19-4-20,ENTER(CON)TAINMENT,"The lockdown has brought the entertainment industry to its knees. Producers and directors tell SHALINI SAKSENA that an industry bleeding hundreds of crores daily will take months to recover with present tense and future uncertain.

The year 2020 started on a low key but it had many good movies in store for the audience and the industry was looking for an excellent run. While movies like Tanhaji, Baaghi 3 and Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan that did good business, it was films like Angrezi Medium, Radhe, Laxmmi Bomb and Sooryavanshi that the audience was looking forward to. Then there was complete lockdown. While Angrezi Medium has since then been released on a OTT platform, the release dates of the other films hang in balance since there is no clarity when theatres will open.

According to producer Ajay Rai of JAR Pictures which has films like Gangs of Wasseypur and Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana to its credit says that the biggest problem is the uncertainty when work will start and the fear associated with working in close proximity.

“Given the fear factor, it will take time for films to get back on track, he says. “There is so much fear and people are not going to throng theatres. Therefore, digital space is doing well for itself. This is the right time to look at such platforms to release movies. For a producer who has spent a year or so on a project, he needs to cover his cost. He may not be looking at a large profit margin. An OTT platform is an option. A movie in a hall is watched by five lakh people, on the OTT it is 50 lakh or even more. It is a win-win for small movies. For big budget movies it is a different ballgame,” Rai says.

The impact of the present lockdown is going to be felt till the end of the year. “Movies that were probably going for shoot in June-July will get pushed four-five months down the line. Also, producers are not going to put in Rs 200 crore in a project for now. They will wait and watch the situation,” Rai tells you.

Ram Kamal Mukherjee, who co-produced his first TV series Bin Kuch Kahe and directed a 45-minute feature — A Tribute To Rituparno Ghosh: Seasons Greetings says: “These are tough times for everyone. Our industry can’t work from home. It involves a very outdoor kind of work. Making cinema is a collective effort, we are definitely affected as are the daily wagers. But there are many actors who are helping to tie them over these testing times.”

The problem will be when things open. While the Government has pushed the taxes forward, the issues will be when the industry is asked to pay past dues. “Given that we have not earned a rupee, how will we pay these taxes with backlogs,” Mukherjee says.

For independent filmmakers like myself, it is a blessing that there are OTT platforms. But it is a sad situation for big filmmakers. “They are the kind of people who are sitting in a loop. They don’t know when their movies will release and if they release will people come to watch them as and when theatres open. Will people have enough money to watch movies if they have not been paid,” Mukherjee tells you.

Director Aditya Kripalani, who debuted with Tikli and his Laxmmi Bomb that was slated to release in May tells you that for writers like himself, the lockdown has not impacted him professionally he had taken a break to write around this time. “For other directors, they can’t shoot nor can they edit since they need a studio. All post-shoot work has to be done at home if possible. All that can be done is prep for the film. People who were in the before a film are in a good place since one can coordinate via video chats. But if one was shooting or is in post shoot production, those would be the people who would find it tough going,” Kripalani says. He is at present writing a film about a lady cinematographer.

He feels lucky that he is not in the same boat as others. Usually, he gets down to shooting every February. “This quarantine poses no difficulty for me. But yes, we just finished the shoot for a film two months back and it is in post-production stage. Till we lock the edit, we are in a good place. But after that, we will need to colour grade and will need a studio,” Kripalani says.

Like every other producer and director, the most important question to tackle would be way ahead once shoots start. “How do you ensure the safety of the actors? All the crew goes back home at the end of the day. Even if we go for outstation shoots, one has to get everyone tested for COVID-19. The crew has to stay in a hotel where they will come in contact with hotel staff who will go back home and may bring back the virus. The only way to control would be to hire a place and run it to ensure safety,” Kripalani tells you.

More than the logistics that surround the shooting, Kripalani opines will be the logistics for the people to go theatres. “The theatre industry is hit the hardest. People will need to have the confidence to sit in a hall and not be bothered by a cough or a sneeze. Resuming shooting and watching a film in a hall will take a long time,” Kripalani says.

Kamal Gainchandani, CEO, PVR Pictures tell you that it is a crisis that no one expected when 2020 began. “We had not anticipated this when the year began. The Government has acted in a decisive and timely manner and kept the numbers low. Now that the lockdown has been extended to May 3, 2020, we are hoping that cinemas, malls and public places will open by end May or beginning of June. We understand that customers will not go from total social distancing to zero social distancing immediately. There will be a transitionary phase. We as exhibitors will have to reassure our customers, make them feel safe and work extra hard to maintain hygiene and other aspects of social distancing,” Gainchandani says.

He tells you that PVRs have always maintained a high level of hygiene, safety and security. They will just have to work extra hard to maintain social distancing by advising their staff to maintain the distance with not just customers but with their colleagues too. “We will have to augment our efforts. We will advise our team and staff to maintain social distancing. People have more or less maintained social distancing by being at home during the lockdown. They understand the importance of doing the same. We also believe that people also have out-of-home need for entertainment in their lives and are itching to go out. Our natural grain is to be social. People would like to go out and yet be safe. We will be able to deliver on this and come out with proper measures in place as per Government guidelines,” Gainchandani assures.

Things are no different for regional films. They could be worse off since many are made on smaller budget as compared to Bollywood. Co-producer Akshay Bardapurkar, whose Marathi venture AB Aani CD stars Amitabh Bachchan, tells you that the movie was set to release in over 100 cinemas across the State when cinemas shut. “I sold the rights of the movie on an OTT platform and it slated to release on May 7. We had hoped that the cinemas would open as well but this is not going to happen. People’s health is more important. Hence OTT is the way forward,” Bardapurkar says.

The problem that he sees that since people have got used to home entertainment, it will take them time to visit cinemas. “It will not before Diwali that people will feel safe enough. Take the example of James Bond’s No Time to Die. Its release has been postponed to November. This will hamper regional cinema financially. While there is hunger for content, people no longer want to binge watch,” Bardapurkar tells you.

It is not just the OTT platforms that the filmmakers will be looking at. “The regional film industry will now look at satellite space. Or they might split between OTT and satellite to recover their cost. This is going to be the new order for small regional film industry. Another option could be pay per click for movies to be released for international market. However, this is not likely to work for big budget films. Also, many films are made for big screen. One will lose out on experiential viewing. Can one really enjoy watching Bahubali on mobiles,” he asks? Bardapurkar will now look for options that will protect him including his next big project Chandramukhi.

Siddharth P Malhotra, director of films like Hichki tells you that it is not just going to be a changed Bollywood but every one of us would have changed post opening of the lockdown.

“It is will be pre-COVID-19 and post. The amount of introspection that we are doing, we will not be the same. Every person will evolve. But people will continue to want entertainment and shootings will start. But in a more controlled way. This is the right time for producers and creators to create content so that when there is need to fire, there is no lack of ammunition,” Malhotra says.

He describes a typical day on the sets. People spit and leave chewing gum all over the place. There is no concept of social distancing. They touch every equipment with no gloves. Nobody wears masks. Food is cooked in a certain way. “All this will change. The 100-men crew will be reduced. Only those will be allowed who are needed. This will continue till there is a cure out there. Even if there are no more cases, anyone can get it again and become patient zero and the cycle will start again. There has to be cure out there for the fear to go down and things to normalise. We are looking at very strict guidelines when shoots start,” Malhotra tells you. He also says that it will be tough to convince distributors to buy the movie.

What he doesn’t see is a problem when it comes to movies to be released at the international market which can happen a few months down the line. One is told that while international market gives a certain revenue but the majority. One can stagger one’s release.

Then there is the whole challenge of completing movies that were being shot in foreign locations. A large number of foreign countries offer huge subsidies for films to be shot at various locations in their countries. Producer Ravi Bhagchandka says it might be difficult, if not impossible, for some time to come.

“I find it very hard to imagine that any producer would invest in taking a crew abroad when there are likely to be major impediments to travelling internationally. Not just that, the fear of the virus still being active in different parts of the world is a concern that most producers are likely to have till a cure is found for the Coronavirus,” Bhagchandka says. During the making of the documentary, Sachin: A Billion Dreams, he had travelled the world to put the film together. He was also mulling foreign locales for a number of his projects that are in the development stage. It has been put on hold. Bhagchandka is at present, developing the Hindi adaptation to George McCutcheon’s 1902 book, Brewster’s Millions.

Pradeep Kumar of Shaika Films, who made his debut as a film producer with Bamfaad, starring Paresh Rawal’s son, Aditya Rawal tells you that in order to understand there is need to look at things from three points.

“The entertainment industry is divided into three – TV, films and digital space. Films and theatres are hit the hardest. People will be scared to go and watch a film in theatres even if they open. I don’t’ think that makers will release films before September or October. In all this mess, the people most impacted are daily wagers,” Kumar says. He along with his wife are producers of Choti Sarrdaarni on Colors as well.

He tells you that show makers depend on the broadcasters who in turn depend on sponsors. Since the GDP has been affected, companies will need to revisit their budget. “If they were paying Rs 100, now they will give Rs 50. Coronavirus has changed the world. The lockdown has affected the globe. We don’t know where we will stand once the lockdown opens. There will be almost no takers for films for the time being. However, TV and digital space will limp back since the audience for these two will remain. Even at home, people will want entertainment,” Kumar says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/enter-con-tainment-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/enter-con-tainment.html
97,19-4-20,EXPERT SPEAK,"SHALINI SAKSENA speaks with trade analysts KOMAL NAHTA and TARAN ADARSH to tell you what the lockdown and the future holds for the entertainment industry

The impact of COVID-19 and the subsequent nation-wide lockdown has left its mark on the film industry as well. Nothing is releasing, shooting is not being done and everything is at a standstill. Those who can work from home — post-production and editing — that is being done otherwise precious little is happening.

Trade analyst Komal Nahta tells you that all releases have been postponed indefinitely as nobody knows when cinemas will open. When the lockdown opens, one doesn’t know if cinemas will open simultaneously. “Second, even if the cinemas open, will people have the spending power. Third, will those who have the spending power have an urge to go to public places. Everything is pointing to a grim picture,” Nahta says.

He tells you that everyone is bleeding money. Interest is mounting at whatever stage the film is at — whether it was 90 per cent complete or even 100 per cent complete and whether it was due to release in March end or the coming months — the story is the same across the board. While Sooryavanshi had started its promotions, the situation for this movie is no different like it is for Radhe, Laxmmi Bomb or Coolie No 1. There are losses piling up for each and every producer.

“For movies that had released just before the cinemas were locked, like Baaghi 3 and Angrezi Medium, they are not going to revive even after the cinemas open. Old is gone. When the cinemas open, people will be looking for new content. At least Baaghi 3 had a couple weeks of run and did business. As far as unreleased films are concerned, those who can afford to go to a theatre, will go and see them. This is because people are bored to death. They would be looking for outings. But the fear will be there and will only dissipate on how fast India is Coronavirus-free. There are chances that the fear is going to last for months. This is because nobody has a magic wand to make the country COVID-19 free,” Nahta says.

He opines that majority of the industry players are not looking at technology to throw up a solution like the pay per link and people watching a movie at home. This will require a complete mindset change which Bollywood is not prepared for.

“The whole thing about watching a movie in a theatre is the experience that comes with it — watching a film along with people you don’t know. Collective viewing gives you a kick. Everyone would watch films on the OTT platform or TV as they release after eight to 10 weeks since satellite and digital rights are sold. But despite this, people spend 10 times the money to see it in a theatre, braving the traffic, standing in a queue to buy the ticket and getting inside — for the movie experience. To sell a film like Sooryanvanshi or Radhe or Laxmmi Bomb on OTT platform requires a mindset change and nobody wants to do that in this stage. Small producers may see it as a God sent opportunity but not big producers. Even if big producers get money from an OTT platform, will they want to sell? I don’t think so. No big film producer is brave enough to say: ‘Ok, I am willing to sell on an OTT platform'. To do so means to face reality which is scary,” Nahta says.

Taran Adarsh, known for giving trade figures and box office updates says that the year 2020 has not started on a good note. “In the first quarter, Tanhaji was a universal hit. Then there were movies like Thappad, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan and Baaghi 3 (did well in the interior but run was cut short due to COVID-19). The first quarter was not good enough. The second quarter started on a disastrous note. We lost on holidays worldwide. Theatres are shut across the globe. This is, to my memory, the first time that the global box office is zero. There were many films planned to be released and we lost out on this period. This is not a good sign,” Adarsh says.

He tells you that it is too early to comment on the numbers when it comes to the loss the industry has suffered since there is no certainty when the theatres will open but he estimates it would be to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore-plus.

He tells you that once the lockdown is over, people will get back to work. They will have bills to pay — rent, kids’ fee and medical bills. In such a scenario entertainment will not feature in their mind at that point. In such a scenario, cinema going will be a habit that will have to be cultivated again. When? We don’t know when the theatres will open. Having said this, whenever the Government decides to open them, a lot of practices will have to be put in place.

“First, social distancing while buying ticket, while entering the halls and sitting inside. Will there be alternate sitting arrangement? Social distancing while getting out will have to be done. Then during the intermission. Will there be social distancing while buying popcorn or a cup of coffee? Social distancing while using the washroom. Second, once the movie is over, will theatres need to be sanitised? Third, which is for the production houses when they resume shooting. A lot of films are half done. They need to be completed. At any given time during a shoot there are 100-125 people. Will social distancing be practiced whether it is TV or films,” Adarsh asks. He tells you that it is going to be BC and AC — Before Corona and After Corona.

“Corona has changed the world. Also, one can’t expect big budget films to release just because theatres have opened in India. Half the time, such films release simultaneously in the international market. Till such time that normalcy returns to the US, the UK, New Zealand, Australia and Middle-east and people are ready to go and watch films, I don’t see any big filmmaker wanting to release his or her movie,” Adarsh says.

He doesn’t think that OTT platforms are going to be the next big thing. “A few films here and there may look at digital space. This may be true for those films that have fewer stake. But for bigger players, it will always be theatrical. This is because it is on the basis of this that will tell you where you stand on the digital platform,” Adarsh says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/expert-speak.html
98,19-4-20,"‘I look for good story, then comes role’","Atul kulkarni | He is seen in films like Raees, The Ghazi Attack and Section 375. He speaks with Musba Hashmi about his latest venture, The Raikar Case, what made him take up the role and fondest memory in the industry

What is your role in Voot Select’s The Raikar Case?

First things first. The series is a murder mystery. The story revolves around who has done it and also talks about interpersonal relationship between the family members of this big family. I play Yashwant Naik Raikar, the head of the family. He is like the epicentre of the family and what has happened in the family. He is of patriarchal mindset.

What made you say yes to the role?

Whenever, I take up any project, I look for the story. I try and listen to the story as an audience and that’s exactly what I did with this one too. This story is gripping, so much so that one just can’t let go of it after watching one episode.

Today, people have a lot of choices, there are so many platforms with so many shows and if a series is making sit and watch the complete series despite of the so many distractions, this itself indicates how engaging the story is. I am happy that we are getting lots of messages from people that they loved the story. It makes me even more happier that what I am liking, the audience too is liking that.

You debuted with Bhoomi Geetha. How did you come on board for that?

I was doing a play in Delhi, when I was studying in National School of Drama (NSD) back then and we had a show in Bangalore. That’s when, Kesari Haravu, director of the film saw me in the play and offered me the film. That’s how I got the project.

You have done a lot of varied roles. What made you experiment?

Like I said, I go for the story and the storyteller (director). This is the main criteria for me and then comes the role ofcourse. This is the order I follow before I take up any project.

How do you define acting and what is your approach towards it?

In simple words, you pretend. You are into the business of pretending things. It is all about conviction. One has to convince people that you are that character yourself and the story that you are telling is true.

Your fondest memory in the industry.

The day I entered the industry has been the most memorable moment for me till date. I love doing films and am glad that I have been a part of this industry.

Was there a moment when you have to go out of you comfort zone?

Not really. My training in NSD comes handy in this case. NSD teaches you in an extremely professional manner. Also, acting is about getting out of your comfort zone. You are never the character that you are playing, you are a different person. Having said that, there is always something — a quality — of the character in yourself . It is a combination of both. For every character, you have to go out of your comfort zone, may be physically or mentally. As an actor, it is my duty to do that (go out of the comfort zone) and I am trained for it.

A lesson learnt in the industry.

One thing that I have always told myself is that my profession is not my life. This profession is overwhelming — suddenly people start recognising you. So one thing that you must learn is to never take yourself too seriously because of the name and fame that comes with this profession. It is a big no-no. The key is to stay grounded and not think too much about being into this profession.

What are your upcoming projects?

I am writing the script for Laal Singh Chaddha, Aamir Khan will be playing the role. I will be acting in a series — City of Dreams, Nagesh Kukunoor will be directing it. Then I am doing a show for Netflix, it is a Bahubali prequel. That’s all for the time being.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-look-for-good-story--then-comes-role----2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-look-for-good-story--then-comes-role---.html
99,19-4-20,Lockdown platter show,"Active yeast has gone from the shelf. So has all purpose flour. Cooking, baking, food exotica have deluged social media photo galleries — welcome to the new syrup of the homebound — open ovens and hot selling platters all home grown and consumed. MUSBA HASHMI tells you more

When the entire country is home bound owing to the current lockdown due to the novel Coronovirus, what one can’t cordon off is the sudden cravings. Be it for gol gappas, bhelpuri, samosas, garlic bread or for that matter even momos, people have started donning the hat of a chef. All thanks to social media. Get up, walk up to the kitchen, play a cooking video on any of the platform and you are good to go.

One doesn’t even have to put too much efforts in searching for these videos as the moment one opens their social media, hundreds of thousands of such videos are ready to pop out of the screen any moment. The craze of cooking is on an all time high. Even the laziest man on earth is out there in the kitchen, preparing to satisfy his craving.

However, this is leading to stocks running out far and wide. With baking being high on agenda, active dry yeast has gone out of stock at major delivery stations like Grofers, Big Basket and even the local grocery stores. “The demand has suddenly peaked with not less than 20 yeast packets being sold in a day. That was my stock for the past eight months with only once in a while people asking for it,” said Babli of the Goel Stores in Hauz Rani, Saket

From Mexican to Italian to baking breads, making pizza dough from scratch, to Chinese to regional cuisines on the Indian platter, social media is flooded with pictures and recipes by users. “I cant remember the last time I stayed home for so long that too without any cooks, maids or cleaners. Obviously, this is the time to explore and show-off your internet gained cooking skills,” said Jilmil Dutta who is home locked in Sarva Priya Vihar due to the Coronavirus.

The deal is to cook something exotic, and much like a restaurant. From enchiladas, to Mexian roles and guacomoli to pizza, pasta, lasania to litti chokha, pav bhaji and dhokla, everything that people would order in or go out to eat, is being made at home, much to the delight of family members working from home.

Besides all the exotica being dished out from home kitchens, there is a whole body of food and chores related jokes that have been regaling whatsapp users in these difficult time of lockdown. “I feel my utensils have had a litter,” said one overworked housewife, while the other said “I feel like this virus is a conspiracy to make me learn how to cook.”

The mostly working population of urban women is now home bound and ready to try her hand at things she always wanted to but could never find time to. “The usual dal chawal is not my idea of cooking. I find it boring. So I’ve been voraciously trying out my hand at Internet recipes and have actively been discussing what comes next with my Insta and Facebook friends. A lot of time has been consumed doing this chore that is a delight for a change,” Urmila Singh, a highly placed and busy marketing executive, says.

Such has been the increased intake of food, that circumfrences have grown and fat burning home remedies becoming a common feature. “Dear Tummy, kya aapko pata nahin lockdown mein bahar nikalna mana hai?. App kaisey itna bahar nikal rahi hain?”.

Karan Dua, who runs a cooking channel DilSeFoodie on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram says his channel had never seen such a surge in views. “I have been actively running these channels and posting videos since 2013, but it was not before the lockdown phase that my channels saw a surge of about 1500 followers daily and views counting in thousands, with demands pouring in every day for new recipes, to be precise easy ones,” he says.

It is not only baking or cooking that everyone is running after, the latest trend that people are falling head over heels for is Dalgona coffee. “I came to know about this trend through social media where everyone was busy mixing coffee, sugar and water into a thick foamy texture. I too decided to follow the trend and made a video on the same. I got immense appreciation for the same,” Dua tells you.

Dalgona coffee is nothing but what Indians are making since eternity. Take coffee powder, add some sugar and one spoon water and whisk it for five to seven minutes or until it turns into a light-coloured creamy foam. Take hot or cold milk in a cup or glass and layer the foam onto it. A thick layer is just as fine. The milk will remain in the bottom half of the cup while the light coloured foam will float on it. Your Dalgona coffee is ready to serve.

Not to mention all the memes that have been doing rounds on Dalgona coffee. Someone is posting a picture of a half-peeled potato and captioning it ‘Dalgona Aaloo’ while another one presents ‘Dalgona Kabootar’ and the most hilarious of all is the ‘Dalgona Peg’ by a Punjabi man.

One of the most watched videos of Dua is the one in which he is teaching people an easy way to boil water. “Humour is welcomed by everyone. That is why I decided to make this tricky video which has garnered more than 90,000 views. I engage my viewers with recipes and sometimes with fun,” he says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lockdown-platter-show-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/lockdown-platter-show.html
100,19-4-20,‘I get roasted by teens many a times’,"Comedian and Youtuber ASHISH CHANCHLANI recently released his debut horror film Aakhri Safar that has garnered 10 million views. He speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about why he chose horror as a genre for his film among other things

What is your film about?

This is my directorial debut horror film for YouTube. I usually do comedy sketches for the channel. But I wanted to do something different. Horror as a genre on YouTube has not exactly been explored much. There have been horror-comedies but not pure horror. I wanted to experiment and therefore the always say that 26-minute short film.

How tough was it to work in the genre?

I used to always say that it was easy to deal with this genre. But when I started exploring it, I realised that it was not as easy. What one thinks is going to be scary need not necessarily be scary when you get it down on the screen. I understood it was not as easy as it looks and one had to go that extra mile to make things scary. But as I explored more, it became easier. I definitely learnt a lot with this movie.

India doesn’t make as good horror films. Where is the gap?

I would say that we have had our fair share of good horror films. There was Bhoot by Ram Gopal Varma. Then there is a film by Pawan Kripalani — Phobia — starring Radhika Apte. There are a few directors who have done some good work. Some of our horror films have sex and romance and we deviate and loose track of the story. When we concentrate of the story, we do a better job.

How did your comedy journey begin?

I have done Civil Engineering. Like any other person in Mumbai, I wanted to be an actor as well. My father would tell me that I needed to wise up and realise that there are millions of people who wanted to be one and I should give up my dream. I used to watch vines and thought that India had so many topics why not make something on those topics that were fun. From vines I switched to Insta to Facebook to finally YouTube and became a career.

Is it possible to make a career in comedy today?

I think it is tough because the genre is getting saturated. One has to do something out-of-the-box to stand out make good money from it and go places.

Have Indians learnt to laugh at themselves?

Indians get offended easily. Todd Philips director of Joker and Hangover series stopped making comedies because he felt that people get offended easily. People need to understand that there are people who love to joke around. Just because one made a joke about a serious issue, it doesn’t mean that we are making of the issue at hand. It is meant to be taken as a joke. I have been roasted many times for my jokes. You are a bad comedian if you can’t take a joke on yourself. Sometimes people cross the line which should be avoided.

Can you share a few instances where you were roasted?

I have been roasted by 18-19 year olds. I think they are just being teenagers. Once they are past this phase, they will understand things better.

What is keeping you busy?

For now, it is comedy. It is my comfort zone. But I am looking to explore murder-mystery as a genre. It will take time to put it out on paper but hopefully it will be a short film as well. One day I hope I can make a full-length movie as well.

Where do you get inspiration from?

It is all around me. Have you ever tried to make a video of people on Holi day with faces covered with colour? I make content from what is around me. I made a video on the face of people with colour on their faces and it went viral. One just has to sit with paper and pen and one will get content. Sometime, it gets exhausting since I am looking for content. But I really down get down to making it till I am convinced that it is good to go.

What was your parents’ reaction when you quit?

They have always been supportive of what I am doing. They were worried for me because they felt what I was doing was not going to go anywhere. But they settled don once my popularity rose.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-get-roasted-by-teens-many-a-times----2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---i-get-roasted-by-teens-many-a-times---.html
101,19-4-20,"Research being done on side effects of HCQ, says ICMR","The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday said that research is underway to study the side effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).

The move follows criticism that HCQ has been endorsed by the ICMR without studying its serious side effects for asymptomatic health-care workers treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and for asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.

Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, senior Scientist of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I) of the ICMR, said it has conducted cohort study and no trial study yet, as evidence base to conduct the trial is not available.

The ICMR has recommended chemoprophylaxis with HCQ for asymptomatic health-care workers treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and for asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases.

The ICMR document states “its use in prophylaxis is derived from available evidence of benefit as treatment and supported by preclinical data”.

However, a team of scientists in their review published in the recent issue of The Lancet Infectious Medicine said that although some in-vitro evidence supports the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine and its precursor chloroquine, “there is no peer-reviewed publication that evaluates either drug for exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”

Even for treatment of diagnosed cases, only one small study reported faster nasopharyngeal viral clearance, with no data for clinical improvement. This evidence, or the lack thereof, hardly justifies state-endorsed, widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, said Dr Pranav Ish (Department of Pulmonary Medicine), Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, and Sahaj Rathi (Community Medicine), Ashwani Kalantri and Shriprakash Kalantri both from Department of Community Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram.

They said they were deeply concerned that in this environment of global panic, an endorsement by the highest scientific body of India will create an overly optimistic perception of the effectiveness of HCQ among the public.

“The drug is untested, the benefits unknown, and the risks not negligible, especially at this scale of use. Moreover, the safety of these immunomodulators in people at risk of a severe viral illness has never been evaluated,” they said adding that a blanket recommendation for chemoprophylaxis in the absence of credible evidence might be contentious to say the least.

If hydroxychloroquine is to be used, a clear informed choice needs to be offered to every contact, explaining the scarcity of evidence for its efficacy and its potential risks. Additionally, all outcome events should be recorded.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/research-being-done-on-side-effects-of-hcq--says-icmr.html
102,19-4-20,Ludhiana’s ACP dies of Covid,"The 52-year-old Ludhiana assistant commissioner of police, who was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital, died on Saturday.

ACP (North) Anil Kohli breathed his last at the SPS Hospital, Ludhiana, Civil Surgeon Rajesh Bagga said.

On Friday, the Punjab government had given its go-ahead to the hospital to conduct plasma therapy on the police officer.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced Rs 50 lakh ex gratia to the next of kin of the deceased. He said a similar amount will be paid to the family of any officer who dies in the line of duty due to Covid.

“Sad News ACP Anil Kohli passed away. Died of #COVID-19. Was admitted in SPS Hospital Ludhiana,” Ludhiana district public relations office tweeted. The officer had tested positive for coronavirus on April 12. His wife, a security guard and a station house officer tested positive on Friday.

The Mohali district administration on Saturday morning sent a fully-recovered coronavirus patient to the hospital to use his plasma for treating ACP Kohli. “District Administration Mohali is dispatching one young fully recovered/ cured COVID-19 patient to SPS/Apollo Hospital Ludhiana.

His plasma may be used to try and cure the other COVID-19 positive patients by plasma therapy,” Punjab’s Special Chief Secretary KBS Sidhu tweeted.

The Chief Minister and Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta condoled the death of the police officer. “Sad to share that we had lost Gurmail Singh Kanungo yesterday & ACP Anil Kohli in Ludhiana to #Covid19 today. In this moment of crisis, losing our Corona Warriors is a big loss for the State. I join their families in this time of grief. Rest assured Punjab will stand by them,” Amarinder Singh said on Twitter.

“Our brother officer Anil Kohli, ACP Ludhiana, lost his battle against #COVID-19 today afternoon. Anil served Punjab Police and the people of Punjab for over 30 years. May his soul RIP! Our prayers are with his family, relatives and all those worked with him,” the DGP tweeted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ludhiana---s-acp-dies-of-covid.html
103,19-4-20,"Karnataka registers youngest death, total +ve tally at 384","Karnataka registered its youngest and 14th Covid death in the passing away of a middle-aged person, a 42-year-old man, even as positive cases rose by 25, raising the State’s tally to 384, an official said on Saturday.

“Positive case 374, a 42-year-old male patient, contact of cases 306 and 308, died on Thursday due to cardiac arrest and (Covid) sample confirmed positive on Saturday,” said a health official.

MK Stalin the Leader of the Opposition told a media meet on Saturday that Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami should come clean on the whole deal which is worth hundreds of crores rupees.

Saturday saw the number of persons tested for coronavirus in Tamil Nadu reaching 1,372. “Today 49 persons were tested positive making the total number of patients diagnosed with COVID-17 disease reached 1, 372,” said Dr C Vijaya Basker, Minister for Health, while briefing the media late Saturday evening.

He said the day saw 82 persons getting discharged from various hospitals in the State. “Till date 365 persons have been cured and discharged from the State’s hospitals,” said Dr Baskar. He also said that 31 laboratories were working round-the-clock for testing coronavirus.

The health minister said the State has received 36,000 rapid test kits which would help increase the number of tests a laboratory could do. The death tally in Tamil Nadu due to the pandemic remained 15 on Saturday.

The State government is expected to take a decision on Monday whether to allow some of the industrial units to open the shutters.

The committee has been asked to formulate guidelines for a phased exit from the regulations imposed during COVID 19 lockdown.

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises units in Tamil Nadu (the mainstay of the State’s economy) is in doldrums because of the unexpected lockdown. “This sector should be totally exempted from repaying the loans they have availed at least for two years.

128,19-4-20,PNB fraud case: Nirav’s brother offers to help ED,"Fugitive dubious diamantaire Nirav Modi’s brother Neeshal, a co-accused in the Rs 13,500 crore PNB credit fraud case, has in a letter to the Enforcement Directorate offered to cooperate in the probe and distanced himself from his brother’s actions in the scam.

The ED and CBI have already chargesheeted Antwerp-based Neeshal along with Nirav, their uncle Mehul Choksi and others in the PNB credit fraud case.

In his apparent bid to clear himself of the criminality in the money laundering case, Neeshal has also appended a forensic audit conducted by a Belgium-based auditing firm certifying that all transactions of Firestar Diamond BVBA were authentic, genuine and with legitimate documentary evidence such as invoices and shipping consignment documents. In its chargesheet filed in May 2018, the ED had named the firm Firestar Diamond involved in money laundering for Nirav Modi. Neeshal was a director in the chargesheeted firm.

The ED had also stated in the chargesheet that Neeshal was involved in the appointment of dummy partners and was a signatory or a beneficiary in some Dubai-based dummy companies between 2011 and 2013.

According to the ED chargesheet, huge sums of money were transferred to the accounts of Firestar Diamond from six Hong Kong-based companies.

In his letter to the ED, Neeshal claimed that he was willing to fully cooperate with the investigation and hoped that the agency will respond positively to his offer. He also urged the agency to meet him in Antwerp to clarify any doubts regarding the investigation.

He also dissociated from his brother Nirav saying he has nothing to do with the criminal activities of Nirav or his transactions relating to the Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) under probe by the CBI and the ED.

Agency officials, however, termed Neeshal’s attempts as a gimmick to seek leniency in the light of the pending extradition proceedings against him. Nirav is undergoing custody in London and is also facing extradition proceedings at the behest of the investigating agencies probing the PNB scam.

They said all the accused have already been chargehseeted in the case and attachments to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore have been made in the case following through investigation and Neeshal’s attempts to turn approver may not be tenable.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pnb-fraud-case--nirav---s-brother-offers-to-help-ed.html
129,19-4-20,Homesick migrant sculptor cuts off his tongue at temple in Guj,"A labourer from Madhya Pradesh who was apparently depressed because of the lockdown and yearning to return home chopped off his tongue at a temple in Gujarat’s Banaskantha district on Saturday, police said.

While some reports claimed that it was a “sacrifice” to appease the goddess, police did not confirm them.

Vivek Sharma (24), a native of Morena district of Madhya Pradesh who worked as a sculptor, was found lying unconscious and covered in blood at the temple of Nadeshwari Mataji at Nadeshwari village in Sui Gam tehsil on Saturday.

“We found him holding his chopped tongue in his hand and rushed him to Sui Gam hospital,” said police sub inspector H D Parmar.

The temple where the incident took place is looked after by the Border Security Force, while Sharma worked at another temple which is 14 km away.

As per the preliminary inquiry, Sharma had become extremely homesick, and was restless ever since lockdown was imposed for containing coronavirus, banning inter-district or inter-state movement.

A local BSF official said Sharma might have thought of offering his tongue by way of sacrifice to the goddess so that circumstances changed and he could return home.

However, police said they can not ascertain what exactly happened until he recovers and his statement is recorded.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/homesick-migrant-sculptor-cuts-off-his-tongue-at-temple-in-guj.html

UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Philip

Alston has warned that significant portions of America will soon face destitution unless Congress takes “far-reaching” actions.

“Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination, and a muddled, corporate-driven, federal response [that] has failed them,” said Mr Alston, who made a fact-finding visit to the US in 2017.

He painted a grim picture of record layoffs, a weak safety net, and a government “focusing primarily on businesses and the well-off”.

On March 27, President Donald Trump signed into law a historic USD 2 trillion emergency relief package which made its way through Congress, to provide stopgap funding for workers, small businesses and industry, impacted by the need to lockdown much of the country to halt the transmission of the Covid-19.

The US must take urgent additional steps to prevent tens of millions of middle-class Americans hit by the

Covid-19 pandemic from being “plunged into poverty”, he said.

134,19-4-20,Others will revise virus death tolls like China: WHO,"The World Health Organization (WHO) said many countries would likely follow China in revising up their death counts once they start getting the coronavirus crisis under control.

Wuhan, the Covid-19 epicentre, admitted missteps in tallying its death toll, abruptly raising the city’s count by 50 per cent — following growing world doubts about Chinese transparency over the outbreak. The WHO said Wuhan had been overwhelmed by the virus, which emerged in the city in December, and the authorities had been too swamped to ensure every death and infection was properly recorded.

Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online, and there have been questions about the government’s recording of infections as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the crisis.

“This is something that is a challenge in an ongoing outbreak: to identify all of your cases and all of your deaths,” Maria van Kerkhove, the WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead, told a virtual press conference in Geneva.

“I would anticipate that many countries are going to be in a similar situation where they will have to go back and review records and look to see: did we capture all of them?”

She said the Wuhan authorities had now reviewed their databases and cross-checked for discrepancies.

Wuhan added 1,290 deaths to its number of deaths, raising the total to 3,869, and added a further 325 cases, bringing the number of infections to 50,333.

Van Kerkhove said that because Wuhan’s healthcare system was swamped, some patients died at home; others were in makeshift facilities; and that medics, focused on treating patients, therefore did not do the paperwork on time.

Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, added: “All countries will face this”.

But he urged nations to produce precise data as early as possible, “because that keeps us on top of what the impact is, and allows us to project forward in a much more accurate way.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/others-will-revise-virus-death-tolls-like-china--who.html

The report didn’t specify how many people remained under the country’s 30-day quarantine. Figures from previous state media reports suggest the North would have released close to 10,000 people over the past weeks.

The North had initially placed 380 foreigners under quarantine. The North in March arranged a special government flight to fly out dozens of diplomats to Vladivostok, Russia.

137,19-4-20,Nepal is home away from home for some stranded foreign tourists,"Nepal, which for decades has been a magnet for adventurers, thrill-seekers and mountain lovers, is now a preferred destination for some foreign tourists seeking protection from the deadly coronavirus that has been wreaking havoc across the globe.

Five foreign tourists, including an Indian doctor, have been staying together like a family at a guest house in the picturesque tourist hub of Pokhara in Western Nepal for more than three weeks as the Himalayan nation is going through a lockdown.

They were visiting the country when the lockdown was announced on March 24 and since then have been staying at Pushkar Guest House in Lakeside of Pokhara Municipality.

Talking to Nepali language online newsportal Setopati, Indian national Dr Akash Yadav says he is spending one of the “happiest moments” of his life in Pokhara during the lockdown.

Yadav, who recently joined Apollo Hospital after completing the MBBS and wanted to do Masters of Surgery at a medical college in Nepal, says he enjoys the company of other foreign travellers and feels safe in the country.

Originally from Gorakhpur, Yadav had moved to Hyderabad and arrived in Nepal just before the outbreak of the coronavirus for his admission either at Manipal Medical College in Pokhara or Institute of Medicine in Kathmandu.

Migyul is a French photographer and painter, who left his country two years ago, reached Pokhara just before lockdown after completing trekking near the Everest Basecamp.

He met Nata, a woman from Oman, in Kathmandu after returning from the trekking and the two made a plan to visit Pokhara together. The lockdown was imposed just before they were about to embark on another trekking journey to the Annapurna Basecamp from Pokhara. Now, they are waiting for the lockdonwn to end to start their journey. The two are planning to visit India after life returns to normal.

Another tourist Kiran, from Scotland, UK, had arrived in

Nepal on March 1 on a six-week visit and reached Pokhara last month for a trip.

He thinks Nepal is more safe than the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. Dyamino, who is from Italy, does not want to go back even after the lockdown ends as he feels the country has been devastated by the pandemic.

The tourists are staying like a family and the guesthouse owner has waived their expanses for one week due to the lockdown imposed in response to contain the coronavirus, leaving many tourists stranded.

Nepal on Tuesday extended the nationwide lockdown until April 27 as part of measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the country.

138,19-4-20,Dhoni arguably greatest captain ever: KP,"Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen says two-time World Cup-winning skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is arguably the greatest captain ever.

When asked, Pietersen said it would be difficult to argue against Dhoni’s greatness.

“It will be very difficult just with the weight of expectation to go against MS Dhoni because of what everybody expects from him, how he has to live his life and what he has been through captaining India and then captaining the CSK,” Pietersen, who played 104 Tests, told Star Sports.

India tasted huge success under Dhoni, winning the 2007 World T20 and the 2011 World Cup at home.

India also won the 2013 Champions Trophy under the Jharkhand dasher, who has not played any international cricket since India’s semi final exit from the ODI World Cup last July.

Dhoni, who has also been leading IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, has been a successful captain there also, winning the cash-rich T20 league thrice in 2010, 2011 and 2018.

Meanwhile, former India batsman Gautam Gambhir, who led Kolkata Knight Riders to two IPL titles in 2012 and 2014, believes that the franchise could have added another one or two titles if they had got swashbuckling West Indian all-rounder Andre Russell earlier than it did.

Russell, known for hitting towering sixes, was the player of the series in 2019, when Mumbai Indians clinched their fourth title.

“Imagine (Andre) Russell going for Rs 50 Lakhs to KKR and Pawan Negi for Rs 8 crore to (Delhi) Daredevils. I probably wished that he would have been there for 7 years when I was playing we would have certainly won one or two more,” said the former left-handed batsman.

Russell made his IPL debut with Delhi Daredevils in 2012. But sparse chances and injuries restricted his number of games to a handful for the first two editions.

Before 2014 edition, he was roped in by KKR. But he could feature in only a couple of games in that season. However, the tide changed for good in 2015 and it saw Russell score 326 runs at an astounding strike-rate of 192. He also starred with the ball and picked up 14 wickets.

The 2016 edition saw him perform predominantly with the ball as he picked 15 wickets besides scoring 188 runs. KKR made it to the play-offs but failed to make it to the finale.

After serving a one-year ban, the West Indies all-rounder ended up with 13 wickets and more than 300 runs in the 2018 season. In the last season, Russell scored a massive tally of 510 runs besides picking up 11 wickets.

In total, Russell has so far played 64 IPL matches in which he has scored 1,400 runs and picked up 55 wickets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-arguably-greatest-captain-ever--kp.html
139,19-4-20,"FPIs pull out Rs 12,650 cr in April amid COVID-19 turbulence","Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have withdrawn a net Rs 12,650 crore from the Indian capital markets in April so far amid the coronavirus crisis.

Between April 1 to 17, FPIs pulled out a net sum of Rs 3,808 crore from equities and Rs 8,842 crore from the debt segment, the depositories data showed.

The total net outflow stood at Rs 12,650 crore.

However, April has been a tad better compared to March, when overseas investors had withdrawn a record Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian markets (both equity and debt).

The quantum of net outflows has significantly slowed down, at least from equities, said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.

""Out of eight trading days so far in the holiday truncated month, FPIs were net buyers in the Indian equity markets in four,"" he said.

Citing the reason for net inflows on some days in April, Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww, said ""global markets are becoming more stable. The general belief is that the virus has peaked in many parts of Europe which is aiding the sentiments of global investors. The oil deal between OPEC and Russia is also contributing to the relatively more stable markets.""

According to Srivastava, the widespread concern among foreign investors about slowdown in the global economy due to the COVID-19 outbreak has been keeping them on the tenterhooks.

He added that slowdown in the quantum of net outflows in April does not indicate a change in the trend at this juncture as the underlying environment continues to be negative.

However, he said this could be a result of India gaining prominence among foreign investors for doing well with regards to containing the pandemic.

In addition to that, measures announced by the government and the RBI periodically to revitalise the sagging economy would also be resonating well with investors. The sharp fall in the markets has also provided investors an opportunity to invest at relatively attractive levels, he said.

Going forward, Srivastava cautioned that ""there lies a bumpy ride ahead.""

In such times of uncertainty, FPIs would continue to adopt a measured approach when it comes to investing in emerging markets like India. With low risk appetite, they would continue to drift towards safer investment avenues and safe havens such as USD and gold, he said.

Most of the airlines had chalked out their plans to resume services from April 15 in expectation that the lockdown will be lifted.

""We may, however, have to extend the period of 'leave without pay' for further term, if so required,"" the airline said.

An official, however, said about 10 per cent of the 5,500-odd employees, who are crucial for certain tasks even when there is no operation, continue to work and will be paid partial salary.

We are hopeful that the skies will reopen from May 4 and we will resume operations in a phased manner. Meanwhile, the airline also said it is working towards building its ability to scale up operations in the new environment and market conditions that would emerge going forward.

142,19-4-20,"For Milan nurse, virus patients enter her soul","The coronavirus brings with it forced isolation: Family members can’t visit hospitalized patients. Nursing homes bar their doors to outsiders. People with mild cases or who have been in contact with infected persons must stay in quarantine.

Cristina Settembrese spends her days caring for COVID-19 patients in a hospital ward, and when she goes home, her personal isolation begins by her own choice.

The 54-year-old has been a nurse since she was 18. Two months ago, the infectious disease ward where she works at San Paolo Hospital in Milan started treating only COVID-19 patients. Suddenly, she had to learn how to operate machines she likens to “helmets” to help patients breathe. She studied the operating instructions at home in a kind of self-taught cram course.

While patients with coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.

Two days after Italy’s first confirmed case in late February, Settembrese sent her 24-year-old daughter, Rebecca, from their home in the Milan suburb of Basiglio to live with her sister. The nurse was worried she might inadvertently infect her daughter.

She chats with Rebecca, who leans over a first-floor balcony, whenever Settembrese can pass by. A single parent, her only companion now in her apartment is her chihuahua, Pepe, who gets bundled in a faux leopard-skin coat for a walk.

On her way to the hospital eight kilometers (five miles) away, Settembrese stops at her parents’ bakery. From the sidewalk, Settembrese waves to her mother with a rubber-gloved hand. Her mother makes treats for her co-workers, among them a casatiello, a kind of braided bread studded with eggs and salami that’s a specialty of her parents’ native Naples.

Walking Pepe and chatting with fellow dog owners at a safe distance “is my only social life,” Settembrese says. The northern region of Lombardy is the area of Italy with the country’s most cases and deaths.

But Settembrese speaks of her new family — her patients and colleagues — with whom she has forged bonds in these past fraught weeks.

The patients “live their life alone. Sometimes they die alone,’’ Settembrese says.

Before she leaves work for the night, she reviews with her colleagues how the patients are faring. Not just how well they are breathing but whether they feel angry or distraught because relatives have died from COVID-19.

Once off-duty, the nurses call each other to ask how their patients are doing.

“We feel a little like we’re their family,” Settembrese says. “They are patients who enter into your soul.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/for-milan-nurse--virus-patients-enter-her-soul.html
143,19-4-20,"Govt took timely action to contain virus as cases rise to 7,638: Pak PM","Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Saturday that his government took timely action, including an early lockdown, to contain the spread of coronavirus, even as the country reported 622 fresh cases taking the total number of COVID-19 patients to 7,638.

“The government enforced a lockdown in March when there were only a few cases. We also started screening people at airports and pilgrims returning through land borders,” Khan said while addressing the media in Islamabad.

He, however, warned that numbers could increase by the middle of next month to pose a challenge for the Government.

“Our initial projections said that we would have 50,000 cases by April 25. Thankfully that’s not the case. Our new projections suggest that we will have 12,000 to 15,000 coronavirus patients.

144,19-4-20,Thousands attend cleric’s funeral despite lockdown in B’desh,"Tens of thousands of people attended the funeral of a top Islamic cleric in Bangladesh on Saturday, defying a nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 84 patients and infected 2,144 others.

Mawlana Jubayer Ahmed Ansari, 55, who was the nayeb-e-ameer (deputy) of Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish, died at Bertala village in Sarail upazila on Friday night. His funeral was held at a local madrasa, which thousands of people from different areas, including Dhaka, attended, flouting government directives and risking their lives, the Dhaka Tribune reported.

“About 50,000 people attended his funeral on Saturday morning, defying the government’s strict social distancing rule,” the paper said, citing locals. The incident took place just days after the government announced that the entire country was at risk of succumbing to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 154,800 people worldwide. The huge gathering at the funeral drew criticism from locals as well as citizens from different parts of the country through social media.

“The funeral was arranged at a time when the government has prohibited gatherings to ensure social distancing in order to curb coronavirus transmission,” said Al Mamun Sarkar, member of the district’s coronavirus control and prevention committee.

The district’s Civil Surgeon Dr Ekram Ullah said: “It is my beyond imagination how a large number of people could take part in the funeral when people have been told to say prayers inside their homes, and not go to mosques, to contain the pandemic.”

When asked, a local police officer said, “We did not think the gathering would be this big. Police could not do anything as the situation was out of control because of the massive gathering.”

Additional Superintendent of Police Md Alamgir Hossain said they had asked the madrasa authorities to maintain social distancing and ensure all preventative steps during the funeral.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/thousands-attend-cleric---s-funeral-despite-lockdown-in-b---desh.html
145,19-4-20,"Worldwide death toll rises to 1,57,669","Coronavirus deaths have surged past 1,50,000 worldwide with nearly a quarter of them in the United States, where President Donald Trump lent his support to protesters rallying against lockdown orders.

A total of 1,57,669 deaths have been reported among the 2,287,369 cases.

Evidence is mounting that social distancing successfully slowed the pandemic after more than half of humanity — 4.5 billion people — were confined to their homes.

Governments around the world are now grappling with when and how to ease lockdowns that have crippled the global economy, even as the Covid-19 death toll climbs further in hard-hit countries.

The United States accounts for nearly a third of the 2.25 million coronavirus infections reported globally. It has also recorded over 37,000 deaths, more than any other nation, followed by Italy, Spain and France which have all been ravaged by their own outbreaks.

Many countries are testing only the most serious cases and the number of confirmed global cases is likely only a fraction of the true total.

Virtually no corner of the world has been left untouched, with deaths in Africa passing 1,000. Nigeria announced the death of President Muhammadu Buhari’s top aide on Saturday, the highest-profile person to succumb to the virus in Africa’s most populous nation.

Meanwhile, many of the world’s 260 million Orthodox Christians are preparing to mark Easter without attending church services. The Russian Orthodox Church has asked the faithful to celebrate at home, even though many places or worship will remain open. Services in Turkey will be closed to the public and broadcast on the internet.

In Zimbabwe, celebrations and mass rallies to mark the country’s 40th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule were cancelled.

China sharply raised its death toll to 4,636 on Friday after adding another 1,290 fatalities for the city of Wuhan, where the respiratory disease first emerged late last year.

Trump, who has angrily shot back at claims he reacted too slowly to the virus threat, has accused Beijing of downplaying the impact of the virus within its borders.

“It is far higher than that and far higher than the US, not even close!” he tweeted.

Trump did not offer evidence to back the claim, but pressure has mounted in recent days on Beijing to come clean over its handling of the initial outbreak.

Leaders in France and Britain have also questioned China’s management of the crisis but Beijing hit back, saying it had not concealed information about the illness.

Signs that the outbreak could be easing in parts of Europe prompted Switzerland, Denmark and Finland to begin reopening shops and schools this week.

Germany’s health minister said Friday that the virus was “under control after 3,400 deaths in his country, which is now beginning the delicate task of lifting some restrictions without triggering a secondary outbreak.

Some small shops will be allowed to reopen Monday, and some children will return to school within weeks.

Parts of Italy also began emerging from lockdown, with Venice residents strolling around quiet canals.

But Spain, where the death toll topped 20,000 on Saturday, has extended its strict lockdown, while Japan, Britain and Mexico have all expanded their current movement restrictions.

Signs of the economic carnage wrought by the pandemic are mounting, with China reporting its first contraction in GDP since at least the early 1990s after several decades of breakneck growth.

The Trump administration pledged another $19 billion in relief for farmers reeling from a massive jolt to the agricultural markets with schools and restaurants shuttered across the country.

African state leaders and global financial bodies warned Friday that the continent needed tens of billions of dollars in additional funds to fight the outbreak.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/worldwide-death-toll-rises-to-1-57-669.html
146,19-4-20,‘Bowling to players like MSD gives you important insight’,"New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson said that bowling to big players like MS Dhoni gives important insight into how to bowl to others.

Anderson said that Dhoni is one of the best finishers in the game and whenever he was bowling to him in the Indian Premier League playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore, he would have senior players in his ears all the time.

“He is one of the greats of the game, one of the best finishers in the world. Very difficult to bowl to him. I had Virat Kohli at long on, AB de Villiers at long off. They were continuously running in to say what do we do, what was I thinking, what should I do,” Anderson said in a live chat with Sportstar’s Instagram.

“Even their thoughts were like ‘if you bowl here, he will hit you for a six’ and ‘if you bowl there, he will hit you for a six’. You can subdue the moment. You know that you aren’t the first one, he has done it to every bowler in the world at some point of time,” he added.

Anderson was to be part of the 2020 IPL as part of the broadcasting team after going unsold in the auctions.

“Once you bowl to those guys, it gives you a massive insight to bowl to others. You gain confidence once you bowl to these bigger guys like Dhoni. At times, it is demoralising but it can make you a better cricketer,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---bowling-to-players-like-msd-gives-you-important-insight---.html
147,19-4-20,Moeen ready to make Test return,"Moeen Ali says he is ready to return to Test action for England after a self-imposed exile from the red-ball game despite having been made to feel like “a scapegoat” in the past.

All-rounder Moeen missed the Test matches during England’s winter tours of New Zealand and South Africa after taking a spell away from the longest format of the game.

The 32-year-old, who continued to play limited overs matches for England, has been reflecting on his absence and suggested he would be willing to return to Tests if selected when cricket eventually resumes.

“I think I’d probably be ready (to play Test cricket) now, to be honest. Clearly I would have to be playing well and win a spot back on merit,” Moeen told the Guardian.

“But in terms of being available — and obviously I’m speaking hypothetically — if there was a Test match tomorrow and I got the call, I’d say yes.”

“We’re all missing cricket right now and coronavirus makes you realise what you love. It could take out the whole summer and that would be a big thing.”

Moeen was dropped after the first Test against Australia last year and admitted to feeling like a scapegoat.

“When you find yourself surrounded by a few negative comments, somehow it’s all you can focus on. You have to be mentally stronger and filter more of it out,” Moeen said.

“It’s almost been a case of forgiving anyone who has ever said anything I didn’t like and now looking to start afresh when we get back playing.

“I may have felt a scapegoat at times in the past but I’m over it now. It’s time to move on.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/moeen-ready-to-make-test-return.html
148,19-4-20,Hope BCCI figures out its own window: CPL CEO on potential IPL clash,"Caribbean Premier League (CPL) CEO Pete Russell expects the T20 league to take place as scheduled in September and hopes the BCCI figures out “its own window” for the IPL which has been indefinitely postponed.

There is a possibility that the BCCI organises the IPL in September or October and that might require rescheduling the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup.

The CPL is scheduled to run from August 19 to September 26 and can clash with the IPL.

“We wouldn’t go up against it. While I know the BCCI is all-powerful in these things, there has to be some sensible consideration around what players and other leagues are doing,” Russell told ESPNcricinfo.

“I think IPL would want all the West Indian players to be playing in their tournament — it wouldn’t make sense for them to play at the same time as CPL when a lot of their stars are playing with us. That would defeat the objective. I don’t think they need to do that, either. They can figure out their own window, for sure.”

The COVID-19 cases in the Caribbean have not been as alarming as in the US and Europe with the death toll yet to reach double figures in the six countries that host the CPL.

“It’s good that the Caribbean has locked down early, and it hasn’t been hit in the same way as the UK, for example. We’re looking at different permutations in terms of what could or couldn’t happen, but the lucky thing is that we’ve got a bit of time — we don’t have to force a decision,” Russell said.

“I don’t think there’s any question that we’ll be able to play it. We’re only going to play if it’s safe to do so, but we’ve been approached by a lot of the countries who want it to happen. The reason (for that) is that it’s a big sporting event, and it could act as a sign or a marker that the Caribbean is open for business again,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/hope-bcci-figures-out-its-own-window--cpl-ceo-on-potential-ipl-clash.html
149,19-4-20,Laxman will give online sessions to Bengal batters,"Confined to their respective homes amid a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic, Bengal cricketers will take one-on-one online sessions from their batting consultant VVS Laxman to “rectify the mistakes” that they committed during the Ranji Trophy season.

Bengal had reached the Ranji Trophy final after 13 years but their dream to lift the title for the first time since 1989-90 remained unfulfilled following a top-order batting failure, which saw Saurashtra claim their maiden crown on the basis of first innings lead.

“I spoke to our batting consultant VVS Laxman today. We will share the footages and clippings from the video analyst and there will be one-on-one sessions on how to improve further,” CAB president Avishek Dalmiya said.

“Focus will also be given especially to the top-order batsmen so that performance can be better next season.”

Avishek said Bengal video analyst Gautam Sarkar has already started preparing the video footages of the last season and the online sessions with Laxman will start in a few days’ time.

Saurashtra had amassed 425 in their first innings after electing to bat in the Ranji Trophy final. In reply, Bengal were 35/2 at one stage before being bundled out for 381, handing a title-deciding first innings lead to Saurashtra.

Opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, who had two double centuries to his credit in 2018-19, was a big let down for Bengal as he could manage just 258 runs from 17 innings at an average of 17.20.

Experienced Sudip Chatterjee also had a lacklustre outing with 170 runs from six innings (at 34.00).

Everytime the top-order failed, it was the individual brilliance of Anustup Majumdar (704 runs with two centuries and three half-centuries) that carried Bengal batting forward.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/laxman-will-give-online-sessions-to-bengal-batters.html
150,19-4-20,Spain set to finish season without fans,"Football matches and other sports events in Spain will take place in empty venues at least until the end of the summer, mayor of Madrid said on Saturday.

José Luis Martínez-Almeida told the Onda Cero radio station that the coronavirus pandemic likely “won’t be under control” by then for events with big crowds to resume normally.

“In the spring and summer there won’t be any events with crowds in Spain, and possibly not in the fall either,” Martínez-Almeida said.

“Because obviously the situation will not be fully under control. We will have to change our habits and behaviors even after being allowed to go back on to the streets.”

Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries with more than 190,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, only behind the United States. More than 20,000 have died in the European nation.

The Spanish league is not expecting to resume at least until the end of May. It is working on several scenarios, including playing without fans through the fall.

“Football matches without fans in the summer is a possibility, as long as health and safety conditions are observed,” Martínez-Almeida said.

The football federation said this week that if the league can’t resume it will use the current standings to decide the four clubs to play in the Champions League, which would mean giving the spots to Barcelona, Real Madrid, Sevilla and Real Sociedad.

The league has said the total losses for not finishing the season because of the pandemic could reach nearly 1 billion euros. ($1.1 billion). The losses if the league resumes with matches in empty stadiums would be about 300 million euros ($325 million), and if it restarts with fans it would be nearly 150 million euros ($163 million).

Martínez-Almeida also said it was a “mistake” for Atlético Madrid fans to play its Champions League game against Liverpool. Nearly 3,000 Atlético fans attended the game on March 11, just days before the Spanish government declared a state of emergency and established lockdown measures that are expected to remain in place at least until April 26.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spain-set-to-finish-season-without-fans.html
151,19-4-20,Italian football federation hopes play resumes in late May,"The Italian football federation (FIGC) said on Friday that club matches should resume “in late May, early June”, saying those advocating cancellation of the season “do not like football, or Italians”.

The president of the FIGC, Gabriele Gravina, said it would take three weeks to prepare after the end of the coronavirus lockdown in the country, currently scheduled for May 4.

“So at the end of May, early June, we can start,” he told Italian radio on Friday.

“Those who talk today about cancelling the season do not like football or Italians, because they take away hope for the future and for recovery,” Gravina said.

“There will be a monitoring period to guarantee the that all those taking part are free of the virus. If they are all negative, there is no problem of distancing or contagion,” said Gravina.

“I hope that everyone will be able to play in their own stadium, if that is not possible we will find other solutions,” he added.

“It’s a complex moment for our country, for the economy and for football, which is one of the most important industries,” he said, adding that he was confident “we will find the right way”.

According to the Italian press, Brescia and Torino are the last two clubs to openly oppose the resumption of the league.

152,19-4-20,PL return date still not clear: Brady,"West Ham chief executive Karren Brady claims the Premier League’s return date is still unclear despite hopes the top-flight season can restart in June.

The Premier League said on Friday that wrapping up the remaining 92 fixtures remains their goal, but the on-going coronavirus crisis means no fixed schedule can be drawn up yet.

Brady’s West Ham were perilously placed in the English top flight when football was suspended, sitting above the relegation zone on only goal difference with nine games remaining.

“Players will have been able to retain some physical fitness at home,” Brady wrote in her column in The Sun on Saturday.

“But if social-distancing rules are still in place, physical match-play training will not be allowed — you can’t tackle from two metres away.

“So, how match-fit will players be if the season commences, as we all hope it will, by mid-June?”

With most clubs having nine games left, it was reported that Friday’s meeting of the 20 clubs discussed finishing the season in a 40-day window.

There have been claims that clubs were told domestic seasons must end by July 31 and the 2020-21 campaign must start by the first week of September at the latest.

But Brady is adamant difficult questions over training, testing of players, hygiene and medical protocols will need to be resolved first.

She questioned how Premier League clubs could regularly test players for the virus when the same situation is not yet in place for all NHS workers.

She also highlighted a potential unfairness in some squads having a number of players in self-isolation.

“Police officers will need to be at games even if they are behind closed doors as some supporters will travel to the stadium, even if they cannot come in to watch,” she said.

“Everyone at the stadium — and even behind closed doors this is about 300-500 people — including security, staff, medical officers, players, referees and media, will have to have temperature checks, fill out health questionnaires and observe social distancing.

“Then there is the issue of injuries. All this is manageable but what if a player gets injured, where do we send him?

“It can’t be to an NHS (UK National Health Service) hospital that is already under pressure and private hospitals are carrying out NHS procedures and not taking in injured footballers. So then what?”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pl-return-date-still-not-clear--brady.html
153,19-4-20,MLS extends hiatus until ‘at least June 8’,"Major League Soccer won’t resume before June 8 the league said and is exploring multiple scenarios for completing the 2020 season.

The league is also discussing changes to player compensation because of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are seeking to work collaboratively with the MLS Players Association to find a solution that provides a safety net for all players, opportunity to earn full salary in the scenario where all matches are played with fans, and in particular provides protection for the players at the lower end of the salary scale,” the league said in a statement on Friday.

ESPN on Friday reported that the league has suggested most of its players take as much as a 50% pay cut in a shortened season — depending on how many matches must be cancelled.

Playing games without fans in attendance could also affect the extent of player paycuts, the sports site reported, although to what degree remains unknown.

“MLS remains focused on exploring a wide variety of formats for playing the entire 2020 season including pushing back the MLS Cup into December or later,” the league said on Friday.

“Based on the most recent government guidance, we have extended the moratorium on matches until at least June 8.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mls-extends-hiatus-until----at-least-june-8---.html
154,19-4-20,"MS, Rohit joint best IPL skippers","On the 13th anniversary of VIVO IPL, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his Mumbai Indians counterpart Rohit Sharma were declared joint Greatest of All Time (GOATs) captains of the IPL, whilst AB de Villiers emerged as the GOAT in the batsmen category and Lasith Malinga took away the title in the bowlers category. Shane Watson, one of CSK’s vital cog in the wheel, won the battle among the all-rounders.

Royal Challengers Bangalore and Team India captain Virat Kohli was voted the IPL’s greatest Indian batsman for being the highest scorer in the history of the tournament with 5412 runs in 177 matches at a staggering average of 37.84.

The jury was split right down the middle to make their pick on the greatest ever captain. While Dhoni shouldered the responsibility of taking the #YellowArmy to 10 playoffs out of the 11 seasons, Rohit proved to be the most successful captain pocketing 4 titles in 7 seasons for Mumbai Indians.

In the coach’s category, the calm and composed Stephen Fleming (CSK) emerged the winner as he pipped Trevor Bayliss of KKR by a small margin.

155,19-4-20,IPL’s opening night changed my life forever: McCullum,"Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum says his sizzling 73-ball 158, which set the ball rolling for IPL in its very first game 12 years ago, changed his life forever.

On April 18 in 2008, McCullum got the inaugural IPL off to a scintillating start for Kolkata Knight Riders against Royal Challengers Bangalore.

“That night, my life changed completely in the space of those three hours or actually, even an hour and a half. You talk about sliding doors, and moments in your careers and in lives,” McCullum told kkr.in.

McCullum has now reunited with the Knight Riders as their coach.

Recalling the time when he was a 26-year-old dazzler, McCullum wondered, “Why was I the one who got that opportunity to be able to go and face (the) first (delivery) with Sourav Ganguly? How did I get a chance to play in the first game, have the first opportunity to bat in such a huge tournament for world cricket?

“How was I even able to grab that opportunity? How much luck did I have along the way? Honestly, I don’t know the answers to any of these, but what I do know is that it changed my life forever.”

His score has been battered only once in 11 seasons so far, by Chris Gayle.

McCullum also recalled his then captain and opening partner Ganguly’s reaction to his incredible innings.

“Dada said, ‘Your life is changed forever,’ and I didn’t quite know what he meant at the time, but (in hindsight), I 100 percent agree with him,” McCullum said.

“Shah Rukh (Khan, the KKR co-owner), in the months which followed or the days and the weeks and the months which followed, he said, ‘you’ll always be with the Knight Riders.’”

McCullum said he never thought he would be able to pull off an innings like that.

“I couldn’t have done it without my team-mates, that’s 100 percent sure,” he said. “It was just a surreal moment in time where you just look back and say, ‘How lucky was I?’”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl---s-opening-night-changed-my-life-forever--mccullum.html

“My IPL favourite memory would be when we won the IPL in 2016. We had a very good tournament the whole way through. The best thing was we won a lot of close games which really built great momentum and great belief within the team.

“It was fantastic. That’s one thing that I will always cherish for the rest of my life. It was a great memory and one of the best,” Warner said in a video message posted by the franchise on its official Twitter handle.

Warner was the captain when Sunrisers won their maiden IPL title in 2016, defeating RCB by eight runs.

“We came up against Bangalore in Bangalore in the finals, we knew how good they were. We knew how well Virat Kohli was going, that year he scored 960 odd runs and was the highest run-scorer. Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers made a great great team.”

“For us it was about backing ourselves, our skills. Bangalore were good at chasing but we felt as a team our best attribute was defending. We had a great bowling attack led by Buvi and I felt that was the best way forward.

Carey, who was scheduled to make his IPL debut with the Ponting-coached Delhi outfit, said only time will tell whether the T20 World Cup and the IPL can happen this year.

“At this stage it’s looking likely that (IPL) might not go ahead,” Carey was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia.

“It would be nice to be in Delhi playing cricket — it was my first time selected to be part of the IPL. I’m still really positive.

“I’m sure the world will move in the way we want it to, and there’s still that hope later in the season the IPL will go ahead and the (men’s T20) World Cup (scheduled for Australia), but we’ll wait and see,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/carey-not-sure-of-ipl-happening-this-year.html
158,19-4-20,Srinath didn’t get the credit he deserved: Pollock,"Javagal Srinath spearheaded India’s pace attack in the 90s with aplomb but former South African seamer Shaun Pollock believes the Indian never got the credit he deserved.

Srinath played 67 Tests and 229 ODIs between 1991 and 2003, taking 236 and 315 wickets respectively.

“I thought India’s Javagal Srinath didn’t get the credit he deserved,” Pollock said during a Sky Sports podcast discussion with former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding and England’s Stuart Broad.

“In my era, you had great combinations like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis for Pakistan and Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh for West Indies. Australia had Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. You now have James Anderson and Stuart Broad in this era.”

Pollock, who snapped over 400 Test wickets and amassed more than 3,700 Test runs in 108 Tests, said one bowler who left an indelible mark on him early in his career was West Indian pace great Malcom Marshall.

“(Malcom) Marshall was next level and I was lucky enough to meet him early in my career as it made me think about fast bowling in a completely different way,” he said.

However, since his retirement in 2008, Pollock has been most impressed by his fellow countryman Dale Steyn, who had overtaken him as South Africa’s leading wicket taker in Tests in December, 2018.

“But since I’ve stopped playing, l cannot have enough respect for (Dale) Steyn. His ability to shape the ball upfront at high speed and then come back later and reverse it,” he said.

“He cranked it up on flat wickets and had such a good action and variations. He is something special and his stats back it up.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/srinath-didn---t-get-the-credit-he-deserved--pollock.html
159,19-4-20,"Cricket can wait, lives are at stake: Bhajji","Be it closed door matches or the currently postponed Indian Premier League, cricket should be the farthest thing from everyone’s minds amid the COVID-19 global crisis, feels ace India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.

“See cricket is the last thing on my mind at the moment. I am not even thinking about it,” Harbhajan said.

“It is not necessary to hold a cricket match. I don’t think anyone should think about sports and cricket at this hour. These are small things. Lives are at stake...understand that,” said the 39-year old off-spinner.

“Yes cricket has given us everything. Whatever I am today is because of cricket. But this is not the time to discuss cricket. I would like to talk about how we can help people,” said India’s third highest wicket-taker in Test cricket.

There are doubts over whether the T20 World Cup, to be held in Australia in October this year, would take place or not. Harbhajan said, keeping the situation in mind, a World Cup or an IPL can wait for a year.

“One IPL, one World Cup...what difference will it make if it does not happen this year? But if these things go on, our lives will be finished.

“I know I am not in my 20s anymore but even if I was...I would have said the same thing,” said the 103-Test veteran who has also played 236 ODIs and 28 T20s in a career spanning almost two decades.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cricket-can-wait--lives-are-at-stake--bhajji.html

“I feel he is a package — to learn and to show what is cricket. He is a pure batsman. If he is batting, you will get to learn a lot,” said Shami.

He said that bowlers get to learn from bowling to Rohit. “He (Rohit) will hit bowlers, and you get to learn. If you are a batsman, you get to see how much time he has to play a shot. You will also see how to bat in different conditions. He is a next level batsman. He is the best package,” he said.

Pathan said that he feels while watching Rohit play that he is not a cricketer but “a poet.”

“Sometimes, while I am commentating and watching Rohit Sharma play, I feel he is not a cricketer, but a poet. He bats as smooth as butter, like a poem. The bowlers don’t even realise that he is slamming, and he keeps on slamming,” he said.

161,19-4-20,Sir Alex wanted Ronaldo to go Barca,"Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo’s 90 million Euro transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid in 2009 is seen as a landmark moment in both clubs’ history.

While for Real Madrid it marked the beginning of the career of a player at the Santiago Bernabeu who would become their all time highest goalscorer, for United, it marked the end of the team that many regard as the best Alex Ferguson had assembled in his 26-year-long reign at Old Trafford.

Ronaldo’s transfer saga was however one that stretched on for a long time. Ferguson’s disdain for Real Madrid’s tendency to pay exorbitant fees to buy the biggest player in the world is one that he never attempted to hide and it is reported that he was even ready to sell Ronaldo to Real’s arch-rivals Barcelona just to ensure that anyone but the Madrid giants would get his star forward.

According to AS, Real Madrid had reportedly agreed to pay Ronaldo’s 75 million Euro-payout clause and Ferguson flew to Portugal to cut off Madrid’s bid directly. The Spanish newspaper then says that Ferguson went on to contact Barcelona and encourage them to make a bid for Ronaldo.

In the end, however, Ferguson knew of Ronaldo’s desire to join Real and this was key in the transfer to go through.

Ronaldo’s fee was a record that stood for four years until Real broke it again to buy Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur. Unlike many other players who have struggled to justify their record transfer fees however, Ronaldo would go on to become one of the greatest players in the club’s history. His tally of a mind numbing 451 goals in just 438 appearances makes him the highest goalscorer overall in the club’s history. He is also the all-time highest goalscorer for them in LaLiga and the Champions League.

Ronaldo and Ferguson have expressed their admiration for each other a number of times in the years since. Ronaldo has called Ferguson his father in footballing terms while Ferguson rated Ronaldo as one of four players he managed that he considers truly world-class along with Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Eric Cantona.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sir-alex-wanted-ronaldo-to-go-barca.html
162,19-4-20,Dhoni's ploy of recruiting international captains helped CSK: Faf,"In recruiting international captains who can be part of the leadership group, Mahendra Singh Dhoni ensured Chennai Super Kings always had better chances of getting success in the Indian Premier League (IPL), feels former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.

""A great thing that CSK has done over the years, and that's credit to MS and (Stephen) Fleming the coach, is they have targeted captains - (Brendon) McCullum, myself, (Dwayne) Bravo, obviously MS, (Suresh) Raina's captained a bit - because they want thinking cricketers,"" the 35-year-old told CSK's website.

""So, there's a lot of leaders within group, that experience of thinking cricketers is what they want and obviously it has proven to be very successful,"" he added.

CSK has been a part of 10 out of 12 seasons of IPL and have never finished below the semi-finals or play-offs.

""Chennai Super Kings is a great franchise to be a part of. MS has got such strong leadership. He leaves a massive hole when he's not on the field,"" the former South Africa skipper said, heaping praise on Dhoni.

Du Plessis also spoke about his passion for fielding, adding the team had a few very good fielders. ""I love going to positions on the field where the ball goes all the time. We are lucky at CSK that we got a few very good fielders. Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) is incredible, he has got the strongest arm in world cricket. Jaddu wants them to try and run. He jogs to the ball because he knows if you run, you are out,"" he added.

The 2020 IPL season, scheduled to begin on March 29, has been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""The IPL, both for players and fans around the world, has become an integral part of the season. I was really looking forward to it this year,"" he said.

165,19-4-20,Coronavirus crisis 'biggest invisible war'; Armed forces and military assets adequately protected: Rajnath,"India has put in place a robust mechanism to insulate the three services and their strategic assets from the coronavirus infection, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday, assuring that the military is fully prepared to defend the the country from ""adversarial forces"" though it was fighting the pandemic.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, Singh said the fight against the pandemic is the ""biggest invisible war"" in last several decades and India is acting on a war footing with proper coordination among all agencies concerned and support of people.

He said the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force are strictly adhering to instructions issued by the Prime Minister's Office, the Health Ministry and their own medical bodies for protection against COVID-19.

""The fight against COVID-19 is possibly the biggest invisible war in our lifetime. A war against humanity and having various impact on health and economic security of the nation,"" he said.

""We as a nation are fighting the COVID-19 crisis on a war footing and all agencies of the government are working in close coordination. The armed forces are assisting the nation in its fight against coronavirus,"" Singh said.

Asked whether the pandemic has impacted operational aspects of the military, Singh said they are prepared for all contingencies and ready to defend India's sovereignty from adversarial forces in all scenarios.

Referring to the situation along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, the defence minister said India is dominating the enemy through targeted intelligence-based strikes on their launch pads.

""The Indian armed forces are prepared for all contingencies and I can assure you that we are prepared to defend our sovereignty from adversarial forces in all scenarios,"" he said.

His assertion comes amid apprehension about possible impact of the pandemic on the armed forces, particularly after 26 Indian Navy sailors were infected by the virus in the first such large-scale case of infection in the Indian military.

""As you would have gathered from the operations along the LoC (Line of Control) in the last two weeks, we are dominating the enemy through targeted intelligence based strikes on their launch pads and eliminating them before they set foot on Indian soil,"" the defence minister said.

Pakistan has been resorting to widespread ceasefire violations along the LoC at a time when India has been leading efforts to help the SAARC member nations in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.

The Army has been adequately responding to Pakistani ""misadventures"" under its policy of ""hot pursuit"", a military official said.

On the role of armed forces in containing coronavirus pandemic, the defence minister said expertise of armed forces in communications, supply chain management, medical support and engineering are being used to combat it.

He also said that the government has directed leading defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) to produce medical equipment like ventilators, masks, PPEs and other equipment to address the problem of shortages.

Singh said armed forces are taking measures like curtailing movement of troops, restricting leave and enforcing work from home to prevent spread of infection.

A mandatory 14-day quarantine period is being enforced for all personnel coming from outside any station, irrespective of rank, he added.

He said special precautions are being taken on ships and submarines where it is difficult to strictly follow social distances norms.

Soldiers deployed along borders, especially in remotest regions, are safest as they are cut-off from all likely carriers of disease, he said, adding the government is ensuring their safety by deploying fresh troops who have been medically validated as having no symptoms of the infection.

In a video message, he also said that industries which are ready to provide accommodation to their workers during the lockdown will be given food grain supply and permission for raw material from the state.

168,19-4-20,26 Navy men test +ve in Mumbai,"Sailors along with INS Angre quarantined

In one of the biggest cases so far in the armed forces, at least 26 naval personnel tested positive for Covid-19 at the Western Naval Command, Mumbai. Taking urgent steps to contain the spread of the pandemic, the Navy along with other authorities quarantined the sailors along with INS Angre, the shore-based naval establishment where the cases were detected.

The Army has so far reported eight cases, including two doctors and all the affected are now under treatment and recovering.

Giving details of the cases reported from the Navy, which are the first for the service, officials said on Saturday this number includes 20 sailors of INS Angre. Most of these are asymptomatic and have been traced to a single sailor who tested positive on April 7.” INS Angre is the shore-based logistics and administrative support establishment of the Western Naval Command in Mumbai.

All the sailors reside in the same accommodation block at INS Angre and all primary contacts, though asymptomatic, were tested for Covid-19, the Navy said. Following this, entire living block was immediately put under quarantine and INS Angre too is under lockdown and all actions as per established Covid-19 protocol are being taken. “There are no cases of infection onboard ships and submarines,” the Navy added.

So far among the three Services, the Army had reported eight positive cases, of whom two are doctors and one nursing assistant. “Four others are responding well to treatment and we had one case in Ladakh, he is now coronavirus free and has rejoined duty,” Army Chief Gen Manoj Naravane said on Friday.

Early this month, in a video message to the rank and file, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh said the challenge is not over yet and it is only going to intensify in days and weeks ahead and outlined the priorities one of which was to ensure that operational assets, specifically ships and submarine, remain free from the virus. “It is a very difficult task because physical distancing onboard ships and especially submarines are very tough… but physically we will maintain the required distance of six feet,” he had stated.

His exhortation came days after navies of the US and France fell prey to the pandemic with their aircraft carriers Roosevelt and Charles De Gaulle respectively reporting number of positive cases among the sailors. While the French ship reported over 1,000 positive cases, the US aircraft carrier also saw nearly the same number of such cases. In fact, the captain of the US warship later resigned.

Meanwhile, the Navy said in the wake of the cases that their warships continue to be mission-deployed in three dimensions, with all the networks and space assets functioning optimally. The Navy remains combat-ready, mission-capable and is in full readiness to partake in the national mission to fight the pandemic as well as to provide support to our friendly-neighbours in the strategically vital Indian Ocean Region(IOR).

Highlighting some of the operational deployments, officials said the warships continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Straits of Malacca in the East to Bab-el-Mandeb in the West, including undertaking Operation Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in Gulf of Aden.

As regards the cases, they said the detection of these Covid-19 cases was a result of meticulous contact tracing and aggressive screening/testing carried out by Western Naval Command after one sailor tested positive on April 7.

All these sailors continue to remain asymptomatic and are being monitored at INHS Asvini, under the care of the best medical professionals.

Since the sailor was tested positive for Covid-19, the entire premises of the unit have been sealed off. Containment zones and buffer areas have been designated and frequent disinfection continues to be carried out as per protocol to contain spread by breaking the chain of transmission.

All other areas within naval premises have been under strict lockdown and stringent quarantine and safety protocols have been enforced for personnel and their families, with door-to-door screening being undertaken for identification of cases, if any.

All missions for coastal and offshore security continue as before. Operational units are being maintained in readiness by following a 14-day quarantine routine to meet immediate contingencies, including assistance to civil authorities and friendly maritime neighbours.

Several quarantine facilities have been set up in naval premises at Mumbai, Goa, Kochi and Visakhapatnam for use by our countrymen. Last week, a batch of 44 piilgrims from the Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir who were quarantined at the naval facility in Mumbai after returning from Iran, returned to their homes fully satisfied with the care and comfort they received from the Indian Navy. Naval aircraft have undertaken many missions flying supplies and personnel aiding State Governments.

169,19-4-20,CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers to begin in Sept,"South American qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, will begin in September, the region’s governing body CONMEBOL has said.

Last month, CONMEBOL asked FIFA to delay the start of the qualification campaign as the first two rounds of matches at the end of March could not be played due to football being suspended on the continent.

“For the moment, the start fixed by (FIFA) for its celebration is September 4-8 in the format already established,” said CONMEBOL on Friday.

All 10 teams are due to play each other home and away in a round robin format. That amounts to 18 matches, far more than most other continental federations organize.

The first two rounds need to be rearranged but CONMEBOL said any new dates would have to be ratified by FIFA.

And with the Copa America being postponed until next year, the opportunities to fit in an extra two rounds of matches appear few.

As it is, two rounds of World Cup qualifiers are due to be played on June 3 and 8, 2021, with the Copa now set to begin on June 11.

Meanwhile, CONMEBOL said that no restart date could yet be fixed for its flagship club competitions, the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana.

However, it reiterated its “determination” to complete the 2020 editions of both tournaments — the South American equivalents of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/conmebol-world-cup-qualifiers-to-begin-in-sept.html
170,19-4-20,Rashid reveals 2023 WC ambition,"Adil Rashid has said it would be “lovely” to play in the 2023 World Cup even though the leg-spinner will have turned 35 by the time England defend their title.

Persistent shoulder trouble has been a problem for Rashid, who needed pain-killing injections while helping England win their first men’s World Cup title on home soil last year.

Nevertheless, Rashid told reporters in a conference call on Saturday: “My aim is to play for England as long as possible.

“We don’t know how long that could be. Months, years, or whatever it is

“I have a vision in terms of maybe achieving that, the 2023 World Cup would be lovely.

“If I stay fit, if my shoulder gets stronger then I can hopefully play for a long time.”

The Yorkshireman was an ever-present during last year’s World Cup, although his 11 tournament wickets came at an expensive average of 47.81 apiece.

But even though he wasn’t fully fit, “top-drawer” England captain Eoin Morgan never lost faith in his leg-spinner.

“He knew the shoulder wasn’t great, but he kept backing me,” said Rashid.

“I went in there with a strong mindset and did a decent job. That shows when I am 100 percent everything else will hopefully work out better.”

Rashid has, however, repeatedly taken important wickets, a quality he demonstrated again as he won the man-of-the-match award for a return of three for 52 against South Africa in Johannesburg in February that included Temba Bavuma and Quinton de Kock.

‘Turning point’

And with the next World Cup set to be played in India, where pitches traditionally favour spinners, Rashid could be an even greater threat.

“South Africa was a big turning point for me,” he said. “In South Africa the shoulder was stronger.”

Looking ahead, Rashid said the fact all senior cricket worldwide was currently suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak had not led him to change his mind about remaining a white-ball specialist should the 2020 English season get underway.

But Rashid, a veteran of 19 Tests, said he would “reassess” in September, leaving open the possibility of a bid for a place in England’s squad for the 2021/22 Ashes in Australia.

“If I don’t make that decision of playing red-ball and just sticking to white-ball then there’s no Ashes or whatever for me.

“But if I do, and I’m fully fit then that’s something that I could look towards but that’s something that I’ve got to earn.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rashid-reveals-2023-wc-ambition.html

Djokovic triumphed in Paris, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 to capture his first and only French Open title.

On Friday, Murray and Djokovic shared an Instagram Live chat where they discussed a rivalry which began in childhood and is still going strong in their early 30s.

“If I could change one result, I obviously would have loved to win the Australian Open or the French Open, but as a challenge for me, because clay was such a tough surface for me throughout my career,” Murray told the world number one during the link-up.

“Just in the terms of the way I played on clay it was the hardest one for me to adapt to.

“That would have been my biggest achievement for me if I would have won the French.

“Australia has been pretty painful for me thanks to you over the years. If I could change one I would take the French Open off you.”

Djokovic has long had the upper hand on Murray.

He leads their head-to-head 25-11 and has 17 Grand Slam titles to the Briton’s three.

However, Murray does possess two Olympic Gold medals from London in 2012 and Rio in 2016.

He defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals in London on his way to the title.

“I felt like a played well overall, but you beat me in the London Olympics in the semis, 7-5, 7-5,” Djokovic said.

“I still felt like we both played very well, I felt the quality of the match was pretty good, you were just better in the decisive moments of the sets.

“Of course I was devastated when I lost because it was Olympic Games, but I was happy with the way I played.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/murray-haunted-by-2016-roland-garros-final-loss-to-djokovic.html
173,19-4-20,"Remaining I-League matches cancelled, Bagan champions","The remaining 28 matches of the I-League will be cancelled due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown and Mohun Bagan will be officially declared as the champions, the committee running the league decided on Saturday.

The I-League panel, which met via a video conference, made the recommendation to the All India Football Federation’s executive committee not to resume the I-League in view of the nationwide lockdown, which will remain in force till May 3.

It will now just be a formality for the AIFF executive committee to endorse the recommendation of the I-League committee.

“The committee recommended that the 2019-20 season be deemed to be concluded. That Mohun Bagan be declared as the Hero I-League champion for the 2019-20 season as they stand atop current standings in the Hero I-League until the point of suspension on March 14, 2020,” the AIFF said in a statement.

Mohun Bagan have already clinched the title with four rounds left to be played with 39 points from 16 matches before the AIFF suspended the I-League on March 14 on the directives of the government.

There was a three-way race among East Bengal, Minerva Punjab (both on 23 points from 16 matches) and Real Kashmir (22 points from 15 matches) for the runners-up slot before the I-League was suspended.

“Mohun Bagan with 39 points from 16 matches enjoy a point difference which is insurmountable by any other team even if all other matches had been played and concluded as a normal course of action,” the I-League Committee said.

“With regards to the remaining clubs, and noting the concerns expressed by many of them in writing, the League Committee recommended the remaining prize money (apart from the champion’s prize money) be equally divided among the remaining 10 participating clubs.”

The committee also recommended that there be no relegation from the I-League 2019-20 season, in a huge relief for the likes of Aizawl FC and Neroca FC.

At the time of suspension of the league, Indian Arrows were at the bottom of the 11-team heap, while Neroca (19 points from 17 matches) and Aizawl FC (16 points from 15 matches) were at ninth and 10th, respectively.

Indian Arrows, the developmental side of the AIFF, will not be relegated in any case.

Regarding the second division league, the committee said it will “wait for approval over regulatory matters from AIFF Executive Committee and Asian Football Confederation to understand the feasibility of organising a shorter duration tournament next season for qualification to I-League 2020-21”.

The committee also recommended to abandon the various youth leagues for which nearly 500 matches are yet to completed as the panel felt it would be an injustice for kids and youth players to be compromising with social distancing.

AIFF senior vice president Subrata Dutta chaired the meeting, which was also attended by general secretary Kushal Das and I-League CEO Sunando Dhar, among others.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/remaining-i-league-matches-cancelled--bagan-champions-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/remaining-i-league-matches-cancelled--bagan-champions.html
174,19-4-20,Messi a level above Ronaldo: David Beckham,"Former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham rates Barcelona's Lionel Messi higher than Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo succeeded Beckham as Manchester United's no.7 before arriving at Real Madrid two years after the England captain left the Spanish giants.

Beckham has also experience of playing against a young Lionel Messi in the latter's initial years with Barcelona and faced him once while he was playing for Paris St Germain.

""He [Messi] is alone in his class as a player, it is impossible that there is another like him,"" Beckham told Telam. ""He, like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not at his level, are both above the rest.""

Beckham recalled his last match against Barcelona in the quarter-final of the 2013 Champions League. PSG were ahead at one stage at Camp Nou when Messi came on as a substitute. Eventually, Pedro scored and Barca went through on the away goals rule.

""We were leading before Messi came in, and once he came in, Barcelona scored,"" Beckham said. He was 37 years old by then and ended his illustrious playing career at the end of the season but Beckham said that he did not enjoy losing that tie.

""Although I enjoyed playing at that level at my age, I do not like to lose. Our team played well. In both matches, we did things we should be proud of. We didn't lose against Barcelona, and that is something that should motivate us,"" he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/messi-a-level-above-ronaldo--david-beckham-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/messi-a-level-above-ronaldo--david-beckham.html
175,19-4-20,Serena Williams'' coach and Nadal planning matches at academies,"Both Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou announced plans to stage matches at their tennis academies.

With top-level professional tennis shut down until at least July 13, both academies said they were examining the possibility of staging and broadcasting matches so fans could watch remotely.

While the Rafael Nadal academy, based on the Spanish island of Mallorca, said on its website that it was in talks with the ATP on how to proceed, Mouratoglou released a statement unveiling a planned ""league"" of 50 matches at his academy near Nice in the south of France and talking of ""millions of US dollars in prize money"".

The Nadal Academy said it was considering becoming ""a campus where elite players can reside, train and compete between themselves in matches that will be televised so that fans around the world can enjoy them.""

It said Nadal had originated the idea and that the academy had been in taks with ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi.

""Right now tennis takes a back seat and the most important thing is everyone's health, but if in the coming months the Academy can be used to help other professional players, I'd be delighted if they could come to train and also to compete,"" Nadal said.

""I think that competing among ourselves would help us maintain our game for when the tour restarts.""

The academy has hosted a Challenger Tour event, the Rafa Nadal Open, as well as other lower-ranked and junior tournaments.

Mouratoglou's statement said he was planning 10 closed-door matches to be broadcast live at his academy on each of five weekends under the title ""Ultimate Tennis Showdown"".

The competition will start on the weekend of May 16 with a match between world number 10 David Goffin and 20-year-old Australian Alexei Popyrin, who is training at the academy and whose father reportedly came up with the idea.

The lineup for later matches has yet to be decided.

The statement posted on social media said that the ""UTS aims to reinvent the way tennis is usually experienced and consumed.""

On-court coaching and video coaching would be allowed and, said the statement, fans watching remotely would be able to interact in real time with the players, listen to conversations between the players and their coaches.

Mouratoglou said that the competition will be ""player-centric"" could be ""particularly beneficial to lower-ranked players.""

The lockdown in France is scheduled to end on May 11, which means players will be able to travel, although mass events will still be banned, so no spectators would be allowed.

The Spanish government on Saturday proposed extending its lockdown until May 9.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/serena-williams---coach-and-nadal-planning-matches-at-academies-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serena-williams---coach-and-nadal-planning-matches-at-academies.html

The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases includes 12,746 active cases, 2,271 cured and discharged cases, and 519 deaths, according to data collected from the State Governments till 11 pm on Saturday.

The Union Health Ministry also added that the RT-PCR test will be the standard frontline test for Covid-19 diagnosis and the rapid antibody test will be used for surveillance in hotspots. On Friday, at least 5 lakh rapid antibody tests kits arrived here from two Chinese companies. Delhi and Rajasthan are among the States that have been given the rapid antibody test kits. The ICMR has recommended the use of antibody rapid testing for Covid-19 in high containment zones as a surveillance tool rather than an early diagnostic tool.

“After seven days of a person being infected, this antibody test would indicate the patient’s immunity. If someone turns out to be positive in this test, it means they have a strong immunity to fight the virus,’’ as per the ICMR.

As many as six States have recorded 1,000 plus positive cases with Maharashtra at the top. The other States are Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.

Maharashtra topped the charts with 3,648 cases and 211 deaths followed by Delhi with 1,707 coronavirus cases and 42 deaths.

Madhya Pradesh is third on the list with 1,402 Covid-19 cases and 69 deaths, followed by Gujarat which has 1,376 cases and 53 deaths. Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu occupy fifth and sixth spots.

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary Health Ministry said at a Press briefing here that 83 per cent cases had co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases while 75.3 per cent people who succumbed to the viral infection are above 60 years.

He said giving details on the age profile of the deceased: “14.4 per cent people are in 0 to 45 years age group; 10.3 per cent people are in 45-60 years age group; 33.1 per cent are in the 60-75 years age group; and 42.2 per cent are from 75 years and above age group.”

“If lockdown and social distancing norms are not followed, then the entire country would have to face the consequences,” said Agarwal adding that in the last 24 hours, the country saw 991 fresh Covid-19 cases and 43 deaths. Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu have reported the highest number of cases.

He also added that 47 districts in 23 States have shown positive trends in the fight against coronavirus outbreak in the country. “One district each in Puducherry and Karnataka has not reported any positive coronavirus case yet along with 22 new districts, split across various States, have also not reported new cases in the last 14 days,” added Agarwal. This includes Lakhisarai, Gopalganj, Bhagalpur in Bihar, Dholpur & Udaipur in Rajasthan, Pulwama in J&K, Thoubal in Manipur, Chitradurga in Karnataka. Hoshiarpur in Punjab. Rohtak and Charkhi Dadri in Haryana and Lohit in Arunachal Pradesh.

The official said that 4,291 coronavirus cases are epidemiologically linked to the Nizamuddin Markaz event held mid-march this year. “These cases are spread across 23 States and Union Territories, which include most of the high degree burden cases -- Tamil Nadu has 84 per cent cases, Delhi 63 per cent and Assam 91 per cent, Uttar Pradesh 61 per cent and Andaman & Nicobar 83 per cent.

Family extends helping hand

Amidst the nationwide lockdown, the cast of Colors’ Choti Sarrdaarni is doing their best to keep their fans entertained. While practicing social distancing, they have been sharing their quarantine diaries on-air through small vignettes. But given the limited resources, the artists are seeking help from their family members to help them capture the sequences. While Avinesh Rekhi’s wife and kids are making all the arrangements, Nimrit Kaur’s mother is learning nuances of shooting while little Param’s parents are helping him with his dialogues.

Talking about it, Avinesh Rekhi who plays Sarabjit says: “The scenes are being shot entirely from home and hence it is little challenging to execute. You need to make sure that there is decent lighting, the space is suitable, and the camera angle is precise. But I am glad that my family is supporting me especially my kids who are extremely curious and are learning the shooting techniques. While my wife handles the camera, my little munchkins ensure the setup is ready. With everyone's involvement, things are quite enjoyable.”

Nimrit Kaur who plays Meher says: “I have great respect for our crew on sets who support us day in and day out to bring out the best. This lockdown has proved to be a great learning experience for me, and I have started valuing little things. As we are shooting from home, my mother has taken on multiple roles; she is handling the camera, helping with the setup, directing me and in all this also ensuring that I am well fed. She been a great support and is also learning something new in the process. We do have hiccups but together we manage and turn things around.”

Even when apart, the actors are staying connected with the viewers to take away their quarantine blues!

Vijayendra turns teacher

As the nation continues to be under a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are making most use of their time at home and spending it in the company of their loved ones. Actor Vijayendra Kumeria, popularly known as Dev in Naagin Bhagya Ka Zehreela Khel, is also using this opportunity and spending time with his family. The actor is especially bonding with his little daughter and making sure that she doesn't miss out on her studies. While he stays at home, he has now also turned into her tutor.

Commenting further on the same, Vijayendra said: “I have learnt to take things in a positive way. So, I am using this lockdown period by helping out my wife with her chores and helping my daughter, Kimaya, with her studies. She is an extremely smart and intuitive child and I have the most wonderful time bonding with her. I help her read stories from her books, we trace shapes and even practice writing and colouring. It's a lot of fun. Earlier, due to my hectic working hours, I used to always feel guilty that I didn't get much time to spend with them. But now, I am making up for that lost time.”

Twist in Puja-kunal’s wedding

Puja Banerjee who has been a part of various television shows and movies never would have thought in her wildest dreams that her wedding will have so many twists and turns.

180,19-4-20,Back to office days,"Most channels are re-telecasting their popular shows, Sony SAB is no different and has brought back Office Office. MUSBA HASHMI speaks with SANJAY MISHRA about the nostalgia around the show

Remember our paan-loving Shuklaji from Office Office? Many of us can never forget the har taale ki chaabi man. Travel back in time and relive the golden era of TV. Sony SAB is back with the re-run of its popular show Office Office, a satirical take on the prevalent corruption that exists in offices in the country.

With the Coronavirus taking its toll, with shootings cancelled, many channels have been left with no option but to re-telecast the timeless classics just like Doordarshan did a few weeks back. The craze of these shows is such that everyone is glued to their TV screens, waiting for their favourite show to give darshan. With so many iconic shows making a come back, how could Office Office be left out of the list.

Sanjay Mishra, who played Shukla in the series is glad that TV is going back in time and bringing back the classics. “Indian TV has never experimented with contemporary humour. The content that we are watching is a complete waste. There is no sattire at all. There are a lot of comedy shows but contemporary humour is missing. Now that Office Office is back, the home bound audience will get to see good content along with humour. What I wish is that during this lockdown phase, audience too shall evolve and look for meaningful and content-oriented shows instead of the dramas that don’t make sense. It is relieving to see this happen through the comeback of our good old shows,” Mishra, whose film Kaamyaab is all set to make its appearance on an OTT platform, says.

The exciting part for Mishra is that the audience will get to see his career graph. “Chanakaya is also back on Doordarshan, so it is an exciting phase for me wherein the audience can see my work from to A to X, won’t say Z because it is not over yet,” he tells you.

The reason why Shuklaji is engraved in people’s mind is because people have seen that characters in real life and that’s why are able to relate to it. “All of us may have come across a Shuklaji or Bhatia or for that matter Pandeyji in our life. That’s the reason why we can never forget these characters. The series definitely went off air but we kept seeing such characters in real life and that’s why Shukla can never be forgotten,” he tells you.

Just like human beings, a character too evolves with time. But for Shuklaji, this was not the case. “Actors try and add things in their characters, however when it comes to Shukla there was no scope for improvisation. Each and every line blended with the character like butter. The lines were meant for those characters. It took us sometime to understand the characters that we played but the script had everything in place and all we did was to perform our heart out infront of the camera. It also gave me a lot of confidence day by day.

“Also Shukla was not only one character — sometimes he was an officer and sometimes a peon. Most of the times I played it but whenever somone else had to play that, I was the happiest. However, every character got equal screenspace but it was just for fun that we used to eagerly wait ki bhaiyya aaj kaun chaprasi banega,” he tells you.

Recalling a typical day on the sets, Mishra tells you that it was unlike the modern times. “The TV industry works from 9 am to 9 pm. However, for us it was different. We didn’t follow the set pattern. We used to reach the sets by around 11 am and wrap the shooting by 7 pm. Timings didn’t matter for us, our focus was to complete the shot and the day’s work — no matter how long it take. It was a relaxed environment. We enjoyed our work and never took that amount of pressure. It was like a rehearsal for us and we learnt a lot from the show. What happens is intially people scare you a lot in the industry. Someone or the other will keep asking you ‘dialogue sahi se yaad hai na’ this creates a lot of pressure, but for Office Office all actors rehearsed a lot. We finished three days work in a single day. Dialogues came out of our mouth automatically, it was like we were living the characters. Today when I see other actors working for such long hours, I feel scared. They wake up early morning and work till late night. Sometimes they have to do the same kind of work for two years with no creativity at all. But for my show, we had something different to do every day. I started enjoying my show so much so that I used to wait for it to come on TV and I even felt excited to go on the sets,” Mishra tells you.

He tells you that on his first day of the shoot, all the actors went home, but he decided to stay back. “I remember on my first day, I completed my shoot and all the other actors left after completing theirs, but I stayed back on the sets. That’s when my director Rajiv Mehra saw me and he walked upto me to ask if my shot is left. I told him that I just wanted to stay back and watch him work because I was enjoying every bit of the process,” Mishra, who has a few films lined up for the year tells you.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/back-to-office-days-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/back-to-office-days.html
181,19-4-20,Experts question study linking stray dogs to SARS-CoV-2 spread,"After a study published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution proposed that stray dogs might have played a role in the initial transmission of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, some experts called the findings ""speculative"".

Some fear that the ""hypothesis"" proposed in the study may contribute to changing the attitude of people towards street animals and those who care for them. Moreover, if some people take the theory presented in the study as facts, they might even abandon their dogs.

""I do not believe that any dog owners should be concerned as a result of this work,"" said Professor James Wood, Head of Department of Veterinary Medicine at University of Cambridge in the UK.

In the study linking stray dogs to spread of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, biology Professor Xuhua Xia at the University of Ottawa in Canada traced the coronavirus signatures across different species.

""Our observations have allowed the formation of a new hypothesis for the origin and initial transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"" said Xia.

""The ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and its nearest relative, a bat coronavirus, infected the intestine of canids, most likely resulting in a rapid evolution of the virus in canids and its jump into humans. This suggests the importance of monitoring SARS-like coronaviruses in feral dogs in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.""

But several experts found the link between dogs and the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 speculative.

""The theory that SARS-CoV2 originated in dogs seems to stem from speculation about CpG and high ZAP expression. This is speculative at best and certainly isn't strong evidence for the link,"" said Professor Mick Watson, Personal Chair of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, Scotland.

Scientists have been looking for an intermediate animal host between bats, which are known to harbour many coronaviruses, and the first introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into humans, but a definite answer has so far eluded researchers.

""I am confident that answers about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still out there, somewhere in the natural world, but we have not found them yet,"" said Professor Ben Neuman, Chair of Biological Sciences at Texas A&M University-Texarkana in the US.

""The conclusion that cats or dogs were involved as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 is highly speculative, and should not be presented as fact,"" Neuman said.

182,19-4-20,Trump warns China of consequences if found responsible for COVID 19,"US President Donald Trump has warned China of consequences if it was ""knowingly responsible"" for the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Trump, who has expressed his disappointment over handling of the coronavirus disease by China, alleged non-transparency and initial non-cooperation from Beijing with Washington on this issue.

""If they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences,"" he told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday. ""You're talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody's seen since 1917.""

Trump said his relationship with China was very good till the time the deadly COVID-19 swept the world.

""The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then, all of a sudden, you hear about this. So, it's a big difference.

""You know, the question was asked would you be angry at China. Well, the answer very well might be a very resounding yes, but it depends,"" Trump said.

The president underlined that there was a big difference between a mistake that got out of control or something done deliberately.

""In either event, they should have let us go in. You know, we asked to go in very early and they didn't want us in. I think they knew it was something bad and I think they were embarrassed,"" Trump said.

He claimed that China was pitching for former vice president Joe Biden, who is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for the presidential election.

""If sleepy Joe Biden wins, China will own the United States,"" Trump said, adding that his administration had gained billions of dollars from China due to his assertive trade policies.

The president said the coronavirus crisis had hurt everybody.

""We had the greatest economy in the world by far. China isn't even close. Go back two months. And we're going to keep it that way,"" he said.

Trump asserted that Iran was now a much different country than it was before.

183,19-4-20,"France reports 642 more coronavirus deaths, total toll 19,323: official","France on Saturday reported 642 more deaths from COVID-19 in hospitals and nursing homes over the last 24 hours, but registered new falls in the total numbers of coronavirus patients in hospitals and intensive care.

The new deaths -- 364 in hospitals and 278 in nursing homes -- brought the total toll in the country from the epidemic to 19,323, the French health ministry said in a statement.

However in a continuation of a trend seen over the last days the number of coronavirus patients in hospital fell by 551 to 30,639. The numbers in intensive care meanwhile fell by 194 to 5,833.

This was the fourth consecutive day there has been a fall in the numbers in hospital and the tenth day in a row there has been a fall in the numbers in intensive care.

""The fall in the demand for equipment and human resources in intensive care is continuing, but it is still at an exceptional level, far higher than the usual level in France,"" the statement said.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic. But President Emmanuel Macron announced this week that the lockdown could begin to be eased from May 11.

Schools could gradually reopen then, he said -- but cafes, cinemas and cultural venues would remain closed, and there could be no summer festivals until mid-July at the earliest.

184,19-4-20,UP students’ evacuation from Kota injustice to poor: Nitish,"Bihar CM calls move lockdown violation, questions why labourers left out

The Uttar Pradesh Government’s move to bring back 8,000 students in 400 buses from Kota in Rajasthan to the State on Saturday during the nationwide lockdown has triggered strong protest from neighbouring Bihar.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar termed it as a gross violation of lockdown and said it is injustice to the migrant workers who are not allowed to return to their States. A senior Bihar Minister asked the Centre to remove all barriers imposed to enforce the lockdown.

The UP Government’s decision to send buses to ferry students comes after a large number of stranded students took to social media requesting for help. Many shared that they did not have the money to even pay their hostel fees as the lockdown was extended till 3 May. The UP Government’s decision came days after the Bihar Government refused to take its students back.

Citicising the Yogi Government, Bihar CM said, “This is injustice as the poor, migrant labourers are not being allowed to move in same way. Students studying in Kota come from well-to-do families and most of them live with their families in Kota. Getting the students back home during the lockdown is injustice towards the labourers. It is also violation of the lockdown. When the labourers moved from Delhi in March that was also a violation of the lockdown.”

Incidentally, the UP Government had also sent hundreds of buses to ferry its migrant workers to different parts of the State from Delhi.

According to media reports, the UP Government also recently arranged over 20 buses to ferry more than 900 pilgrims from south India back to their hometowns. They were stuck in Varanasi since 24 March.

Nitish said the Yogi Adityanath Government’s decision would not just defeat the purpose of the lockdown and need for social distancing but could also make it look like States are facilitating students yet “making excuses” about being unable to bring back migrant workers.

Senior Bihar Minister Ashok Chouidhary said, “When you have decided to defeat the concept of lockdown, then remove all barriers and stop doing pick and choose. Let everyone come back.”

The Bihar Government had earlier this week lodged a protest with the Centre over the Kota administration issuing passes to students of various coaching centres and their parents for returning to their home States.

Recently, Bihar Chief secretary Deepak Kumar had written a letter to the Union Home Secretary and Rajasthan Chief Secretary, for violation of lockdown by granting passes to private vehicles to ferry students back to Bihar.

In a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, Bihar Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar had on Monday said, “Such movement from Kota is not at all advisable in the present scenario. In Bihar, we are now medically examining the returning students as well as their guardians accompanying them, and instructions are being issued to quarantine them.”

Earlier also Nitish had raised his objection, pertaining to violation of lockdown when Yogi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had arranged buses for migrant labourers and dumped them on the borders of Bihar, two days after the Prime Minister had announced for nationwide lockdown on March 23.

Welcoming the Yogi Government decision, BSP supremo Mayawati said similar steps should be taken to facilitate the return of migrant labour families to the State.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/up-students----evacuation-from-kota-injustice-to-poor--nitish-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/up-students----evacuation-from-kota-injustice-to-poor--nitish.html
185,19-4-20,Govt tweaks FDI policy to prevent hostile takeover,"The Government on Saturday made its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share land border with India to curb “opportunistic takeovers” of domestic firms following the Covid-19 pandemic, a move which will restrict FDI from China.

Countries which shares land borders with India are China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.

“An entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route,” according to a press note issued by the Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.

It said that the Government has amended the FDI policy to curb “opportunistic takeovers” of Indian companies on account of Covid-19 pandemic.

It also said that Government approval will be mandatory for any transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in a company in India, which results in change in beneficial ownership, falling under this new restriction.

“In the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction or urview of the (amended policy), such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government approval,” ‘it said.

According to sources,the decision would restrict foreign investments from China amid fears that companies in the neighbouring country might make takeover bids at a time when domestic firms are battling lockdown imposed to contain rapid spread of coronavirus.

Currently such a norm was there for investments coming from Pakistan. A company can invest in India, subject to the FDI policy except in those sectors/activities which are prohibited. “Further, a citizen of Pakistan or an entity incorporated in Pakistan can invest, only under the Government route, in sectors/activities other than defence, space, atomic energy and sectors/activities prohibited for foreign investment,” it added.

Commenting on this, Nangia Andersen LLP Director Sandeep Jhunjhunwala said Chinese tech investors have put an estimated USD 4 billion of greenfield investments into Indian start-ups, as per the estimates of India-China Economic and Cultural council.

“’Such is their pace that over the last few years, 18 out of India’s 30 unicorns are Chinese-funded. Overall, time is right for India to safeguard longer-term considerations and protect its technology ecosystem by blocking hostile deals and effectively dealing with the looming challenge posed by Chinese tech companies,” he said adding SEBI had earlier sought details from custodians regarding investments coming from China into Indian stock markets.

PwC India Partner (Tax and Regulatory) Vikram Doshi, said, “COVID-19 will impact several businesses, especially ones that are highly leveraged. It will open up takeover opportunities in many sectors.”

He added that this press note is an attempt to place a check and give the government an opportunity to review such takeovers and investments coming into India from specific jurisdictions. According to the DPIIT data, India received FDI from China worth USD 2.34 billion (Rs 14.846 crore) between April 2000 and December 2019. During the same period, India has attracted Rs 48 lakh from Bangladesh, Rs 18.18 crore from Nepal, Rs 35.78 crore from Myanmar, and Rs 16.42 crore from Afghanistan. There are no investments from Pakistan and Bhutan.

Chinese central bank - People’s Bank of China - has recently hiked its stake in mortgage lender HDFC Ltd to 1.01 per cent. Although FDI is allowed through automatic route in most of the sectors, certain areas such as defence, telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors.

Under government route, foreign investor has to take prior approval of respective ministry/department. Through automatic approval route, the investor just has to inform the RBI after the investment is made.

There are nine sectors where FDI is prohibited and that includes lottery business, gambling and betting, chit funds, Nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco. During April-December 2019-20, FDI into India increased by 10 per cent to USD 36.77 billion.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-tweaks-fdi-policy-to-prevent-hostile-takeover-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-tweaks-fdi-policy-to-prevent-hostile-takeover.html

189,19-4-20,India asks Pak to look into reasons behind collapse of domes of Kartarpur Gurudwara,"India has taken up with Pakistan the issue of collapse of domes of the Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara, one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, government sources said on Sunday.

India has conveyed to Pakistan that the damage to the structures in the gurudwara has caused ""great consternation"" among the Sikh community, they said.

""India has urged Pakistan that in deference to the sentiments of the Sikh community, the deficiencies which led to the damage to the newly constructed structures be urgently rectified and remedied,"" said a source.

In November last year, the two countries threw open a corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative.

Kartarpur Sahib Gurudwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev.

The sources said India conveyed to Pakistan that the strong sense of faith and devotion of the Sikh community to the holy site must be fully understood and appreciated.

190,19-4-20,‘My journey is like my life',"AHAM SHARMA, who started his career with Chand Ke Paar Chalo, speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about why he chose TV to begin his career, the lessons the industry has taught him and a role close to his heart

How does it feel to not be working (due to lockdown)?

One does miss going to the sets and be in front of the camera. For actors who are working 24x7, there is so much to do — read books and watch a few things. But all said and done, not be able to go out and meet people and observe people and life from close quarters takes its toll after a while. But it means that one gets to spend time with family, enjoy and relax. There are ups and downs.

An engineer turned actor. How did that happen?

I am from a village Salempur in Bihar. Just like any other middle-class family, I had to complete my studies and take up a job. I did all that. But when I was in college, I realised that I would not be happy with a regular job. I came to Mumbai, gave auditions and once I got work, I quit my job.

Was acting on cards?

Not really. It was not in my radar till I was in college. Before this I had no clue. Nobody in my family had anything to do with acting or any art form. It was all discovered much later.

Why did you choose TV to begin your career?

When I landed in Mumbai, I did a film Blue Oranges, but probably the time was not right for that kind of movie. Back then there were only to mediums — films and TV. I did get some offers for films but those didn’t pan out. I come from Bihar and I needed to survive. I got an offer from TV and took it up since I wanted to act and grow.

Films or TV, which one is better?

Films are going to be the ultimate medium because it gives you ample time to explore and it creates an impact. It gives you chance to work with the best in the industry. Film is essentially a technical platform and it depends on the director how he edits and shape it. Theatre is good for an actor since it connects you with the audience directly. TV is going downhill now. People looking for content are moving away from this medium. It gives you so little time to produce quality content due to time constrains. There is no time to prepare — either for the actor, the writer or the director. Those who are able to give good content need to be applauded.

What made you take up diverse roles — historical, mythological and dramas?

An actor doesn’t want to get typecast. People tend to this once you excel in a genre. They want you to keep doing that. It has been my conscious decision to do as many different roles as possible. But this is not always possible on TV since there are limited roles that one is offered. However, I have tried to do different work so I can keep challenging myself.

How has the journey been thus far?

I am happy doing what I am. Life is about doing more and wanting more. I want to challenge myself more and do more and to the best of my ability. My journey has been like life.

You have been in the industry for so long, what are the lessons it has taught you?

Like any profession it has its own challenges. I am not going to define it as difficult or easy. It is like any other craft one has to work hard and be good at it. If one is good at your work, one will get due.

Is there a role that is close to your heart?

I have not done many shows but have tried to put life into those roles. This is not possible if you don’t put your heart in the character. When I did Karna for Mahabharat I could plan much in advance since there are so many books out there. I had so much material that I could research and give shape to this role. I knew how to layer the character and bring it to fore for the audience. The role also gave me instant recognition. Another role was Arjun in Manmarziyaan, on Star Plus, even though the show didn’t run for long.

I understand you are into martial arts. What made you take up Taekwondo?

I was very much active during my college days and took up martial arts. I took it up since I knew that it would help me since I wanted to act. I also enjoy doing it and know it would come in handy while doing action scenes.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---my-journey-is-like-my-life--2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---my-journey-is-like-my-life-.html

Asked about how he is holding up amid the lockdown, the founder of Emmay Entertainment told IANS: ""We had three films and six shows in the pipelin. Everything is on hold now. Arjun (Kapoor) and Rakul's film was on the floor. We were also shooting two films -- 'Satyameva Jayate 2' and 'Mumbai Diaries'. I am doing post (production) of ‘Indoo Ki Jawani'.""

""As a producer, of course I am affected, but what I am trying to do is, instead of thinking negative, I am working with my writers and developing scripts. I am trying to finish the post-production of those projects that we can sitting in the house"" shared Nikkhil.

Under his banner Nikkhil delivered films like ""D-Day"", ""Satyameva Jayate"", ""Airlift"", ""Batla House"", and ‘Marjaavaan"" among others. He has also produced the Netflix show ""Hasmukh"", featuring Vir Das.

Talking about one of the biggest problems the shooting process will face in near future, Nikkhil said: ""Maintaining social distancing on a shooting floor is tough and that we have to incorporate in our lifestyle, in our work culture. From budgeting to promoting and processing of a film, everything is going to change post lockdown. I do not think the formula we were working with for long will be relevant anymore.""

Citing an example, he said: ""Even if we want to release a film, will people go to the theatre to watch it? Social distancing is one factor, home entertainment through OTT platforms is another. Of course, it is more convenient. From technicians to superstars, everyone has to sit down and re-evaluate. We are all going to look at it as ‘pre-COVID 19' and ‘post COVID 19'. Nothing is going to be same!""

Does he have any solution in mind? ""We cannot fight the change. We have to change ourselves to deal with it. Every film cannot be an event film. There are high-budget, mid-budget and small budget films. We plan the budget based on the subject and stars coming on board for the film. As the viewing habit of our audience is changing, we have to choose the platform of release and the story accordingly. That will surely change the budgeting of a film. The definition of stardom will also change. Running a production house is not easy, and all I am doing is preparing myself to deal with the new age that is coming!""

The 37-year-old actor will now fulfil his wish with upcoming movie ""Barb and Star"", co-starring Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, which is set to release later this year.

""I'm so excited for people to see the movie. I'm so excited to see the movie myself. Years ago, when I first started in the industry, I kind of only really wanted to do comedy and I was sort of making good comedy connections, feeling like I was going to go down that path.

""And then I did 'The Fall' and if you're playing a serial killer, nobody's considering you for comedy,"" Dornan told Variety.

""The Fall"", which ran for three seasons on BBC Two, featured Dornan as Paul Spector, a serial killer who targets young professional women. The show also featured Gillian Anderson.

The actor said it has taken him years to finally land a comedy project.

""I guess it's taken me a while to find my way back to that world. I've made enough people giggle along the way. It came about through the directors and producers having seen the chat stuff that I'd done like Graham Norton, where I've told loosely funny stories on a sofa during the job,"" Dornan said.

197,19-4-20,'Wonder Woman 1984' fight sequences inspired by Cirque du Soleil,"""Wonder Woman 1984"" director Patty Jenkins has revealed that she wanted an improved and feminine fighting style for the titular superhero for which she drew inspiration from Cirque du Soleil performers.

The DC superhero film, starring Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince, reunites the actor with Jenkins for the sequel to the 2017 film.

The director said the team was ""mindful"" that as the film's villain, Cheetah/ Barbara Minerva (played by Kristen Wiig) is a woman, they shouldn't end up fighting like men.

""Men fight like men. We were mindful of that. I don't want to be trying to look like a man. We need to fight like women,"" Jenkins told the Empire magazine.

Diana and her fellow Amazons fought to protect rather than for glory or to kill, so she wanted to avoid the typical punching and head-butting that men do, she added.

Gadot said they didn't know how to go about the combat scenes till she and Jenkins watched Cirque du Soleil, a Montreal-based entertainment company and the largest contemporary circus producer in the world.

""(Cirque Du Soleil) was beautiful. And then Patty said 'This should be the inspiration for the fight sequences. I looked over at her like 'How do I do that?!' She said 'Don't worry, you never know how you do it until you do it',"" the actor said.

The film will also see Chris Pine reprise his role as Steve Trevor and new entry Pedro Pascal as Maxwell Lord.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, ""Wonder Wonder 1984"" will now be released on August 14.

""Nowadays dancers are very particular about what style they want to do. Kids today are learning from the best in the world and following them right from the time they start their journey. Back then we did almost everything. I used to watch Bollywood songs and learn choreographies from there.""

201,19-4-20,"China 'number one' in coronavirus deaths, official toll 'unrealistic': Trump","President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the accuracy of China's official coronavirus death toll, terming it ""unrealistic"" and claiming that the actual number was ""way ahead"" of the US' which is not the world's ""number one"" country in terms of COVID-19 fatalities.

Trump's comments have come two days after another 1,300 fatalities were added to the official count in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started in November last year. The revision puts China's overall death toll to more than 4,600.

""We are not number one; China is number one just so you understand,"" Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday.

""They are way ahead of us in terms of death. It's not even close,"" he asserted.

According to Trump, when highly-developed healthcare systems of the UK, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain had high fatality rates, it was 0.33 in China.

The president asserted that the actual number was much more than the official Chinese death toll figures, which he said were ""unrealistic"".

""You know it, I know it and they know it, but you don't want to report it. Why? You will have to explain that. Someday I will explain it,"" he said.

He also highlighted that on a per-capita basis, the mortality rate in the US was far lower than other nations of Western Europe.

Early this month, President Trump cast doubt on the accuracy of official Chinese figures after US lawmakers, citing an intelligence report, accused Beijing of a cover up.

The number of the coronavirus cases in the US crossed 700,000 on Friday, while over 35,000 people have died from the disease, as President Trump assured his people that America was ""very close"" to seeing the light ""shinning brightly"" at the end of the tunnel.

According to data maintained by Johns Hopkins University, over 35,000 people have died in the US and the country has 734,969 infections, the highest in the world.

The death toll in China is 4,632 with no fatalities reported on Saturday, according to China's National Health Commission.

""Hospitalisation numbers are down (and that is) good news, Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus press briefing on Saturday, noting that the number of people getting hospitalised from the virus continues to fall from around 18,000 to currently 16,000, the emergency rooms have fewer people in them and the ICU admissions and intubations continue to be down.

""If you look at the past three days, you could argue that we are past the plateau when we're starting to descend, which would be very good news. Again, it's only three days but that's what the numbers would start to suggest, he said, while cautioning that even if the state is not at a plateau anymore, we're still not in good position.

He said the state continues to witness the tragic news of daily deaths.

An additional 540 people died on April 17, which is not as high as it was but still suggests that the health crisis is far from over. New York State had reported 606 deaths on April 15, which was the lowest figure then in 10 days.

Of the 540 deaths, 504 people had passed away at hospitals and 36 in nursing homes, which Cuomo said are the single biggest fear in all of this because of all the vulnerable people in one place.

It is the feeding frenzy for this virus despite everything we can do in the best efforts of people who are working in those nursing homes and are doing a fantastic job, he said.

New York City, the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak in the US, has 131,263 confirmed virus cases and more than 8,890 deaths and another 4,309 probable deaths, people who did not have a positive COVID-19 laboratory test, but their death certificate lists as the cause of death ""COVID-19"" or an equivalent.

The filmmaker is also producing the remake of 2019 Malayalam romantic thriller ""Ishq"", starring Shane Nigam and Ann Sheetal.

""Our movies are also being made in the south, so it is not a new thing. Both the films that we are actively chasing -- 'Vikram Vedha' and 'Ishq' -- are phenomenal and we felt the films should be shared on a national level and that is why we are planning to make them in Hindi.

""Primarily the stories are exciting, it is not a question about the language. These are exciting stories and that is why we chose to say it on a bigger scale, to a bigger audience,"" Neeraj told PTI.

216,19-4-20,"Spraying of disinfectant on people physically, psychologically harmful:Health ministry","The Union Health Ministry has issued an advisory against spraying of disinfectant on people for COVID-19 management, saying it was physically and psychologically harmful.

Even if a person is potentially exposed to the COVID-19 virus, spraying the external part of the body does not kill the virus that has entered the body, it said, adding there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are effective even in disinfecting the outer clothing/body in an effective manner.

The ministry said it has received many queries regarding the efficacy (if any) of use of disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite spray on ndividuals to disinfect them.

""The strategy seems to have gained of lot of media attention and is also being reportedly used at local levels in certain districts/local bodies,"" the ministry said.

Disinfectants are chemicals that destroy disease-causing pathogens or other harmful microorganisms. It refers to substances applied on inanimate objects owing to their strong chemical properties.

Chemical disinfectants are recommended for cleaning and disinfection only of frequently touched areas/surfaces by those who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19.

Precautionary measures are to be adopted while using disinfectants for cleaning like wearing gloves during disinfection.

""Spraying of individuals or groups is not recommended under any circumstances. Spraying an individual or group with chemical disinfectants is physically and psychologically harmful,"" it said.

Spraying of chlorine on individuals can lead to irritation of eyes and skin and potentially gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. Inhalation of sodium hypochlorite can lead to irritation of mucous membranes to the nose, throat, respiratory tract and may also cause bronchospasm, the advisory said.

Additionally use of such measures may in fact lead to a false sense of disinfection and safety and actually hamper public observance to hand washing and social distancing measures, it stated.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/spraying-of-disinfectant-on-people-physically--psychologically-harmful-health-ministry-2020-04-19.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/spraying-of-disinfectant-on-people-physically--psychologically-harmful-health-ministry.html

222,19-4-20,"ICMR bats for Oxford vaccine, WHO lists 3 more as frontrunners","The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Sunday said that a candidate vaccine called ChAdOX1 a"" being developed by researchers at University of Oxford -- is the frontrunner in the race to take on the deadly COVID-19 virus which has infected over 23 lakh people globally, killing over 1.60 lakh people.

Speaking at a daily media briefing in the Capital, Dr Raman Gangakhedkar who is the chief scientist of ICMR said that at least 70 groups of scientists across the world have been working towards a novel coronavirus vaccine and five groups have come into human trial phase -- with ChAdOx1 leading the race.

On Friday, scientists at the University of Oxford promised a super-fast vaccine during a virtual press conference, saying it would be available by September. According to lead researcher Professor Sarah Gilbert, their ChAdOx1 vaccine can work against the virus called SARS-CoV-2.

The Oxford vaccine group which was among the first to enter the COVID-19 vaccine race, also promised one million doses of the vaccine by September.

However, WHO's latest ""Draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines (April 11 update), lists only three candidate vaccines as present which are currently in human clinical evaluation, and ChAdOx1 candidate vaccine is yet to be officially included as the fourth one.

According to the WHO draft, from a total of 70 candidate vaccines in the race, three leading vaccines which are in human testing phase are from CanSino Biological Inc and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc; and Moderna Inc along with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US.

What probably separates ChAdOx1 - known as recombinant viral vector vaccine - from the rest is the time it promises to take in order to deliver mass quantities.

In India, the Pune-based Serum Institute of India has collaborated with New York-based Codagenix Inc to develop a vaccine against the deadly respiratory disease.

The irony is: WHO special envoy David Nabarro has warned that there is no guarantee that a coronavirus vaccine can be successfully developed in coming months.

Nabarro who is one of the world's leading experts said that people have to live with the threat of coronavirus ""for the foreseeable future"" and adapt accordingly because there is no guarantee that a vaccine can be successfully developed.

In an interview with The Observer, the WHO special envoy said the public should not assume that a vaccine would definitely be developed soon and would have to adapt to the ongoing threat.

""You don't necessarily develop a vaccine that is safe and effective against every virus. Some viruses are very, very difficult when it comes to vaccine development - so for the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat,"" he was quoted as saying.

In late March, Professor Gilbert received 2.2 million pounds as funding from the UK government for vaccine development and trials.

Researchers enrolled over 500 healthy volunteers to test if their vaccine can prevent the novel coronavirus.

The vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine vector and was developed at Oxford's Jenner Institute. Adenoviral vectors are a very well-studied vaccine type, having been used safely in thousands of participants, from 1 week to 90 years of age, in vaccines targeting over 10 different diseases.

""The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response, such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This is an even greater challenge. Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate,"" said Professor Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford.

According to experts, the COVID-19 vaccine is at least 12-18months away, so there is no need to jump on every occasion someone announces a new one.

Calling them ""vowels of the new normal"", Modi said that like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world.

""Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models. India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal, can take the lead in providing a new work culture,"" the prime minister wrote on LinkedIn.

He also said the next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application.

""They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind,"" he said.

Titled ""Life in the era of COVID-19"", in the write-up, the prime minister also reminded that COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking.

""Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,"" he said.

Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, ""today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience,"" he said.

Referring to the post-coronavirus world, Modi said we should evaluate what might be the new opportunities or growth areas that would emerge now.

""Rather than playing catch up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world. Let us think about how our people, our skills sets, our core capabilities can be used in doing so,"" he said.

Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models, he said adding that India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal, can take the lead in providing a new work culture.

Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure – roads, warehouses, ports.

But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes, he pointed out.

""India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post COVID-19 world,"" he said.

""Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity,"" the prime minister stressed.

Modi said he envisions the new business and work culture being redefined on the vowels of the new normal.

""...Because like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world,"" he said.

These are : Adaptability, Efficiency, Inclusivity, Opportunity and Universalism.

The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable, he said.

""Doing so would mean that even in a time of crisis, our offices, businesses and commerce could get moving faster, ensuring loss of life does not occur,"" he explained.

Embracing digital payments is a prime example of adaptability.

India is already witnessing an encouraging surge in digital transactions, he said.

The prime minister also sought ideas on business models to further help telemedicine across the world.

Efficiency cannot only be about- how much time was spent in the office, he said, adding that people should think of models where productivity and efficiency matter more than appearance of effort.

On the issue of inclusivity, he said business models that attach primacy to care for the poor, the most vulnerable as well as our planet should be developed.

""COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity,"" the prime minister opined.

He said there was a need to invest in innovations to make sure the farmers have access to information, machinery, and markets no matter what the situation, ""that our citizens have access to essential goods"".

The novel coronavirus outbreak has significantly changed the contours of professional life and these days home is the new office and internet is the new meeting room, Modi said.

""I have also been adapting to these changes. Most meetings, be it with ministerial colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing,"" Modi wrote.

The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable.

The work place is getting ""Digital First"", he said.

""And, why not? After all, the most transformational impact of technology often happens in the lives of the poor,"" he said.

It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures, the prime minister said.

He also recommended practising yoga and urged people to download the Arogya Setu app as tool to check the spread the deadly virus.
