0,16-3-20,Of threat and its perception,"It is nobody's case that danger is not there. It is a question of an intelligent understanding of disaster as it is possible to face it sensibly

Periodically there are events which capture the people’s mind and imagination because they are so unusual. Recall the global frenzy at the beginning of 21st century? The midnight of December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000 were supposed to be epoch-making. However, any student of geography knows that there is no such thing as a century changing. The planet Earth rotates around its own axis and around the sun. The flashpoint of December 31, 1999 changing to January 1, 2000 would be at different points of the globe at different times of the same day. For the purposes of enabling “measurement of time”, the Earth is divided into longitudes. This measurement begins at a given longitude in the Pacific Ocean region. The rest of the measurement of time follows. The marking of the longitude is notional and the time taken by the Earth to rotate fully, once, around its axis is taken to be “24 hours.”

Because of this innovation, calendars could be created and seasons marked by months. This collection of months became a year. The globe is dotted with many types of calendars, each marking the days and the collection of days in its own unique manner. Ultimately, all calendars talk of a year. In a manner of speaking, the measurement of days, months and years is based on assumptions which make learning scientific and sequential.

To get back to the story of the so-called beginning of the 21st century, the “unique event” was projected as once-in-a-lifetime occasion. People wanted to be among the first on the planet to witness the “birth” of the 21st century. They also wanted to have a story for their children and grandchildren if they were ever asked, “Where were you when the new century was born?” So the enterprising ones got to work and some of them sat on the beaches of certain islands to be among the first to witness the first sunrise of the 21st century. This became a multi-billion dollar business but no management book has discussed this. However, the “dawn of the new century” became a reality in perceptions.

Simply put, the gross truth is that there is no such thing as a sunrise or sunset. The simple truth is that the sun never rises and it never sets. It looks like a sunrise because the Earth rotates. Also, there would be no qualitative difference between a December 31 and January 1. In a manner of speaking, January 1 would be like any other day at any other time. Nothing would have changed in nature or reality, other than one more rotation of the blue planet while orbiting around the great fireball in the sky. However, the fallacy does not end there.

A new century, even going by the self-given measurements, does not begin with a zero. A new century would begin with one. Hence, the 21st century did not begin, in a manner of speaking, in the year 2000 but would have begun in 2001 only. However, such is the power of the hype created by the media that no one seriously questioned the beginning of the new century on January 1, 2000. Thus it is that the new century was ushered in and celebrated. Almost every kind of reaction, from that of the astronomers to statisticians, was conspicuous by its silence on this anomaly. Clearly, in life, the importance of “belief” is high and the media plays a determining role in it. This is a running theme which has several precedents in this century. For instance, there was the Y2K scare at the turn of the 21st century, where computer users and programmers feared that computers would stop working on December 31, 1999. There was such a major brouhaha over the Y2K threat that it delivered huge financial gains for some computer companies. Ultimately, nothing happened but the belief in and the fear of the Y2K phenomenon was enormous.

Come 2001, there was the “threat” of Anthrax and in 2002 many believed that the West Nile virus was a threat to the world. In 2003 it was the fear of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), while in 2005 the “Bird Flu” was believed by many to be a recipe for disaster. A few gained and many, especially poultry and those involved in animal husbandry, paid the price of the global panic exacerbated by the media.

Whenever there was a threat perception the question of scale, magnitude and range of impact, were rarely built into the equation. Ultimately, this was nowhere near many of the other equally disastrous events that the world had seen, like in the time of the “great plague.” Swine flu, Ebola virus, Zika virus all had their days.

It is nobody’s case that danger is not there. It is a question of an intelligent understanding of disaster as it is possible to face danger sensibly. One of the media reports says that on March 12 alone, the ongoing Coronavirus wiped out Rs 11 lakh crore from the share market at Dalal Street with the Sensex crashing by 2,919 points. However, the biggest challenge of the time may be to face challenge in a realistic manner.

1,16-3-20,States must utilise funds for geriatric care,"Unless there is a strict oversight mechanism, course correction is difficult and the elderly of the nation will continue to suffer the result of this indifference at the Government and bureaucratic level

The National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE) was launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2010 to provide accessible and affordable healthcare for the elderly and the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared 2020-2030 as the ‘Decade of Healthy Ageing.’ This is very relevant for India as according to census data, there are over 104 million senior citizens in the country. Out of this, more than half of the elderly are women.

Approximately 71 per cent of the country’s elderly reside in areas with limited access to healthcare. It goes without saying that the incidence of hospitalisation is much higher in the elderly as compared to the total population.

A major cause for concern is the fact that 27 per cent of people above the age of 80 were found to be homebound or immobile.

Despite the fact that the situation is grave, States have not managed to use more than seven per cent of the funds disbursed by the Centre for the healthcare needs of the elderly and only five per cent of the funds released for the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been put to use.

This is particularly pathetic considering the fact that the NPHCE is part of the NCD flexi pool which is one of the major components of the National Health Mission (NHM).

Providing access to quality healthcare is the responsibility of the Central Government as well as States and they need to put central funds to good use and ensure that healthcare schemes for the elderly are implemented in all districts.

At present, the implementation is lackadaisical and is marred by unwieldy cost overruns. State Governments are already overwhelmed by their existing healthcare programmes and it is not unreasonable for them to expect a certain amount of flexibility in operations. However, the failure to produce tangible results points towards a lack of planning and organisation. Unless there is a strict oversight mechanism, course correction is difficult and the elderly of the nation will continue to suffer the result of this indifference at the State Government and bureaucratic level.

Where do we stand?: At present, the facilities that are dedicated for geriatric care are sub-standard. In rural and remote areas, where a substantial percentage of the elderly reside, you would be hard-pressed to find a functional facility, let alone a well-equipped one.

State Governments are not very keen on spending money on programmes like the NPHCE as they use the funds for more immediate requirements like skill training, salary and infrastructure development, all of which are crucial areas that are forever cash-strapped.

Even though the NPHCE is under the NCD flexi pool, there are two main reasons behind the underutilisation of funds. First, we suffer a shortage of medical professionals who are trained in geriatric care. Second, State Treasuries take a lot of time to release funds to the respective district administration.

Both of these factors lead to an underutilisation of capital, preventing the programme from taking flight. Also, depending on the economic condition, a number of State Governments cut back on expenditures to trim the fiscal deficits.

Time to address the skill gap: Since the core of the programme focusses on clinical care, it is not possible to ensure effective implementation, unless we train our healthcare professionals. Only a handful of medical colleges in India have postgraduate programmes to train undergraduate students in geriatric care, owing to the strict guidelines laid down by the Medical Council of India (MCI).

Unless medical colleges get the technical and the bureaucratic support they need, it is unrealistic to expect the current state of affairs to improve. Thankfully, the Government has woken up to this reality and is now supporting two National Centres for Ageing (NCAs) that are dedicated to train professionals, conduct research, and provide healthcare for the elderly. We also have regional geriatric centers (RGCs) that aim to provide tertiary care through outpatient departments for seniors in addition to providing postgraduate medical courses for students who want to specialise in geriatric medicine. If we open more RGCs and NCAs, particularly in rural and remote areas, it will help improve health outcomes for the elderly.

The need for a multifaceted approach: We also need a shift in societal attitudes towards the elderly if we want better results. Preventing and treating health problems in the elderly requires a multipronged approach that incorporates the active involvement of the healthcare ecosystem, urban/rural development, social welfare and legal sectors. We need to expand our current geriatric care programme to include non-medical determinants as well.

Unless we have an unwavering political commitment coupled with social action, it is difficult to implement customised policies at the grassroot level. Seniors must be educated about potential risk factors so that they are empowered to take control of their health. Children must volunteer to look after their ageing parents and we need customised health insurance schemes to take care of the needs of our senior citizens.

The Government must establish more gerontology units to train medical and paramedical professionals on the healthcare needs of the elderly. To sum it up, a joint approach can help address the challenges in geriatric care in the country. Failing to do so will develop into a costly proposition in the future.

2,16-3-20,Punjab Govt likely to start screening at railway stations,"Punjab Government is in talks with the Centre to initiate the process of screening of passengers at major railway stations amidst the Coronavirus scare. Ahead of the impending wheat harvesting season, the State Government has expressed concerns over the expected inflow of migratory workers or labour from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other States which comes at a time when the authorities concerned are taking serious and strong steps to check the spread of deadly virus.

During the wheat harvest season, starting from April, a huge number of migratory labour comes to Punjab to work in the fields. Considering the same, a senior government official told The Pioneer that we have raised the issue with the Centre and apprised them of the entire situation.

“We are planning to set up the screening systems at all major railway stations in the State, besides Delhi and Chandigarh,” said the official adding that soon, the thermal screening sensors or other screening equipment would be set up at the major railways stations in Ambala, Ludhiana, and others.

Only a day before, the State Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had informed that the State is considering to start the screening of all rail passengers.

Informing about the preparations for dealing with the virus, Sidhu had informed that the there are 500 beds each in Amritsar and Mohali Government hospitals for the purpose of quarantine. Besides, the Government has directed to put on hold the retirement of many Government doctors, who are to retire on March 31 as an outcome of the Government’s recent decision to reduce retirement age from 60 to 58.

As per the latest updates from the Heath Department, till date only one confirmed case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) has been reported from the State. “The case has travel history of Italy and was checked at Amritsar International Airport and admitted at GMC Amritsar and is stable now. His family members are negative and are stable,” said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the Central Government is sharing daily lists of passengers of travel from different foreign countries with the State. “The passengers are screened at port of entry at Delhi or other airports. As a matter of precaution and to ensure surveillance of each and every passenger, the State Government is visiting and calling every passenger daily till surveillance period of 14 days from day of arrival,” said the spokesperson.

Till date, the State has received the names of 6886 passengers, out of which 6,283 total number of passengers have been contacted by the state Health Department.

Out of the total 100 samples tested by the Department, only one patient has tested positive till date, while 95 have tested negative, and the results for remaining four are awaited.

At present, total 2333 patients have been kept under surveillance, out of which only eight are under hospital observation, while remaining 2325 are in home surveillance.

“Two facilities with 500 beds have been established for quarantine of passengers coming from China, Italy, Iran Korea, France, Spain and Germany at Amritsar and SAS Nagar,” said the spokesperson adding that three passengers are under Government quarantine (two from Germany and one from France) at Amritsar and all are stable.

The Health Department has taken IMA (Indian Medical Association) on board for collaboration with the State for management of COVID-19, said the spokesperson.

SANGRUR SSP, IAS OFFICER WIFE UNDER ISOLATION

Punjab Government has kept the two IAS-IPS officer couples, who had returned from holidays in Italy and Switzerland, under isolation.

Sangrur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sandeep Garg and his IAS officer wife Surbhi Malik, who is Patiala Development Authority’s chief administrator, along with Mohali Deputy Commissioner Girish Dyalan and his IPS officer wife Avneet Kondal, who is Fatehgarh Sahib SSP, are being quarantined.

The condition of all four officers is stable, and their 14-day quarantine period would end on March 16.

CORONA SCARE: WEDDING DATES BEING POSTPONED

With the Central Government imposing strict travel restrictions amidst Coronavirus scare, the Punjabis are pushing back the wedding dates, for which all the preparations, and booking arrangements have already been done. The people are cancelling the bookings for marriage palaces, community centres, or hotels.

Owner of Sohi Banquets at Zirakpur-Kalka highway, Samuel Massey, said that people are cancelling their bookings for weddings this week and are making reservations for April. Our three bookings have been cancelled so far, he said.

A Canada-based NRI family, with roots in Jalandhar, has also decided to postpone marriage of their son despite all arrangements being in place already. But the family has decided to postpone the wedding as the Central Government has cancelled all visas and also announced that those arriving in India could be quarantined.

3,16-3-20,"Cinema halls, schools, gym shut in Hry till March 31","In view of the Coronavirus outbreak and detection of more than 100 positive cases in the country, Haryana Government on Sunday decided to shut down all cinema halls, gyms, swimming polls, theaters, clubs and night clubs across the State till March 31.

Apart from this, all Government and private schools in the state will remain closed during this period. Also, mass gathering of more than 200 people will remain prohibited in all religious, social, political, cultural, sports and personal and family events in the State.

These decisions were taken in a meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal and Health Minister Anil Vij here on Sunday to review the preparedness of Health Department to check the spread of Coronavirus here.

Earlier, the State Government had on Friday decided to close down all Government and private schools in five districts namely Sonepat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Faridabad and Gurgaon. The government had also ordered the closure of all Government and private universities and colleges in the state till March 31 as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease.

“All Government and private schools in Haryana will remain closed till March 31. The students will attend the school only to take the Board exams, annual exams and assessment exams as per previous schedule. However, all teaching and non teaching staff members will attend the school as usual,” stated a Government’s order issued on Sunday.

During the meeting, the Chief Minister also directed that 2500 to 3000 beds (minimum 100 in each district) should be identified in the isolation wards set up in the Government hospitals of the State. However, he said, the number of these beds could be increased in cities adjoining Delhi like Gurugram, Rohtak and Jhajjar.

At present, 1328 beds have been identified in 298 isolation wards in Government hospitals and district wise arrangement of quarantine facility has been made for 3000 persons. Apart from this, sensitization programmes would be held in all Government and private hospitals in the State to sensitize the doctors as well the staff about the Coronavirus.

The Health Minister said that AYUSH Department would organize 100 camps in the State from Monday onwards wherein medicines would be distributed to the people free of cost to enhance the immune system. Decision was also taken in the meeting that sanitizers would be installed in those government offices where people in large number visit for their day to day work.

Initially, Haryana Civil Secretariat and Mini Secretariat would be taken up for this work. Apart from this, all the CMOs have been asked to ensure the installation of sanitizers in district offices in consultation with Deputy Commissioners concerned.

During the meeting, it was informed that the adequate arrangements have been made to deal with any eventuality in the wake of spread of Coronavirus in the Country. Personal protection equipment in sufficient numbers is available with the Health Department and these are being further augmented.

4,16-3-20,PGIMER to design new drugs to fight coronavirus,"In the wake of surging Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the country, the Experimental Pharmacology Laboratory (EPL) at the Department of Pharmacology, PGIMER has taken initiative to design new drugs to fight the virus.

In this regard, a team EPL, under the guidance of Prof Bikash Medhi, Department of Pharmacology, PGIMER comprising Dr Phulen Sarma, Nishant Sekhar, Manisha Prajapat, Dr Pramod Avti, Dr Ajay Prakash, Hardeep Kaur, Dr Subodh Kumar, Dr Harish Kumar and Dr Seema Bansal have identified few potential targets (nucleocapsid protein, protease enzyme, E protein, M Protein, Spike protein), upon which in-silico drug designing was carried out and few important hits were identified in last two months, said an official spokesperson of PGIMER.

The spokesperson said that there are seven strains of human Corona viruses, which include 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, responsible for the infection with special reference to involvement of the respiratory tract (both lower and upper respiratory tract) e.g. common cold, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis and other system symptoms like occasional watery diarrhoea etc.

Among these seven strains, three strains proved to be highly pathogenic (SERS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV), which caused endemic of severe Corona virus disease. Interestingly, among the hits there were few molecules, which were earlier approved for other conditions.

Thus, the selected hits and the re purposed molecules can be further evaluated in in-vitro and in-vivo platform for further validation, the spokesperson added.

Notably, atleast 108 confirmed cases, an increase of 24 from the day before, of Coronavirus were reported on Sunday in the country. The health experts have warned that adults with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are at highest risk of Coronavirus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pgimer-to-design-new-drugs-to-fight-coronavirus.html

The State Government had earlier decided to close all technical educational institutes till March 31, “but today, this order has been partially amended”, said the State Government’s official spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the Technical Education Department has revised the old order to clarify that the examinations in the universities or engineering colleges, poly-technic colleges or industrial training institutes (ITIs) would be held as per the earlier schedule.

Punjab Technical Education Department has issued new amended orders to the IK Gujral Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar; Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University, Bathinda; all Government or private engineering colleges of the State, all Government or private polytechnic colleges and all Government and private ITIs that these institutes should issue directions to the staff attached with examination process to be present and also ensure that non-teaching staff attached for conducting exams should also be present, said the spokesperson.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/exams-in-punjab-itis---to-be-held-as-per-schedule.html
6,16-3-20,"Punjab cracks down on illegal sand mining, 9 held","Acting swiftly on the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s orders to launch special operations to crackdown on sand mining, the Punjab Police has arrested nine persons, which led to the seizure of 18 vehicles being used illegally for mining in six districts.

Informing, the State Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said that the seizures, made during the raids conducted on Saturday night in Ropar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar City, Jalandhar Rural, Moga and Fazilka, included JCBs, tractor trolley and tippers. So far, nine cases have been registered by the police, and further investigations are in progress, said the DGP.

The DGP said that similar raids will be carried out daily on the directives of the Chief Minister, who had received certain reports and complaints of illegal mining being carried out at night.

The special operations, to be conducted in all the concerned districts, will involve officers of the Mining Department, and the Police will accompany the civil officers deputed by the Deputy Commissioners.

Giving details of Saturday night’s operations, Gupta said that in Ropar, though the night mining was hampered by rains, the raiding team nabbed three people with two sets of machinery. In Moga, two persons were arrested with two tractors and trolleys, with FIR registered in Police Station city Moga. All-out efforts were on to arrest the owners as well, he said.

“Even though the mining was not supposed to be carried out in the area, the duty officer at Sadar Fazilka police station discovered illegal operations being carried out, and an FIR (dated March 14, 2020) was registered under the Mining and Minerals Act, 1957. Eight tractors, trolleys were seized in the raid.

A special checking drive last night in Hoshiarpur led to the arrest of one person and recovery of tractor trolleys along with implants. FIR has also been registered under sections 21(1) of Mining Mineral Act at Police Station Haryana, said the DGP.

In Jalandhar Commissionerate, one case was registered against a farmer for illegally mining his own fields in Sadar police station, and a JCB was taken into possession. In the sixth raid, in Jalandhar rural, four cases were registered and four persons arrested for indulging in night mining activity, said Gupta, adding that three tippers and one tractor trolley had been confiscated.

Meanwhile, reiterating his commitment to eliminate illegal mining completely from the state, Capt Amarinder said that all-out efforts were being made by the Government to check such mining activity.

Top officials of the districts where such mining was allegedly taking place, especially in the cover of darkness, had strict instructions to take immediate cognizance and action on any complaints, he said, warning that no laxity in this regard would be tolerated.

The DGP said that the Chief Minister had also directed the police to extend all support to the Mining Department and concerned district officials in the special raids against night mining. Every complaint was being taken seriously and nobody found guilty of involvement would be spared, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cracks-down-on-illegal-sand-mining--9-held.html
7,16-3-20,Neighbourhood challenge,"Irrespective of India’s Look East and Act East policy, bilateral relations between New Delhi and Naypyidaw have been stalled because of China’s dominance

Following an infructuous spell of looking east, India’s Act East Policy (AEP) is hobbled by snags in connectivity, continuing insurgencies, agitations, blockades and extortion in the North-east and replication of some of these very problems, especially insurgencies and snarls, in decision-making in Myanmar, the launchpad and fulcrum of AEP. Last month, the visit of Myanmar President, U Win Myint, to India reminded us of AEP anew.

The open-door policy is intended to usher in development in the North-east, which could in turn facilitate the closure of insurgencies. For the Look East Policy to work, it was necessary to press the “pause” button on democracy and, instead, support the ruling military junta. Reversion to democracy, albeit partial, has been achieved as I discovered last month in Yangon through a joint civil military leadership, with the Army having the last word.

At the core of AEP is connectivity — by road, rail, sea, inland waterways and air. The strategic geography in the North-east channelises this outreach through the narrow and sensitive Siliguri corridor, the vulnerable chicken’s neck of the region. Choices for bypassing the Siliguri constriction were to transit through Bangladesh and/or use the sea route to reach insurgency-free Mizoram on the Myanmar border — from Kolkata to Sittwe Port in Myanmar and upto Mizoram.

Earlier, Bangladesh had rejected Indian requests to connect Myanmar through the Port of Chittagong upto Agartala and thence to the Myanmar border. What is being operationalised now is the costly and delayed Kaladan multi-modal access from Sittwe to Myanmar/Mizoram through Rakhine and Chin States, currently beset with insurgencies by the Arakam Army. Therefore, instead of working this project south-north, it has been reversed, starting from Mizoram to Sittwe, which will have a 1,000 km special economic zone (SEZ) and a gas land pipeline from its gasfields to Gaya in Bihar. A number of roads to and through Myanmar to the east are under construction and completion, thus enhancing the AEP connectivity grid.

Unique to Myanmar is the civil-Army joint leadership arrangement under an Army-dictated constitution of 2011, which ensures that 25 per cent of the elected seats in Parliament is reserved for the Army. As the Constitution forbids Myanmar’s popular leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League of Democracy (NLD) from holding office, she is a State Councillor in the improvised system, which allows her the number three position in the State hierarchy after the President and Vice President; whereas the “C” in C Senior General Aung Hlaing, who calls the shots, is at number five. The Constitution reserves the posts of defence, home and border affairs Ministers for the Army.

The NLD wants to change the Constitution, which requires an unachievable two-thirds majority in Parliament. Last week, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi unsuccessfully tried to pass the Constitutional amendment. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing is in his second term, which will end in April 2021, and efforts are on to accommodate him as the Vice President. This may introduce a modicum of civilian control over the military. While the Army is popular in the countryside, it is disliked by the urban elite. It disapproves of the overwhelming Chinese presence and meddling in Myanmar’s internal affairs. But others don’t mind them as they have the money to invest and develop the country.

Another historical challenge facing Myanmar is its myriad insurgencies, which like the cluster on the Indian side, is a hurdle for AEP. At the time of independence, many States in the erstwhile Burma had sought self-determination and separation but the Panglong Agreement of 1947 promised to settle Centre-State relations even as the Communists and Karens favoured independence. Today, there are more than two dozen active and dormant insurgencies, the active ones in border States like Shan, Kachin, Chin and Rakhine. The world’s most complex but elaborate peace process is in Myanmar and it consists of unilateral, bilateral and a nationwide cease fire agreements, prone to violations and formal and informal dialogues backed by the international community, prominently by China.

The year 2019 was bad for the peace process. The 21st century Panglong Union Peace Conference with 10 nation-wide ceasefire signatories and the high-level Joint Implementation Coordination Meeting could not be held, though the Union Peace Dialogue took place in July. Both the failed meetings are likely to be held after the national elections later this year, which the Lady — reference to NLD leader Daw Suu Kyi — is expected to win but with a reduced majority. For various reasons, her popularity has waned but there is no alternative leader.

Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Myanmar this January and signed 33 agreements, of which the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (like the economic corridors with Pakistan and Nepal) was the centre piece. All three strategic corridors seek access to markets but two have an eye on warm waters of the Indian Ocean. Surpassing India’s port potential at Sittwe is Kyakpyu, the deep-water port coupled with SEZ and ultimately road, rail, oil and gas pipelines radiating through Myanmar north of China’s Yunnan province. China’s footprint is enormous: There are hordes of Chinese in the north. Though the controversial $3.6 billion hydel dam at Myitsone has been put on hold, bilateral trade stands at $17 billion and China holds 40 per cent of Myanmar’s foreign debt of $5 billion. Xi signed separate agreements with the Senior General and State Councillor while hailing the new blueprint for comprehensive strategic cooperation and the new 2+2 strategic dialogue, Myanmar’s first with any country.

India, though with good intentions and now sizeable civil and defence cooperation, is no match for China’s deep pockets and outreach to play the role of a regional equaliser. Still, its impressive infrastructure and capacity-building programmes have been appreciated. Japan will team up in improving quality and quick delivery of projects. While the two million, mostly Indian Tamil, diaspora is no asset, the Buddhism connect has not been tested even as Indian tourists are thronging Myanmar. India has transferred a Russian kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarine and may soon sell Brahmos missiles against the $1.5 billion line of credit, of which $300 million is left. Border trade — within 16 km — is a paltry $25 million, though overall trade is around $2.5 billion, far below potential.

The flowering of bilateral relations is stalled in part by the complexity of joint leadership and the unstoppable rise of China. While Beijing has cast a string of pearls along India’s periphery, it has placed in Myanmar, an arrestor wire system of an aircraft carrier to blunt the take-off of AEP towards Asean, where China is also the dominant influencer. Myanmar’s full transition to democracy depends on progress in ethnic reconciliation and resolving civil-military tensions through Constitutional reform. Till then, AEP will remain constrained.

8,16-3-20,Farooq is free,"What’s next for the NC chief, who still has a psychological hold on the people? Can he still be an asset?

The Government has finally realised that its single-minded Kashmir policy, the one it has been ramming hard without factoring in local contexts and complexities, is costing it international acceptability. So even while it convinced the world about changing the status of Jammu and Kashmir as an internal and sovereign matter and as a larger counter-terrorism initiative, its civil lockdown of the Valley ate into its credibility. But what made India look like an unfair oppressor was the arrest of democratically-elected leaders, with a decided pro-India tilt, and labelling them as enemies of the State overnight. Worse, they were considered as good as “terrorists” and booked under draconian laws, nullifying any interlocutory scope that they could have offered with Kashmir’s civil society and citizenry even in a changed scenario. The growing anxieties about human rights curbs in the Valley despite a largely incident-free record, both in the European Union (EU) and the US, and an interventionist push from US President Donald Trump, have finally forced the Government to yield some ground. So it has released former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) leader Farooq Abdullah after seven months of captivity. And it is likely that it may release others over a period of time. The Government also has self-serving motives. For some time, it has been trying to restore a semblance of normalcy by conducting panchayat and local-level polls, hoping to build a new narrative ground up, albeit with candidates friendly to it. As another round of panchayat polls is scheduled for March, officials elected a year ago, most of whom were walkover wins, fear to move out of Srinagar hotels, simply because they contested against local will. Such was the boycott then that over 12,000 panchayat seats continue to be vacant. This round, too, could collapse as panchayats have made it clear that any electoral process would have to be preceded by the release of jailed NC and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders. This has completely blasted holes in the BJP’s attempt to rebuild a grassroots matrix or carry out its much-touted development agenda, something it thought would be a cakewalk in the absence of traditional politicians. It has failed to raise an alternative political front and, therefore, needs to create a political climate first. The NC and PDP would still be needed for that purpose. The BJP may have encouraged the formation of the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP), drawing rejects from the PDP and NC, under the stewardship of ex-PDP Minister Altaf Bukhari, but it cannot generate reassurance, least of all credibility, driven as it is by self-serving transactional politics than ideology. The Government would still find it easier to deal with old faithfuls than new aspirants. Perhaps, it is to craft an environment of fairplay that Abdullah has been released. The JKAP may have been formed but needs time to develop a cadre base, something which is still concentrated around the NC and the PDP. Question is will the NC now be used as a polarity to justify the politics of the JKAP or be used to build new bridges? After being treated so unjustly for siding with New Delhi throughout his career, Dr Abdullah has refused to comment on political matters till all leaders are released.

In fact, he may use this unwanted alienation to his advantage and be of some relevance. For at the moment, he hardly has any asset value. For the normal Kashmiri, he is a recipient of much of their hatred and abuse. They believe he shortchanged them by choosing a secular and democratic India and lost Article 370. Now, not only that is gone, the former State has been reduced to a Union Territory. So Kashmiris are questioning his family legacy. For New Delhi, he may have been the moderate face that’s not needed in changed times, given the endorsement of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status both at home and the world. Therefore, Abdullah’s inescapable need to question the abrogation of Article 370 and appear an activist Kashmiri is more than an irritant, it is an obstacle in the new narrative. His suggestions of a negotiated autonomy for the two sides of Kashmir and converting the LoC into a soft border for trade and commerce to flourish seem impractical when all talk is about righting historical wrongs and reclaiming territories in that context, rather than addressing current realities. Yet one must remember his worth through the decades of conflict. He acted as a filter and as Chief Minister did manage to keep militancy in check, give some semblance of credibility to the election process and had a pan-India acceptability as a regional voice. For Abdullah may be a spent force, but people, who have invested in the idea of India at his call, will only see this as betrayal and recede into separatist ways. Simply for that reason, he still has worth and the emotion of his people. It is through him that the Government can let people speak and be heard. Without it, there can be no reconciliation. And the Government’s intent would always seem doubtful to the world.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/farooq-is-free-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/farooq-is-free.html
9,16-3-20,Time to take a leap,"With Coronavirus disrupting learning, it will be interesting to see how tech unicorns tap the potential

With the Coronavirus spreading like wildfire, Governments around the world have been forced to close schools and colleges as a precautionary measure. But should this be allowed to dampen the students’ future, upset schedules or stunt their minds? For in these unfortunate times, there’s an opportunity for institutions to boost their online capacity and mainstream tech education. Those possessing enough resources and infrastructure must create a more robust system and those with deficiencies must evolve new learning tools. Though digital education has been a stated goal of our education policy for a long time and distance learning has been seen as an option in undeserved areas, there has not been mass adoption yet. Yet global institutions have called for a shift from in-house tutorial to online learning to not only maintain a continuity plan but create new value chains and fructify an ed-tech revolution.

Now as the conventional education system stands fractured, India cannot afford to be a laggard. Ed-tech is already bridging massive gaps in the conventional form of learning caused by the crisis and can very well be mainstreamed after this. With more people likely to work and learn online, the Kerala Government has announced it would provide extra bandwidth across the State. Besides, many online learning websites are allowing free access to their content to close the gaps affected students are bound to face. But making the tech system work will require much more than just temporary concessions. That’s partly because not all students will be able to tap the potential due to existing anomalies like capped and costly data plans, slow connectivity and lack of accessibility to smartphones among other things. Until now, the ed-tech’s focus has been on learners in the metropolitan cities, which have a robust payment system, internet bandwidth and familiarity with online products. The challenge is to reach students belonging to low-income families and living in deep pockets of rural India. For educators, it will be a humongous task to craft modules according to the learning trends of the students on a case-specific basis and at the same time, they have to keep their course prices at par with the industry average. The opportunity at hand is to grow the e-learning space at $243 billion by 2022. With India having one of the largest networks of higher education institutions in the world, it will be interesting to see how unicorns in the educational space change their strategies.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/time-to-take-a-leap-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/time-to-take-a-leap.html
10,16-3-20,Help farmers grow money,"Improving purchasing power in rural areas, especially that of farmers who constitute over 50 per cent of the workforce, will accelerate the economic growth of the country

While the share of agriculture in India’s economy has progressively declined, even today the sector directly and indirectly occupies over 50 per cent of the country’s workforce and contributes to over 17 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, the farm sector’s importance in our economic and social fabric goes well beyond these indicators as the majority of India’s poor live in rural areas where farming is the primary source of livelihood. Additionally, with a growing population and rising incomes in the cities, farmers face the burden of increasing yields and improving the quality of their produce. But, for many years now we have been beset with an agrarian crisis for a variety of reasons. The Government’s strategy, over the years, primarily focussed on raising agricultural output, improving food security and providing subsidies and waivers rather than recognising the need to raise farmers’ income. While these prove helpful in the short run, they are not effective measures for the long haul as farmers continue to face the same issues that got them into a catastrophic situation in the first place.

Instead of handing out loan waivers, the Government could help farmers by providing access to exploitation-free credit. This has been attempted but both vision and implementation have been lacking. If easy credit is available, farmers will have improved access to seeds, pesticides, irrigation facilities and even mechanisation. Since farmers typically procure all these materials via an open market as there is no State support, higher income or easy credit will enable them to produce more/better. As farm incomes reduce or stagnate over time, conversion of farmlands for alternate uses to generate money has gone up significantly in the past decade as land prices have seen a considerable uptick. After putting in all the hard work, farmers do not receive fair wages for their labours. This has traditionally been due to unfair exploitative practices at the mandis (wholesale food markets) and the large number of middlemen across the supply chain, right from production to consumption. In addition, for years now, low global prices have hurt exports and encouraged cheaper imports, that further hit farmer incomes. A highly-fragmented supply chain and poor farm infrastructure is a contributing factor to the farm crisis as more than 50 per cent of the produce is wasted in distribution alone. At the front end, there is very little demand insight for various crops and virtually no marketing infrastructure and at the farmers’ end there are non-existent or poor storage facilities and additional transport and manpower costs. Due to all the contributing factors above, farmers’ incomes have either stagnated or been lower while the cost of production and support services is perpetually increasing. The farmers, despite high interest rates, take the risk and cultivate only to be disheartened when their produce does not fetch suitable prices that cover their costs and leave something over as profit. Only a small portion of the farm produce gets the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and more than 90 per cent of farmers are at the mercy of the traders who set the market price. As incomes become insufficient, more and more farmers face poverty. This situation discourages the current crop of farmers but more so the next generation which gravitates towards the city for better opportunities. This leads to a shortage of hands for farm activities and is a very prevalent problem in an agri-rich State like Maharashtra where a lot of the farm help and labour is being brought from other States. The lack of fair return on both financial and effort investment by farmers has led to a marked increase in farmer suicides.

To solve this crisis all controllable, supporting factors (Government policy, spending, initiatives, incentives among others) have to singly focus on helping the farmer be self-sustainable. On an average the farmers’ income today is only `20,000 a year in 17 States or about half the country. That means that the monthly income of a farming family — with an average of five members — is less than `1,700. It is hard to imagine how farmers are surviving today with these incomes which have to suffice for supporting their families and continuing with their farm production activities. With 50 per cent of our population working in the agri sector, it is imperative to help generate more income for them both for their betterment and for the economy to keep ticking.

Thankfully, the Centre has set a target to double farmers’ income by 2022. While this is a good first step towards enabling farmer self-sustainability, the income has to go up significantly more than double at the current levels for it to be truly transformational. The broader strategy and framework outlined by the Government is based on good principles. However, implementation on the ground and ensuring effective and timely impact for the farmer will make the difference. Some of the key factors to ensure that the outcome is favorable are given below:

Productivity of farmland holdings has to be prioritised and improved: Most importantly, reducing dependence wholly on rainwater through better irrigation mechanisms and better planning of groundwater, is important. Enabling better support services such as easy access to credit on fair terms, availability and access to high-quality seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and technology-driven enhancements would be extremely beneficial.

Helping farmers align their production with seasons and market demands: As phone and internet penetration grow exponentially, providing farmers education, information on weather, market requirements, pricing, Government schemes and subsidies would be useful.

Crop diversification for better income: A lot of companies, especially start-ups are taking up the important task of educating and advising farmers how to not only improve farm yield but also to diversify their produce to increase incomes. This farmer education and awareness, at a larger scale, would not only help increase farm income but also help meet the demands of a growing population.

Better access to markets and pricing: Currently, the control of pricing or what the farmers receive for their hard work is in the hands of a few traders in mandis. Traditionally, this has been the area of most severe exploitation of farmers. Ensuring transparency in buying and selling of agri goods at the mandis and ensuring MSP is an immediate impact solution. In the last few years, with the rise in overseas Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies coming to India and recently minted and existing companies working in agriculture, farmers have been given an alternative to selling in mandis. Here, for production to certain specifications and quality standards, farmers earn more than what they would at mandis and have some demand guarantees as well. Companies such as Big Basket, More, Godrej, Reliance and so on all have centers where farmers can sell their produce directly with transparent pricing. However, this is limited to areas that are closer to urban centres and has not yet penetrated the deeper rural areas wherein there is a larger number of severely- impacted farmers.

Improved agri-infrastructure and supply chain: A lot of the produce, be it vegetables, milk, grains and so on, is lost in distribution across the supply chain. All stakeholders suffer additional costs due to these losses. Farmers suffer the most due to loss or quality deterioration and it also discourages them from diversifying their crops to fruits and vegetables. Enabling efficient, low-cost storage options at farmer locations, improving access to transport or credit facilities for the same, subsidies on cold storage, use of technology to predict demand and so on would help eradicate some age-old problems and positively impact farmer incomes.

Cooperative farming/cluster farming/Farmer Producer Organisations: Most farmers across India have marginal land holdings and this reduces their ability to generate higher incomes individually. Consolidation of land holdings becomes an important strategy to raise farmer incomes. They can voluntarily come together and pool land to gain the benefits of size. Through consolidation, farmers can reap the benefits of economies of scale both in input procurement and output marketing.

Focussing on these areas and implementing programmes with a single, unified vision will be a huge step in the direction of reviving India’s agriculture sector. Improving purchasing power in rural areas, especially that of farmers, will also help accelerate overall economic growth. Poor policy, high price volatility, climate risk and indebtedness plague India’s farm sector. A majority of farmers — 85 per cent — include small and marginal ones, with declining and increasingly fragmenting landholdings, where these external factors and uncertainty make them even more vulnerable.

The equipments to be installed will be connected to a centralized control room to initiate a crack down on dangerous driving, over speeding and unsafe lane changing.

The NH-44 passes through five districts of Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat and Sonipat.Additional Director General of Police, (Law and Order) Navdeep Singh Virk said that a blue print to this effect was prepared at a brainstorming session on the road safety held under the chairmanship of Director General of Police (DGP) Manoj Yadava during the observance of 31st National Road Safety Week-2020 across the State.

""As the repeated violation of speed limit leading to more crashes and injuries, the installation of proven speed detection devices and speed detection cameras systems will certainly help in minimizing loss of human life in road accidents. Such path breaking initiatives under the visionary approach of DGP Manoj Yadava will certainly help in further minimizing the road accidents and fatalities on this highway in particular and in entire State in general,” he added.

As part of the national road safety week, Virk said that Haryana Police has also undertaken several initiatives including special awareness drives, workshops and seminars to highlight and emphasize the need for road and traffic safety across the state in the month of January 2020.

During the week long programme, State Police alongwith traffic volunteers has made people aware of traffic rules for road safety, he said.

Describing the road safety as an important topic for road users including the pedestrians, the ADGP said that police personnel had conveyed the message on road safety to people and requested their contribution in bringing down accidents on roads which is a matter of grave concern in the entire nation.

During the road safety week which continued upto January 17, the ADGP said that traffic police teams with the help of volunteers had checked and stopped the traffic rule violators and handed roses by stressing upon to follow the traffic rules.

To positively encourage two-wheeler riders to wear helmets, police also donated helmets and briefed them on the importance of wearing helmets for their safety.

In addition, reflectors have also been pasted on heavy or light vehicles. A total of 115 road safety awareness programmes have been conducted by the Police, Virk added.

The other events conducted included educating the road users on road safety aspects, imparting first aid training to traffic officials, eye sight check up of drivers, blood donation camps, organization of road safety quiz competition in schools and colleges etc.

12,16-3-20,Kaushik seeks high level probe into Jashpur incident,"Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik condemning the Jashpur incident in name of delivering justice, on Sunday demanded a high-level probe.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also sought stern action against the accused.

Kaushik said even after the name of the relative of a legislator emerged, the entire issue is being covered up.

“A committee should be constituted for probing into the whole incident and the victim should be provided security,” he said.

The mode in which the victim was said to be given ‘justice’ and the way in which the pressure was exerted, is a clear indication that the legal path has been bypassed, the BJP leader said, adding that action should be taken against all those involved in the incident.

Kaushik further pointed out that the matter could have been reported to the nearest police station but the whole issue was diffused at the village level itself under political pressure to end the matter.

“Even after being an issue of molestation of a minor girl, it is necessary that justice is delivered to the victim.

“The district administration should ensure that the victim does not face any political pressure,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kaushik-seeks-high-level-probe-into-jashpur-incident.html

18,16-3-20,5 bed isolation ward set up in Palamu medical college,"A five-bed isolation ward has been set up in the Palamu Medical College Hospital in the wake of Coronavirus. Each of the 5 rooms has one bed only. This arrangement has been done under the express order of Deputy Commissioner Shantanu Kumar Agrahari, said civil surgeon John F Kennedy.

Kennedy said, “We have kept hand wash and sanitisers in the isolation ward. The people admitted here will be under medical surveillance 24x7.”

About N 95 masks that doctor attending such patients wear, Kennedy said, “We have placed a requisition of 250 N95 masks and we expect to get them in a few days from now.”

Kennedy said, “There is a rush for wearing masks by the commoners. Just wash your hands regularly and in short intervals. Soap can do. Any wash that is germicidal or viricidal can be used. If spirit/ alcohol is used then there is no need of water.”

He said people think that masks can provide protection but they are only useful to the ones who have symptoms.

Following order from Agrahari, the CS on Sunday directed opening of one OPD specially for visitors coming with complaints of cold, cough, sneeze and fever.

Kennedy said this extra OPD is for visitors exclusively having above mentioned symptoms. The regular OPD will work as usual.

Meanwhile senior BJP leader Babulal Marandi speaking to the Pioneer said, “I ask the government to keep its OPD open on Sundays and on other holidays too.

It is a time of health emergency. OPD must work irrespective of days and holidays.”

Questioning the wisdom of isolation ward set up in RIMS Ranchi near the one in which Lalu Prasad is admitted, Marandi said, “It belies logic if any isolation ward gets set up near any patient’s dwelling.”

Marandi further asked the Hemant Soren government to decongest public transport which is too crowded be it bus or auto.

Kennedy admitted that Palamu medical hospital has personal protective equipment, but no sensor thermometer to gauge fever. He said, “Once this hospital gets VTM 9 viral transform medium, we can start swab test of oral and nasal cavities.”

It was a great relief when Kennedy said, “There were 19 passengers who came here in Palamu from countries like England, Italy, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Belgium, and were home quarantined for 14 days and 14 out of these 19 are fit and healthy while the remaining 5 who are yet to complete their 14 day home quarantine appear to be good now.

Nine passengers came to Daltonganj from London, Bangkok, Brussels and Singapore, one passenger to Chainpur from Bangkok, one again in Manatu from Bangkok, two in Paton from Bangkok, one from Saudi Arabia in Bishrampur and five in Panki block from Italy, Bangkok and Bangladesh.

An extra OPD for visitors having complaints of cold, cough, sneeze and fever has been started here in the Palamu medical college hospital for which DC Agrahari had set a deadline to get it started this Sunday itself and CS Kennedy sat in its inaugural service with N 95 mask on his face.

Kennedy said people having asthma, high BP must be extra careful as virus attacks more where asthma, high BP exist and where immunity is fragile. He asked people to be alert but panic.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/5-bed-isolation-ward-set-up-in-palamu-medical-college.html

27,16-3-20,‘Social media posing serious threat to national security’,"Media must remain honest and truthful, andact with great restraint and responsibility, said Kumud Kumar Thakur, General Manager of Bokaro Steel Plant and President of Mithila Sanskriti Parishad.

Speaking at a seminar titled — 'Role of Media in Current Perspective of the Country' Thakur said that a free and fair media was not just a part of a healthy democracy but was an indispensable prerequisite.

“Media has been considered the fourth pillar of the democratic system- a pillar that supports, nurtures and nourishes the democracy and helps in course corrections as and when necessary,” he added.

The seminar was organised by Mithila Sanskriti Parishad - a social and cultural institution Mithila Sanskrit Parishad at Sector 4 in Bokaro Steel City on Sunday.

Expressing his views Ajay Ask a senior journalist said, now-a-days social media has given us access to more information sources than ever, but it’s changing our perceptions of each other and crushing the quality journalism.

“The social media also possesses a serious threat to the national security of a nation,” he added.

The relationship between fake news and social media is emerging as one of the fresh challenges not only for the national security but also destroying the credibility of Print and Electronic Media, said Ajay.

“Easy access to digital tools, mushrooming of social media platforms, easy availability of smartphones with affordable Internet access have bolstered the nexus of fake news with social media, said Akshay Kumar.

“While fake news is content in the form of news items, videos, photos (morphed photos), generated in the appearance of real news with a bad or wrong intent to mislead the reader-social media platforms, which are predominantly user-generated content on various digital communications channels, act as a powerful and swift vehicle to circulate the fake news,” added Akshay.

The users of social media are frequently exposed to a plethora of fake news items, which they often believe as real news and share it on their social media platforms, he said.

Unlike traditional media (print and electronics media), which have to keep a close watch on content, social media platforms enjoy a considerable amount of freedom in terms of filtration of the content. With less checking points, the menace of fake news gets circulated by unaware readers to their social media groups, which in turn gets viral in the digital sphere of social media, thus, creating a vicious circle of promoting false information, manipulative information and hoodwinking the consumers of that information, said Akshay.

Speaking on the occasions Arvind Sharma urged, media must place the welfare of the common man and the progress of the nation at the centre of all its activities. “Media must act as the moral compass and the conscience of the society and must aggressively campaign to end all social evils.

It must become the voice of the voiceless and help the helpless,” he added.

Arun Pathak asked the media to shun the tendency to sensationalize and present facts dispassionately without mixing news and views.

In this sequence, 35 journalists were honoured with Vidyapati Samman, for their outstanding contribution in the field of journalism; presented mementoes and stole.

Beside others, SK Jha, Amarendra Jha, Amita Jha, Tulanand Mishra, KC Jha, Rambabu Chaudhary, Manoj Jha, Jayanti Pathak, Usha Jha, Nutan Jha, PK Jha, Gangesh Pathak, Sudeep Thakur, Ganesh Jha, Aman Kumar Jha , Shravan Kumar Jha, Rajiv Kanth, Mayanand Jha, Sunil Mohan Thakur, Deepak Kumar, Vishwanath Goswami, Dheeraj Tiwari, Vivekananda Jha were present on the occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---social-media-posing-serious-threat-to-national-security---.html
28,16-3-20,"Sanitisers, masks sold out, prices peak","In view of the threat posed by coronavirus (COVID-19), the demand for masks and hand sanitisers has increased considerably in Dehradun in the past two weeks. However, the sudden demand for these commodities has created a shortage for these products in the market.

According to a local chemist, the locals are taking every possible preventive measure against the novel coronavirus that essentially include masks and sanitisers.

However, due to the surge in the public demand, the regular supply of masks and sanitisers in the market has failed to meet the demand. According to a local chemist Neeraj Kumar, “People are quite aware of their safety from coronavirus. We are selling a considerable number of masks and sanitisers in a day. Since Saturday, the sanitisers are out of stock in our shop. Many customers had to return empty-handed from our shop in the last two days.

Our stock of sanitisers will arrive on Monday, however we are also not getting the desired number of sanitiser bottles and masks as the suppliers have to fulfil the demands of their customers too.” Talking about the sale of the masks and sanitisers a chemist from Raipur area Kamal Chaddha said, “We sold the masks and hand sanitisers worth Rs 4,000 within two hours on Saturday and by 3 PM both the items were out of stock.

We are expecting the delivery of our fresh stock by this Wednesday but the supplier is also providing us limited stock as the manufacturers also take time to meet the needs of every customer.

Seeing the current scenario, people will keep buying these essential sanitation items for at least the next two months.”

Some of the locals have alleged that masks and sanitisers are being sold at a higher price than the maximum retail price “I went to Haldwani last week and had to buy a hand sanitser at Rs 150 and mask for Rs 80 though their MRP was Rs 100 and Rs 50 respectively.

Some people are taking this coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to earn few extra bucks,” said Raipur resident Preeti Ghildiyal. However, most of the chemists aver that they don’t indulge in such unethical practices. According to the owner of chemist shop on Sahstradhara Road, Sushant Sonkar,

“We are not selling the masks and hand sanitisers in more than their usual price to earn any extra profit. We are here to do the business but selling the essential products at double prices during an epidemic is disreputable for us because this epidemic will end someday but we will certainly not get those customers back.

Such practices, as small they might seem, can affect one’s reputation and business in the future.”Though most of the people are anxious about the shortage of sanitisers in the market, some of them are quite calm and have different thoughts about the whole fiasco of sanitisers. “Washing your hands using soap or handwash is a much better option to prevent the spread of germs than using a sanitiser.

People can use clothes to cover their mouth and nose if the masks are not available. There is no need to panic but to take simple precautions against the coronavirus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sanitisers--masks-sold-out--prices-peak.html
29,16-3-20,Combating Coronavirus: A Global Perspective,"The outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in China in December, 2019, has been impacting lives across the globe ever since. Declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March, 2020, which essentially means spread of a disease across the globe caused by a new virus or organism for which still there is no effective response or vaccine. While the scientific research community is working hard to combat the influenza type virus and find a solution to it, the ‘unknown devil’ has till date claimed around 5000 lives across the world. Although the death count is not as staggering as compared to the earlier pandemics, its impact on lives and economy cannot be undermined or underestimated. Acknowledgement of Coronavirus (COVID-19) by WHO as a pandemic indicates the epidemic getting rampant in multiple countries and continents simultaneously. WHO has taken this step to create a sense of urgency, so that an aggressive posture and action is taken by the nations for the containment of the disease. As we know, COVID-19 or the Novel Coronavirus originated in Wuhan in Central Chinese Hubei Province and has currently spread across the globe with 1,33,860 confirmed cases till 13th March, 2020 (Source:WHO) in not less than 114 countries. Although in India the current level of infection is 83 and two deaths so far, as per Govt. of India sources (MoHFW), we really do not know what the future beholds?

The virus outbreak has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy and financial markets. Major institutions and banks have cut their forecasts for the global economy including OECD. The disease has spread rapidly around the world having originated in China and travelling to Iran, Italy, South Korea, France, Germany, Spain and India among the 114 countries that have reported Coronavirus cases.

A brief look at the HistoryHistorically there have been six Pandemics across the globe, which have claimed millions of lives.

1. The Great Plague of London – the dreaded Bubonic plague in the 14th Century, which was known as Black Death and which resurfaced in 1665, killing innumerable lives.

2. Spanish Flu (1989) caused by H1N1 Virus. Nearly 500 Million people got affected by this virus which caused nearly 50 Million deaths.

3. Asian Flu (1957), which originated in East Asia due to Influenza virus H2N2 Strain. Nearly 1.1 Million people died.

4.1968 Flu Pandemic, which originated in China in 1968, because of H3N2 Virus and killed 1 million people worldwide.

5. 2009 Flu Pandemic or Swine Flu, killing 5,75,000 people worldwide.

6. HIV AIDS of 1980’s causing 25 Million deaths and 65 Million infections till date. Source: Center for Disease Control (CDC).

Hence, while we have read with horror about Spanish Flu, Hepatitis, MERS, Ebola, Japanese encephalitis, Marburg virus, Lassa Fever Virus etc., this is the beginning of COVID-19 about which we must understand the impact on human lives and economy – sooner the better. One good step taken is that with the immediate sharing of information countries, action taken by WHO and the alarm raised, countries have pulled up their socks and taken immediate steps to stop spreading of the disease.

Major impact on the economy world-wide

The major influence visible on the economies comprise:

a) Downgrades in economic forecast. Forecasts for the global economy have been severely downgraded.

b) Slowdown in manufacturing in major economics including the US, Eurozone, China and Japan.

c) Services industry - because of reduced consumer demand and spending, retail stores, restaurants, transportation and aviation industry have got seriously affected.

d) Slump in oil price – because of reduction in global economic activity, the recessionary tendencies got intensified.

e)Stock market mayhem - Stocks have tumbled like nine pins in most of the countries touching their lowest in recent memory. Investor’s wealth of around 11 Lakh Crores INR has vanished in thin air with the market plummeting. BSE and NSE have taken a hit exceeding 20% with the stocks tumbling. The trading halts starting in Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, Karachi have reached the Middle East and European and American shores. The MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) All-Country World Index fell as much as 2.3% wiping off $ 11 Trillion in a huff. Australia, Japan, Jakarta, Singapore, UK, Germany and others have all hit the bear market confirming the pandemic nature and aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak.

f) Lower bond yield. Even safe haven assets are getting impacted and causing fleeing of investors.

Combating COVID-19 Worldwide

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Chinese Government has been trying to grapple with the problem, which has made the entire economy go kaput. It has severely impacted business travel, tourism industry, hotel industry, share markets etc. The international market including the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Sensex and South-East Asian Markets have taken the brunt of the disease. The already limping economy has felt the bear hug and no one knows when the markets will rebound.

The efforts to contain the disease have been initiated at all places. India has proactively adopted an aggressive posture in limiting travel of foreigners to prevent community transmission of Covid-19. Although travel restrictions, surveillance, social distancing and sharing of information to stop panic have taken a toll on the economy and will further aggravate bearish tendencies, it is an indispensable action which the Governments have to take for the containment of the pandemic. The closing of cities in China, creating quarantines, suspended business operations and moratorium on travelling has already put severe pressure on the world economy considering the size, linkages and magnitude of trade of China with the leading economies.

However, a silver lining is discernible with the Chinese claiming that the COVID-19 graph has reached the inflexion point in China and lesser cases are coming to light with the massive disease containment exercise undertaken in China. For India and other tropical countries, there is a hope that the virus may not survive for long with the onset of summer if full care and precautions are taken since it is not known to survive in temperature ranges of 30 deg Celsius or above.

In India a lot of advisory is being shared to prevent COVID-19 and with the aggressive measures and restriction being imposed, we hope the steps will bear fruit and the disease will finally vanish from the scene. The sooner it happens, better will it be for humanity.

30,16-3-20,"State on high alert, MCD remains complacent","While the Central and State Governments have enforced various precautions against the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) has not taken any preventive measures for the safety of people present in the corporation.

The State Government ordered closure of all schools and colleges apart from prohibiting social gatherings under Uttarakhand Epidemic Act 2020. However, in the MCD, which is visited by a large number of people from across the city every day, the officials appear to have remained complacent to the situation.

Apart from routine works, a number of citizens are visiting the MCD daily to pay property tax.

The number of visitors is apart from the number of office and field staff who are present in the MCD compound daily.Instead of first focusing on measures in its own compound, the MCD is relying on publicity measures in parts of the city.

No precautionary measures have been adopted by the MCD officials for the safety of the public as well as employees of the corporation.

Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ said that banners and hoardings related to novel coronavirus have been installed in the city for public awareness. However, he avoided making any specific statement about the preventive measures in the MCD compound itself. The municipal corporation that has the responsibility of maintaining sanitation and hygiene of the whole city itself has not taken any steps towards the safety of the people present in its building.

Observers point out that the MCD is exposing its utterly negligent attitude by not even taking the basic precautions in its own compound visited by hundreds of citizens every day.

Putting up banners in the city is a mere formality especially if the corporation ignores the message in such banners when it comes to its own compound.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-on-high-alert--mcd-remains-complacent.html

The student returned from Japan on March 3 and was kept isolated in the hostel. However, 10 days later, due to symptoms like cough, the health department decided to keep him in isolation ward.

At the same time, his samples have been sent to Delhi. Meanwhile, an Italian in Rishikesh has also been admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Rishikesh with symptoms similar to COVID-19.

The Haridwar chief medical officer Dr Saroj Naithani said that the 26-year-old MTech student of IIT Roorkee had recently returned from Japan. Due to cough, the authorities decided to keep him in isolation ward.

33,16-3-20,Ranchi SP quarantined in Patna after Italy trip,"Ranchi Superintendent of Police Saurav and his wife have been quarantined in Patna amid Coronavirus scare after the couple returned from a vacation in Italy, officials from the police headquarters in Ranchi said on Sunday. The couple, which visited Italy for a 10-day vacation and landed in Patna on Saturday, was taken to the Isolation Ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) as a precautionary measure, sources said.

“The Ranchi SP volunteered to stay under observation in Patna as he returned from Coronavirus-hit Italy. He has not shown any symptoms of the viral infection and is healthy at the moment,” Spokesperson of Jharkhand Police, Additional Director General of Police Saket Kumar Singh said. Saurav, who goes by one name, could not be reached over phone on Sunday.

With death toll rising above 1400, Italy has become the epicentre of the lethal Novel Coronavirus in Europe. The European country has reported at least 20,000 cases of Coronavirus and has become one of the major concerns due to the high flow of tourists to the country. The virus is contagious and can be passed on from one person to another either through direct contact or breathing in close proximity, say doctors.

Meanwhile, a Ranchi resident, who returned from Netherland on Sunday, was admitted in the Isolation Ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi. The doctors at the hospital collected his samples for laboratory tests and allowed him to stay in a 14-day home quarantine at his residence. As per the protocol, doctors cannot disclose the identity of the person.

While the virus has claimed over 5000 lives across theglobe, primarily in Italy and China, it has affected more than 80 people inIndia and caused two deaths. No cases of Coronavirus have been reported inJharkhand so far. However, nearly 100 people here are under observation afterreturning from countries affected by the virus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Coronavirus a global pandemic.

Meanwhile, the Government has asked all State-run hospitals to stock sufficient masks and other products used for protection against Coronavirus.

RIMS has arranged for 450 pieces of N95 masks and all State-run hospitals have set up special isolation wards for patients infected by the virus. Doctors say that three-layered surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in protection against the virus.N95 masks, they say, are only meant for use by medical practitioners and caregivers.

According to the official website of the World Health Organisation (WHO), on December 31, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus.

34,16-3-20,Naman to embark on awareness drive on coronavirus,"Amidst ongoing fear of Coronavirus, social cultural organisation, ‘Naman-Shaheedon ke Sapno ko’ has decided to postpone its annual ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in the city. The event was scheduled on March 23. Meanwhile, the organising has announced another campaign in the wake of COVID 19.

Founder of Naman Amarpreet Singh Kale, said that in view of the spread of Coronavirus, a meeting of the organisation was held and it was unanimously decided to postpone the event.

“We will organise Tiranga Yatra after the situation gets normal. However, we are using our team to educate people on ways to take preventive measures from the virus. We have printed several posters and pamphlets that will be distributed at 300 different points across the city. We will send our volunteers at different areas across the city and nearby villages educating people,” said Kale.

Addressing the media, Kale said that the idea behind Tiranga Yatra is to instill nationalism among the people of Jamshedpur. This was the reason a social cultural organisation, Naman-Shaheedon ke sapno- was formed. The organisation also felicitates soldiers and their family members for their contribution to national security during several wars. However, in view of the prevailing situation they have decided to postpone the event and organise the yatra when the fear of the virus is over.

He reiterated that Tiranga Yatra will be organised in memory of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh along with Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar who were hanged to death on grand scale only after some time.

“We want to make the legacy remain in the heart of Indians that keeps us all inspired forever. They were the ones who fought against British for freedom of India at very young age and their sacrifice was an important catalyst for India’s Independence. As a tribute a march will also be taken out in which students along with senior members of the society will participate,” said Kale.

He said that the according to the present situation they will rather use the team to go door to door and educate people on cleanliness so that they can remain save from the virus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/naman-to-embark-on-awareness-drive-on-coronavirus.html

40,16-3-20,‘Lehron Ka Rajhans’ staged at Ravindra Bhavan,"Marking the closure of 35th National Theatre Festival, play ‘Lehron Ka Rajhans’ was staged at Ravindra Bhavan on Sunday.

The play was directed by Sharad Sharma from Ujjain. The play is a story written by Mohan Rakesh.

At the centre of the play is Gautam Buddha's younger brother Nanda and his wife Sundari. After Gautam Buddha, his wife Yashodhara has also become a monk. Dhamma Sharanam is a buzzing environment in the atmosphere.

At the same time, the duality of Nanda is what they should do. On the one hand, there is extra affection for the beauty, and on the other hand, the brother's Dhamma is reclusive. They swing like a pendulum. The narrative of the mutual duality of worldly pleasures and spiritual peace comes to the fore through Nanda and Sundari.

Many of the play's dialogues enter the psyche like the immortal utterance. Like Nanda says, everyone has the right to think, however good to say. At the same place, the monk Anand Nanda says, you have a room, a garden, but there is no home, where your soul may get satisfaction.

The play was wonderfully performed by the artists.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---lehron-ka-rajhans----staged-at-ravindra-bhavan.html
41,16-3-20,State Govt using COVID-19 scare against our protest: Joshi,"The members of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association claimed that the State Government is using the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to thwart their protest against reservations in promotions. According to the members, the government evoked Uttarakhand Epidemic Act 2020 just to oppress them and their strike across the state. Besides, the protesting members also organised a two-wheeler rally in Dehradun against the State Government on Sunday.

Addressing a Press conference on Sunday, the state head of the association Deepak Joshi said that Uttarakhand Government has not prohibited gatherings in malls, markets, bus stations, railway stations and especially the Jhanda Mela in which thousands of people gather from other States too.

According to him, the government has evoked Uttarakhand Epidemic Act 2020 specifically to influence their protest through its oppressive policies. He said, “We will continue our strike irrespective of coronavirus while taking proper precautions during the protest and even if the situation worsens, we will continue the work boycott by staying at home.

No one from our association will resume work until the government accepts our demands.” While addressing the media, Joshi informed that considering the threat of coronavirus and public welfare, the employees from health services will not be joining the strike but will extend the time of their work boycott from two hours to two and a half hours.

“Considering the current coronavirus situation, the employees from health services which include allopathic doctors, nurses and pharmacists will not join the protest full time from Monday but will extend their work boycot hours,” said Joshi. According to the protesting employees, the employees from health services will join the protest full time after March 25.

42,16-3-20,"Psychotropic drugs ‘overprescribed’, says CIP Director","Psychotropic drugs are being overprescribed by private practitioners in Jharkhand, Director of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Dr D Ram has said, admitting that lack of infrastructure in private clinics and vested interests of some pharmaceutical companies could be responsible for the practice.

“Psychotropic drugs are being overprescribed by psychiatrists practicing in private. This over-prescription of drugs may have an adverse effect on patients,” he said. “People suffering from minor to moderate mental health issues respond better to psychotherapy, and sometimes, to a combination of medicines and psychotherapy,” Ram told this newspaper while answering a query at a press conference held recently.

On the question of whether pharmaceutical companies had vested interests in the over-prescription of psychotropic drugs or not, he did not directly admit the role of pharmaceutical companies. However, he said, “You know how the state of affairs are. What should I say on this?”

While CIP has a thorough process in place to detect and address mental illnesses, most of the private clinics give a miss to psychotherapy – an important tool for addressing mental illnesses, say doctors. Clinical psychology comes handy in dealing with mental illnesses developed due to life events such as the loss of a loved one, challenges in dealing with relationships or unemployment, say doctors.

“Most of the private clinics do not have clinical psychologists; therefore, they heavily rely on drugs. However, mental illnesses triggered by life events are best addressed with the help of psychotherapy, which we call counseling in colloquial terms,” said Dr. Chritoday Khess, a senior doctor at CIP.

When a person who is in need of a Clinical Psychologist is only given drugs, he or she takes more time to recover. And in some cases, treating only with drugs may even aggravate the symptoms, doctors say. Deblina Halder, a Financial Editor who has dealt with depression since a young age, recalled her experience of taking psychotropic drugs for more than a year while dealing with the trauma of sexual abuse as a child. “Drugs did not work for me as the fear of staying in close proximity to a male adult persisted. I overcame the fear only through therapy. Honestly, medicines only made me numb and drowsy,” she said.

Psychotropic drugs also cause some harmful side effects and should be prescribed only if the patient is in need of it, say doctors.

Some of the common side effects of psychotropic drugs are erectile dysfunction in men, drowsiness, aggravation of other mental health issues, and digestive disorders, say doctors. “Despite the side effects, psychotropic drugs are extremely effective in treating mental illnesses.

Drugs were invented for a purpose, and they should be used only for it,” said Dr. Khess.

According to a study conducted by World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 6.5 per cent of the Indian population suffers from some form of serious mental disorders, with no discernible rural-urban differences.

Though there are effective measures and treatments, there is an extreme shortage of mental health workers like psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors. As reported latest in 2014, it was as low as ‘’one in 100,000 people’’, says a leading Indian news portal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/psychotropic-drugs----overprescribed-----says-cip-director.html
43,16-3-20,Socialists on anti-CAA campaign reach BBSR,"A hearty reception was given to a Samajbadi (socialist) team, which is on a campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), at the Lohia Academy here on Saturday evening.

To mark the 85th year of the Congress Socialist Party that played a big role in the Independence struggle, a group of leaders are visiting different States and campaigning against divisive politics, communalism and economic crises.

The team led by Dr Sunilam, a former MLA and Arun Srivasav reached Bhubaneswar on Saturday afternoon. A welcome meeting was held under the chairmanship of Debiprasad Prusti, State coordinator of the Samajbadi Samagam.

Speakers criticised the Narendra Modi Government at the Centre for the present economic crises, rising unemployment and farmers’ plights in the country. They alleged that presently communal politics is dividing the peace loving countrymen in the line of religion and held PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah responsible for this.

Poor, Dalits, tribals and minorities are the worst sufferers of the situation. The economic crisis marked now is manmade meant to help a few businessmen and industrial houses. There is an unholy nexus between people in power and industrial houses, they alleged.

They appealed to people believing in different political ideologies to come together under a common minimum programme (CMP) to save the Indian democracy and the Constitution.

Among others, Prafulla Samantara, Krushnachandra Patra, Debaprasad Ray Mohapatra, Shivananda Ray, Birendra Nayak, Prahallad Singh, Amiya Pandav, Sudarshan Pradhan, Tusharkant, Nishikanta Mohapatra, Biswapriya Kanungo. Bijaya Pradhan, Mohammed Israil and Sasmita Jena spoke.

49,16-3-20,"Deepak Prakash meets Saryu, seeks RS support","The election for two Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand is getting interesting by the day. While in one seat the victory of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren is sure, for another seat the contest is going to become bipolar between BJP candidate and party State president Deepak Prakash and Congress candidate Shahzada Anwar.

In its effort to garner necessary support for Rajya Sabha elections, Prakash on Sunday met rebel BJP leader and former Minister Saryu Roy at his residence. Roy the independent MLA from Jamshedpur East defeated former Chief Minister Raghubar Das in last Assembly election. Roy accompanied by BJP Chatra MP Sunil Singh, Bokaro MLA Viranchi Narayan and others urged Roy to support Prakash.

Prakash said, “Roy is our very good friend and we have our association since RSS days. He positively assured me of supporting in Rajya Sabha election.” Roy’s association with RSS is for more than four decades as he started his political career as RSS pracharak. Sources said in Roy’s victory from Jamshedpur East against Raghubar Das, the seat Das had represented for five times, RSS cadres played big role. Roy association with RSS can be gauged from the fact that in January when Roy visited Maa Vindhyavasini Mandir Vindhyachal Dham (Mirzapur) he met RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat. Though Roy termed the meeting with Bhagwat as merely coincidental, but it was talking point at state political corridor. Sources said that the BJP leadership is using the influence of RSS to bring Roy for supporting Prakash.

The BJP state president said that apart from Roy, BJP is expecting support from other legislators and the party is confident of victory in Rajya Sabha election.

Sources said that Prakash victor is sure as the party has already crossed the magic number. For Prakash’s victory the party requires the support of 27 MLAs. The party already has support of 26 MLAs including Marandi. The two AJSU MLAs have already announced to support Prakash. Moreover, former BJP leader and Barkatha MLA Amit Yadav too had announced to support Prakash.

Prakash enjoys a close relationship with J.P. Nadda right from the time the BJP national president’s father, N.L. Nadda, was vice-chancellor of Ranchi University from August 1978 to April 1980. Apart from closeness with Nadda, he also enjoys good rapport with Babulal Marandi. In 2000 when Marandi became first Chief Minister of State, Prakash was made the chairman of Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation Ltd.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/deepak-prakash-meets-saryu--seeks-rs-support.html
50,16-3-20,COVID-19 Pandemic— A wake up call,"Coronavirus has spread across the world reaffirming the fact that health is not only a localised problem to be dealt by one country but a global issue. In the current scenario, the whole world is vulnerable.

This viral infection has flu like symptoms which can also lead to difficulty in breathing and ultimately the patient can also die. There is currently no vaccine.

The scientists are still not sure how it spread to humans from bats or other suepected animals. There are two theories- one is that some person has consumed the meat of a carrier bat or was infected through the urine or stool or the carrier.

Coronavirus was previously never isolated in humans and emerged first in China, in the city of Wuhan in December 2019. It has now spread in over 100 countries of the world and has infected more than one lakh people within two months. It has killed more than 3,500 people accounting to 3.5 percent mortality rate. There is apprehension that it may further spread and may affect the whole world.

Health, education and nutrition are the fundamental needs of any individual. Health, out of the three, is important in every stage of life because only a healthy person can achieve the desired goal and make their life better. Infection is not new in the humans.

There is scientific proof that origin of virus and bacteria is noted far before the origin of human species.

Infection is not new to our country too. It is believed that we all are infected with one or other virus or bacteria at some point of time in our lives. The main cause and spread of infection in our country is either ignorance or lack of awareness. We are not giving much importance to personal hygiene and public sanitation as we should.

As India is a tropical country hence there is frequent change in weather. The incidence of common cold is widespread which we see on a daily basis. The rate of infection is directly related to the personal hygiene and public sanitation.

Although, even if we have the highest sanitation and hygiene standards, the bacterial and viral diseases can never finish off but definitely the incidence of clinical infection and spread can be controlled. The operation theatres are disinfected with the aim of reducing the number of bacteria and virus to an almost negligible count so that the possibility of the infection becomes minimum.

It should be understood that we all share the same environment in our family but it is usually one of us who gets the infection, not the others. The body resistance can be improved with good diet. There is no specific treatment for coronavirus yet apart from the general method of increasing the body resistance and giving supportive treatment. Taking a balanced, nutritious diet, maintaining personal hygiene and sanitation can prevent coronavirus infection.

Coronavirus has elicited the attention and response of the whole world. China has proved and world has agreed that the principle of isolation is quite effective in controlling and containing the spread of coronavirus.

The Chinese government has isolated nine million population of Wuhan. If anybody was suspected, then he or she was investigated and if found positive for coronavirus- admitted in the hospital. China has controlled the spread of this infection significantly with this measure.We would like to emphasise the importance of isolation here. Isolation is not a new trend but has been going on in our country for centuries. Due to tradition of isolation, the mother and new born babies were kept in isolation in the cleanest area of the house. Nobody was allowed to meet the mother and the baby but only the designated lady called dai.

The aim of isolation was to keep the mother and baby in a safe and clean area to prevent or avoid any infection, knowing very well that the body resistance of the mother after delivery and new born baby is the least at that time.

If we analyse seriously, that if there is a boundary for each house then why should not there should be a natural boundary for a city so that cities can be separated from each other.Contrary to the above principle, there is significant crowd in our hospitals. There is a social trend in our country, there are many friends and relatives who don't visit the patients home for years together even for social ceremonies like marriage and death but if that person is admitted in the hospital then they will definitely visit.

This kind of crowd not only creates problem for the doctor and hospital staff but the patient also unknowingly.

Here we would like to emphasise that the incidence of corona virus infection is not the last of such epidemic outbreaks but considering the situation and circumstances of our country then there is fair possibility of similar incidence to occur in the near future as well.

This situation makes one wonder if it would be sensible for policy makers and bureaucrats of our country and that of other countries to focus on the value of a natural boundary of at least of few kilometre either of natural forest or manmade greenery between two cities which can work as the isolation areas and act as a wall between these cities, so that god forbid if there is a similar health emergency like coronavirus epidemic, or man-made tragedy like terrorism at least they can be controlled if needed. This will enable protection of people of affected cities and other cities.

It is said that coronavirus can survive from a few hours to five days on surface of any floor or of any objects like chair, table, door knobs, phone etc. They all should be decontaminated with the commercially available anti microbial agents as a precautionary measure.

The tradition of hand washing has been a practice followed for centuries in our country.

We would like to quote that the tradition of hand washing can be seen at any religious place in our country. Hand and feet washing is quite a common social tradition which is very prevalent in citizens of Asian countries irrespective of religion.As the infection is spread by coughing, sneezing or touching infected objects, all should cover the mouth and nose while sneezing/coughing and wash hands frequently.

Hand washing is the most effective measure to prevent infection and can save many more lives which cannot be saved by any expensive machine and medicine. We all are stakeholders and should follow the dictum that prevention is better than cure.

52,16-3-20,"Cong backs RS candidate, says, won’t withdraw","Amidst rumour of horse trading during Rajya Sabha elections, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) said that there was no question of withdrawing its candidate, and that the UPA alliance will win both the seats.

JPCC Chief and Finance Minister of the State, Rameshwar Oraon said that the party can not withdraw its candidate only on the fear of defeat in the election. He was reacting on former Minister in the State Government and Jamshedpur East MLA, Saryu Roy’s statement in which Roy had said that he would talk to JPCC Chief to withdraw the party candidate from the fray to prevent horse trading.

Oraon appealed to Roy that he should extend his support to United Progressive Alliance (UPA) second candidate, Shahjada Anwar. He assured that there is no possibility of horse trading because all 18 MLAs of the party were loyal to the party. If the party will not field its candidate then all MLAs of the party will be free to vote in favour of any candidate, he added.

The Finance Minister of the State said that Congress candidate has support of two MLAs of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), 18 MLAs of Congress, one MLA of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and one independent MLA, Kamlesh Singh. Congress has given opportunity to its grass root level worker instead of a billionaire, he added.

It may be mentioned here that Roy had said on Saturday that fielding Anwar will create situation of horse trading. Out of total 81 members Assembly, a candidate will need the support of at least 27 MLAs to win the election. The JMM has 29 MLAs. After Babulal Marandi joined BJP, the party’s strength will increase to 26.

If the two MLAs of AJSU are included, the number of pro-BJP MLAs increases to 28. In this way JMM and BJP may send their candidates to Rajya Sabha.

For the second seat BJP fielded its newly elected State Chief, Deepak Prakash.

The elections will be held for two of six Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand, currently occupied by independent Parimal Nathwani and RJD’s Premchand Gupta. Shahzada Anwar, who had earlier unsuccessfully contested the Assembly election from Ramgarh thrice as Congress, JMM and RJD candidate, filed his nomination accompanied by senior Congress leaders.

The polling for the two seats will be held as the tenure of two Rajya Sabha members from the State will end on April 9 this year.

The election process started from March 6. Polling will be held on March 26 on ballot paper. The results will be announced at 5 pm on the same day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-backs-rs-candidate--says--won---t-withdraw.html

This is an exhibition that mix Cooked Portraits from the series Food Mythology and the new Totka series, based on Indian Cuisine.

Enora about the exhibition said, “As far as I remember, India crystallized in it, all the existential mysteries, which are revealed into the eyes of the one who want to see.”

The marvelous is everywhere and seizes every chance to be embodied in the smallest details of the daily life : in the small mountains of colorful spices, in the pattern of a sari, in the wide-eyed of Kali, in the rituals flowery protection, in the cacophony of the horns that never disturb the cows chilling on a four-way. It is about permanent saturation, a colorful epileptic score that forcefully invites our senses to a dance that we are not ready for.

“India heckles our habits, upsets our rasas, whispers magnificent mythological stories,” Enora added.

The culinary world is not an exception through the power of mystery, testifying of a very ancient heritage, bequeathed by the Vedas, 7000 years ago; by the delicate balance of the 3 vital energies which go through our body.

“ The Totka series contains all the nods to the symbols that were dear to me: the third eye, Gond art, protective mother earth, knowledge of ayurveda plants, temple offering, chakras, tribal dance and finally Shivatri. I have a great respect for all these mythological references. With regards, I add a final Namaste dedicated to my creative duo, the Indian photographer Varun Namdev” Enoraadded.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/painting-exhibition----totka----on-display-at-alliance-francaise-de-bhopal.html

60,16-3-20,76 PDS retailers replaced by SHGs in Rourkela,"As many as 76 Public Distribution System (PDS) retailers of the city have been removed by the Food Supplies & Consumer Welfare Department to pave path for the SHGs to take over their jobs.

The Government’s decision has left the retailers aggrieved and they are planning to move the Orissa High Court, said sources.

The department had asked the retailers to deposit the requisite amounts for renewal of the dealership for another year. Accordingly, the dealers deposited the amounts, but two days later, the Government took the decision to axe them. The first question is if the department has an agenda to axe certain retailers then why it accepted the renewal fees from them. How far would it be justiceable to engage the SHGs leaving the 76 dealers and their families in starvation? The dealers have also staged protests in front of the Civil Supplies office here.

Source said the department has set a benchmark that if on an average 75% consumers are not taking the PDS materials from a retailer then they would be not allowed for renewal of dealership and, accordingly, the instruction was passed to the district administration and the CSO. But here the administration has enhanced the benchmark to 85% unilaterally.

Besides this, there are certain dealers who have more than 90% but are axed and certain SHG dealers are already there whose average is hardly 45% to 50%, but they are not replaced. Despite this, the authorities are adamant to engage more SHGs. From this, the ill intention of the administration and political conspiracy are apparent, allege the retailers’ association. Against this alleged unethical decision of the authorities, they would legally fight the issue, said the sources.

It may be noted that a total of 2,597 retailers have been axed in the State so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/76-pds-retailers-replaced-by-shgs-in-rourkela.html

66,16-3-20,‘Spend more for skill growth in mineral areas’,"The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court has advised for allocation of more funds for skill development as unemployment is a major issue in rural areas of the State.

The Oversight Authority of the Odisha Mineral Bearing Areas Development Corporation (OMBADC) has been advised to take up more skill development programmes in diverse fields.

The CEC team, which recently visited the mineral bearing areas of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar, has said in its report that while the on-going programmes on skill development have been scientifically planned, the allocation for livelihood promotion appears to be proportionally small.

So more programmes on skill development in diverse fields need to be taken and share of funds for the sector may also be increased, it said.

Similarly, the CEC has also advised the OMBADC to be more proactive keeping in view of improving standard of service. The Oversight Committee of OMBADC has approved Rs11,806.50 crore out of Rs 16,562.27 crore funds available with it in the second phase.

While in first phase, the OMBADC has spent Rs 822.50 crore against an allocation of Rs 869.42 crore from Ad Hoc CAMPA.

About 89 per cent of funds is being utilised for three sectors, drinking water, health and education. While major funds are spent in drinking water, health and education sector, the standard of service is needed to be improved, the CEC suggested.

The OMBADC is needed to lay down basic standards of service to be made available to the general public. Health sector service will have to be planned with reference to the primary health centre, block and district level hospitals and similar standard of service will have to be thought of for the other sectors, including education.

The CEC has observed that the OMBADC projects are being implemented through the concerned line departments of the State Government and are mainly intended to augment the existing Government programme.

Often the OMBADC projects overlap both in terms of the location of the projects and their components because the OMBADC substituting for the State Government is basically extending financial support for schemes, which earlier were funded from the State Budget.

So far as the drinking water projects are concerned, an institutional mechanism is needed to prevent wastage of water from leaking pipes. The CEC team observed that drinking water taps and pipes were seen leaking at various places. Local panchayats could be entrusted with maintenance of water supply system at villages, advised the CEC. Treatment of the catchment areas of the rivers is an absolute must to augment recharge of ground water, it said.

Water conservation and ground water recharge and soil and moisture conservation works need to be undertaken and more allocation is needed for arresting soil erosion on forest floors, pointed out the CEC.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---spend-more-for-skill-growth-in-mineral-areas---.html

69,16-3-20,My encounter with Biju Patnaik at OUAT,"It was sometime in November 1992. I was then Dean, College of Agriculture, Odisha University of Agriculture & Technology (OUAT). We had invited Biju Patnaik, then Chief Minister, as the chief guest for the College Commemoration Day in the morning. The function went on with its usual format of reading the annual performance report, speeches by the Vice-Chancellor and the chief guest and thanks giving. At the end, while CM was leaving, a group of girl students, without my permission, requested him to attend a programme to be presented by them in the evening at around 6 pm. The CM refused as he had other engagements.

It was 5.30 pm. I was in my room clearing some files. I received a call from the CM’s office that the CM would come to attend the programme of the girls at 6 pm.

I rushed to the Assembly Hall of the College. The hall was open, but there was nobody inside it. An attendant was playing some film songs on the microphone. I went to the entrance hall of the college. It was in a mess. There had been an exhibition arranged in the hall in the morning, where each department of the college had presented their research achievements. The exhibition was dismantled in the afternoon, leaving the display tables, torn papers and dust. I went back to my office. Everybody had left except caretaker Mr Samal. I called him and both of us started clearing the entrance hall. We pushed the tables to the staircase room. Mr Samal got a broom and swept the floor. I went out and found some students. I told them to run to the hostels and tell the students to come immediately to the Assembly Hall as the CM was arriving at 6 pm. I rang up girls’ hostel and asked them to come immediately as the CM was arriving to witness their performances. I had an old jeep at my disposal. I sent it to the girls’ hostel to ferry them to the Assembly Hall. I rang up the Vice-Chancellor. He was in his office and came immediately.

The Chief Minister arrived sharp at 6 pm. We received him and brought him to my room. I had some arrangements in my office. I offered him a cup of coffee and some cashew nuts. I tried to engage him with some discussions to gain some time. He ignored, drank his coffee and got up with some cashew nuts in his hands and proceeded towards the Assembly Hall. I followed him keeping some distance as I apprehended the hall might be empty. I had heard that he was free with his hand. Luckily when we reached the Assembly Hall, it was half-full. The girls had also arrived and were on the stage preparing for the show. My students had responded to my SOS.

Within a few minutes, the girls started their programme. The hall became full with the students. The programme was good. At the end of the programme, the CM went on the stage, thanked the girls and left.

He was a brave man short in his temper but with kindness in his heart. My students had once blocked his car when he was coming out of his residence to go to his office. He got down and thrashed some boys but called them for a discussion in the afternoon. Students told me that they had gone prepared to be thrashed. That was the shortest way to draw his attention and get some benefit.

72,16-3-20,People with vested interests playing into the hands of political parties: Mayawati,"In a veiled attack on Bhim army chief Chandrasekhar Azad Ravan, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Sunday said people with vested interests were playing into the hands of rival political parties and claimed that they had nothing to do with Dr BR Ambedkar, his legacy and his movement.

“Even now, people with vested interests are playing into the hands of rival political parties. They have nothing to do with Babasaheb Ambedkar and his movement. Nor they have anything to do with Manyavar Kanshi Ram’s sacrifice and austerity,” Mayawati said without naming the Bhim Army chief.

“The truth is that these people are only using the names of the Dalit icons (Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram) to realise their vested interests,” she said in a statement on Sunday.

Mayawati’s statement assumes significance as it comes on the birth anniversary of BSP founder and her mentor Kanshi Ram and amid reports of Azad floating a new political party.

Sharpening her attack, Mayawati said, “Kanshi Ram had written a book Chamcha Yug to alert the gullible Dalits, tribals, people from backward castes and from other oppressed sections from selfish and bikaau (saleable) people like these.”

Mayawati also said, “Formation of new parties or organisations will not benefit these people, but it will lead to success of the policy of divide and rule of the casteist parties and people opposing these sections, thereby making these people helpless, and then they will never be able to stand on their feet.”

The BSP chief urged all the followers of Kanshi Ram to work hard to fulfill the dreams of Ambedkar, the statement said, adding the birth anniversary of the party founder was celebrated in a simple manner.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/people-with-vested-interests--playing-into-the-hands-of--political-parties--mayawati.html
73,16-3-20,UP tobacco farmers look for support to shift to alternative crops,"With tobacco cultivation on the decline, farmers in Uttar Pradesh are willing to shift to alternative crops if suitable institutional support is available to them.

Tobacco cultivation in Uttar Pradesh has declined from 1,15,000 hectares in 2000-01 to 23,000 hectares in 2017-18, said Giri Institute of Development Studies (GIDS), Lucknow, in its study ‘Economics of Tobacco Farming in India’, conducted in collaboration with Centre for Multi Disciplinary Research (CMDR), Dharwad (Karnataka).

This report is based on key studies carried out in 10 major states growing tobacco, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

The report says that tobacco farmers are willing to shift to other crop if suitable alternatives are made available. Their willingness to shift is conditional in most of the states, subject to institutional support in terms of subsidised inputs, technical know-how on alternate crops and guaranteed crop loan.

According to Prof Fahimuddin S of GIDS, Lucknow, tobacco cultivation has declined in UP due to low price of tobacco, tobacco crop disease and awareness of health hazards of tobacco use. The prices have been quite low and farmers are forced to sell tobacco at 50 per cent less price due to low demand, thus leading to low net returns from tobacco cultivation.

“Many farmers in Uttar Pradesh, who were growing chewing and hookah tobacco, have shifted to growing mustard, cotton, cauliflower, tomato, pea, potato and maize. Other farmers are also willing to leave tobacco cultivation if support for alternative cash crop is made available to them,” he said.

Dr AK Mishra, district programme coordinator, (Etah) diversified agricultural support project, said that farmers were eager to grow medicinal plants and flowers but needed government support.

Lessons can be learnt from states like Kerala, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and North Eastern, where tobacco cultivation has reduced or stopped completely. Diversification of crops in tobacco growing fields of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat needs to be closely observed and analysed, the report said.

The officials in Uttar Pradesh, UP Diversified Agricultural Support Project (UPDASP) say if the success of the programme is sustained, cultivation of tobacco can be totally replaced with alternate crops within next five years.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-tobacco-farmers--look-for-support-to-shift--to-alternative-crops.html

The Yogi government completes three years in office on March 19.

A senior official told The Pioneer here on Sunday that on March 19, the chief minister would hold a press conference and also distribute a booklet highlighting achievements of his government.

In 2018, the Yogi government had celebrated its first anniversary in a grand style by showcasing the cultural diversity of the state. In 2019, the celebrations were cancelled because of imposition of model code of conduct in view of the Lok Sabha election. That time, the chief minister had held a press conference at party office.

84,16-3-20,SP sets eye on 351 seats in UP assembly polls,"If the Bharatiya Janata Party can win over 300 seats in Uttar Pradesh by “spreading lies”, then with honest hard work, truth and by bringing people together, “we can win 351 seats” in 2022, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Sunday.

Pointing out that a palm reader had recently predicted that he would win 350 of the 403 seats in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Yadav said if the SP was voted to power, his government would hold a caste-wise census.

Addressing the media a day after his party’s national executive meeting here, Yadav said his party colleagues had vowed to win 351 of the 403 seats in UP assembly. He said that in the 2022 UP assembly polls, his party would have no alliance but could go for some seat adjustments with like-minded parties.

“In the 2022 assembly polls, the SP will not have pre-roll alliance like the past elections but will have some seat adjustments with like-minded parties,” he said, refusing to name any party saying it was too early.

“Our target is big. I have quoted a number that nobody can imagine. Even we had not imagined that the BJP would win more than 300 seats,” Yadav said.

In the 2017 UP assembly polls, the BJP and its allies had won 325 seats propelling Yogi Adityanath to the chief minister’s seat. The SP, which was in power, managed only 47 seats while the BSP and the Congress trailed even further.

On Sunday, several former leaders of the Bahujan Samaj Party and Bharatiya Janta Party joined the Samajwadi Party.

Yadav said that with the support of his new colleagues, “we won’t fall into any net” woven by the BJP.

Rejecting the BJP’s slogan of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas Sabka Vishwas’ as fake, the former chief minister said the SP slogan would be real as it was taking people together.

Asked about Yogi Adityanath government’s decision to bring an ordinance for recovery of damages to public and private property during protests, Yadav said in the backdrop of the observations made by the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court, the government’s move was an admission that it was doing illegal acts.

“Even the High Court and the Supreme Court have censured the state government, terming the act of putting up hoarding of anti-CAA protesters as illegal but this government was acting like a dictator,” he said.

“The government is doing an illegal act, the cabinet decision has proven this. This government does not care about the High Court or the Supreme Court,” he said.

“Why does the government forget that so many people sitting in government have instigated riots. You tell me, in the history of UP, has any chief minister withdrawn riot cases against himself?” he asked, targeting Yogi Adityanath, who as head of the state has withdrawn cases lodged against him.

The SP chief also announced that his party would not contest the Bihar assembly polls and party MLAs would support the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh,

Meanwhile, several senior leaders of BSP, including former parliamentarians and legislators from Azamgarh and Bundelkhand region, joined the SP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-sets-eye-on-351-seats--in-up-assembly-polls.html

“By preparing for the panchayat polls, the party will strengthen its organisation at the ground level in rural areas and it will certainly give us an edge in the 2022 assembly polls, which are just about two years away from now,” said BJP state general secretary and party in-charge of panchayat polls, Vijay Bahadur Pathak, here on Sunday.

A review meeting on the panchayat polls was held in the state capital on Thursday in which the leadership formed committees of ministers and senior leaders at the divisional level to monitor the preparation.

Pathak said that the BJP was committed to taking every elections seriously and the panchayat polls would not be different as the party cadre would engage themselves at the panchayat and booth level.

He said that only after the organisational structure for panchayat elections was constituted, the party would hold meetings at the divisional, district and block levels to chalk out the poll strategy.

Pathak said that the party does not want to give opposition any opportunity to resurrect itself at the grassroots level ahead of the 2022 elections.

“We will go to the panchayat elections with the slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and development whereas in the past the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party had always misused the power and money to win the polls,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-focusing-on--panchayat-polls.html

106,16-3-20,Rahul slams Govt for hiking excise duty,"Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said he had asked the PM to pass on the benefit of the global oil price crash to Indian consumers, but instead “our genius” hiked excise duty on fuel.

His jibe at the Prime Minister came a day after the Government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre each to garner about Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue.

“Just 3 days ago I had requested @PMOIndia to pass on the benefit of the global oil price crash to Indian consumers, by slashing the prices of petrol & diesel in India. Instead of heeding this advice, our genius has gone and hiked #exciseduty on fuel!” Rahul tweeted.

He also tagged a video of a press conference in which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman purportedly avoids answering a question on why Government has not passed on the benefits of the global oil crash to the people.

The former Congress president on Wednesday had accused Prime Minister Modi of being too busy “destabilising an elected Government” to notice a crash in global oil prices this week. “Hey @PMOIndia, while you were busy destabilising an elected Congress Govt, you may have missed noticing the 35 per cent crash in global oil prices.

“Could you please pass on the benefit to Indians by slashing #petrol prices to under 60? per litre? Will help boost the stalled economy,” the former Congress chief had said on twitter.

The Congress on Saturday had hit out at the Government over the hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel, demanding that the benefit of reduced international crude oil prices should be passed on to the people.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rahul-slams-govt-for-hiking-excise-duty.html

The underlying message of the video conference was unitedly taking on the virus, but Pakistan used the occasion to raise the Kashmir issue, calling for immediate lifting of the “lockdown” there to allow disease containment measures. Pakistan chose to be “churlish” and used the video conference for political point scoring, the sources said.

Pakistan sent their State Minister of Health Zafar Mirza who was uncomfortable while speaking, they said. Pakistan raising the matter reflected “very poorly” on their dealing with the humanitarian issue, the sources said. “Raising the issue was unwarranted and out of context. Pakistan attempted to politicise a humanitarian issue,” a government source said.

India could have kept Pakistan out of the video conference, but as it was a humanitarian issue, the country was invited, the sources said.

108,16-3-20,JeM recruited youths in Kashmir to make online purchase of chemicals,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the 2019 Pulwama attack has revealed that Pakistan-based terror groups like the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) were recruiting gullible youth in Kashmir for making online purchases of chemicals used for manufacturing explosives to fabricate IEDs.

The investigation into the terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel on February 14 last recently led to the arrest of two persons, including 19-year-old Wazir, who during his interrogation gave the officials an insight into the radicalisation process of JeM.

Wazir is alleged to have procured online aluminum powder, high altitude jackets, mobile battery banks and trekking shoes. Aluminum powder is a highly flammable material and used as an ingredient in blasting agents used in commercial mining, they said.

Wazir handed over the aluminium powder to JeM over-ground workers and it was used by terrorists in the February 14 suicide attack when an explosive-laden car hit a CRPF convoy killing 40 personnel.

His interrogation also revealed that the JeM overground workers were brainwashing young boys and preparing them to indulge in terror activities, they further said.

The probe into the Pulwama incident got a fresh impetus after the NIA identified the house where Adil Ahmed Dar, the terrorist who was driving the explosive-laden car, had shot his last propaganda video that was subsequently released by the terror group from Pakistan.

On February 28, the NIA got a major breakthrough in the case when it arrested 22-year-old Shakir Bashir Magrey, a furniture shop owner and resident of Hajibal in Pulwama’s Kakapora.

Magrey had provided shelter and other logistical assistance to suicide bomber Adil. He was introduced to Adil in mid-2018 by Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq and he became a full-time overground worker of the JeM.

This month, the NIA has arrested four persons-- Tariq Ahmed Shah, his daughter Insha Jan, Wazir-ul-Islam and Mohammad Abbass Rather. The number of people arrested in this case has now gone up to five. The key conspirators have since been killed by the security forces during encounters.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/jem-recruited-youths-in-kashmir-to-make-online-purchase-of-chemicals.html

117,16-3-20,"NPA troubles to continue in FY21, says Yes Bank","Yes Bank expects pressures from sour loans, which led it to declare the highest loss for any private sector lender at Rs 18,654 crore for the December quarter, to continue even in FY21, but CEO-designate Prashant Kumar is confident of its survival after a Rs 10,000-crore capital infusion.

The bank witnessed withdrawals of over Rs 72,000 crore of deposits in the last six months to Rs 1.37 lakh crore, but the Rs 10,000 crore capital infusion, coupled with over 1,000 branches and a strong customer base makes Kumar confident of Yes Bank continuing to be a “going concern”.

“The proposed capital infusion and the bank’s strong customer base and branch network will enable the Bank to continue its business for the foreseeable future, so as to be able to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in its normal course of business,” the bank said, quoting Kumar’s assessment.

Kumar is at present the bank’s RBI-appointed administrator and will be taking over as CEO on Wednesday evening once the bank comes out of moratorium.

The heavy reverses on corporate lending -- nearly a third of the overall loans have turned sour -- have probably led the new management led by Kumar to earmark focus on retail and small business loans as a priority going forward, according to its investor presentation.

The bank has also made it clear that additional-tier 1 bonds of over Rs 8,500 crore will have to be written-down completely for the reconstruction to begin, setting the stage for a legal battle.

Kumar had to be installed as the administrator of the bank on March 5 by the RBI, after the government superseded its board due to an inability to raise much-needed capital.

Much of the troubles at the bank are attributed to the alleged mishandling by its co-founder and former chief executive Rana Kapoor, whose term was cut short by the RBI due to governance lapses.

Under Kapoor’s successor Ravneet Gill, it began an accelerated recognition of the stress hidden in the balance sheet, which started with reporting its maiden quarterly loss in March 2019. Kumar has continued the widely prevalent practice of an incoming head cleaning up the books and preferring to start with a clean slate.

However, in its investor presentation, Yes Bank said slippages, which went up to Rs 24,587 crore in the December quarter, will normalise only in FY22.

The bank told investors that it expects slippages to be at 5 per cent of the assets in FY21. The assets decreased by 22 per cent to Rs 2.90 lakh crore at the end of December 2019, as compared to the year-ago period.

Compared to the preceding quarter, advances overdue for 31 to 90 days (levels before they get tagged as NPAs), declined 43 per cent to Rs 13,911 crore.

The higher slippages and a reduction in loan book were key reasons for the 60 per cent decline in the core net interest income at Rs 1,065 crore, and also narrowing of the net interest margin to 1.4 per cent from 3.3 per cent a year ago.

Deposit mobilisation, accelerating resolution of the stressed assets and cost optimisation have been marked as the key focus areas, along with a shift to low-value loans by Kumar.

In the high-value loans segment, the strategy is to reduce exposure to commercial realty, non-bank lenders, housing finance companies, infrastructure and electricity sectors, it said.

Meanwhile, the bank’s reconstruction has been set-off with the issue of Rs 10,000 crore of shares to the consortium led by SBI, which also includes IDFC First Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, the bank informed the exchanges.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/npa-troubles-to-continue-in-fy21--says-yes-bank.html
118,16-3-20,Saudi Aramco reports 20.6% drop in 2019 profit,"Saudi Aramco on Sunday reported a 20.6 per cent drop in its net profit for 2019 due to low oil prices and production levels, the company said in a statement.

These are the first annual results to be announced by the energy giant after its historical $29.4 billion initial public offering and listing on the Saudi Tadawul market last December.

Aramco posted net profits of $88.2 billion last year compared to $111.1 billion in 2018, Monday’s statement said.

“The decrease was primarily due to lower crude oil prices and production volumes, coupled with declining refining and chemical margins,” it said.

The company also made $1.6 billion of impairment provisions for losses associated with Sadara Chemical Company, an Aramco subsidiary.

“2019 was an exceptional year for Saudi Aramco. Through a variety of circumstances — some planned and some not — the world was offered unprecedented insight into Saudi Aramco’s agility and resilience,” CEO Amin Nasser said.

“Our unique scale, low costs, and resilience came together to deliver both growth and world-leading returns, while also maintaining our position as one of the world’s most reliable energy companies,” Nasser said.

The earnings for last year are not affected by the coronavirus outbreak or the ongoing price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has sent oil prices crashing.

Aramco said it will distribute dividends worth $73.2 billion for 2019 but based on its commitments under the IPO, its dividends for the next five years starting this year will be at least $75 billion.

It said its capital spending last year dropped to $32.8 billion from $35.1 billion in 2018.

The company expects capital spending, which is expenditure on projects, to be between $25 billion and $30 billion this year “in light of current market conditions and recent commodity price volatility.”

But it said that capital expenditure for 2021 and beyond is currently under review. The results were announced amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia after they failed to agree on additional output cuts to support prices dented by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/saudi-aramco-reports-20-6--drop-in-2019-profit.html
119,16-3-20,Petrol price cut by 12 paise,"Petrol price was on Sunday cut by 12 paise a litre and diesel rates by 14 paise as oil companies moderated rate reduction amid the fall in global prices to absorb the hike in excise duty on fuel by the Government.

Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 69.75 per litre, while diesel is priced at Rs 62.44, according to a price notification of state-owned oil firms.

Delhi has the lowest fuel prices among metros because of lower state taxes.

Industry sources said the reduction in rates would have been higher but for the Rs 3 per litre increase in excise duty effected on Saturday.

Oil companies, they said, had been moderating reduction warranted in retail prices in anticipation of an excise duty hike. The gains they thus accumulated were adjusted against the price hike that would have been necessary because of the increase in excise duty. Some moderation in passing on the decline in international prices in the near future to domestic consumers will continue till all of the excise duty impact is recovered, the sources added.

The Government had on Saturday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre each to garner about Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue as it repeated its 2014-15 act of not passing on gains arising from the slump in international oil prices.

According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel. Additionally, road cess was raised by Rs 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.

The Government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped Government’s excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.

It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol-price-cut-by-12-paise-litre.html

121,16-3-20,"GST hike to derail mobile industry, lead to job losses: ICEA","Increasing GST on mobile phones to 18 per cent from 12 per cent at the time of economic slowdown coupled with coronavirus outbreak will derail the industry and lead to job losses, industry body ICEA said on Sunday.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association said the decision will put a burden of Rs 15,000 crore on common man and adversely impact over 100 crore Indian consumers.

“When coronavirus is spreading panic, economic slowdown is at its peak, consumer sentiment is battered and stock markets are in free-fall, increasing GST is both counter-intuitive and insensitive. This will lead to immediate job losses and severely dampen future investments in manufacturing,” ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said in a statement.

He said that till June 2017 consumers were paying 4-5 per cent value added tax and 1 per cent on excise duty and later they were burdened with 12 per cent GST which has been further increased to 18 per cent.

“The 18 per cent GST hike will also bring back the bad old days of early 2000s when the grey market in mobile phones was rampant at 90 per cent. It reverses years of painstaking efforts by governments and industry to increase mobile manufacturing and penetration by sensible policy interventions and tax rationalisation,” Mohindroo said.

He said this move will also prove to be disastrous for the already fragile retailer community wherein lakhs of small and mid-sized retailers survive by selling mobile phones.

A top official of the country’s leading smartphone seller Xiaomi had said on Saturday that smartphone makers will be forced to increase handset prices with this hike in GST.

“As a result of this GST increase, all smartphone makers will be forced to increase prices. This can weaken the demand and mobile industry’s Make in India programme. This could also have long lasting impact on internet penetration and digital India program as majority of Indians access the internet on smartphones,” Xiaomi India Managing Director Manu Jain said.

ICEA said that the GST hike is contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to make India the world leader in mobile phone manufacturing.

Mohindroo said that with hike in GST, it will be difficult to achieve even half the target of $80 billion domestic production of mobile phones in the country by 2025 set under National Policy on Electronics 2019.

Mobile manufacturing production in the country increased five-folds and revenues 10-folds from 58 million units valued at Rs 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to 290 million units valued at Rs 1,81,200 crore in 2018-19.

“The government revenues post GST had doubled from Rs 10,900 crore to Rs 20,700 crore within two years. To strike the sector with a higher GST at this stage is the equivalent of killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Not a savvy move by any stretch,” Mohindroo said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/gst-hike-to-derail-mobile-industry--lead-to-job-losses--icea.html

125,16-3-20,WMO warns widespread transmission of dengue due to climate change,"At a time the deadly coronavirus epidemic is creating havoc, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned widespread transmission of dengue due to climate changes that brings rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall patterns. The WMO has also warned rise of global hunger and large number of displacement due to extreme climatic conditions across the world.

The WMO report on state of global climate 2019 said that the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world population is now at risk of infection.

“In 2019, the world experienced a large increase in dengue cases. Changes in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit dengue virus, increasing the risk of the occurrence of disease.,’ the report said.

In another report, it said that the frequency of dengue outbreaks has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades and is currently the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. Known to exist in only 9 countries in the 1970s, dengue is now endemic in 128 countries and strikes as many as 96 million people each year. The dengue virus is transmitted to humans by two species of mosquito, the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes that also transmit yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya and other viruses

The WMO report on climate change said that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. “ Between 2015 and 2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1°C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Niño event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend”, the report said.

The report warned that for over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018. Among 33 countries affected by food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes a compounding driver together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries and the leading driver in 12 of the 26. The food security situation deteriorated markedly in 2019 in some countries of the Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people, (6.7 million in Ethiopia, 3.1 million in Kenya, 2.1 million in Somalia, 4.5 million in South Sudan, 5.8 million in the Sudan) were estimated to be severely food insecure, only slightly lower than during the severe and prolonged drought in 2016-17.

“More than 6.7 million new internal disaster displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, triggered by hydrometeorological events such as Cyclone Idai in Southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. This number was forecast to reach close to 22 million in 2019, up from 17.2 million in 2018. Of all natural hazards, floods and storms contributed most to displacement,” it said.

According to report, an unusually and exceptional heatwave in Europe, unprecedented floods and droughts, above above the long-term average in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar, and flooding led to the loss of some 2,200 lives in the region, ongoing warming in Antarctica saw large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier, with repercussions for sea level rise, and carbon dioxide emissions spiked following the devastating Australian bushfires, which spread smoke and pollutants around the world.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/wmo-warns-widespread-transmission-of-dengue-due-to-climate-change.html

131,16-3-20,"Corona: Construction, transport, chemical manufacturing likely to be worst-affected, says report","Construction, transport and chemical manufacturing sectors are likely to be the worst-affected by the coronavirus pandemic in China, says a report. However, India’s top imports — crude oil and gems and jewellery — which collectively account for 46 per cent of total imports are relatively insulated from the public health crisis in China, according to the report by ICICI Securities.

The novel coronavirus which originated in China’s Wuhan city towards the end of 2019 has so far claimed over 5,000 lives and infected more than 1 lakh people globally. Daily death toll due to the virus is still very high and given the number of infected people, the battle with the virus is far from over, it said.

Since the severity of the virus became known, global financial markets have been on the edge. Although most of deaths are in China, the virus has reportedly spread to about 100 countries and has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. Out of India’s total imports of $507 billion in FY19, 26 per cent of the basket, which comprises iron and steel and inorganic chemicals, is likely to be affected modestly.

“We expect the impact on iron and steel to be moderate because India imports 11 per cent of its iron and steel from China. Also, India’s biggest import source country for iron and steel, South Korea imports 20 per cent of its requirement from China.

“Similarly, we expect the impact on inorganic chemical to be moderate as well since India imports almost 15 per cent of its inorganic chemicals from China,” the report noted.

Further, there are five import items that heavily depend on China. They are — electrical machinery, machinery and mechanical appliances, organic chemicals, plastics and optical and surgical instruments. These items collectively account for 28 per cent of India’s import basket.

141,16-3-20,Volatility to rule markets: Analysts,"Equity markets are likely to see more volatility this week and may also witness a relief rally after suffering a massive drubbing recently due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts said.

In a nerve-wracking week for the markets, the BSE Sensex plummeted 3,473.14 points or 9.24 per cent while the NSE Nifty lost 1,034.25 points or 9.41 per cent, largely in tandem with global equities which succumbed to panic selling triggered by the coronavirus outbreak.

Domestic markets witnessed a roller-coaster session on Friday, with trading being halted for the first time in 12 years as benchmarks plunged over 10 per cent in opening trade, before staging a record-shattering comeback.

Analysts said participants would keep an eye on the spread of the coronavirus, as well as further stimulus measures by global central banks and governments. The US Federal Reserve is also scheduled to announce its rate decision this week.

“Markets would take a while to recover from this significant price damage. While volatility may continue in coming days, we could see intermittent relief rallies, however these are likely to be short-lived. In such times of global volatility, retail investors should keep calm and not panic,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The number of novel coronavirus cases in the country rose to 107 on Sunday, with 12 fresh cases in Maharashtra, the Union Health Ministry said. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600.

On the macroeconomic front, WPI inflation data will be announced on Monday.

“Temporary relief was seen in the global markets based on stimulus hopes. Investors are still advised to be alert since the volatility, as measured by the volatility index has reached all-time highs. Sentiments around the spread of the virus will continue to drive the markets and any signs of the rate of infections falling will be a positive,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

145,16-3-20,Iran urges people to stay home as virus kills 113 in a day,"Iran on Sunday urged its citizens to stick to guidelines and stay at home to stop the new coronavirus spreading, as it announced 113 deaths in a day.

The latest death toll announced by the Health Ministry took to 724 the official number of people to have been killed by the disease since last month.

People “should cancel all travel and stay at home so that we may see the situation improving in the coming days,” ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference.

Jahanpour also reported 1,209 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, raising the total to 13,938.

“The good news is that more than 4,590 of the overall confirmed cases have recovered” and the patients have been discharged from hospitals, he added.

Tehran province had the highest number of new infections with 251 fresh cases. Khorasan Razavi province, home to the holy Shiite city of Mashhad, followed with 143 cases.

“The cases there will probably increase,” the official said, calling on everyone to cease from travelling to the northeastern province.

Mashhad’s Imam Reza shrine receives many devout Iranians every year, especially around the country’s New Year holidays which start on March 20.

The outbreak in Iran is one of the deadliest outside of China, where the disease originated.

148,16-3-20,"Biden, Sanders to debate against backdrop of global pandemic","As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago.

The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday’s contest.

Rising infections in the United States and around the world have prompted a dramatic slowdown of global travel, upended financial markets, and raised questions about President Donald Trump’s ability to lead the nation through a prolonged period of uncertainty.

Just two Democrats — former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — remain to make the case that they are best-positioned to challenge Trump in November.

Five other candidates who joined them on stage in the February 25 debate in South Carolina have dropped out, with many rallying behind Biden’s surging candidacy.

For both Biden and Sanders, the debate is a moment to display their leadership skills in front of what could be one of the largest audiences of the primary.

They’ll aim to draw a contrast with Trump, but also with each other, arguing that they have the right experience, temperament and policy prescriptions to lead the nation through a crisis.

“Moments like these don’t come around often in campaigns and this is a perfect opportunity to show millions that you have what it takes,” said Robert Gibbs, former White House press secretary and campaign adviser to President Barack Obama.

“They must show voters they are the answer to what is missing right now by being calm, honest, ready to lead and empathetic.”

The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday’s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/biden--sanders-to-debate-against-backdrop-of-global-pandemic.html
149,16-3-20,Tech tutor for missed classes,"If there is any silver lining to COVID-19, it is that schools should now develop a viable remote learning module of teaching and examinations, says Team Viva

Now that coronavirus is a pandemic and schools and colleges are shut across the country, how will children make up for syllabus gaps and prepare for crucial exams that will take them to the next level? The answer clearly lies in online tutorials, exams and assessments that can maintain a continuity of the learning process without bothering about physical attendance. If there is any silver lining to Covid-19, it is that all schools evolve a digital learning plan and put tools in place to enable a quick pivot to remote learning if needed. It is also a good time to take stock of developing digital infrastructure and access that is affordable and uniform. For the world will bump into from one crisis to the next but knowledge and wisdom are needed to tackle them. Says Pankaj Kumar Singh, MD of Cambridge Montessori pre schools, “It’s the worst time for an epidemic as board exams are still on. The closures can be a serious threat to children’s academic progress, safety and social lives. This will have an impact on the next academic session too.”

Is virtual learning the way out? In a country like India, socio-economic equity is the biggest obstacle in preparing for online learning. There is a problem of over-served and underserved areas. The challenge for us is to ensure the strength of affordable devices and bandwidth in rural areas to universalise digital classrooms. Schools that have digital learning modules are already ahead and, therefore, should not make technology appear elitist. District administrations must figure out how to buy or rent Wi-Fi hotspots and then have a community plan for distributing both devices and hotspots.

During a school shutdown such as now, parents may also be working from home, meaning several people could be competing for one or two computers. Therefore, we must ensure smartphone-friendly apps so that there is no stress on access. An ill-conceived digital module can adversely affect low-income students and kids with special needs. “It’s a great option but now is a good time to start the research required for developing certain skills and equipment. Not all students might have the equipment or the right machinery in their household to learn the designing techniques,” says Akshara Dalal, Director of the JD Institute of Fashion Technology.

She argues that the popularity of online education modules would help students develop more than just academic skills. “Virtual learning is a great way to develop rounded perspectives because it promotes critical thinking and application beyond what academic sessions deliver. It can be more of a practical work, where students can self-explore. I believe that sometimes when students keep coming to classes regularly, they get limited to an extent by the teachers’ interpretation or they might get influenced by their classmates. So it can be an interesting turn.”

For Dharini Upadhyaya, co-founder and co-CEO of FSM and Pankaj, e-learning is the future as institutions have no other way out at the moment to keep things under control. “We must find interesting topics for engagement. Education is not just confined to conventional mainstream subjects. It’s also learning about allied subjects. Various media will, in fact, increase the curiosity of kids. Parents should look at alternatives such as online education, covering interesting concepts. One of the subjects can be arts,” says he. He also emphasises the need for educating both teachers and students on online protocols as to time slots, parking and uploading lessons in cloud data and stick to check-in and check-out times. Above all, educators must include virtual meetings, live chats or video tutorials to maintain a human connection. This need was felt after schools closed for a long time in Wuhan.

After weeks of largely being confined to their apartments, teachers began calling each other and leaving the lines open, even if they weren’t talking. They simply wanted the comfort of being able to speak up and have someone hear their voices. Teachers and students do miss each other.

Also, Indian institutions can follow the example of Coursera, a US online education company that recently announced it would provide any impacted university in the world with free access to its 3,800 courses online. Open online courses were originally born a decade ago to democratise access to higher education. Students and teachers around the globe at first became very attracted to the world’s largest ed-tech experiment. However, institutions later grew disappointed as the reachability and affordability came into question. Hence, the need of the hour is not to develop concessional but functional, scalable and viable models. This effort certainly won’t go waste.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tech-tutor-for-missed-classes-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/tech-tutor-for-missed-classes.html

151,16-3-20,Try again,"With painted faces, artists fight facial recognition technology

As night falls in London, Georgina Rowlands and Anna Hart start applying makeup. Instead of lipstick and eyeliner, they’re covering their faces with geometric shapes.

Rowlands has long narrow blue triangles and thin white rectangles criss-crossing her face. Hart has a collection of red, orange and white angular shapes on hers.

They’re two of the four founders of the Dazzle Club, a group of artists set up last year to provoke discussion about the growing using of facial recognition technology. The group holds monthly silent walks through different parts of London to raise awareness about the technology, which they say is being used for “rampant surveillance.” Other concerns include its lack of regulation, inaccuracy and how it affects public spaces.

Some 19 people attended the most recent event in the East London neighbourhood of Shoreditch and anyone can take part in the walks, in which participants have to paint their faces in a style called CV Dazzle.

The technique, developed by artist and researcher Adam Harvey, is aimed at camouflaging against facial detection systems, which turn images of faces into mathematical formulas that can be analysed by algorithms. CV Dazzle — where CV is short for computer vision — uses cubist-inspired designs to thwart the computer, said Rowlands.

“You’re trying to kind of scramble that by applying these kind of random colours and patterns,” she said. “The most important is having light and dark colours. So we often go for blacks and whites, very contrasting colours, because you’re trying to mess with the shadows and highlights of your face.”

A similar technique was used extensively in World War I to camouflage British naval ships and confuse opponents about the actual heading or location of the ships. To test that their designs work, they use the simple face detection feature on their smartphone cameras. “I can see that I’m hidden, it’s not detecting me,” Rowlands said, checking her phone to see her face doesn’t have a square around it. The rise of facial recognition technology is being tested and spreading in developed democracies after aggressive use in some more authoritarian countries like China.

Britain has long been used to surveillance cameras in public spaces to counter security threats and London is ranked as having one of the world’s highest concentrations of closed-circuit television cameras. But that acceptance is being tested as authorities and corporations increasingly seek to deploy a new generation of cameras with facial recognition technology while activists, lawmakers and independent experts raise concerns about mass surveillance, privacy, and accuracy.

Opposition to algorithmic surveillance is not limited to Britain. Russia activists were reportedly arrested last month for holding a similar face paint protest over Moscow’s facial recognition cameras. Hong Kong pro-democracy activists routinely use face masks in street protests to hide their identities. Rights groups in Serbia and Uganda have opposed government projects to install Chinese-supplied cameras.

Other designers have come up with counter measures like sunglasses that reflect infrared light to blind cameras. “There is a movement of resistance against facial recognition that we are actively participating in and we want to kind of further initiate,” said Rowlands.

Rowlands, Hart and two other artists founded the Dazzle Club in August, following news that London’s King’s Cross district — a busy transport hub where many big offices are being built rapidly — had quietly experimented with live facial recognition cameras without public knowledge or consent, sparking a backlash.

London police recently started using live facial recognition cameras on operational deployments. Last week officers arrested a woman wanted for assault after the cameras picked her out of a street crowd on a busy shopping street. Police say new technology is needed to keep the public safe and images of innocent people are deleted immediately.

Public attitudes to facial recognition technology in Britain appear to be mixed, according to one survey last year, which found most people said they don’t know enough about it but nearly half said they should be able to opt out.

The Dazzle Club’s founders say they’re worried about the effect that the technology has on people in public if cameras are collecting their biometric data — facial images — without clearly explaining what’s being done with it.

“We’re having to adjust our behaviour in public space in a way that I think is problematic,” said Hart.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/try-again-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/try-again.html

153,16-3-20,Bag a New Deal,"Plastic ban strengthens the role of women in the informal sector by generating alternative employment opportunities for them, says Aparna Deswal

In June 2018 the Indian government announced that it was mandatory to eliminate single-use plastics by 2022. Last year, there were speculations that the first big step in the fight against disposable plastic would be taken on October 2, Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th anniversary. However, the government shelved the plan to outlaw single-use plastics on the occasion saying that it “would have been disruptive for the industry at a time when it is coping with an economic slowdown and job losses.” As a part of the campaign, 18 states have imposed a complete ban on plastic carry-bags, while five others have a partial prohibition at religious and historical places in place according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Considering that India generates about 2,600 truckloads of plastic every day, this is a positive step for the protection of the environment. As all the states are now looking for alternatives to plastic bags, this ban has created job opportunities in new, largely informal sectors, especially in the rural belts.

In the small town of Kishangarh (also known as Madanganj) in Ajmer district, Rajasthan, the ban on plastic bags has enabled women to be financially empower themselves. The ones residing in the Dungri Mohalla of Kishangarh, work as daily wage labourers in some of the toughest conditions in the informal sector. After toiling for eight hours, they were getting a meagre amount of Rs 250. Tired, they would return home, to cook food and take care of their families. Next day, they would go in search of work again.

In 2010, Rajasthan government had declared the state to be plastic free. The strict instructions, in recent years, by the Green Tribunal and the Rajasthan High Court, have ensured that people across both formal and informal sectors have given up the use of plastic bags. This, over the years, has led to an increase in the demand of bags made out of cloth providing job opportunities to many women.

In the last four to five years, women in the Kishangarh Mohalla have been sewing cloth bags to fulfill this demand. The businesspersons get rags and waste cloth from Surat textile industries in Gujarat and outsource the work to these women to sew bags. Offered Rs 15 for one kilo of cloth bags, these women can earn a maximum Rs 200 a day. This alternative source of income also allows them to work from home and look after their families. Though the rate is low as compared to what they got work they did earlier but working from home compensates for it.

“During the winter season, we get a lot of home-based work like tailoring, embroidering, peeling garlic and peas, chopping vegetables and packing. But sewing of cloth bags comes to us regularly irrespective of the season,” shared a 35-year-old Manju Regar who earns Rs 100 on an average per day while working at her own convenience from her house.

Women find this work not only convenient but also dignified as compared to the work they did as daily wage labourers and domestic helps. Through this they are able to support their families financially without compromising on their health and self-respect. They also believe that since the future has to be plastic-free, the demand for cloth bags will definitely increase, which in turn would increase their chance of getting permanent employment. Achuki Bai, who is 65-years-old, has worked hard for her entire life but has never been rewarded. Sewing cloth bags has enabled her to make money which satisfies her.

Another woman, Geeta Manoharpuriya, works with a non-government organisation. Her other women family members are involved in sewing cloth bags. She shares that they enjoy this work because of the freedom it offers, without any interruption, deadline and any negative impact on their health. They don’t even require any special training for it.

The ban on plastic bags has certainly created new work opportunities for women. Since it will take some time to ban single-use plastic all across the country, this time can be utilised to build skills of such women so that they can become more efficient. This will not only show our preparedness to effectively replace plastic with environment-friendly options but also strengthen the role of women in the informal sector.

157,16-3-20,"Syrian war, rumbling into 10th year, still has global impact","In a world gripped by a pandemic, global unrest and a fast-moving news cycle, it can be difficult to remember that the war in Syria is still happening.

Even before the coronavirus outbreak took over daily lives around the globe, the conflict, which began in early 2011, had largely fallen off the world’s collective radars — reduced to a never-ending fight involving an ever-more complex web of players and refugees that few remember once lived in a country they called home.

But as it enters its tenth year, the war — which gave rise to the Islamic State group and triggered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the 21st century — has shown it is still creating new tragedies that can have an outsized impact on global politics.

Earlier this month, Turkish and Syrian troops were clashing in Syria’s northwest.

That brought NATO-member Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the war, to the brink of direct confrontation, and produced an unprecedented wave of displaced people.

Arguing that it faces a potential new influx of refugees from Syria, Turkey announced it would no longer stop its vast migrant and refugee population from illegally entering Greece, touching off a new crisis for the European Union.

More than half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million people have been driven from their homes, and a staggering 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line, according to the United Nations. Half the country lies in ruins.

A political process does not exist. Contrary to what some may hope, the Syrian war is nowhere near its end-game.

A cease-fire brokered by the Turkish and Russian presidents in Moscow last week may have put the brakes on the Syrian government’s devastating military campaign to retake the northwestern Idlib province. But the halt is not a long-term solution, and the war’s final and most devastating chapter is yet to come.

In the three months before it was paused, the Syrian offensive triggered the largest single wave of displacement of the entire war. That may be dwarfed by the flight of humanity toward Turkey if Syrian President Bashar Assad resumes the assault to retake Idlib, home to some 3 million people.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/syrian-war--rumbling-into-10th-year--still-has-global-impact.html
158,16-3-20,N Korean nuclear negotiator appointed as Austria envoy,"A North Korean nuclear negotiator has been appointed as the Ambassador to Austria, replacing a son-in-law of the country’s founder Kim Il-sung, state media said in a report on Sunday.

Choe Kang-il, acting director-general of the Foreign Ministry’s North American affairs bureau, had been involved in nuclear negotiations with the US, including preparatory talks ahead of the second summit in Hanoi last year between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and American President Donald Trump, Yonhap News Agency quoted Pyongyang’s KCNA as saying in a report on Saturday.

Choe was named to replace Kim Kwang-sop, the husband of Kim Kyong-jin, a half-sister of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, according to the KCNA.

The former envoy has been in the position for 27 years since his appointment in 1993.

The KCNA also confirmed that Ju Won-chol has replaced Kim Pyong-il, a half-brother of late leader Kim Jong-il, as ambassador to Czech Republic.

161,16-3-20,Self-management is the key,"If the people in authority initiate change, it will bring about a transformation among the common public too, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Over the past century, the world has changed manifold and with it, the landscape of development. Today, newer countries have emerged and our planet is now home to more than seven billion people where one in every four of them is a young person. The geopolitical scenario has also changed, with developing countries emerging as major economic forces and political powers. The coming century certainly belongs to India which is almost the size of a subcontinent and has an abundance of natural and human resources.

We all know that our country is home to about 100 million hectares of forest area with a rich variety of flora and fauna. There are thousands of gardens, big and small, and a great mass of cultivable land that can yield good crops of grains, pulses, vegetables, fruits, flowers and valuable herbs. It has vast areas of land which are lying barren or water-logged but can be reclaimed and cultivated. It has immense mineral and oceanic wealth which if properly used in the light of modern science and technology can be the source of great prosperity. But inspite of all these natural, mineral and human resources, the country is steeped in poverty. Why?

There is a lot of dirt, disease, illiteracy and inhumanity all around. There are millions of people in the queue, applying for jobs and unable to find a decent one. There is immense deforestation due to which the soil is unable to hold water. The run-off water causes siltation of rivers and dams and eventually, floods. We can blame this state of affairs on the mismanagement of resources or lack of proper harnessing of the available resources. There are millions of able-bodied youth but they do not play any constructive national role. They remain ignorant of their duties towards the society, be it in terms of maintaining cleanliness, following traffic rules or taking necessary measures to save the environment. There is no sense of national pride among them. They lack the strong drive to pull the country out of destitution. Lakh of people, whose time and energy could be put to constructive use by giving them some training and gainful employment, are roaming around, wasting their precious time in idle pursuits.

All this is happening because there is no plan that can enthuse them and stir them to purposeful activities. There are no leaders who inspire them, raise their spirits and organise them to do something for the task of building a strong nation. The bureaucracy is too narrow-minded to facilitate the social and economic change and to wipe the tears of the backward classes or the weaker sections of society. The businessmen and industrialists are engrossed in making money. Their sensitivities have become hardened to even notice their deprived brethren who are dying because they cannot stand the rigours of the climate or the pain of hunger.

History is evidence to how planning, determination and direction in earlier times brought up two major transformations by the ‘Green Revolution’ and ‘Operation Flood.’ The scientific method of cultivation had helped not only to fight the ravages of flood and drought but also offered food to the less fortunate neighbouring countries in Asia and Africa. Proper pooling and management of scientific know-how and funds had extricated the country from the state of begging bowl to the state of philanthropy. But today, the situation has changed. Why?

The answer is mismanagement of resources and power. India’s burgeoning population and leaders that are unable to manage themselves are to blame. This is where the ‘art of self-management’ comes to fore. And that is possible only if one completely understands the self and learns to be the ruler of one’s own mind. Leaders from around the world should change their outlook, lifestyle and work culture through a system of values and meditation. If the people in authority initiate change, it will bring about a transformation among the common public too.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/self-management-is-the-key-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/self-management-is-the-key.html
162,16-3-20,"As he plotted his way to title win in Oman, Sharath wondered if he had made mistake of his life","India's most decorated table tennis player Sharath Kamal won his first international title in 10 years on Sunday but midway into the competition, the 37-year-old was forced to wonder if he made the mistake of his life by travelling to Oman amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the news of sporting events getting suspended or postponed around the world started trickling in, Sharath was in Muscat for the ITTF Challenge Plus event.

The Polish Open happening around the same time was suspended and the world body announced suspension of all activities until the end of April.

In these extraordinary times, confusion and chaos in the minds of the players was bound to follow. Sharath was in Muscat with other Indian players including singles number three Harmeet Desai.

""When I heard about the Polish Open being suspended, I thought I made a big, big mistake by coming here,"" Sharath, who was relieved to be back to his wife and kids in Chennai in the wee hours of Monday, told PTI.

As a precautionary measure, he has decided to self-quarantine himself at home though the screening at the Chennai Airport showed his body temperature was normal.

""In times like these, you obviously think about your family and they are worried about you. But when it was confirmed that the tournament would go on, I had to focus on the job,"" said the world number 38, who beat Portugal's Marcos Freitas in the final, an opponent ranked 12 places higher than him.

The Indian, whose previous title came in Egypt in 2010, battled past Freitas 4-2 with the final game stretching to 17-15. It was his first win over his Portuguese opponent on the ITTF tour, having lost to him in German Bundesliga way back in 2010.

Sharath was pushed to the limit in the semifinals also before pipping Russia's Kirill Skachkov in a seven-game contest.

""This tournament was my build up to the Olympics qualifiers but now that everything is suspended, I don't know how to feel. I won a tournament after a long time, my game is coming along nicely but there are no tournaments at least for the next one and a half months.

""Having said that, it is satisfying to come home with a title. Both final and semifinal was tough. Whenever I train with Freitas, I am losing most of the points but in the match, I was able to outguess him.

""He knew that forehand is my biggest weapon, so, he focussed on my back hand which worked beautifully last night.

It has been learnt that the employees have been asked to ""work from home"" with all the cricketing operations already being suspended till further notice.

""The BCCI employees were today notified that the headquarters at the Wankhede Stadium will be as good as closed in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. All the staffers have been advised to work from home,"" a top source from the Board told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

""However, if someone still wants to come, they can,"" he added.

The BCCI last Friday postponed the IPL-13 from March 29 to April 15 along with all other domestic tournaments, including the Irani Cup and the Women's Challenger Trophy.

India has so far reported 114 positive cases with two deaths. The global death toll has crossed 6,000 and the number of infected is over 160,000.

In India as well as across the globe, more and more companies are encouraging their employees to work from home in these critical times and no wonder, the BCCI is also going the same way.

It has been learnt that the National Cricket Academy (NCA) has also stopped its various zonal camps even though rehabilitation programmes at the Bengaluru centre was still on as on Monday.

The IPL franchises have also called off their pre-tournament training camps with Royal Challengers Bangalore being the latest.

""Keeping in mind the health and safety of everyone involved, the RCB Training Camp scheduled to start on the 21st of March has been deferred until further notice. We request everyone to follow the guidelines provided by the Health Ministry and stay safe,"" RCB tweeted.

The RCB outfit is led by Indian cricket team skipper Virat Kohli.

The IPL franchisees were engaged in a conference call, exploring the possible options among themselves after their meeting with the BCCI brass in Mumbai on Saturday.

With the IPL already losing out on 17 days, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has hinted that one of the options could be a ""truncated IPL"", but only if the situation improves by April 15.

In case of a truncated IPL, eight teams could be divided into two groups with the top four going into the knockouts.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19--bcci-tells-employees-to-work-from-home-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/covid-19--bcci-tells-employees-to-work-from-home.html

The Maharashtra government also reported four more patients of the infection, as concerns over the pandemic steered decisions across all sectors and states, including in politically volatile Madhya Pradesh,

The ministry did not immediately add the Maharashtra cases to its national count,

The tally of 114 includes two fatalities and 17 foreigners as well as 13 people who were discharged after they recovered from the infection, which according to the WHO has infected 1,53,517 people in 135 countries and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

As many states virtually shut down to stem the spread of COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the contribution of doctors, nurses and healthcare workers in fighting the virus. He said there was a coordinated response to the outbreak, showing the strong spirit of the nation in such situations.

In a series of tweets with the hashtag 'India Fights Corona', Modi said the encouragement from people highlighting the steps being taken to combat the virus is boosting the morale of all the ""remarkable people"" at the forefront of the fight.

A Maharashtra government official said four patients were detected for the novel coronavirus infection, taking the state tally to 37.

Giving details of the Odisha case, an official in Bhubaneswar said a researcher who recently returned from Italy tested positive for the coronavirus.

The 33-year-old patient who reached Delhi from Italy on March 6 and travelled to Bhubaneswar by train on March 12 is being treated at the Capital Hospital in the Odisha capital.

""His condition is stable and he is not showing any other complications,"" the state government's chief spokesperson on coronavirus cases Subroto Bagchi told reporters.

The man consulted a doctor on March 13, complaining of fever and headache, and was admitted to the hospital's isolation ward the next day.

As he travelled by train from Delhi to Bhubaneswar, the state government has launched a ""contact tracing exercise"", Bagchi said.

His family members have been quarantined and kept under observation.

In Madhya Pradesh, where the future of the Congress-led Kamal Nath government hangs in balance, there was no floor test as was being speculated and the assembly was adjourned in view of the state government's concerns over the coronavirus.

BJP MLAs demanded a floor test as directed by Governor Lalji Tandon -- after 22 Congress MLAs of the Congress resigned from the party.

However, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Govind Singh raised the issue of the coronavirus threat and also mentioned the Central government's advisory on the matter, prompting Speaker N P Prajapati to accept his plea and adjourn proceedings till March 26.

While political confabulations continued in the central Indian state, many thousands of students across the country were restricted to their homes and employees worked from home as administrations all over put into effect plans to contain the spread of the contagious disease with flu-like symptoms.

Gyms, cinema halls, swimming pools and other places were closed in many states. Adding to its restrictions, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said no religious, social, cultural and political gathering of over 50 people would be allowed in Delhi till March 31.

168,16-3-20,Uncertainty looms over MP trust vote on Monday,"Uncertainty looms over holding of A floor test in the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly on Monday with sources in the Jyotiraditya Scindia camp claiming that the 22 MLAs of the Congress who had resigned last week might not be coming to Bhopal.

Governor Lalji Tandon had on Saturday night directed Chief Minister Kamal Nath to seek a trust vote in the House immediately after he delivers his customary address on the first day of the Budget session beginning Monday.

Nath, who met the Governor on Sunday late night, said that the decision on a floor test will be taken by the Speaker.

The 22 MLAs of the Congress who had resigned might not return to Bhopal on Monday from Bengaluru where they are camping, sources close to BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose rebellion from the Congress had triggered a political crisis in the state, said on Monday morning.

These MLAs, including six ministers, have already resigned from the membership of the Assembly and there is no point in coming back at this point, they said.

Of the 22 MLAs, at least 19 MLAs had e-mailed their resignation letters to the governor from Bengaluru on March 10.

Speaker NP Prajapati had accepted resignations of six of the 22 MLAs. He, however, remained non-committal on holding a floor test.

Interestingly, holding of a floor test found no mention in the List of Business (LoB) issued by the state Assembly secretariat on Sunday night.

The LoB mentioned only about the Governor's customary address on the first day of the Budget session and the motion of thanks.

Referring to this, BJP national vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, ""Kamal Nath has very innocently said that it is the job of the speaker to conduct floor test, while the fact is that it is the government which decides the business of the House"".

""The governor had ordered the chief minister to seek the trust vote after his customary address. Tandon has written the letter to you (Nath) and not to the Speaker,"" he told reporters on Sunday late night.

Chouhan said that with the resignations of 22 MLAs, the Nath government was reduced to a minority.

""The government must table a proposal for holding a floor test in the House and the speaker should ensure that it will be conducted,"" the former chief minister demanded.

On Sunday late night, MLAs of the BJP returned to Bhopal from Manesar in Haryana.

169,16-3-20,The right dialogue,"US First Lady Melania Trump urges parents and educators to teach positive behaviour to children

Melania Trump urged parents and teachers Tuesday to teach children how to interact in positive ways and also to prepare them for the negativity that comes with living in a digital age, calling them the “front line” against irresponsible behavior online.

The first lady focused on cyberbullying in remarks to the National PTA Legislative Conference and did not mention the coronavirus, an issue on the minds of educators and parents nationwide.

She also shared an extended handshake with PTA President Leslie Boggs at a time when federal health officials are discouraging people from engaging in such touching when they meet.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.

In her remarks, Mrs. Trump said the internet can be a “tool for good” by helping people share important life updates and stay informed but can be “destructive and dangerous,” even deadly, when misused.

The first lady spoke about a 16-year-old Tennessee high school junior who took his life last September after discovering that his intimate messages with a boy had been put on social media by classmates. The teen had not been public about his sexuality.

She said parents and teachers are the “front line” against such irresponsible online behavior.

“As parents, adults, educators, and community leaders, it is our responsibility to ensure our children are being taught the importance of positive ways to interact with each other and prepare them for attacks and negativity they could receive in this new digital age,” she said.

“With your help, we can break down the harmful barriers that internet abuse poses to our children and society,” she said, adding that she was “thrilled” to learn about steps by PTAs across the country to teach students, parents and teachers how to use technology responsibly.

Cyberbullying is one aspect of a youth initiative named “Be Best” that Mrs. Trump launched in 2018 that also focuses on their overall well-being and combating opioid addiction.

Her focus on cyberbullying comes as her husband, President Donald Trump, uses his Twitter account to belittle others and behave in ways that contradict her guidance to children. On Tuesday, the president tweeted that the independent Federal Reserve was “pathetic” for not cutting interest rates as low as he would like.

Mrs. Trump has said in the past that her husband’s antics won’t deter her from helping children.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-right-dialogue-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-right-dialogue.html
170,16-3-20,"Greenland, Antarctica ice loss accelerating","Earth's great ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctica, were now losing mass six times faster than they were in the 1990s due to warming conditions, the media reported on Thursday citing scientists as saying.

A comprehensive review of satellite data acquired at both poles was unequivocal in its assessment of accelerating trends, the BBC quoted the scientists as saying. Between them, Greenland and Antarctica lost 6.4 trillion tonnes of ice in the period from 1992 to 2017.

This was sufficient to push up global sea-levels up by 17.8 mm, the scientists added.

""That's not a good news story,"" said Professor Andrew Shepherd from the University of Leeds.

""Today, the ice sheets contribute about a third of all sea-level rise, whereas in the 1990s, their contribution was actually pretty small at about 5 per cent. This has important implications for the future, for coastal flooding and erosion,"" he told BBC News.

The researcher co-leads a project called the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise, or Imbie, which is a team of experts who have reviewed polar measurements acquired by observational spacecraft over nearly three decades.

The Imbie team's studies have revealed that ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland were actually heading to much more pessimistic outcomes, and will likely add another 17 cm to those end-of-century forecasts. ""If that holds true it would put 400 million people at risk of annual coastal flooding by 2100,"" Professor Shepherd told the BBC.

171,16-3-20,ISL has become more professional over years: Habas,"The first head coach to win the Indian Super League trophy twice, Antonio Habas of ATK feels that the league has become more professional over the years with the coming in of better players and support staff.

He also said the latest title ATK won on Saturday after defeating Chennaiyin FC 3-1 in the final here, though it was played without spectators due to COVID-19 pandemic, was more important than the club won in the inaugural season under him in 2014.

“It’s different because in the first season, the Hero ISL was not the same competition. Now it is much more professional. There are better coaches, better players, more teams, more time in the competition,” he said when asked to compare his success in the first ISL to the latest one.

“This title is more important than the first, but the first was also important because it was the first title,” Habas added.

ATK have now become the first ISL team to win the title thrice in the league's six year history, having also won the trophy in 2016. Chennaiyin FC, who lost 1-2 in the summit clash on Saturday, had won the title twice (2015 and 2017-18).

Habas credited the collective effort of the team as the reason behind their latest title after injuries to key players early in the season created problems.

“We are a group always, inside and outside of the pitch. This is important. We had big problems with injuries to Carl McHugh, then Agus (Iniguez) and in the final, the problem to (Krishna) Roy. But the strength of the team was the collective effort,” he said.

“His (Carl McHugh) injury was a big miss. With the problem with Agus, the team was in a problem for two, three matches. But the strength of the group salvaged the situation. When you have individual problems, the only solution is the team, the collective. The mix between Indian and foreign players was fantastic this season.”

The 62-year-old Spaniard admitted his side did not play well in the second half of the summit clash against Chennaiyin FC and his players were nervous.

“I think the match had two different parts. In the first half after the initial few minutes, we were better than Chennaiyin. And after that in the second half, with the injury to Roy (Krishna), the team was nervous.

“We could not find the necessary personnel to keep scoring and kill the match off. In the second half, the team did not play well. Even though we did not play well, we had fantastic character. In some matches, you can win with the heart,” he said.

Asked about the secret behind his success with ATK, Habas said,” “ATK has people that love me, like I love ATK. I have a special connect with ATK since the first season and it continues. We are a family. This is amazing. This is the secret.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/isl-has-become-more-professional-over-years--habas.html
172,16-3-20,"We were better side, paid price of poor finishing: Coyle","Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle rued his side’s missed chances in their 1-3 defeat against ATK in the Indian Super League summit clash that cost them a third title.

Chennaiyin failed to give their magical turnaround in this ISL the desired fairytale ending, and Coyle minced no words that his side played better than ATK in the final held here without spectators on Saturday due to COVID-19 pandemic.

“Goals change games. We had a few easy chances in initial phase but could not take them. No one should tell me they (ATK) were the better team. My disappointment is for how much my team put into the game. But ultimately if you don’t take your chances, you give away soft goals,” he said.

“We were the team that played all the football. To be fair to them they stuck to their task. They made it tough for us by banging the ball forward. The spoils went to ATK so all the very best to them. We were the team who kept pushing on, but they were clinical and we were not,” Coyle added.

The 53-year-old Irish coach said ATK must be relieved to have won the final and the title given that Chhenaiyin had more possession and goal-scoring chances.

“We had almost 70% possession but ultimately if you don't take your chances, it will come back to haunt you. There were two things from our perspective. One, we were not clinical enough with our chances and second, I felt ATK’s last two goals were certainly avoidable,” he said.

“I think ATK will be very relieved to get away with the trophy given what we brought to the game. But that is how football is at the highest level.”

Coyle praised ATK goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja despite he was being the thorn in Chennaiyin’s flesh by saving some crucial saves.

“However, I have to say ATK’s goal in the first half was a wonderful finish and credit to them. The man of the match for me was their goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja. He was truly outstanding. I have to give credit to ATK for winning,” he said.

Despite the disappointing stumble in the final hurdle, it has been a season to remember for the Marina Machans who made it to the summit clash after languishing near the bottom of the table midway into the season.

“My feelings go out to my group of players, because those players, particularly the young players, they have done so much. They have been a joy to watch. I really feel for them. They love their club. I feel disappointed for them. It is a tough night to lose and it is important to recognize the players who have done very well.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-were-better-side--paid-price-of-poor-finishing--coyle.html

There will be a dedicated Athlete Lounge for Indian Olympians and access to medical facilities and food will be available on site. A media centre to host travelling Indian media personnel has also been planned in the area. Several Indian and international brands will also have their stalls to display and sell their products.

More than 70 Indian athletes have so far qualified for the Tokyo Olympics and the IOA is expecting the number to touch at least 125 before the Games.

In January, the WPI inflation stood at 3.1 per cent and in the year-ago same period it was at 2.93 per cent, as per the data from the commerce and industry ministry.

The WPI inflation for food articles for February 2020 came in at 7.79 per cent as against 11.51 per cent in the previous month.

The rate of price rise for onion and potato too came down to 162.30 per cent and 60.73 per cent, respectively as against 293.37 per cent and 87.84 per cent in January 2020.

Build up inflation rate in the current financial year so far was 1.92 per cent compared to a build up rate of 2.75 per cent in the year-ago period, it added.

""The considerable decline in the WPI inflation in February 2020 is in line with our forecast, led primarily by food items, as well as a modest contribution of the correction in prices of crude oil and minerals, which would intensify in the ongoing month,"" said Aditi Nayar, economist with ICRA.

The former MD and CEO of the private lender was arrested by the ED here on March 8 under provisions of the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) as he was allegedly not cooperating in the probe related to the crisis at Yes Bank which has been placed under moratorium by the RBI.

The 62-year-old banker was initially remanded in the ED custody till March 11 which was later extended up to March 16.

As his remand ended on Monday, Kapoor was produced before special PMLA court judge P P Rajvaidya, who extended his ED custody till March 20 on a plea by the central investigating agency.

Meanwhile, Kapoor told the court he has been suffering for long from asthma and also depression.

""I just want to bring to your (court) notice that my family is providing treatment, but don't known when it will erupt,"" the veteran banker added.

The ED told the court that during Kapoor's tenure at Yes Bank, he had sanctioned Rs 202.10 crore loan to a joint venture involving the HDIL group.

A part of this loan was used by the real estate group to pay previous loans of Yes Bank, the agency said.

Earlier, the ED had saidloans worth Rs 30,000 crore were given to various entities when Kapoor was on the bank's panel.

""Of this, Rs 20,000 crore turned into bad debts,"" the agency had told the court.

The Reserve Bank of India had earlier thismonth imposed a moratorium on the capital-starved Yes Bank, capping withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account, and superseded the board of the private sector lender with immediate effect.

The ED has accused Rana, his family members and others of laundering proceeds of crime worth Rs 4,300 crore by receiving alleged kickbacks in lieu of extending big loans through their bank that later turned NPA.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/yes-bank-co-founder-kapoor-s-ed-remand-extended-till-march-20-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/yes-bank-co-founder-kapoor-s-ed-remand-extended-till-march-20.html

The number swelled to 107 from 84 with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of positive cases followed by Kerala. Meanwhile over 450 stranded Indians were flown back from Italy and Iran and quarantined.

A Health Ministry official said over 4,000 people who had come in contact with 93 positive cases have been identified through contact and were being tracked while 42,000 people across the country are under community surveillance.

More States on Sunday closed schools, colleges cinema halls, and also imposed Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent gathering of more than four persons in order to check the spread of the disease.

While the number of positive cases in Maharashtra shot up to 33, the Health Ministry has clarified that the 71-year-old man from Buldhana, who died during treatment on Saturday in a hospital, had tested negative for coronavirus infection. He had returned from Saudi Arabia recently and had diabetes and high blood pressure.

The Mumbai Police on Sunday clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC to stop tour operators from conducting any kind of group tours to foreign or domestic destinations till March 31.

Maharashtra has already invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 that gives wide-ranging powers to officials to enforce measures, including that of lockdown and quarantine, required to tackle an outbreak. Shopping malls, schools and colleges have been closed in the State till March 31.

The Government has also placed curbs on the movement of all types of passengers to Pakistan through international border points.

Earlier, the Government had announced suspension of all types of passenger movement from 00:00 hours on March 15 through the Indo-Bangla, Indo-Nepal, Indo-Bhutan and Indo-Myanmar borders barring a few specified border checkposts.

A total of 218 Indians, mostly students, from Milan landed at around 9.45 AM at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi and were taken to an ITBP quarantine facility in south-west Delhi’s Chhawla area.

198,16-3-20,"Governor proposes, Speaker disposes!","Showdown in MP Assembly likely on Mon as Speaker noncommittal on holding trust vote

Uncertainly prevails over the floor test in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly as Speaker NP Prajapati has not given clear instructions for it despite Governor Lalji Tandon on Saturday night asking Chief Minister Kamal Nath to seek a trust vote soon after the Governor address on Monday.

With the BJP seeking an confidence vote at the earliest and the Congress in favour of putting it off for a few days in order to woo back its rebels, it seems the political drama has now shifted to the Assembly.

On being asked whether he will respect the Governor’s direction to the Chief Minister for the Confidence Motion on Monday, the Speaker remained noncommittal and told the reporters, “This will be known tomorrow... I will read out my ruling tomorrow.”

As the rebellion led by Jyotiraditya Scindia threatened the survival of its Government, the Congress appeared keen on putting off the trust vote and asserted that it is the Speaker’s prerogative to decide about the proceedings of the House, but a buoyed BJP maintained that he was bound by the Governor’s direction. BJP legislative party sources said it will vociferously demand for the trust vote after the Governor’s address.

However, Law and Legal Affairs Minister PC Sharma said, “What all will be done in the House, the Speaker decides.”

Another Congress MLA said the floor test “might not take place on Monday” and the issue could even go to court.

After the Speaker accepted the resignation of six Congress MLAs on Saturday, the party now has 108 legislators. These include 16 rebel legislators who have also put in their papers but their resignations are yet to be accepted.

The BJP has 107 seats in the House which now has an effective strength of 222, with the majority mark being 112.

To add to the ruling Congress’ woes, it is yet uncertain whether it will continue getting the support of four Independents, two BSP MLAs and one MLA from the SP.

Referring to resignations of 22 Congress MLAs, the Governor wrote in his letter to the CM: “Based on the above facts, prima facie, I believe that your Government has lost the confidence of the House and it is in minority. This is a very serious issue and therefore as per the constitutional provisions and for protecting the democratic values, it is necessary that on March 16, soon after my address, you seek the trust vote in the Assembly.”

While the Congress MLAs returned on Sunday from Jaipur, the BJP too was bringing back its legislators from Haryana to attend the first day of the session on Monday.

BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said Chief Minister Kamal Nath should step down as the Congress Government has become “lame-duck” after the resignation of the 22 MLAs. BJP legislative party sources said that it will vociferously press for the trust vote after the Governor’s address.

The opposition party claims that the political crisis in the State is due to internal fighting in the Congress and it has nothing to do with it.

The 19 rebel Congress MLAs are likely to return by Monday morning, a source close to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who has joined the BJP, said. Amid the political slugfest, state public relations minister PC Sharma on Sunday demanded that all the MLAs be screened for coronavirus.

“The MLAs who have returned from Jaipur and also those who have gone to Haryana and Benguluru should undergo coronavirus tests. It is important as the virus has spread in Jaipur and Haryana,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/governor-proposes--speaker-disposes--2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/governor-proposes--speaker-disposes-.html

204,16-3-20,Centre moves SC for approval of formula to provide breather to telcos in payment of AGR dues,"The Centre moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking approval of its formula to allow telecom companies to pay their Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues in annual instalments for over 20 years to avoid impact on the economy.

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah directed that the Centre's application be listed before the same bench which had given the October 24, 2019 verdict for payment of AGR dues, amounting to Rs 1.47 lakh crore, owed by telecom companies.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, mentioned the application for urgent listing saying that if a telecom company goes bankrupt due to the dues, it would have a major impact on the sector.

The bench said however that it does not know when the original bench which gave the verdict will assemble due to the precautionary measures adopted by the top court in wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

It also allowed the Centre to file an affidavit in reply to the contempt notice issued by the apex court on February 14, for non-compliance of its order to payment of the AGR dues to the Department of Telecom (DoT).

The Centre in its application said that looking at the most possible and perhaps inevitable scenario in mind and in larger interest of economic consequences on the nation, the central government has taken a decision to seek approval of this court to a formula arrived at for recovery of the past dues from the telecom service providers.

""This formula, which is placed for approval/ permission of this court, is arrived at after a detailed and long drawn deliberations at various levels of the government in the administrative hierarchy including the cabinet and keeping the vital issues related to the financial health and viability of the telecom sector and need for maintaining competition and level playing field in the interest of consumers,"" it said.

Under the formula suggested by the government, the telecom companies impacted by the verdict of the apex court of October 24, 2019, be allowed to pay the DoT-assessed dues in annual instalments in over 20 years (or less if they so opt), ""duly protecting the next present value of the said dues using a discount rate of eight per cent (based on one year marginal cosy of lending rate of SBI which is currently 7.75 per cent"".

As per the formula the ""interest on the unpaid amount, penalty, and interest on penalty in relation to the past dues as on the date of the judgement of the Supreme Court will not be levied beyond the date of the said judgement, and the net present value will be protected using the discount rate"".

It states that the telecom firms would continue to be liable for interest, penalty, and interest on penalty for unpaid dues of licence fee and spectrum usage charge which arises prospectively after the October 24, 2019, date of judgement of the apex court.

If there is any change in amount of past dues arising from the judgement determined after reconciliation between telecom companies' self- assessment and DoT's calculation, then it may be adjusted against the payable instalment amounts of the company.

The government informed the court that it has withdrawn the DoT communication of January 23 as directed by the top court on February 14, due to which contempt proceedings were drawn against the department's desk officer.

""It is most respectfully submitted that the said communication was issued bona fide and not for any ulterior motive. However, having realised the mistake, the said communication was immediately withdrawn on the very same day i.E. On February 14"", the application of the Centre said.

The government said that compliance of the apex court orders is of utmost priority for it but it is required to be brought to the notice of the court that ""considering the huge amount which is payable by the telecom service providers, there would be certain inevitable consequences which may not be in any ones' interest"".

It informed the top court that telecom companies who were liable to make the payments have started making the payments and the part payment is made.

The government said it is conscious of the fact that any immediate adverse impact on the functioning of the telecom firms would not only have an adverse impact on the overall economy of the nation but would also seriously harm the interest of the consumers across the country.

It said that in the event of any one major service provider being impacted would result into the drastic and most possible consequence of such service providers facing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

The Centre in its application said that the impact of this would be on competition in the telecom sector with adverse consequences for the consumers and on quality of services.

The Centre's application also gave the figures of the amount paid by the telecom companies against the AGR dues and the due amount till March 6, as assessed by the DoT.

It said Bharti Group has paid 18,004 core and its due are 25,976 crore; Vodafone Idea has paid till now Rs 3,500 crore and has dues of Rs 54,754 crore; Tata Group of Companies has paid Rs 4,197 crore and has dues of Rs 12,601 crore; Quadrant Televentures Ltd has paid Rs 69 crore and has dues of Rs 189.22 crore, and Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd has paid Rs 195.18 crore and has nil dues.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-moves-sc-for-approval-of-formula-to-provide-breather-to-telcos-in-payment-of-agr-dues-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/centre-moves-sc-for-approval-of-formula-to-provide-breather-to-telcos-in-payment-of-agr-dues.html

206,16-3-20,SAARC nations second Modi’s corona fund plan,"PM pledges $10 million; while all hail anti-virus proposal, Pak broaches Kashmir issue

SAARC nation on Sunday supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proposal of setting up COVID-19 Emergency Fund to jointly combat the pandemic. During video conference with his counterparts, the PM committed 10 million dollars as initial investment for the fund.

Apart from Modi, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Bhutanese premier Lotay Tshering, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Special Assistant to Pakistani Prime Minister on Health Zafar Mirza participated in the video conference.

The underlying message of the video conference was unitedly taking on the pandemic, but Pakistan used the occasion to raise Kashmir, with Mirza calling for the “lockdown” to be eased in Jammu & Kashmir to deal with the coronavirus threat.

Modi asserted that it was important for the SAARC member countries to work together to combat the coronavirus spread, and said the region can best respond to the coronavirus pandemic by

Prime Minister urged to his counterparts that it was important to focus on collaboration, not confusion, and preparation, not panic.

Mirza, in his remarks, also hailed China for its efforts to deal with the coronavirus and urged other SAARC nations to learn best practices from it.

After initial remarks by the leaders, Prime Minister Modi made a series of suggestions which were hailed by the SAARC leaders and representatives.

“I propose we create a COVID-19 Emergency Fund. This could be based on voluntary contributions from all of us. India can start with an initial offer of 10 million US dollars for this fund,” Modi said.

“We are assembling a Rapid Response Team of doctors and specialists in India, along with testing kits and other equipment. They will be on stand-by, to be placed at your disposal, if required,” Modi told the SAARC leaders. India had set up an Integrated Disease Surveillance Portal to better trace possible virus carriers and the people they contacted and it could share this disease surveillance software with SAARC partners, Modi said.

“Looking ahead, we could create a common research platform, to coordinate research on controlling epidemic diseases within our South Asian region. The Indian Council of Medical Research can offer help coordinating such an exercise,” he said.

In his opening address, Modi said the South Asian region has reported less than 150 coronavirus cases, but “we need to remain vigilant”.

“Prepare, but don’t panic” has been India’s guiding mantra in dealing with coronavirus outbreak, he said. “We started screening people entering India from mid-January itself, while gradually increasing restrictions on travel,” Modi said, citing the evacuation of more 1400 people from abroad.

Maldivian President Solih backed coordinated approach to deal with COVID-19, asserting that no country can deal with the situation alone. Lankan President Rajapaksa said SAARC leaders should formulate mechanism to help the economies of the region to tide over problems posed by coronavirus.

He also proposed setting up a SAARC ministerial-level group to deal with issues related to coronavirus.

Hasina hailed PM Modi’s suggestions to deal with the pandemic and called for taking the initiative forward by more such video conferences, including one with health ministers of SAARC nations participating. “Our collective efforts will help us devise a sound and robust strategy for SAARC region to fight coronavirus,” Nepal PM Oli said. Bhutanese PM Lotay Tshering said that it was mportant for all countries of the region to be on same page to combat coronavirus.

Mirza, in his initial remarks, said no nation can afford to be unresponsive to situation in wake of coronavirus outbreak. “We share common regional concerns on COVID-19. While hoping for best, we have to prepare for worst,” the Pakistan PM’s Special Assistant on Health said.

Modi on Friday had proposed formulation of a joint strategy by the SAARC nations to fight coronavirus, a suggestion that was backed by all the member states. Calling on the SAARC nations to set an example for the world, Modi had reached out to the eight-member regional grouping and pitched for a video-conference among its leaders to chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people globally.

His appeal got a prompt response from Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa, Maldivian President Solih, Nepalese Prime Minister Oli, Bhutanese premier Tshering, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Hasina and the Afghan government, all of whom welcomed the proposal. Pakistan’s response to the proposal came in after the rest, with the country’s Foreign Office Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui saying Mirza will be available to participate in the video-conference.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saarc-nations-second-modi---s-corona-fund-plan-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/saarc-nations-second-modi---s-corona-fund-plan.html

Veran said government officials would meet with scientific advisers in the coming days to determine if the second round of voting will be held next Sunday.

""Probably on Tuesday I will ask them about the second round,"" Veran said, while refusing to be drawn on rumours the government will soon announce a complete lockdown and confine people to their homes.

213,16-3-20,"Ravan eyes Dalit vote, launches Azad Samaj","In an interesting twist to Dalit vote bank politics in the country, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan on Sunday launched his political party — the Azad Samaj Party (ASP) — marking the birth anniversary of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram.

The date of the party’s launch is seen as a direct challenge to BSP supremo Mayawati whose party has so far been the sole claimant of the Dalit votes in Uttar Pradesh and a few other States. As many as 28 ex-MLAs and six former MPs attended the event in neighbouring Noida prompting two former Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh — Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav — to react on the new outfit, saying these are parties with vested interest and would have no political impact.

Chandrashekhar took to social media depicting Dalit leader late Kanshi Ram’s image as his profile status, to officially announce his new political party.

The Azad Samaj Party will make the Uttar Pradesh 2022 Assembly elections interesting as the ruling BJP, the Samajwadi Party (SP), the BSP and the Congress will fight to form their Government.

As many as 98 leaders of the SP, the BSP, the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) joined the newly launched party.

In the 2017 Assembly polls, the BJP-led NDA won 325 seats with 48.7 per cent votes, the SP won 47 seats with 21.8 per cent votes and the BSP won 19 seats with 22.2 per cent votes.

On the occasion, Azad said the Bhim Army will run parallel to the party and continue to fight for Dalit rights and enroll new members.

The launch ceremony of ASP, however, courted some controversy since the banquet hall manager had shut down the hall before the event as administration has banned large gatherings owing to COVID-19 but on insistence the event was organised outside the hall.

Mayawati said people with vested interests are playing into the hands of rival political parties and claimed they have nothing to do with BR Ambedkar and his movement.

“Even now, people with vested interests are playing into the hands of rival political parties. They have nothing to do with Babasaheb Ambedkar and his movement. Nor they have anything to do with Manyavar Kanshi Ram’s sacrifice and austerity,” Mayawati said without naming the Bhim Army chief.

On the other hand, another former UP Chief Minister and head of Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav exuded confidence and rejected the idea of new political outfits and said as per a palmist SP will win 350 seats in 2022 UP State Assembly elections.

“I have decided that we will win one seat more than 350... Together we will win 351 seats in the 2022 Assembly elections,” Akhilesh said in his Lucknow party office. Yadav added if the Centre does not go for caste-wise census, then the SP will conduct it in Uttar Pradesh after winning the 2022 Assembly polls.

Azad, who rose to prominence during clashes between Thakurs and Dalits in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur in May 2017, had filed nomination against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi during the 2019 general elections, but withdrew later.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ravan-eyes-dalit-vote--launches-azad-samaj-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/ravan-eyes-dalit-vote--launches-azad-samaj.html

The COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,777 people and claimed 69 lives in the country. The country has stepped up efforts to contain the virus by placing travel restrictions, closing schools, restaurants and bars and cancelling entertainment events across the country.

Sewa International, a leading Indian-American non-profit organization, has released USD 10,000 to run its 24X7 helpline and coronavirus awareness campaign through a team of 20 physicians.

It has also established various chapters across the country who are working with the Indian Embassy and consulates to help families obtain visas to travel to India in emergency situations.

“There are over 250,000 students from India studying in US universities. More than 300 US Universities have closed including some who have moved instructions to a virtual mode, and even shut their dorms. Sewa has fielded calls from Indian foreign students from such universities who are finding it difficult to cope up emotionally, health wise and financially,” said Professor Sree Sreenath, president of Sewa International.

“We even had a couple of concerned parents call us from India,” Sreenath said.

“A team of 20 physicians is helping Sewa in providing free advice through Sewa coronavirus helpline. Over 400 volunteers in 20 major cities in the country are working tirelessly to put up a formidable community response at this difficult time,” said Swadesh Katoch, Sewa's vice president for Disaster Relief.

Local businesses and medical professionals are offering their services to the community most times pro bono through Sewa International.

Its volunteers are providing multiple services including delivering free food, assisting the elderly in grocery shopping and visiting a doctor and helping those who are faced with travel and visa issues.

“We are also offering family therapist calls for helping parents deal with anxiety and stress,” he said.

“Sewa is also helping people with COVID-19 like symptoms to meet with doctors. In a few cases our Family Services volunteers are working with friends and family of patients who are in self-quarantine or being tested for COVID-19. Sewa is running a daily Facebook Live campaign to spread awareness about preventing the infection,” Katoch said.

Federation of Indian-American Associations of Georgia is working with all universities across Georgia and Alabama to help students hit by the situation created due to the coronavirus crisis.

“We have daily meetings with the university authorities as well as with various student organisations at their campuses to assess the situation and have offered our help to provide them with food, accommodation and any other help they need,” the association said.

“We are also in constant discussion with our partner organisations who can provide their spaces to the affected students in case we need them. As of now, Gujarati Samaj, Gokuldham and Shakti Mandir have graciously offered their places to host the students impacted by the virus,” it added.

The doctor, who had returned from Spain on March 1, tested positive on Sunday at the SCTIMST.

The doctor had reported for duty from March 2 onwards, complaining of sore throat on March 8. He wore a mask while attending to his duties, including seeing patients on March 10 and 11.

On March 12, he was directed to be kept in isolation after Spain got included in the list of nations affected by Covid-19.

On March 14, he was made to undergo a repeat test for coronavirus, which came out positive on Sunday.

With these many professionals not available for duty, normal services at the premier institute are likely to be affected, even though the authorities are trying to ensure that the hospital functioning is smooth.

Another cause of concern in the whole matter is that Union Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, had held a meeting with departmental heads last week during which a few of these doctors kept under observation had participated.

220,16-3-20,US Federal Reserve cuts key interest rate to 0-0.25% amid coronavirus crisis,"In a drastic measure to stem any major disruption to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate to almost zero and said it would buy USD700 billion in bonds.

The COVID-19 pandemic has sickened more than 156,000 people worldwide and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the US stands at 68, while infections neared 3,700.

Scientists, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the country are racing against time to find a vaccine to the virus that has spread across the world and is having a major disruptive impact on the economy, particularly in the global supply chain.

The Federal Reserve on Sunday announced slashing the key rate and buying USD700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to help the economy withstand the viral outbreak. ""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed said in a statement.

Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected, it said, and noted that available economic data showed the US economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.

""The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook,"" the Fed said.

""We have responded very strongly not just with interest rates but also with liquidity measures today,"" Fed Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a news conference.

US President Donald Trump, who a day earlier was very critical of the Fed, welcomed the move. ""I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,"" he said. ""People in the market should be very thrilled. ... We got it down to potentially zero,"" the President added.

The Federal Reserve said that it has decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0-0.25 per cent. It expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goal.

""This action will help support economic activity, strong labour market conditions, and inflation returning to the committee's symmetric two percent objective,"" The Fed said.

The Federal Reserve said that it would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including that of public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act appropriately to support the economy.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the committee will assess realised and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric two per cent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments, the Fed said.

It added that to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities that are central to the flow of credit to households and businesses, over the coming months, the committee would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least USD500 billion and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least USD200 billion.

The committee will also reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.

In addition, the Open Market Desk has recently expanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate, the Fed said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-interest-rate-to-0-0-25--amid-coronavirus-crisis-2020-03-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-interest-rate-to-0-0-25--amid-coronavirus-crisis.html
