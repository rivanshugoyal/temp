0,25-2-20,"Waiting for Godot, as usual","The military justice system is in jeopardy and is only surviving due to the efforts of the SC and serving members in the Armed Forces Tribunal

It is no secret that what differentiates us from countries like Pakistan is our commitment to the rule of law. However bruised or battered our justice system may be, it still continues to be trusted and it delivers, albeit rather slowly. This, however, does not hold true for the health of the military justice system, which has been in serious jeopardy for the last three years or so. That it continues to survive on the respirator and provide justice is only because of the extraordinary efforts of the Supreme Court and serving members in the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT). This state of affairs can directly be attributed to the shenanigans of senior bureaucrats in the Defence Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office, who were caught out when they first attempted to subvert the independence and functioning of the AFT by way of enacting new rules through a Gazette Notification issued under the Finance Act, 2017. In this, they changed the selection criteria and procedures for the appointment of the chairperson and members, especially with regard to that of the administrative members. Whether this was done with the tacit approval of their political bosses, is moot.

Since the role of administrative members is to advise the judicial members on aspects of military law, ethos, customs and functioning, only military veterans meeting a specific criterion could be considered for appointment, as per the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007. However, the Finance Act, 2017 opened this up to “a person of ability, integrity and standing having special knowledge of and professional experience of not less than twenty years in, economics, business, commerce, law, finance, accountancy, industry, public affairs, administration or in any other matter useful to the Armed Forces Tribunal.”

How anybody without the requisite expertise or domain knowledge could be useful in advising on matters military was not elucidated. However, it is not difficult to reach the conclusion that the intent was to provide further avenues for post-retirement sinecures for worthy members of our civilian bureaucracy. That apart, by attempting to tighten its hold on the selection process for the chairperson and members, the Government had unambiguously made clear that it expected those aspiring to be appointed to the AFT to follow its diktats. Obviously, if these amended rules were accepted, then the AFT would represent sheer tokenism of the worst kind as it would be a complete travesty of natural justice and go against the very concept of rule of law.

However, fortunately these reprehensible efforts were nullified when the Supreme Court initially stayed the matter and then subsequently struck it down on the grounds that “they were contrary to the parent Act and principles enshrined in the Constitution” (Rojer Mathews vs South Indian Bank Ltd and Others). The court further pointed serious anomalies in the rules and directed the Government to reframe them. In the ensuing stand-off between the apex court and the Government, serving personnel and veterans alike became victims of bureaucratic apathy and bloody-mindedness.

In a show of extreme vindictiveness and an utter lack of empathy for the military community, and with complete disregard of their actions on morale, the bureaucracy did what it does best, refused to move files, thereby ensuring vacant posts could not be filled. From a time when 17 Benches were functional (each Bench has one judicial and one administrative member) across the country, we are now down to two regular Benches in Delhi and one ad hoc roving Bench that moves from city to city in an attempt to try and provide some semblance of justice. The obvious implication is that the wait for justice just became even longer, with over 16,000 cases pending. If the stalemate continues, as it looks to, the situation will only get worse as administrative members complete their tenure around July, unless of course the apex court extends their terms, as it has done for the two judicial members.

That this Government has no intentions of changing course over the matter, despite all that has occurred, has been clearly brought by the issue of a new Gazette Notification in February under the Finance Act, 2017. The new rules notified therein are only marginally different with regard to selection criterion of the chairperson and judicial members but have made no attempt to change the previously-rejected selection criteria with regard to administrative members. Clearly this action on the part of the Government is not only completely brazen but also appears to be in contempt of the Supreme Court, if its directions were to be viewed in the spirit of the law. As to whether the court itself will view this matter seriously, only time will tell. However, one can be certain that there are bound to be a spate of writ petitions filed against this outrage. This implies we are back on the merry-go-round or maybe just as in Samuel Beckett’s play of the same name we will continue “waiting for Godot.” What a shame.

1,25-2-20,Keep the momentum going to eliminate malaria,"The challenges for the mammoth task — private sector partnership, increased domestic funding, surveillance mechanism, impact on the vulnerable population — need to be addressed. Till then there's no room for complacency

Malaria, is known as the “disease of poverty” as it often hits those who have the least access to healthcare. Statistics show that 80 per cent of cases occur among 20 per cent of the country’s population, mostly communities living in remote areas. For India, malaria has been a tricky foe with varying outcomes over the decades. It has achieved great strides in curbing the disease every time the Government has increased intensification and on the ground implementation of eradication programmes. The reverse is also true.

Malaria was nearly eliminated in the early 1960s but it soon re-emerged as a major public health problem. Early setbacks in its eradication coincided with DDT shortages and in the late ’60s malaria cases in urban areas started to multiply. In the ’70s its resurgence was a result of technical, financial and operational problems. As a result, in 1976, a whopping 6.45 million cases were recorded which led to the discontinuation of eradication efforts. In order to control the massive upsurge, the Modified Plan of Operation was launched in 1977 which brought the situation under control for five-six years. Malaria cases fell to 2.18 million in 1984 and climbed back to three million in 1995, with substantial mortality reported. However, since 2000, India has reduced the number of cases by more than half and the number of deaths by more than two-thirds. In the WHO’s World Malaria Report 2019, India was lauded for strengthening its fight against the disease. These concerted efforts need to be sustained, reinvented and amplified if we are going to end malaria by 2030.

Challenges ahead: In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the country’s commitment to eliminating the disease by 2030. Soon after, in 2016, India introduced its National Strategic Plan for Malaria Elimination and took several measures to end the malady. But the biggest challenge remains as India’s true burden of malaria is unknown. To understand and map malaria cases and fatalities, India solely relies on data from Government hospitals. This highlights a big gap in the realities of its malaria burden when approximately 70 per cent of urban and 63 per cent of rural households use the private sector to seek medical care. In some States malaria has been declared a notifiable disease, this means that private sector establishments have to adhere to Government guidelines, use recommended anti-malarial drugs and report cases to the authorities. However, it is yet to be declared a notifiable disease for many States, which amplifies the gap in mapping the overall malaria burden. Several concrete steps are needed to win this fight.

Disease mapping: We must take along the private sector to ensure a collaborative surveillance method to obtain malaria’s exact burden. For this we need to foster a healthy partnership between the private and public sector for mapping the disease in a holistic manner. If such a mechanism for gathering data is implemented and the true burden is identified, then India will be well-placed to end the disease.

Effective partnerships: Collaboration between various stakeholders is the key to success. To cite an example, an NGO, Malaria No More, launched a Malaria Action Coalition (MAC) in September 2019. The MAC acts as a multi-sectoral coordination platform, chaired by the malarial State of Odisha, with representation from non-Government technical, research and implementation agencies as well as the private sector, donors, investors and media partners to support the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.

Creating awareness: Creating awareness has been one of the major catalysts to reduce, if not completely eliminate, a disease. Advocacy, awareness and on-ground programmes go hand in hand and the public and private sector have an equal role in it. To reduce the burden of malaria it is important to empower communities by educating them. An individual has to first learn to recognise and then prevent the disease. To further this effort, it is important that the individual spread information on malaria in his/her area. This empowerment will only come with education and self-awareness.

Government’s commitments: Modi and the Health Minister have echoed India’s seriousness to end malaria by 2030 on national and international platforms, including during last year’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, when 52 leaders committed to halve malaria by 2023. With more Government funding still needed, the Central Government nearly trebled the outlay for the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) over the last two years.

Ensuring adequate investment in malaria is imperative to achieving India’s elimination goals. Implementing the Five Year Plan for malaria elimination shall require Rs 10,653.16 crore. While the Government has increased it’s funding for the NVBDCP, the Central Government-allocated funds for it get divided for disease control programmes/interventions for six diseases, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, kala-azar, lymphatic filariasis and Japanese encephalitis, creating a paucity of resources. This makes private sector contributions extremely critical to bolster the Government’s efforts but there is a lack of funding from it. However, sustained focus and increased funding are crucial to boost the fight against malaria. Its elimination in India is important from a global and regional perspective because the country has the highest malaria burden outside sub-Saharan Africa. Some 1.26 billion Indians are at risk of malaria and the country shares its borders with several nations aiming for malaria elimination, including Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal. Sri Lanka, which eliminated malaria in 2016, is separated by only a small stretch of sea, with frequent air travel occurring between the two neighbours. India also shares borders with Myanmar where a drug-resistant malaria parasite has been reported. Successful malaria control in India will enhance elimination efforts across the region and the world.

The challenges for the mammoth task — private sector partnership, increased domestic funding, surveillance mechanism, impact on the vulnerable population — need to be addressed. Till then there’s no room for complacency.

4,25-2-20,BJD woman leader death: DGP orders probe by IGP,"Director General of Police (DGP) Abhay on Monday ordered a high-level inquiry into the death of Brahmapur BJD woman leader Meenakshi Mishra, who succumbed to burn injuries while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar after attempting self-immolation in front of Brahmapur SP office earlier this month.

The probe would be conducted by IGP (Modernisation) Rekha Lohani.

On February 12, Mishra attempted suicide by setting herself on fire after pouring kerosene on her in front of the Brahmapur SP office. She decided to take the extreme step after failing to meet the SP while protesting against the arrest of her son Raja for his alleged involvement in an altercation over parking issue in Brahmapur.

Soon after her suicide attempt, Mishra was rushed to the MKCG Medical College Hospital in Brahmapur and later shifted to the SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack. After her condition further deteriorated, she was shifted to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar, where she ultimately died.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjd-woman-leader-death--dgp-orders-probe-by-igp.html

7,25-2-20,A Constitution not so fragile,"Proud, natural-born citizens of the country must see through the dubious plans of selective propaganda on CAA and NPR

The agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and related matters, triggered largely by fears that the Union Government will deprive millions of Muslims of their citizenship, is one of the most confusing agitations that this writer has witnessed over the past five decades. The CAA has nothing to do with the Indian citizens. It only seeks to provide citizenship to a limited number of people who have been persecuted in three Islamic Republics neighbouring India. The premise on which the agitation is being carried on is completely baseless and is indicative of the extent of mischief a bunch of malcontents can do when the electorate rejects their agenda.

Organisers of the agitation are calling people to the protest sites by spreading rumours that the CAA will enable the Government to snatch away their citizenship, when the fact is that the law has nothing to do with the people of this country. More importantly, anyone, who reads the Citizenship Act, 1955, (the entire Act and not just the 2019 amendment to it), will realise how water-tight the citizenship of a natural-born citizen (a person born on Indian soil) is under this Act and that in reality, no one has the power to take it away. Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, describes citizens of India “by birth.” It says:

“Every person born in India (a) on or after January 26, 1950, but before July 1, 1987; (b) on or after the July 1, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth; (c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where (i) both his parents are citizens of India; or (ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, shall be a citizen of India by birth.”

As can be seen, probably 99 per cent or more of the Indian citizens fall in this category called “citizens by birth” and they belong to all religions — Hindu, Muslim and Christian among others. Such people are also known as “natural born” citizens. They are distinct from naturalised citizens and indeed constitute the highest class of citizens (for example in the US, only a natural born citizen can be the President). These citizens (this writer included) do not “apply” for citizenship. They become citizens when they first breathe life. They do not make an oath, swearing allegiance to the Constitution of India because their every breath is deemed allegiance. Their loyalty is taken for granted. They can give up their Indian citizenship but no power can deprive them of their citizenship. Among such citizens, those who commit rape and murder, can be hanged for the offence, if the law so provides, but their citizenship cannot be snatched away from them. The Act does not provide for it. They will take their citizenship to the gallows. Such is the quality of this citizenship.

The citizenship Act offers other categories of citizenship like citizenship by registration (Section 5) and naturalisation (Section 6). These are basically for foreigners who wish to settle in India and seek Indian citizenship or people of Indian origin living abroad who want to return to India and live as citizens in this country. There is another category — foreigners, who marry Indian citizens and settle down in the country. Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, is an Italian expatriate who moved to India after her marriage to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1968.

Under Section 5(2), Indian citizenship can be granted to a person coming via the registration route. There is a similar provision under Section 6 (2) for expatriates who apply for Indian citizenship through “naturalisation.” In both cases, citizenship is granted, subject to conditions and restrictions, and only after they make the oath of allegiance.

In the case of Sonia Gandhi, as per the law at that time, she could have applied for Indian citizenship five years after marriage but she did so only after 15 years on April 7, 1983, and was granted citizenship on April 30, 1983. Despite being an Italian citizen in 1980, she illegally entered the electoral rolls that year and following a complaint, her name was deleted from the rolls. However, this is another story for another day. But one may ask, how is all this relevant?

These facts are pertinent because unlike natural-born citizens, Sonia Gandhi’s citizenship is extremely vulnerable. Being a “naturalised” citizen, her citizenship is subject to several conditions and restrictions. Further, if she violates any of those conditions, her citizenship can be cancelled.

Section 10 of the citizenship Act lists out the situations in which a citizen by registration or naturalisation can be deprived of his/her citizenship. It says that if the registration or certificate of naturalisation was obtained by means of fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact; or that citizen has shown himself by act or speech to be disloyal or disaffected towards the Constitution of India as by law established; or that citizen has, during any war in which India may be engaged, unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy; or that citizen has been ordinarily resident out of India for a continuous period of seven years”, his/her citizenship can be cancelled.

Further, unlike citizens by birth, a naturalised citizen has to swear allegiance to the Constitution of India. It cannot be taken for granted. Every Muslim citizen, who is swayed by the anti-CAA argument, must ask himself/herself the following questions in order to know the quality of citizenship he/she enjoys: Did he/she ever “apply” for citizenship like Sonia Gandhi? Was he/she ever asked to swear allegiance to the Constitution of India, like her? So, this is the power and quality of the citizenship of 99 per cent of the citizens under the Citizenship Act, 1955, but the Congress, after its decimation in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, wants the Muslims of India to believe that their citizenship is as fragile as that of its party president.

This is nothing but an attempt to spread falsehood and disaffection. It could even be seen as an attempt to overthrow a duly elected Government through guile and subterfuge. Proud natural-born citizens of India — Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Jews — must disengage themselves from this campaign which is dangerous for our democracy and for our constitutional well-being.

8,25-2-20,Indo-China row,"Beijing’s selective engagement with India on the Wuhan evacuations is plain confrontationist

Desperate times call for desperate measures and when a global crisis has a new name called Coronavirus with a hydra-headed manifestation, then politics should be the last concern between nations who must unitedly fight it. Unfortunately, China, which is filtering the extent of its health crisis lest it be construed as bad propaganda for its global stakes, has let that unease creep into its bilateral ties with India. Seems like the spiralling epidemic has torn the “relative calm” in the strategic partnership. A spat that could have been settled by discussion and mutual understanding has unnecessarily been allowed to gain traction. The current row stems from China’s refusal to grant permission to our military aircraft for the evacuation of several Indians from the Coronavirus-hit Wuhan. Although China facilitated the civil flights by rescue missions, it is dragging its feet over clearances for this one, attributing it to procedural norms given the disease has reached a higher degree of criticality. But India maintains that it is precisely because of this and its responsibility to protect its citizens that it was sending in the C-17 Globemaster, equipped with medical facilities, to bring back Indians, assuming they were infected. Yet in a tit-for-tat response, Beijing accused New Delhi of being selfish and holding back essential medical equipment required by local authorities and medical workers for treating patients. More, China has called upon the Indian authorities to follow the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines that call for resumption of all trade and personal exchanges with it to restore normalcy. Yet the world knows that when it comes to humanitarian missions, India has never held itself back. So this strong-arm and negotiatory tactics by the Chinese are not warranted. In all this bickering, not least unexpected, the Chinese response was the same as it was during the outbreak of the virus, “denial.” So the fate of around 100-odd Indians, who remain stuck in the Chinese city, is still undecided.

Besides, Beijing cannot justify its “selective” engagement with India on the evacuation process, allowing permission to some while denying it to others. As it turns out, in the same “critical period,” three other nations were allowed to operate their evacuation flights. What is incomprehensible is that just a few days ago, the Chinese authorities applauded the “kindness” shown by New Delhi in helping them tackle the outbreak. Premier Xi Jinping had himself lauded India for offering solidarity and assistance. The mixed messages are typical of the larger Chinese strategy of keeping us on our toes by speaking in a forked tongue. Despite this blow-hot-blow-cold attitude of the Chinese, the Indian Government chose to keep differences aside and sought to aggressively push itself to help China contain the virus. From agreeing to test clinical samples from abroad in its laboratories to offering help with the evacuation of people from affected areas to lifting the ban on the export of personal protection equipment — it has done it all. The least one could have expected of the Chinese, given their continued emphasis on strategic relationship and intention to look at trade and other broader areas of cooperation, was to acknowledge the role played by other nations, including India, in fighting the epidemic. But that’s too much to ask from it. In all the three sorties carried out to date, where more than 600 Indians have been airlifted, working with China has been a nightmare with the biggest hurdle coming by way of getting approvals from its authorities — Central, provincial as well as local. It must also not be forgotten that ripple effects of the spread of the virus are being felt in India, as in other nations. We, too, need to be prepared to tackle any potential crisis. India’s stand with regard to restrictions on some medical devices assumes prominence on account of our fast depleting stocks and low domestic output. In fact, the crisis has led to the deep realisation of how we are heavily reliant on the Chinese for the procurement of raw materials and key ingredients for the production of medical equipment and drugs. So much so that the Government is all set to create new opportunities for Indian firms to emerge as an alternative producing destination to fill the supply vacuum. This outbreak should serve as a warning for Indian industries to diversify their supply chains and encourage the production of critical components within India. Till we are dependent on supplies from China, it will use our weakness to leverage diplomacy.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indo-china-row-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/indo-china-row.html
9,25-2-20,Fatty Indians,"Delhi and Ahmedabad top the ICMR’s study of people consuming fats above prescribed levels

That Indian cuisine is high on flavour is an undisputed fact but so is the reality that it is making us sick. Not because there’s anything wrong with our food but because our eating habits are askew and we are over-dependent on coating our food with fat. We think nothing of adding more butter to our food and eating deep fried snacks, biryani, paranthas and so on, especially in the metropolitan cities where there’s a culture of indulgence, easy availability of rich foods, even late at night thanks to food apps and an increasing capacity to pay for foods that we crave for. It’s no surprise then that a recent survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on consumption patterns in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai shows that the average intake of added fat in all the seven metro cities pooled together was 32.6 grams per person each day, which is higher than the ICMR-recommended levels of 20 grams. Out of these seven cities, Delhi and Ahmedabad topped the list in the daily average consumption of fat. Overall, 18 per cent of the total intake of energy was obtained from visible fat and vegetarians consumed more fat at 40.7 grams per person daily than non-vegetarians at 30.2 grams. The survey also revealed that men consume more fat at 34.1 grams than women who consume 31.1 grams per day. These figures are worrying as the country’s burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is escalating at an alarming rate.

While NCDs typically affect people above 55 in most developed nations, in India, they occur at least 10 years earlier. Not only are they eroding our human capital, an increasing healthcare burden is one of the major public health challenges the country is facing. And as Government spending on health is a dismal 1.2 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), this means that the burden of rising lifestyle diseases like cancer, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular complexities is increasingly being borne by individuals out of their pockets. Ludicrously, India is fighting the twin burden of undernutrition and overnutrition, which leaves the Government and healthcare professionals with the dilemma of solving both issues concurrently. Also, it is ironic that both Delhi and Ahmedabad top the list of unhealthy eaters, considering the fact that in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been improving healthcare facilities and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hails from Gujarat, has been an avid proponent of the Fit India Movement. Maybe, it’s time Governments began looking at creating more awareness as part of their efforts to keep India healthy.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fatty-indians-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/fatty-indians.html
10,25-2-20,Reduce the income gap,"The solution doesn’t lie in more sops, fiscal incentives and so on. There is need for change in the way our industrialists do business and netas and babus conduct themselves

Successive Governments have remained obsessed with accelerating economic growth without caring about how it impacts income distribution, forget any attempt to internalise this crucial aspect in development strategies. They believe that the fruits of growth will automatically percolate to the lowest strata of society. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This is evident from a piece of research, Time to Care, released by rights group Oxfam ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) held in Davos (Switzerland) from January 21-24. According to the study, India’s richest one per cent hold more than four-times the wealth held by the 953 million people who make up the bottom 70 per cent of the country’s population. Further, the combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires is higher than the total Union Budget of the country for the fiscal year 2018-19.

At the global level, too, the report (for calculations, it draws upon latest data sources available, including the Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Databook, 2019 and Forbes’ 2019 Billionaires List) brings out glaring inequalities in the distribution of wealth. The world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 per cent of the planet’s population. The 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa. The report notes, “global inequality is shockingly entrenched even as the number of billionaires has doubled in the last decade”.

The Governments world over are fully aware of these glaring inequalities as well as their consequences. For instance, the WEF’s annual Global Risks Report (GRR) — which was thoroughly discussed during the brainstorming sessions at Davos — observes, “inequality underlies recent social unrest in almost every continent, although it may be sparked by different tipping points such as corruption, constitutional breaches or the rise in prices for basic goods and services”. It also warned, “the downward pressure on the global economy from macroeconomic fragilities and financial inequality continued to intensify in 2019.”

They also routinely pledge to address these inequalities and come out with lofty declarations at multilateral platforms, including those under the auspices of the United Nations to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, including by use of what the GRR terms as “deliberate inequality-busting policies.” Yet, when it comes to action on ground zero, there is acute lack of political will on the part of Governments and other stakeholders; hence, the business as usual scenario and ever-increasing inequities.

Fundamentally, inequalities are intrinsic to the way businesses are planned and orchestrated. It all starts with the Government offering a policy environment in which investors are offered an opportunity to earn an attractive rate of return on investment. What that attractive rate should be is not normally defined (though in certain sectors like power, it guarantees a minimum return); so any level, howsoever high, can fall within the scope of “attractiveness.” A vast majority of the businesses pursue the famous adage “profit maximisation” to the hilt. They distribute their expenses in such a manner that the least amount is given to the labour and the bulk of it comes back to the owner (or promoter) as “retained earnings.” The owners/promoters also leave no stone unturned in ensuring that their tax liability is kept at a bare minimum (for this, they retain the best talent viz. chartered accountants and other financial wizards, paying them extraordinarily high salaries). Big businesses also enjoy pricing power. For instance, those operating in metals such as copper, zinc or in hydrocarbon viz. oil and gas enjoy natural monopoly. Leveraging this, they charge high prices, making windfall gains even as consumers suffer erosion in purchasing power. This also applies to banks who enjoy margins of three-four per cent (difference between the average interest earning and the average cost of funds) yielding mammoth profit. Furthermore, there are companies in the IT (information technology) and IT-enabled sector which use their intellectual prowess to post huge profits year-after-year.

Then, there are enterprises in the chemical, petrochemicals and agrochemicals sectors who have hugely benefitted from a protective policy environment, with high tariff on imports as well as licensing and registration requirements. These companies make money at the expense of millions of consumers, including farmers (for instance, they have to pay a high price for “new” crop protection solutions for which domestic substitutes are not available).

The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) may not be so well positioned vis-a-vis large enterprises but ape the latter when it comes to distributing the proceeds of wealth generation. Their owners spend the least on payment to workers thereby boosting their retained earnings. They, too, get tax bonanza from the Government in a variety of ways (for instance, special package under composition scheme of Goods and Services Tax as well as income tax). They may not find a place in the billionaires’ club but definitely earn the multi-millionaire tag.

Then, there is the trader class, particularly entities dealing in farm commodities. They buy products from farmers at a throwaway price — the minimum support price (MSP) notified by the Government remains mostly on paper as its agencies don’t have the wherewithal to procure their produce — and sell to the consumer at a high price. Irrespective of whether there is surplus or deficit, Indian markets are so orchestrated that only traders emerge as the real beneficiaries at the expense of farmers at one end and consumers at the other.

There is yet another class of rich who are an offshoot of corruption in governance systems. This includes corrupt bureaucrats, politicians (besides dubious businessmen) who amass wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income by siphoning off funds from welfare schemes and diversion of funds borrowed from public sector banks to personal accounts or shell companies of which they are the ultimate beneficiaries.

How does the Government address income inequalities? Typically, this takes the form of giving relief to the poor by providing State assistance in cash or kind. For instance, under the PM-KISAN, the Government gives Rs 6,000 per annum to each of the 145 million farmers in the country in three installments of Rs 2,000 each. As for help in kind, it provides Mid-Day Meals to schoolchildren or free medical services to Economically Weaker Sections in hospitals.

There are umpteen instances of such assistance — both by the Centre and States — entailing a mountain of burden on the public exchequer. All of this goes only to help millions barely survive even as a good slice of this is siphoned off (the malice continues in substantial measure despite the Government’s efforts to prevent it, using the direct benefit transfer mechanism). However, it does nothing to augment their productive capacity and prepare them for getting jobs. Even where funds are given for empowering and increasing the income earning capacity (for instance, availability of credit at concessional rate of interest to farmers and others engaged in petty occupations, supply of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers at subsidised rate, free electricity to farmers and so on), much of the promised help either does not reach or is cornered mostly by better-off farmers. Even those who gain from these support measures are at the receiving end when it comes to interface with traders for selling their produce.

Quite clearly, despite mammoth sums spent on welfare of the poor or “empowering” them, income inequalities increase even during periods of rapid economic growth. Even when, growth decelerates (for instance, during the current year when it declined to an 11-year-low of five per cent), then also the inequalities persist as the poor lose much more than the loss experienced by the rich.

The solution doesn’t lie in more sops, concessional credit, fiscal incentives and so on. There is need for a fundamental change in the way our industrialists do business and politicians and bureaucrats conduct themselves. While, the former need to shed their overzealousness for profits, charge less from consumers, distribute more to workers and pay more taxes, the latter must ensure that every rupee is spent for the welfare and empowerment of the poor.

Even as the Government shuffles policy choices to attune them for creating more jobs and increase income (by promoting labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, apparels, food service, hospitality and so on), unless the stakeholders change their mindset towards the majority who are not so privileged, inequalities will continue to haunt and as pointed out in the GRR, even growth will remain vulnerable to the deep divide between the rich and the poor.

12,25-2-20,"Sunni Waqf Board to build mosque, hospital on 5-acre land","UP Sunni Central Waqf Board decided to accept the five acres of land offered to construct a mosque after the Supreme Court verdict of November 9, 2019.

A charitable hospital, public library and Indo-Islamic cultural centre would also be constructed at the site. Six of the eight members were present at a crucial meeting on Monday, even as two members — Imran Mabood and Adul Razzaq, chose to boycott it.

The land was given to Sunni Waqf Board as per the Supreme Court verdict to compensate for the demolished Babri mosque at Ayodhya. The Board also decided to set up a trust for the construction of the mosque.

The Sunni Waqf Board was the main litigant from Muslim side in Ram Janma bhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute title suit. A Board team had visited the alternate land last week.

Chairman of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board Zufar Farooqui said, “In Monday’s meeting held in Lucknow, members discussed the formalities related to accepting the land, initiating the formation of a trust and deciding on other linked structures, apart from the mosque, that could come up on the five-acre land.”

“Besides the mosque on the alternate land, the board will also set up a cultural centre depicting Indo-Islamic architecture and civilisation. The names of trust members and other details will be announced at a later date,’’ said Farooqui.

The board chairman further said that the centre would also undertake study and research in Indo-Islamic architecture. He said that a charitable hospital, public library and other facilities for common people would also be set up at the centre.

On February 20, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board had said that it did not have the option to reject the alternative piece of land given to it by the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict but it would decide on its use when it meets on Monday.

In a historic verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute in November, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot be found for a mosque. Soon after the verdict, there were suggestions that the Board should not accept the land.

Based on the SC verdict, the Centre had asked the UP government to allot five acres of land to Sunni Waqf Board.

The UP cabinet allotted a land tract on February 5 and gave allotment letter of the plot in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya’s Sohawal tehsil to the Waqf Board earlier this months. The plot is located 200 metres off Ayodhya-Lucknow highway, about 18-km from Ayodhya district headquarters.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sunni-waqf-board-to--build-mosque--hospital--on-5-acre-land.html
13,25-2-20,STF guns down hardened criminal,"Sleuths of Special Task Force (STF) claimed to have eliminated a hardened criminal carrying a reward of Rs 1.5 lakh during an encounter in Suhela village in Basti in the early hours of Monday. However, one of the aides of the slain criminal managed to escape. Slain gangster Feroz Pathan was wanted in several cases in Uttar Pradesh and other states.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that Pathan was killed during a gunfight, in which STF constable Imran was also injured. The cops of Gorakhpur Police were also assisted the STF during the exchange of fire.

Awasthi said that acting on a tip-off, a team comprising STF and local police personnel of Gorakhpur surrounded Lalgarh area in Basti early on Monday morning and noticed two men coming on a motorcycle. When the riders were signaled to stop, the person riding pillion got down and started firing at the police team while the driver managed to escape.

“Pathan and constable Imran were injured in the gunfight and were taken to a Community Health Centre from where Pathan was referred to District Hospital, Basti, where he was declared dead upon arrival,” Awasthi said.

Awasthi said that the state government announced a cash reward of Rs 2 lakh for the police team for the successful operation.

SP of Basti, Hemraj Meena said that they had declared a reward of Rs 1 lakh on Pathan while Allahabad SSP had announced a bounty of Rs 50,000.

14,25-2-20,UP blames Delhi for pollution in Yamuna,"The Uttar Pradesh government blamed Delhi for the pollution in Yamuna river and claimed that Holy Ganga had been cleaned from Bijnore to Ballia.

Replying to a question of BSP member Shyam Sunder Sharma in the Assembly, UP Jal Skakti Minister Dr Mahendra Singh said that the state government was doing every thing to clean Yamuna too, but due to Delhi, the river still remained polluted.

“Delhi is doing nothing to clear Yamuna except for taking water to meet drinking water need of the national capital. As Mathura shares border with Delhi, it is bearing the brunt of the former’s callous approach,” he said.

The minister said that the government identified nullah flowing into the Ganga. “Out of the total 217 nullah flowing in Ganga, 191 nullah were diverted while in Yamuna, of the total 170 nullahs, 49 have been diverted,” he said.

Singh said that all 1038 villages and 21 cities on the bank of Ganga have been declared Open Defecation-Free (ODF) while 123 STPs were working and 51 were under construction.

Singh also said that under Namami Gange programme, 78 cremation places on Ganga river have been modernised while similar cremation places would be developed on the banks of Yamuna too.

15,25-2-20,Aligarh violence rocks both Houses,"The face-off between anti-CAA protesters and police in Aligarh rocked both the Houses of UP Legislature on Monday with opposition parties demanding a judicial probe claiming that law and order situation was spiraling out of hands in the state.

The issue was first raised during Question Hour in the Assembly and later during Zero Hour in both Houses.

Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary alleged that women were beaten up by the police and in the ensuing firing one person was killed.

“The situation in Aligarh is very tense and innocent people faced harassment of the people,” he said.

However, Parliamentary Affairs minister Suresh Kumar Khanna charged the opposition for instigating violence and claimed that there was no deaths during the violence.

“UP government is committed to maintaining law and order and will take action if anyone takes law into their hand and the opposition were just shedding crocodile tears,” Khanna added.

Later, SP and Congress members joined the issue demanding a debate.

However on pursuance of Speaker Hriday Narain Dikshit, the opposition agreed to raise the issue during Zero Hour in which Samajwadi Party said that the government had willfully targeted members of a particular community.

“This government does not want people to raise voice against its policies. Poor people are out on the streets against the draconian CAA but this government is hell bent on muzzling voice of dissent,” Chaudhary said.

The SP demanded a probe into the matter by the sitting judge of High Court. On the other hand, the Congress demanded a judicial probe into the matter.

The government claimed that the police used restraint and was forced to act when the situation went out of hand. The Parliamentary Affairs Minister ruled out a probe into the matter after which SP members walked out of the Assembly.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aligarh-violence--rocks-both-houses.html
16,25-2-20,Women survivors flay US President Trump,"Hundreds of women survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster today flayed US President Trump in effigy with brooms on the occasion of his visit to India. Led by four local organisations, the survivors expressed their anger against the US Government for refusing to serve summons issued by the Bhopal Court upon Dow Chemical, owner of Union Carbide.

Madhya Pradesh Muslim Vikas Parishad a local social service organisation supported the demonstrators’ call for justice in the criminal case on the World’s worst industrial disaster.

“Since 2016, when Trump came to power, the Bhopal district court has twice summoned Dow Chemical, as owner of Union Carbide that is absconding charges of corporate manslaughter, but Trump’s Department of Justice has refused to serve these summons upon Dow,” said Rashida Bee, President of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh.

Nasreen Khan of the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha said, “In violating the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) between India and USA, the Trump Government is sheltering the perpetrators of the worst corporate massacre in history.”

“It is now clear that Trump is visiting India mainly to further the interests of death dealing US corporations like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Westinghouse and others.

It is indeed shocking that our Prime Minister in his eagerness to please Trump has not sought, let alone pressed for, US governments’ cooperation in bringing the killers of Bhopal to justice,” said Rachna Dhingra of the Bhopal Group for Information & Action.

Durgesh Ahirwar of Children against Dow Carbide said, ” In Bhopal hundreds of victims of Union Carbide are still dying untimely deaths, hundreds of thousands are battling chronic illnesses and tens of thousands of children are being born with malformations and growth disorders.

21,25-2-20,Odisha to have separate cops’ cadre for coastal security,"As dedicated manpower is needed to handle coastal security, a separate cadre for Coastal Security Police will be created in all coastal States.

Odisha, being one of the major coastal States, has not yet established separate cadre for Coastal Security Police, though it has a 480km-long coastline.

While Odisha has kept coastal security in charge of an Additional DGP rank officer, requirement of a separate cadre will go a long way in strengthening the security system in the marine zones.

Odisha has 18 Marine Police Stations covering the entire coastline and two more police stations are needed for which the State Government has already approached the Ministry of Home Affairs.

In order to handle coastal security, officers and field staff are taken from the regular police force and after their deputation tenure is over they return to original cadre and this creates vacuum. With such ad hoc system, coastal security is being run in several States and looking at the requirement, some of the coastal States have created separate cadres for coastal policing.

Accordingly, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andaman & Nicober Island have already formed separate wings of coastal security police. Large numbers of man power are available in the country with a lot of personnel retiring from Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy. Their expertise can be roped in for setting up separate wing or cadre of Coastal Security Police.

Several State Governments are roping in services of superannuated personnel of Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guards. As the general police force is not having the expertise to run boats provided by Union Government to the States, roping in services of the fishermen as boat crew is also advised.

In a recent meeting on coastal security, the issue cropped up and there was unanimity that the present recruitment rules are needed to be amended to facilitate such recruitments for coastal security.

Sources said the Union Government will be supplying 26 fast interceptor boats for the Marine Police Stations as the State Government is harping on for such provisions because the boats provided for coastal security are not capable of facing tide and entering to sea. So most of the operations are taken up when sea is calm, sources said.

The idea of roping in services of the villagers and fishermen for coastal security has also found currency as those people are more concerned for their coastal zones.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odisha-to-have-separate-cops----cadre-for-coastal-security.html

24,25-2-20,How do we define consciousness of our mind?,"Consciousness has been defined as current awareness of our mind about such things as our sensations, perception, memories, feelings and fantasies. Some of these, which our conscious mind wants to be kept hidden, are stored in our unconscious mind.

Consciousness is an ability of humans to perceive reality and report it through expressions. It is a subjective experience and may differ among individuals.

Our conscious mind experiences a unique sensation when we observe something with our sense organs. It is an experience which is unique to each person and cannot be expressed verbally. In philosophy, they use the term ‘qualia’, defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experiences.

One cannot verbally explain the colour red to a person born blind or the sound of music to a born deaf person. While we perceive them as unified properties of outside world, they are products of our mind (Chalmers, 1995).

Research indicates that our consciousness of something lags almost third of second behind the event itself (Dehaene, 2014).Brain imaging studies indicate that language processing areas are directly involved even in the simplest discriminations of basic colours (Kastrup, 2018).

A study conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2012) on anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness indicated that when the participants lost consciousness, their brain activities began to show regular oscillation between nstates of activation and deactivation. The deactivated or silent periods occurred at different times in different brain regions, which resulted in interruption of communication between regions.

Consciousness comes and goes every day when we wake up and go to sleep. We may lose consciousness by administration of anaesthetics or due to brain injury. All of these lacks subjective experience* (Demertzi and others, 2019).

*(It would be pertinent to cite here my personal experience. I was to undergo a minor surgery and lying on the table in the operation theatre. It was 5 pm on the wall clock. The anaesthetist put a mask on my face and released anaesthesia. His assistant asked him, “But where is the surgeon?” I became conscious. Why were they giving me anaesthesia when the surgeon had not arrived? I thought of taking out my mask but became unconscious. When I awoke, I found myself in a bed in the ICU. I remembered my suspicion and asked the nurse, “What’s the time.” She told me it was 5.40 pm. I felt assured there was no delay. When I asked the surgeon, he confirmed that he was in the antechamber wearing masks, aprons and preparing to undertake the surgery. Was it not a subjective experience?)

Can quantum physics explain our brain’s ability to think?

From consciousness to long-term memory, the human brain has peculiar computing abilities, which could possibly be explained by fuzziness of quantum theory (Brooks, 2015).

Fisher (2015) used the term ‘quantum cognition’ and explored the possibility of quantum processing in the brain. He suggested phosphorus as the unique biological element with a nuclear spin that can serve as a cubit for putative quantum processing in the brain.

Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose collaborated with Arizona-based anaesthetist Stuart Hameroff to suggest ‘The Orch-OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) theory’ (Hameroff and Penrose, 2014) based on quantum mechanics. The theory proposes that quantum computation in the brain microtubules accounts for our consciousness. Orch-Or links consciousness with fundamental space-time geometry and concludes that it plays an intrinsic role in the universe.

Christof Koch, chief scientist and president Allen Institute of Brain Science (alleninstitute.org,2019) says humans have approximately 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections or synapses. It is a daunting task to understand the details of how these cells work, let alone how they come together to make up our sensory system, our behaviour or our consciousness.

Human consciousness is supported by a dynamic complex pattern of brain signal coordination. Redinbaugh and others (2020) conducted functional MRI and electrophysiological studies on monkey brain and suggested that ‘Consciousness depends on large-scale thermo cortical and cortico-cortical interactions. Consciousness also depends on deep layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers.’

Recently, backed by Koch (2019), two concepts on consciousness are going to be tested under a $20-million project. Brain activity of two groups of volunteers would be scanned while performing a series of cleverly-designed tasks targeted to find out brain’s physical origin of conscious thought.

The two theories are:

i) Global Work Space (GWS) theory of Stanislas Dehaene of College de France, Paris

ii) Integrated Information (IIT) theory of Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, backed by Koch.

According to GWS, consciousness arises when we integrate and segregate information from multiple sources such as sense organs and combine it into a piece of data in a global workspace within the brain. The workspace itself creates consciousness and acts as a motivational whip to drive actions. Brain-imaging studies in human suggest that the prefrontal cortex acts as central processing unit similar to a computer.

According to IIT, consciousness arises from intrinsic interconnectedness of brain’s network. When neurons connect in the ‘right’ way under ‘right’ circumstances, consciousness naturally emerges to create the sensation of experience. According to IIT, this happens in the back of the brain where neurons connect in a grid-like structure and would be able to support this capacity.

The theories will be tested in six different labs across the world, where 500 people will be subjected to three different types of brain recordings (MRI, EEG, ECoG-a type of EEG with electrodes directly placed on the brain).

Several journals have assured to publish the results.

25,25-2-20,"Opposition flays annual budget, says Yogi in self-congratulatory mode","Opposition parties in UP Assembly trashed the annual budget for the 2020-21 fiscal presented on February 18, accusing the Yogi government of being in ‘self-congratulatory mode’, claiming that it had presented the biggest-ever budget of over Rs 5 lakh crore.

The opposition said on Monday that the annual hike in the budget was a routine affair and actual achievement lay in utilisation of budgetary grants and the government had singularly failed to spend money on development schemes and projects.

Initiating the general debate on budget, Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary said, “There is an atmosphere of fear in the state as the BJP government is aggressively pursuing divisive politics based on caste and religion. Development works have come to a grinding halt. Even as the government claims to sign MOUs for investments worth lakhs of crores of rupees, nothing is visible on the ground. The government made tall claims that it presented the biggest ever budget akin to claims was made during the presentation of 2019-20 budget in February last year.’’

Chaudhary added, “The claim is fictitious as by adjusting 7.5 percent inflation, the actual budget size has in fact shrunk. Provisions in last budget for new schemes included was over Rs 20,000 crore which has dipped to little above Rs 10,000 crore for 2020-21.”

The Leader of Opposition also said that the utilization of budgetary grants in 2019-20 budget was less than 50 percent, yet the government inflated the size of the 2020-21 budget.

“There is no point in expanding size of the budget if the government lacks the resources for financing schemes and the ability and administrative competence to utilize the budget,’’said the Samajwadi Party leader.

Questioning the efficacy of development schemes of the government, the SP leader said, “The government claims to provided free power and LPG connections to millions of people in the state. But it also hiked power tariff by 27 percent in less than three years. Also, due to economic slowdown and high inflation, very few people are in a position to afford refill of the LPG. Instead of putting money in the pocket of people, the government is in fact extracting it from them.’’

Chaudhary said that the government’s policy of devoting each year’s budget for particular sector yielded nothing.

“The first budget of Yogi government in 2017-18, was dedicated to farmers, second for industrial development, third for women empowerment and the fourth and the present one for youth, education and employment. So far no sector has benefitted from the policy,’’he charged.

The SP leader also said that the haphazard loan waiver scheme for farmers announced in 2017 made little impact and thousands of farmers committed suicide and were still ending their lives.

27,25-2-20,"Cong takes dig at new excise policy, raises drug addiction issue","The opposition Congress corned the BJP-JJP Government on the second day of the Budget Session here while replying to the Governor’s address.

The Congress leaders slammed the Government over the new excise policy, saying it will encourage liquor addiction among youths, and asked the ruling dispensation to take effective steps to curb the growing drug menace instead in the state.

Speaking on the thanksgiving motion on Governor’s address in the assembly, senior Congress leader Rao Dan Singh accused the current government of failing on all fronts. Government has failed to address farmers’ concerns, provide quality education to students, quality health services to common people among others.

Referring to some provisions of the excise policy, he claimed “it will increase liquor addiction among youths”. The State Government has allowed the common man to keep liquor and beer boxes in the house after taking a fee of one thousand rupees. It is extremely unfortunate.

On the issue of drug malady, Singh said “after Punjab, drug menace is fast spreading in Haryana” and called upon the Government to take effective steps to control it.

While raising farmers issue in the House, Singh, who is the MLA from south Haryana constituency Mahendergarh said the cooperative sugar mills are yet to clear the outstanding dues of cane growers.

He says government talks different and acts differently. Singh called the Government's slogan of 'one Haryana, one Haryanvi' wrong and said that the Government should adopt the slogan 'Ek Bharatiya, Ek Bharat'.

On water issue, he said during the BJP Government's rule, people of south Haryana have only got assurances that water will reach the tail ends.

Referring to the mounting debt of the state, Singh pointed towards the Treasury benches and said, “You are running the Government on borrowings.”

He faced repeated interruptions from BJP members Mahipal Dhanda and Aseem Goel who tried to launch a counter attack, prompting Bhupinder Singh Hooda to tell the Chair that if they do not allow his party legislator to speak, the Congress members too will be forced to interrupt the BJP MLAs when they speak on Governor's Address.

GOVT WORKS ON THE SPIRIT OF 'SABKA SAATH, SABKA VIKAS'

The discussion on the motion of thanks to the Governor's address was moved by Senior BJP leader and MLA from Nangal Choudhary Abhay Singh Yadav and seconded by Barwala MLA Jogi Ram Sihag.

Yadav said the previous BJP government in the state undertook equitable development and now the present BJP-JJP dispensation was continuing that with the spirit of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas”.

The BJP legislator referred to the government's various steps in agriculture, health, education and other sectors.

He said that the BJP-led state government successfully implemented election manifesto of 2014 and have also been implementing of election manifesto of 2019. The State Government has done uniform development across the State. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is being successfully implemented in the State. “I would suggest the government to lay emphasis on creating awareness about this scheme among farmers,” he added. Government is promoting scientific farming and soli health card has been given to farmers. One member Haryana Kisan Ayog has been made to look into the issues of farmers. We would suggest the government to include more members of different fields including horticulture, marketing among others in the commission.

We have limited source of irrigation water. Shortage of water is being faced by different districts Mahendragarh, Bhiwani, Palwal, Rewari and Mewat region. The State government is working in this direction.

While participating in the Governor's Address, JJP MLA Jogi Ram Sihag asked the state government to take back cases registered against youths during the Jat quota agitation in the state four years ago.

In a press statement issued here, MLA Sanjay Talwar said that Ashu is associated with a party that is known for its sacrifices for restoring peace and communal harmony in Punjab. He said that Ashu is known as a leader who is spearheading development of Ludhiana, which was earlier neglected during the SAD-BJP regime.

Talwar said he has known Ashu for decades and he has always been known as the development man of Ludhiana. On the other hand suspended DSP Balwinder Sekhon is a mere pawn in the hands of his political masters and is giving frivolous statements just to please some “leaders” for his own personal gains.

He said the stand of opposition parties in support of a tainted official such as DSP Sekhon also raises questions over their own credibility, adding that Ashu had received several complaints against suspended DSP Sekhon as he has been suspended in the past too. The MLAs said that being a grounded leader, Ashu has always stood for the people and when DSP Sekhon was reprimanded over his corrupt acts, he started spreading lies against Ashu.

Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid warned suspended DSP Sekhon from spreading lies against Ashu. He said every person in Ludhiana knows about the credibility of Ashu, who does not need any certificate from either the suspended DSP or the opposition leaders, who themselves have a dubious track record.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/two-mlas-support-punjab-minister-ashu--slam-opposition.html

He also directed that the Estate Office to put in place a facilitative mechanism for speedy registration of all the entities who wish to legally register themselves as PG accommodation.

The Deputy Commissioner also made it clear that the Estate Office will immediately move a proposal for making the fire NOC and periodical fire inspections mandatory in any PGs so as to ensure the safety of the life and property.

It has been decided that a call centre with Estate Office helpline number 1860-1802067 would be established where any citizens can call and provide information about any illegal paying guest facility. This call centre would immediately send the complaints to the concerned SDMs for immediate necessary action as per law.

Apart from this, all the tenants have to be registered with the police which would regularly carry out checks and gather data about the number of tenants in a particular house. The SSP, Chandigarh would share the data of any abnormal number of tenants or guests with the concerned SDMs and also take independent action against them in accordance with the law.

Only 25 PGs registered

More than 1000 PGs are reportedly running across the city while there are only 25 registered PGs in official records of UT Administration.

During Monday’s meeting, the DC asked the SDMs and other concerned officers on why no action was taken against unauthorized PG facilities till now. He also directed the officers to ensure that strict action is taken against unauthorized PG facilities in the city.

Notably, three major violations were found in the initial inquiry at the Sector 32 two-storey house that had caught fire on Saturday leading to the death of three young girls while two others had suffered injuries. The deceased were Muskan Mehta, Riya Arora and Pakshi Grover, all aged between 19 and 21

years.

The PG was not registered as paying guest, no police verification was done and there were structural flaws in the building. The SDM (south) will be submitting a detailed report into the fire incident in next two days with the DC.

Chandigarh police had arrested Nitish Bansal, who was running this illegal PG facility in Sector 32. Apart from this, the UT Estate office has issued two notices to him for illegally running the PG.

Even though registration of a paying guest accommodation with the UT Estate Office is mandatory, there was no monitoring done to keep a check on illegal PGs and building violations so far.

Apart from this, the civic body does not have any information about the exact number of PGs running in the city and not getting tax from PG owners. Once a house is registered as PG, the power and water charges are levied at commercial rates.

Also, once the UT Estate Office gives permission, the applicant must maintain a rolling register to keep a record of the PGs, their permanent address, photo and identity proofs etc. A copy of the PG’s photo and I-card also needs to be provided to the local police. To avoid the registration, many owners sign a tenant agreement with their paying guests.

As per the rules framed by UT Administration, a PG facility can operate only in a house with an area of at least 7.5 marla. It is mandatory to get it registered and thereon pay commercial rates for water and electricity. PGs are not allowed to run their own kitchen in the accommodation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/admin-launches-crackdown-on-unauthorised-pg-accommodation.html

40,25-2-20,Opposition creates ruckus in Punjab Assembly,"Punjab Vidhan Sabha proceedings were hindered on the second day of the Budget session with the opposition parties — Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) – Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — uniting against the Congress on Monday over the state DGP Dinkar Gupta’s remarks on Kartarpur Sahib corridor and allegations against the Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu forcing three adjournments.

The pandemonium that ensued saw 24 MLAs — 12 each of Akali Dal and AAP — being “named” by the Speaker Rana KP Singh on the grounds of “disrupting the House proceedings”. The Speaker ordered the marshals to march all the “named” MLAs out of the House after they allegedly switched off the speakers from which the Vidhan Sabha’s reporters listen to record the House proceedings.

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who was not in attendance and heads the Home Department, is expected to make a statement over the two two issues.

Right from the beginning of the House proceedings for the day, the opposition legislators raised the two issues demanding dismissal of the state police chief for his “condemnable” remarks on the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, and also expulsion of the state Food and Civil Supplies Minister Ashu after the suspended DSP Balwinder Singh Sekhon made accusations against him.

During their protest, the Speaker could not run the House smoothly, as a result of which the question hour, as well as zero hour were affected while no discussion was held on the calling attention notices moved by three AAP MLAs — Saravjit Kaur Manuke on non-issuance of cards under Bhai Kanahiya Health Scheme and improper implementation of CM Cancer Relief Fund Scheme; Rupinder Kaur Rubi on plying of unfit and unauthorized school vans and buses; and Aman Arora on noise pollution due to loud speakers. However, the Speaker initiated the discussion on the Governor’s address in which the Congress MLAs and AAP’s “under suspension” MLA Kanwar Sandhu participated.

While uniting against the State Government, both the SAD-BJP MLAs and the AAP legislators were seen competing among themselves to be the first one to raise and protest against the issue.

As the question hour began, SAD MLA Bikram Majithia stood up to raise the issue holding placards, along with other SAD and BJP MLAs. With him, AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema too sought to raise the same issues.

When the Speaker asked them to speak after the question hour, AAP and SAD-BJP MLAs storm the well of the House, shouting slogans, holding placards and posters while standing at a distance from one another. In an apparent attempt to outsmart each other, both sides were raising louder slogans.

Despite the Speaker’s repeated requests to take their seats and assurance that the Chief Minister would make the statement on Tuesday, the opposition leaders continue with their protest.

After the Congress MLAs huddled together and planned their next move, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra proposed to hold a debate on the issue by fixing appropriate time.

Bedlam prevailed as soon the Congress MLAs too started raising slogans against the Akalis, leading to adjournment.

As the House resumed, Cheema stressed that the two issues are very sensitive and matter of concern. The Speaker pointed that as the Leader of the House was not present, he would make the statement the next day. Not satisfied, the AAP MLAs entered the well of the House sloganeering.

SAD legislative wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon alleged the government of closing down the much awaited Kartapur corridor by making such statements on the behest of the Gandhi family. Tempers run high as the Congress MLAs opposed the allegations against the Gandhis.

Holding Majithia’s picture with Anwar Masih, former SSB member arrested in Rs 1000 ceore drug haul case. Congress MLAs come face to face with the Akalis MLAs, forcing another adjournment.

As House proceedings resumed again, Cheema dubbed DGP’s statement as condemnable and demanded his dismissal. AAP MLAs against entered the well of the House with the Speaker clarifying that he cannot act against the DGP in the matter. Dhillon too raised the same issue asking on whose directions the DGP made such statement.

AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu insisted on a statement on the DGP issue by a senior minister pointing that it has resulted in lot of resentment.

Opposition MLAs again started their separate protests and sloganeering in the well of the House, even as the Speaker initiated the debate on the Governor’s address amidst a complete mayhem.

Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who made his appearance in the House after a long hiatus, too demanded that someone in the government, like Parliamentary Affairs Minister, should make a statement and “DGP must be removed without further delay”.

As the House proceedings continue, SAD MLA Harinder Pal Chandumajra and AAP’s Rupinder Kaur Rubi pushed the watch and ward staff standing in front of the Speaker’s chair trying to break the defence line.

AAP’s all women MLAs — Rubi, Saravjit Kaur Manuke, and Baljinder Kaur, push the women guards with fellow legislators pushing them from behind to break the human security wall.

Irate, the Speaker ordered the marshals to march all SAD and AAP MLAs out of the assembly after naming them, which means suspending them for the day, and adjourned the House. Speaker’s orders came after the Vidhan Sabha staff reports to the Speaker that the opposition party MLAs had turned off the speakers on their table.

All opposition MLAs take their seats, to avoid eviction from the House. All AAP, SAD-BJP MLAs group together as the Punjab Police officers forcibly try to lift them, raising slogans against the Punjab Police and the Speaker. It was complete chaos in the House as treasury benches too raised slogans against the Akali-BJP MLAs.

As the house resumed, the state Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi requested the Speaker to forgive the MLAs. Seconding him, the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra too urged Speaker to take back his decision and let off the MLAs after a warning. Without giving any assurance, the Speaker adjourned the house till Tuesday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opposition-creates-ruckus-in-punjab-assembly.html

43,25-2-20,Cong threatens to hold protest march to Gairsain on March 3,"The Opposition Congress party has become belligerent on the State Government for convening brief Budget session. Demanding that the session should be of at least 15 days, the party has warned that its workers would hold a protest march to Gairsain on March 3 if the session is not extended.

Addressing the media persons at the state headquarters of the Congress party on Monday, the deputy leader of the Congress legislature party in state assembly, Karan Mahra questioned the short duration of the budget session of Uttarakhand assembly and said that state government is doing formality with a brief session. He said that if the sessions of the assembly are organised as per the norms then the MLAs can put the problems of their areas in the assembly and question government. He alleged that the government is organising brief session as it is shying away from its responsibilities.

Mahra said that he has already requested the Speaker of Uttarakhand assembly Premchand Agarwal and leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh for putting pressure on the government on extension of the budget session.

Former secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), Prakash Joshi said that the budget session is of 15 to 20 day duration even in the small states but in Uttarakhand the upcoming budget session is of only five days. He informed that the workers of the Congress party would meet all 70 MLAs on February 26 and 27 and handover memorandums to them requesting extension of the budget session.

On the strategy of the congress party in the upcoming budget session, Mahra said that the party would take up the issue of irregularities in the examination of forest guards and the hegemony of the district development authorities in the session. Terming Trivendra Singh Rawat government responsible for the irregularity in the forest guard examinations, Mahra claimed that it would not have occurred if the BJP government had taken action against the culprits responsible for similar irregularities in examinations conducted by the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection commission in the past.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-threatens-to-hold-protest-march-to-gairsain-on-march-3.html
44,25-2-20,Swamy files PIL in HC against Devsthanam Act,"Rajya Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has said that the Devsthanam Board enacted by the BJP State Government in Uttarakhand is not only unconstitutional but also a violation of the peoples’ fundamental rights. Swamy said this while addressing the media here on Monday after filing a public interest litigation in the Uttarkahand High Court challenging the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Act. The petition is likely to be taken up for hearing on Tuesday.

Swamy said that during the past few years, similar steps had been taken by the governments of various states but he approached the court and succeeded in getting the temples out of government control.

He said, “When some step is taken against our principles, I have the right even as a BJP member to bring the BJP on the correct path, which is also my duty.”

Responding to a query, he said that in 2014, in his petition, the Supreme Court had clearly stated that the government cannot take control of temples. If there are financial irregularities in the temples, the government can take over the management for a short period to redress the irregularities and then hand over the management back to the committee concerned. Managing temples, mosques and churches is not the task of the government. It should be done by the devotees or their representatives.

In the PIL filed in the Uttarakhand high court, Swamy has contended that the Devsthanam Act brought out by the State government is unconstitutional.

The government taking over control of the Char Dham and 51 other temples is a violation of articles 25 and 26 of the constitution, the PIL states. It will be recalled that passing of the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Bill- 2019 in the winter session of the Vidhan Sabha had elicited strong objection from a large section of the religious fraternity including the Teerth Purohits and others involved in the traditional and religious activities related to the Char Dham and other shrines.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/swamy-files-pil-in-hc-against-devsthanam-act.html
45,25-2-20,Pvt schools discriminate against children: SCPCR,"Rejecting the allegations leveled by the management of some private schools, the chairperson of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) Usha Negi said that various anomalies are continuing in different private schools which are detrimental to the interests of children.

According to Negi, many private schools are not following the guidelines as per the norms of CBSE, the government of India, Supreme Court and High Court. There are number of schools that have not appointed a child psychologist, counsellor, or formed POCSO committee as per the rules of CBSE. Besides, many schools have not given admission to children under Right to Education (RTE) Act and schools which admitted children under RTE are discriminating against them, she said.

“When I was inspecting one private school I noticed that the school administration had mentioned ‘RTE Student’ in the identity cards of the students who were admitted under RTE Act. Subsequently, I issued the letter to the management regarding such discrimination after which such identity cards were withdrawn,” said Negi. Citing another example of discrimination against students in private schools, Negi said that the management of another private school had prohibited RTE students from participating in any kind of school competitions. Besides, the names of such students were also displayed outside their respective classes. SCPCR also intervened in this matter because such incidents that humiliate and label students deeply affect them.

It is pertinent to mention here that recently the Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (PPSA) accused the SCPCR of unnecessary interference in the functioning of private schools. However the Uttarakhand Abhibhavak Sangh (UAS) came out in support of SCPCR stating that child rights commission is working for the welfare of children as well as the parent against the harassment of private schools.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pvt-schools-discriminate-against-children--scpcr.html

However, three days later on February 21, Kashyap addressed a press conference questioning the conduct of the SCPCR while appearing fit which contradicts his medical certificate wherein he declared himself to be too sick to attend the hearing, stated the commission in its letter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scpcr-seeks-inquiry-against-the-school-chairman.html

A delegation of the organisation led by its convenor, Paras Goyal met the DEO and handed over a memorandum to him. Goyal said that the state government should implement a fee regulation act to stop open loot of the private schools.

He said that the private schools should adopt a transparent system of admission and inform people about the number of vacant seats they have in each class.

Goyal said that the private schools are charging development fee and registration fees every year which is creating problems to the parents.

He said that there is a nexus between the private publishers and the schools due to which parents are forced to purchase textbooks at very high rates. The ABVP leader said that on the lines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the system of providing scholarships should start in the schools of ICSE board.

He demanded that the schools governed by the missionaries should also be included under the Right to Education (RTE).

He warned that if the hegemony and open loot of private schools is not controlled then the ABVP would be forced to start a massive agitation.

The delegation also included Himanshu Kumar, Mohan Prasad, Vipin Bhatt and others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/end-hegemony-of-private-schools--abvp.html

49,25-2-20,Cong clueless on tackling Opposition,"Attacked by rivals, the Congress legislators on Monday fought among themselves.

In the absence of the Leader of the House and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, the Congress legislators were seen arguing with each other, blaming one another for not reacting to the Akalis’ sloganeering — exposing total lack of planning and coordination.

Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Congress MLA Kulbir Zira take on their own MLAs, when the House was adjourned for half an hour, for not taking on the SAD-BJP MLAs for sloganeering against the Gandhi family.

As the Speaker Rana KP Singh adjourned the House after the SAD-BJP and AAP MLAs were protesting in the well of the House over the DGP’s remarks and allegations against Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Randhawa lashed out at his fellow MLAs for not even responding and “just sitting” when the Akalis shouted slogans against the Gandhi family.

Zira, the first time MLA, was also seen coming down heavily on party MLAs for not responding when the Akalis were “attacking the Gandhi family”.

Unhappy, former Minister and senior leader Rana Gurjit Singh pointed Zira to mind his words, after which the two entered into an argument. Gidderbaha MLA Amarinder Singh Raja Warring pacified Zira. “They complain that they are not being heard…and now, they are not speaking when they need to,” said irated Zira.

“Sayaaneyaan da matlab eh nahi ke gaalliyaan khaayi jaan (Being mature does not mean that we should not react to abuses),” said Rana Gurjit.

Soon, the Congress leaders, led by Randhawa, Warring, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra, Power Minister Gurpreet Kangar, among others, were seen huddling together to devise the further strategy. Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur was also heard speaking against the flourishing business of the Badal family owned PTC.

He insisted on raising the issue in the House “only today”. As the Higher Education Minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa tried to mollify him by saying that he should speak in the Congress party, Jalalpur said nobody listens. “Congress kehda sundi hai…sab mile hoye ne (Even the Congress does not listen…all are hand-in-glove),” he said.

Resentment among the ruling party is prevailing and has been reflect by several leaders in the recent past.

Congress Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh has also shot off a letter to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh pointing at the non fulfillment of the party’s pre poll promises, besides an attempt to cover-up several corruption cases. In fact, during the Congress Legislative Party, on the first day of the budget session, the legislators minced no words to show mirror to the Chief Minister. The MLAs vented out their frustrations against the Congress Government.

That is not all! Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa has also pinpointed several issues against his own government including cancellation of power purchase agreements with the private players. On PPAs’ issue, Capt Amarinder’s loyalist and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has also demanded action from the Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-clueless-on-tackling-opposition.html
50,25-2-20,CBI probe sought against Haridwar MLA,"Steering committee members of the Gurukul College in Jwalapur have levelled serious allegations at the Haridwar Rural MLA Swami Yatishwaranand.

They have alleged that the MLA has a proclivity towards criminal actions and is unnecessarily trying to frame cabinet minister Madan Kaushik in the Gurukul College issue even though Kaushik has nothing to do with any of the allegations.

Addressing a Press conference here on Monday, the steering committee members also demanded a CBI probe into the actions of Yatishwaranand. This Press conference was held a day after the Haridwar Rural MLA and his supporters held a protest rally demanding removal of Kaushik from the cabinet.

Addressing the media, steering committee office bearer Anil Goyal and his colleagues alleged that Yatishwaranand alias Jaswant has criminal tendencies. “He occupies various lands in Haridwar. He has also occupied the Ved temple where he resides while the whereabouts of the temple manager remain unknown since he went missing under suspicious circumstances. This entire matter should be investigated. In Ghaziwali village, Yatishwarananda has built a resort with funds which also include black money. Yatishwaranand is also guilty of tax evasion and a case under serious sections was also registered against him. All this must be investigated,” said Goyal.

He said that Kaushik has been a member of the college management committee since 1997 but has never interfered. On the other hand, Yatishwarananda was made a member in 2016 and was expelled in 2018 due to his dubious activities. After this, he also went to the High Court but did not get any relief from there.

Now he wants to take possession of the Gurukul College property by creating a controversy around Kaushik. Goyal alleged that Yatishwaranand is misleading members of the Arya Samaj.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cbi-probe-sought-against-haridwar-mla.html
51,25-2-20,MCD awaits Govt nod to begin sanitation works,"More than a year after the number of wards under Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) was increased from 60 to 100, the corporation is not yet able to facilitate even basic sanitation works in the new wards. The MCD officials state that the sanitation works in the new wards will begin after the state government approves the proposal door to door collection of garbage under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and for appointment of more sanitation workers.

Citing the reason of the delay, the Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “We are waiting for the state government’s approval for the door to door garbage collection in PPP mode in the new wards. As soon as the government approves, the sanitation works will be started by MCD in all the 40 new wards.”

About the allegations of the members of Samajik Samrasta Manch (SSM) of insufficient sanitation workers in the city, Pandey said, “MCD has to seek approval from the government for the appointment of new sanitation workers. We have proposed the appointment of 600 sanitation workers to the state government and the work will begin soon after the authorisation.”

The issue of sanitation in new wards was one of the important issues of the councillors of new wards in the last board meeting in which Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ assured the councillors that the sanitation works will be commenced soon in every ward. However, nothing has been initiated by MCD so far for the sanitation works in the new wards is concerned.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-awaits-govt-nod-to-begin-sanitation-works.html

59,25-2-20,"Relaxation, ‘Adequate sleep’ mantra to overcome exam-phobia: Experts","Twelve hours relaxation’ with ‘adequate sleep’ is the success mantra to overcome the exam blues, say teachers and doctors.

As Board exams of Class 10 started on Monday, Punam Sinha a teacher of Goddard Public School appealed students to take the exam with a cool mind. “Answer every question only after reading it well. Also, get plenty of sleep a day before the exam,” she added.

Tension grips students and their parents, especially with mothers each and every year starting with the board examinations. Students who suffer from exam fear or exam anxiety or exam phobia can see their marks suffer as a result of this stress. A balanced diet with adequate sleep is the success mantra to overcome the exam blue, she said.

Giving success clue to the student, Sri Kant a professor of Chas College, urged the students not to take the exams as a burden. “Preparing for exams is basically an exercise in repetition. The more we read, the more we absorb, the more we write, the stronger our memory.”

Reading, writing, and memorising over and over again is the only means to perform better in exams, he said.

“It’s found that starting with the examination pressure arises among students along with their parents, each and every year. First, make a habit to be relaxed during the examination, Professor said. “Most of the students cut down on their sleep and food, and get into a desperate mode of study. These are likely to be dangerous. The human brain functions best when the mind is calm and the body is healthy,” he said.

A well-planned schedule and a steady routine, aided by a peaceful mind, provide the best backdrop for effective preparation for exams, he said. “During the exam time, students need a frame of mind to study well. The effective study calls for absolute concentration. This requires a thorough cleaning up of your mind. Do steer clear of all those unwanted, unhelpful thoughts, which take away your attention while trying to study, advised Deepak Kumar a teacher at St Paul School.

Stress, up to a certain level acts as a motivation to study but undue stress can bog you down. There are cases of students who become too nervous during exams, said Dr Randhir a Bokaro based specialist and Physician.

They cut down on their sleep and food, and get into a desperate mode of study. These are likely to be dangerous. The human brain functions best when the mind is calm and the body is healthy.

“Giving up sleep and food in the run-up to the exam is a recipe for disaster,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/relaxation-----adequate-sleep----mantra-to-overcome---exam-phobia--experts.html

62,25-2-20,"JJM reminds coalition to clear stand on NPR, NRC","Social organization Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) has demanded from the coalition government to clear its stand on issues like National Population Register (NPR) and National Register for Citizenship (NRC) and demanded that the State Government should take immediate action to prevent the “draconian law” get implemented in the State.

Addressing a press meet noted Economist, Jean Dreze said that the silence of the Jharkhand Government on CAA, NRC and NPR is extremely disappointing. The state looks all set to roll out NPR survey from April, 1. “A Government that claims to represent the poor and marginalised cannot remain oblivious to the danger of NPR and NRC for people of the State. We demand that the Government stop all NPR-related activities in the State,” he added.

He said that Mahasabha and other people’s organisations will organise a dharna at Raj Bhavan on March 5 to demand that the State Government immediately rejects NPR.

The Mahasabha also raised issues like setting up of land bank, starvation deaths, lynching, atrocities on Adivasis, Dalits, Muslims and women, State-sponsored communalism, attacks on the freedom of expression and subversion on traditional self-governance systems of Adivasis. The ruling parties, JMM, Congress and RJD raised these issues during the election campaign.

“Under the Raghubar Das-led BJP Government in Jharkhand saw constant attacks on people’s rights and basic tenets of democracy - attempts to amend local tenancy laws, amendment in the Land Acquisition Act. “The ruling parties, JMM, Congress and RJD raised several of these issues in their election campaign. Their manifestos also included many people’s demands,” said Dreze.

Reminding the State Government the noted Economist said, “The people of Jharkhand clearly rejected the BJP and gave a decisive mandate to grand alliance, led by Hemant Soren, on local issues and demands.

However, the Government is yet to act on most of the issues flagged by the parties in their election campaigns and the promises made in their manifestos Comparison attached.”

Quoting the issues like Pathalgadi the social worker said that the decision of the Government to withdraw all Pathalgadi cases, right after taking office, was a welcome announcement. However, even after two months, it is yet to reflect on the ground, he added.

“Gram Sabha and natural resources are other important issues.

The silence of the Government on two key demands that drove the Pathalgadi movement – implementation of fifth schedule provisions and PESA – is also deafening. Both JMM and Congress promised full implementation of PESA in their manifestos,” said Dreze. In addition, Congress promised cancellation of projects such as Adani power plant project (Godda), Icha-Kharkayi dam (West Singhbhum) and Mandal dam (Palamu) but since coming to power, the Government is silent on these issues, he added.

Mob lynching, Hunger and under nutrition are another serious issues on which the Government is not taking any step to curb this menace, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jjm-reminds-coalition-to-clear-stand-on-npr--nrc.html

Inaugurating the event, Odisha Minister for Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Ranedra Pratap Swain complemented NASI and ILS for initiatives taken in the area of tribal development. He observed that science and technology applications are important in areas of agriculture, health and nutrition security as well as for protection and conservation of the rich traditions of the tribal communities.

State Tribal Affairs Minister Jagannath Saraka highlighted various initiatives of the State Government in empowering the tribal communities through formation of district councils in tribals-dominated districts for decentralised decision-making. The efforts have made visible impact in almost all sectors including food production, education, sports, livelihood and health, he said.

NASI President Prof G Padmanaban said the academy’s mandate is to link science and society. Former Secretary, DBT and Chair of the Special Programmes of NASI Dr Manju Sharma said a national program for tribal development using science and technology was implemented in 23 locations in India in partnership with leading institutions, universities and NGOs. Emphasis was given to training and capacity development so that tribal people are encouraged to develop entrepreneurship and additional income sources.

ILS Director Dr Ajay Parida informed that 350 delegates from 15 States and as many as 18 research institutions are participating in the conclave. He hoped the deliberations would lead to identification of best and appropriate technologies and be useful for their up-scaling and replication that would contribute to sustainable development of tribal societies.

Dr Paramjit Khurana and Dr Satya Deo also spoke.

There are 20 stalls installed in the ILS campus showcasing tribal products and food grains from different States.

74,25-2-20,Birla Tyres workers unsure about future,"Members of the Birla Tyres Workers’ Union (BTWU) staged a demonstration in front of the District Labour Office on Monday demanding its intervention to run the unit whose production has been stalled since five months and employees have not received salary for over six months.

Union leader Rajendra Bal said that although it was assured by the management that the unit would begin its operation from February after demerger, the promise has become a distant dream.

“The demerger was completed on November 8 last year. Now it is no longer a unit of the Kesoram group and has on the other hand become a separate entity ‘Birla Tyres Limited’. Earlier, it was promised that as soon as demerger would be completed, the new entity would seek funds from banks to run operations afresh from February. Yet, despite completion of the process, we are hopeless as the plant has not started till date,” said Bal.

“We doubt the demerger process made in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is fishy as neither the authorised liquidator nor the Ministry is aware of the process. More so, we are not optimistic of the company’s future as nothing is clear till date and who would infuse fund to meet a burden of about Rs 3,000 crore. Hence, we desperately seek intervention of the State Labour Department and the Central Government to resolve our crisis,” Bal said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/birla-tyres-workers-unsure-about-future.html

The restrictions have been imposed at the 18 examination centres under eight blocks preventing the parents and outsiders from entering into the campuses.

79,25-2-20,"Marandi on side, BJP to sharpen attack on Govt","The State BJP from Sadak to Sadan (road to Assembly) will try to corner Grand Alliance government lead by Chief Minister Hemant Soren for its alleged failure to meet people’s expectations. With the appointment of Babulal Marandi as BJP legislative party leader, the Saffron party has got a leader who can read the pulse of people raising important issue which can bring discomfort for State Government. As Marandi has the habit of travelling the State BJP expects that he can reach out to people across the State.

Marandi, an affable, suave and soft in nature politician has been a loyalist of RSS. After the appointment as BJP legislative party leader he said, “Though I was out from BJP for past 14 years, I did not join any political party. I will work hard with full caliber to strengthen the party at grass root level.”

Marandi’s acceptability in party can be gauged from the fact that despite conclusion of State Assembly election for two months, the BJP legislative party leader post was vacant for two months at the time when two senior leader such as former speaker and urban development minister CP Singh and former parliamentary affairs minister Neelkanth Singh Munda were present in the House.

The appointment of Marandi as BJP legislative party leader didn’t go good with many leaders as many leaders silently have expressed their displeasure over home coming of Marandi in BJP. On February 17, when JVM merger with BJP was done CP Singh despite having seat in the main dais preferred to sit near media gallery drawing media attention.

As the State Budget session is to commence on February 28, the BJP will take up issue as spurt in naxal activities, Pathalgadi violence, and government’s failure to meet the expectations of people. The opposition BJP is likely to raise the state governments reported move to rollback the 'Mukhya Mantri Krishi Ashirwad Yozana' (MMKAY). The MMKAY was launched by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on August 10 last year. The KAY, a flagship scheme of the previous Raghubar Das government, helped farmers get a maximum of Rs 25,000 - Rs 5,000 per acre with the upper limit being five acres - per annum in addition to Centre's Rs 6,000 per annum under the kisan yojana.

A spurt in Naxalism in State will also be highlighted during the session. BJP national general secretary Arun Singh said, “The BJP will raise the issue of worsening law and order situation in State Capital. In last 56 days, the state has witnessed 20 Naxal incidents.” It is around two months but the state government has failed to implement any out its poll promises and to hide its failure the Soren government is saying that the state exchequer is empty.

Sources said that the after the appointment of Marandi as legislative party leader, the process for appointment of state president will gain momentum. Singh said, “The State BJP will get new president soon also the appointment of district presidents will be carried out.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/marandi-on-side--bjp-to-sharpen-attack-on-govt.html

81,25-2-20,No quota for Bihar residents in Govt jobs: HC,"A larger bench of the Jharkhand High Court on Monday ruled that original residents of Bihar, including the ones living in Jharkhand, were not entitled to reservations in Government jobs in the State. Two of the three judges in the three-member-bench decided against giving reservation benefits to Bihar residents in Jharkhand.

Last year, an appellant originally from Bihar, Ranjit Kumar, had knocked the door of the court seeking reservation for the position of constable in Jharkhand police. Hearing the case, on October 18, 2019, the Jharkhand High Court had said that only original residents of Jharkhand were entitled for reservation in Government jobs in the State.

The appellant had said that he should not be denied reservation only on the basis of the fact that he is originally from Bihar. On this, the bench ruled that no resident of any other State can get reservation benefits in Jharkhand under the State’s policies. Jharkhand, earlier a part of united Bihar, became a separate State on November 15, 2000.

According to a report in an English daily, in March last year, a division bench of then Chief Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Ratnakar Bhengra had referred the matter to a larger bench. It had said that the question remains answered on whether a person born prior to November 15, 2000 in erstwhile Bihar and falling in the reserved category should get reservation in Jharkhand or not. The court also said that the benefits, if any, cannot be decided by one of the two States unilaterally.

The court’s decision on Monday will be applicable on all the people who are originally residents of Bihar, but are staying in Jharkhand.

The appellant, Ranjit Kumar had argued in the court that he has been living in Jharkhand since a long time and therefore he should be eligible for reservation in jobs.

His lawyer also said that Kumar belongs to a backward community as per the eligibility criteria for reservation in erstwhile and divided Bihar.

The court’s decision may also affect a large number of Biharis who have been living in Jharkhand since the days of erstwhile Bihar, sources said. Jharkhand still has a healthy population of Biharis, who were born within Jharkhand’s periphery before it became a separate State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-quota-for-bihar-residents-in-govt-jobs--hc.html

84,25-2-20,‘Let courts decide boundary between faith and rights’,"As part of the birth centenary celebrations of freedom fighter, eminent lawyer and former Union Minister Bibudhendra Misra, a memorial law lecture was held at the Saheed Bhawan here last week. Organised by the High Court Bar Association and the Bibudhendra Misra Memorial Trust, senior Supreme Court advocate Sanjay R Hegde delivered the law lecture on the topic “Faith on the Court and the Constitution”.

Speaking to an audience dominated by lawyers, law teachers and law students, Hegde, who has been appointed by the Supreme Court as a mediator on the Delhi Shaheen Bagh issue, drew attention to the sensitive questions today lying before a nine-judge Bench of the apex court on where exactly do the boundaries of faith intersect with the rights under the Constitution.

Drawing similes between the legends of his home State Karnataka’s dalit religious poet Kanaka Dasa and Odisha’s religious poet Bhakta Salabega, who was born to a Muslim father, he said neither Lord Krishna disappointed Kanaka Dasa nor Lord Jagannath disheartened Bhakta Salabega. “Lords never discriminated, nor should the laws also,” Hegde said describing how Lord Krishna’s idol in Udupi turned 180 degrees to give a darshan to Kanaka Dasa and how Lord Jagannath’s chariot stopped midway to give darshan to Bhakta Salabega.

Stating that the framers of the Constitution who were tasked to frame a liberal Constitution where religious pluralism would coexist, Hegde said the Constitutional provisions with regard to religion go much beyond the State neutrality as the State would always seek to protect the rights of practice, culture and religion of various minorities. “The deliberations of the Constituent Assembly left numerous issues unresolved and these, in turn, were passed onto the courts,” he said.

Taking the audience through the verdicts of Shirur Mutt case of 1954 to the Sabrimal temple case of 2018, Hegde pointed out that the apex court as well as the High Courts have followed various confusing approaches in dealing with matters of religion, religious practices and religious doctrines and with references to faith-based personal laws and essential religious practice tests.

Quoting a dissenting view of a judge in one such matter, he concluded his 50-minute talk saying, “A secular country being driven by religious division, it is time that the deities of the Bhagwan Das Road (judges of the Supreme Court) speak clearly to the country whether we should adhere to the non-religious holy book (the Constitution) or the ancient scriptures should once again prevail and drag us back to the seemingly glorious past.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---let-courts-decide-boundary-between-faith-and-rights---.html

During the tenure of Narasimha Rao Government, Ramalay trust was constituted for construction of Ram temple so what is the need for a separate trust, questioned Singh.

He pointed out that the trust formed recently has none of the acclaimed Shankaracharyas as member. Any of the five Shankaracharyas should have been made the head of the trust, he said.

Singh further alleged that some of the members of the trust are accused of demolishing Babri masjid and are out on bail and inclusion of such persons in the Ram temple trust is not justified, claimed the senior Congress leader.

He pointed fingers at Champat Rai, regional vice president of VHP claiming the parishad has nothing to do with the Sanatana dharma and is a RSS affiliate organisation only.

The former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister also objected to Anil Mishra’s being nominated as trust member saying he is a Homeopathic doctor in Ayodhya and is an RSS functionary. Kameshwar Chaupal and Govind Singh, the Bihar BJP leader and RSS pracharak also found mention in Singh’s objection list.

The veteran leader also objected to nomination of government officers in the trust.

Referring to collection of donation for Ram temple in the past, he questioned why no accounts of these donations are being given as of now and demanded refund of such donated amount to donors with interest of 28 years.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/diggy-writes-to-modi-objecting-to-inclusion-of-babri-mosque-demolition-accused-in-ram-temple-trust.html

128,25-2-20,Man who fired 8 times in air threatening cop held,"Amid the clashes which erupted in northeast Delhi, one particularly spine chilling incident emerged from northeast Delhi's Jaffrabad, where a man brandishing a gun confronted an unarmed Delhi Police personnel, threatening him and forcing him to back away with his hands raised before firing repeatedly in the air.

Police said the 30-year-old man, identified as Shahrukh, has been detained for allegedly firing eight rounds on 66 foota road in northeast Delhi’s Maujpur area.

In a video shot by an eyewitness, the personnel — who was dressed in riot gear — was standing in the middle of a main street as the gun wielding man along with others approached him. The video purportedly shows the police standing tall and seemingly unafraid as the gunman saunters up to him, waving the gun and shouting. The gunman multiple rounds while tear gas shells can be heard exploding in the background.

As the alleged gunman points his gun at him, the police officer slowly retreats, holding his hands away from his body to indicate he is unarmed. The gunman then walks right up to the police personnel and shoves him away before firing in the air once more. As he fired protesters on the other side of the road can be seen scattering in fear. Displaying exemplary courage, the police personnel raised his hands and slowly walked away again, even as other miscreants shouted and threw stones at him. The video is one of several to have emerged from Monday's violence. In other disturbing videos and images, vehicles and buildings were seen burning.

A bunch of bullets with seals of Pakistan Ordnance Factory were found by locals in Kulathupuzha on Saturday and they quickly alerted the local police.

The initial probe by the local police confirmed that the bullets were live and were from Pakistan.

Ballistic experts who rushed to the region found that the bullets were the ones which are used in long range machine guns. “Though the bullets were manufactured in the 1980s, they are still active and could be used even now,” said one of the ballistic experts who examined the bunch of bullets.

A team of officials from the Directorate of Military Intelligence have reached Kollam to join the investigation and find out the routes through which the bullets entered Kerala.

Unconfirmed reports in local media said that three of the bullets found in the bunch had Chinese markings. But officials refused to confirm the news.

Monday morning saw a team of NIA officials sweeping down on some of the areas in Chennai and Salem giving credence to the theory that persons from Tamil Nadu too were involved in the trafficking of bullets. But cops said later in the day that the searches were in connection with the murder of special police inspector Wilson who was killed last month at Kaliyikkavila by alleged Islamic terrorists.

The officials of Kerala Police ruled out the possibilities of the bullets being the same which were missed from the armory of the state police. Kerala had been shaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General’s recent report that a number of guns and bullets were found missing from the armory of the Kerala Police in Thiruvananthaouram.

Investigating agencies are concerned about the location from where the bullets were found. “Kulathupuzha is a known haven of Islamic extremist organizations like Socialist Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Popular Front of India (PFI).

139,25-2-20,2.13 cr framers left out from PM KISAN yojana,"A year since its launch, the Modi Government's ambitious cash-for-farmers programme 'PM KISAN' (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) has reached a saturation level due to some States' reluctance to adopt the Central scheme and implementation hurdles like linking with Aadhaar persisting.

There could be 2.13 crore more potential beneficiaries who are left out from the scheme as States like West Bengal and Bihar have not adopted the scheme.

With the enrolment of 9.74 crore potential beneficiaries, the new registration has reached a saturation level, sources said and pointed out that the scheme intended to cover 14 crore farmers.

As per the Agriculture Ministry's data, of the 68 lakh farmers from the West Bengal, about 10 lakh farmers have already self-registered for the scheme via the online portal of PM-Kisan. Bihar's potential is 158 lakh whereas data of only 59.7 lakh has been uploaded. Bihar has adopted a beneficiary application based approach which is delaying identification and upload.

According to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, barring West Bengal and Bihar, all other States and Union Territories are implementing the scheme which has benefited 8.45 crore farmers so far in the country, against the target of 14 crore farmers.

On PM-Kisan portal, the centre has received data of total 9.74 crore farmers. The minister also launched PM-Kisan mobile App on completion of one year of the implementation of the scheme.

""States which have achieved 90 percent or more saturation have been asked to look at inter district variations while states to do 100 percent verification of 25 randomly selected villages in comparatively low saturation districts,"" he said.

The data says, only 9 farmers registered from Adaman and Nicobar Islands; 123 from Arunachal Pradesh; 121 from Chandigarh; 21 from Dadra Nagar Haveli; 633 from Delhi; 30 from Goa, 4902 from Himachal Pradesh;11 from Sikkim; 43 from Puducherry; 733 from Meghalaya and 1010 from Tripura.

According to sources, Aadhaar-based enrolment and cash transfers, slow internet connections in many rural centres, and messy land records have slowed the programme.

""Problems in Aadhaar authentication, or the process of validating the biometric identity with a beneficiary's bank account, have limited the number of potential payouts,"" sources added.

Aadhaar linking was optional for the first tranche that covered the December 2018-March 2019 period.

For the second instalment covering the period April-July 2019, Aadhaar authentication was compulsory, except for north-eastern States and the erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir. On the first anniversary of launch of the Government's ambitious PM-Kisan scheme, Tomar on Monday launched a mobile app to broaden the reach of the programme that aims to provide annually Rs 6,000 to each eligible farmer.

Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of Rs 6000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of Rs 2000 - one every four months. It was launched on 24 February 2019, when the first instalment was paid.

Stating that the cash benefit under the scheme will not only help farmers but also boost the state economy, Tomar said: ""Our officials have approached the state government in this regard many times. I have also written twice to the chief minister urging to join the scheme.

But no reply has come yet from the CM."" Tomar said some states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim are slow in authenticating their farmers' data and the central government is pursuing with them seriously.

141,25-2-20,"Waqf to build hospital, library besides mosque","The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board on Monday said it will build a mosque as well as an Indo-Islamic research centre, a hospital and a library on the five-acre plot allotted to it following the Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict.

The decision to accept the land was taken at a board meeting here. “It has been decided at a meeting of the board to take the five-acre land given to us by the UP Government,” board chairman Zufar Farooqui told reporters.

He said the board will set up a trust soon for the construction of the mosque.

“Besides the mosque, there will be an Indo-Islamic research centre, a public library, a charitable hospital and other useful facilities on the land”, he said.

“The size of the mosque will be decided keeping in mind local needs,” he said.

In a historic verdict in November on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque within Ayodhya.

In 1992, the 16th century Babri mosque that stood on the disputed site in Ayodhya was demolished by “karsevaks”, claiming that originally there was a Ram temple at the same spot. Soon after last year's verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute, there were suggestions that the Sunni board should not accept the plot.

There were also suggestions that instead of a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid, the Muslim community should build a public facility like a hospital there.

The Sunni Waqf Board, however, made it clear that rejecting the site was not an option.

“Following the Supreme Court verdict, the Sunni Waqf Board does not have the choice of rejecting the five-acre alternative land for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya as it would amount to contempt of court,” Farooqui had said earlier.

Besides Farooqui, there are seven other members on the Sunni Waqf Board. Based on the SC verdict, the Centre had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to allot five acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board.The UP cabinet made the allotment after its meeting of February 5.

The allotment letter is for a plot at Dhannipur village in Ayodhya's Sohawal area, on the Ayodhya-Lucknow highway about 20 km from the district headquarters.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/waqf-to-build-hospital--library-besides-mosque.html

146,25-2-20,Twitterati surprised over Trump not writing Gandhi in visitors’ book,"A lot of eyebrows were raised on Twitter and many people expressed surprise as US President Donald Trump left a message in the visitors' book at Sabarmati Ashram without any mention of Mahatma Gandhi.

In the book, Trump wrote, “To my great friend Prime Minister Naredra Modi, thank you for this wonderful visit.”

Trump, who reached Ahmedabad on Monday for the first leg of his India tour, visited the Ashram along with wife Melania minutes after he landed here. After noticing no mention of Mahatma Gandhi in the message by Trump, netizens took to Twitter, comparing his note with that of former US President Barack Obama.

When Obama visited the Mani Bhavan - where Gandhi used to stay while in Mumbai - in south Mumbai in 2010, his note in the visitors' book read: “I am filled with hope and inspiration as I have the privilege to view this testament to Gandhi's life. He is a hero not just to India but to the world.”

Five years later, in January 2015, after visiting the Raj Ghat in Delhi, Obama wrote, “What Dr Martin Luther King Jr said then remains true today. The spirit of Gandhi is very much alive in India today. And it remains a great gift to the world. May we always live in the spirit of love and peace- among all people and nations.”

Congress leader Manish Tewari posted an image of Trump's remarks in the Ashram visitors' book, saying “This is a snapshot of the note that someone sent. It ostensibly is @realDonaldTrumps note at Sabarmati. No mention of the Great Mahatma. Does he even know who Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was?",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/twitterati-surprised-over-trump-not-writing-gandhi-in---visitors----book.html

164,25-2-20,Turmoil in Malaysia as PM Mahathir resigns,"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned on Monday in a shock move after his political allies sought to bring down the government and block the succession of leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim.

It came after months of rising tensions in the ""Pact of Hope"" coalition, which stormed to a shock victory in 2018 against a corruption-plagued government that had ruled Malaysia for six decades.

But there were calls for Mahathir, the world's oldest leader at 94, to stay in office from allies who insisted he had not backed the formation of a new government and had quit in disgust at the plot.

The political drama began on Sunday when Anwar's rivals from the ruling coalition and opposition politicians held a series of meetings around Kuala Lumpur, stoking speculation a new alliance was taking shape.

That coalition would reportedly have excluded Anwar, Mahathir's presumptive successor and a former opposition icon who was jailed for years on questionable sodomy charges, blocking his ascent to the premiership.

With the fate of the government still uncertain Monday, Mahathir submitted his resignation to the king. The monarch accepted it, but appointed him interim leader until a new premier is found, according to an official statement.

Anwar -- who has famously stormy relationship with Mahathir -- said the premier assured him ""he played no part"" in attempts to form a new government, and was ""very clear that in no way will he ever work with those associated with the past regime"".

The proposed new coalition was reportedly set to include the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) -- the party of disgraced ex-leader Najib Razak, which was ejected from office two years ago.

Anwar and Mahathir put their differences aside and joined forces to take on a corruption-plagued government at the 2018 polls. Mahathir, who previously served as premier from 1981 to 2003, had made a pre-election pledge to hand power to Anwar but has repeatedly refused to fix a date.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/turmoil-in-malaysia-as-pm-mahathir-resigns.html

Three candidates — all members of parliament — are on the ballot paper, with the final result due to be announced on April 4.

Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer is currently the frontrunner, viewed as more moderate than his main rival, Corbyn ally and business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey.

‘The jury of seven men and five women found the producer guilty of criminal sexual acts in the first degree and rape in the third degree, a measure of vindication for the dozens of women who came out against the one-time all-powerful filmmaker.

However, the 67-year-old Oscar-winner who produced films including ""Shakespeare In Love"" was found not guilty of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault charges that could have seen him jailed for life.

168,25-2-20,Passion never fails you,"Actor-director Renuka Shahane’s web series Starting Troubles shatters the myth of focussing only on one aspect of career and asks people to pursue their passion they dreamt of as kids. By Team Viva

Have your childhood dreams turned into a reality today? Do you think you have been able to accomplish most of what you had imagined as a kid? Has your passion of being a football player or a contemporary dancer fulfilled?

Starting Troubles, a medical humour by stand-up comedian, author and doctor Jagdish Chaturvedi, aims to shatter the myth that ‘if we want to be successful, we should focus on only one thing in life’, a mindset that has restricted millions from living their dreams while they continue their jobs. People usually stop acting, dancing or singing and sacrifice their interests they dreamt about as children or even if they pursue their passion, they are judged and called unfocussed and confused.

From Pooja Bhabhi of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun to Dr Kavita Gowda, actor Renuka Shahane shares about her long gap, the digital wave and her latest web series.

Medical dramas are usually serious. We mostly look at it as something about health and serious issues and never through a humouristic point of view...

Yes. This is the most common mindset when there’s anything related to doctors or a medical series. And this is exactly what we wanted to break through our series. Even the script doesn’t have a linear narrative, the story keeps going back and forth, which made it more interesting. It was all fun. The atmosphere on the set was very relaxed, we were mostly laughing on something or the other. And I think that as actors it is important to enjoy your script.

What would you say about your character in the series? How challenging was it to carve yourself into Dr Kavita?

I play a very strict doctor and expect a certain level of professionalism from my interns and resident officers. But as the story moves forward one will see that the doctor is the guiding force of all the students who want to do something different in life.

The challenge in playing this role was to have a command over the medical jargon. When you watch international series like Grey’s Anatomy and others, you will notice that the actors are very fluent with medical terms. But here that’s not the case as we don’t have too many medical dramas. Dr Chaturvedi is a practising surgeon, so he made sure that we got the terms right. After the rehearsals he even said that I sound like his mentor. That genuinely made me happy.

If there is a remake of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, would like to play Pooja again?

I will always cherish this role but I don’t see myself playing Pooja in the remake. However, I would love to see Alia Bhatt playing Madhuri’s character.

The market for bold content on digital space is growing. Will we see you in any such shows?

Yes, there is a growing market for erotic content now but I don’t see myself doing it, though I don’t mind if other actors from the same show are comfortable doing it. It also depends on what the story demands. I am very old-school, a lot of people are comfortable doing it but not me.

Your last directorial Rita released 10 years ago and there have been intervals between your acting projects. People have been wondering about this long gap...

For me, it is very important to balance everything, both home and work. That’s why this gap. I am not the kind of person who can do too many things simultaneously. It’s important for me to be there for my kids. And it’s not something imposed on me or I feel bad about, this is a choice I made when I had kids and I’m happy about it. Now that they are grown ups so I will find more time to do things. Though, it’s very difficult to maintain a balance.

We haven’t seen you playing a comic role before. How was it exploring the genre?

It’s nice to explore that part of you because as an actor you are not offered such roles quite often. I like playing characters which have a little bit of humour in it. Whether it’s What the Folks (2018) or Starting Troubles, you are catering to the youth so it has to be catchy and funny.

How do you find web stories different from theatres?

The biggest difference between theatres and web series is the freedom that the latter offers. It doesn’t confine you and gives the freedom to express as many stories and emotions you want to. There is a lot of scope too. Also, if you decide to make something slightly unconventional, people have to decide whether they want to take the risk or not.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/passion-never-fails-you-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/passion-never-fails-you.html

All Sensex components ended in the red, with Tata Steel cracking 6.39 per cent, followed by ONGC, Maruti, Titan, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Bharti Airtel.

In a worrying sign for the global economy, the deadly coronavirus is fast spreading beyond China. South Korea went on high alert on Sunday following a sharp jump in coronavirus cases, and Italy and Iran took their own drastic containment steps.

Further, the IMF also warned that the deadly epidemic could put an already fragile global economy recovery at risk. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday said the coronavirus epidemic is the country’s “largest public health emergency”. The death toll from the deadly virus climbed to 2,592 in China on Monday.

Seoul stocks ended in deep red after South Korea reported 161 more coronavirus cases on Monday, taking the overall virus cases to 763 and making it the world’s largest total outside China.

170,25-2-20,Overseas investors from Mauritius eligible for FPI registration with enhanced monitoring: Sebi,"Market regulator Sebi on Tuesday said foreign investors from Mauritius will continue to be eligible for FPI registration with increased monitoring as per international norms.

The announcement comes after the tax haven was put on the ""grey list"" of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) -- an inter-governmental policy making body that sets anti-money laundering standards.

A significant percentage of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) investing in the Indian market is registered in Mauritius.

The island nation is the second largest source after the United States from which foreign portfolio investments come into the country.

As per January NSDL data, assets under custody of US FPIs are worth Rs 11,62,579 crore and those from Mauritius stood at Rs 4,36,745 crore.

Following the FATF notice, some fund managers knocked on Sebi's door overnight, raising concerns over validity of FPI registration done through the tax haven.

The regulator on Tuesday said, ""Foreign investors from Mauritius will continue to be eligible for FPI registration with increased monitoring as per FATF norms"".

For several years, there have been apprehensions about Mauritius being a money laundering route for FPIs due to its limited regulatory oversight. But, the Indian Ocean island nation has been taking several steps in recent years to address the concerns.

Jurisdictions under the ""grey list"" face increased monitoring. They work closely with FATF to address strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.

Currently, there are 18 jurisdictions identified as having ""strategic deficiencies"", including Mauritius and Pakistan, as per the FATF.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex was trading 43.29 points higher at 40,406.52, and the broader NSE Nifty was up 10.10 points at 11,839.50.

Trump, who is on a 36-hour visit to India commented on the ongoing Democratic Party nomination race and said, ""It could go to the convention, it really could.""

""They are going to take it away from Crazy Bernie, they are not going to let him win...I actually think he would be tougher than most of the other candidates because he is like me but I have a much bigger base,"" Trump told reporters as he flew on Air Force One from Ahmedabad to Agra, according to CNN.

Trump's comments on the American political scene came a day after Sanders, 78, comfortably won the crucial Nevada Democratic Caucus, giving a big boost to his campaign for the 2020 White House bid.

Earlier in the day, 73-year-old Trump, a Republican, tweeted that he has secured a record 95 per cent approval rating in the Republican Party.

The Wuhan local administration earlier announced that people who are not quarantined and seeking special treatment or stranded in the city can leave in batches. The city of 11 million people was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

China locked down Wuhan city on January 23, followed by the entire Hubei province with over 50 million people. Wuhan is the provincial capital of Hubei. Over 18 cities in the province have been sealed.

176,25-2-20,Where’s the audience?,"Armani holds runway show in an empty theatre due to virus

In a last-minute change, Giorgio Armani is holding his Milan Fashion Week runway show behind closed doors due to concerns raised by the coronavirus and instead stream the event from inside the empty showroom.

The fashion house said “the decision was taken to safeguard the well-being of all his invited guests by not having them attend crowded spaces.”

A dozen towns in northern Italy have gone on effective lockdown after the deaths of two people infected with the new virus from China. Milan is the capital of Italy’s Lombardy region, which reported 54 confirmed cases. It’s mayor recently shuttered public offices. But runway shows continued apace for their fourth day, with most of the fashion crowd taking an analytical attitude to the rapidly spiking infections. “For the moment the situation is under control,” said the president of the Italian National Fashion Chamber, Carlo Capasa. He added it was up to government officials or fashion houses themselves to decide if additional measures were needed.

Armani was forced to show behind closed doors one other time, in Paris in 1998, when officials said there were insufficient safety exits inside a huge tent being used as the venue to allow the public to attend. Only his team and one video camera was present, and a video of the show was later distributed to fashion editors. Armani later showed the entire collection in New York in protest, claiming that fashion world politics and not just safety concerns had led to the officials’ call.

On Saturday, Mido, eyewear industry fair, announced that it would postpone the gathering scheduled for February 29 to March 2 until June due to concerns over the virus. “The evolution of this health crisis under way in our country does not leave any doubt over our decision,” MIDO president Giovanni Vitaloni said in a statement.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/where---s-the-audience--2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/where---s-the-audience-.html

179,25-2-20,Flushed at ‘The Basin’,"Southee takes fifer to sweep India’s tail as Kiwis reach century of Tests win with 10 wicket triumph

Indian batsmen’s inadequacies in adverse conditions were laid bare as they crashed to an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat against a ruthless New Zealand side that wrapped up the opening Test in just over three days here at Basin Reserve on Monday.

Starting the day on 144 for four, India were all out for 191 in 81 overs in their second innings. This was a shade better than their dismal 165 in the first innings, which eventually proved to be decisive.

Trent Boult (4/39 in 22 overs) and Tim Southee (5/61 in 21 overs), one of the finest but most under-rated new ball pairs in world cricket, showed that when it boils down to playing incisive seam and swing bowling, this batting line-up is still a work in progress.

The required target of nine runs was knocked off by New Zealand without much ado for their 100th Test win.

India’s last defeat was against Australia at Perth during the 2018-19 series but the loss at the Basin Reserve would hurt them more because the visitors have not surrendered in such fashion of late.

There was no resistance from a star-studded line-up and more than intent, the failure was due to poor technique on a track that had something on the third and fourth day.

This is a team that plays fast bowling much better than their predecessors, the reason for their success on the bouncy Australian tracks.

But when it comes to facing conventional seam and swing bowling in testing conditions, they are yet to learn the art of saving a Test match.

India had lost the mental battle on the first day itself when they saw the moisture on the wicket.

The toss became a factor and not for one session did they look comfortable. Mayank Agarwal was the only batsman who felt at home, albeit in patches, as New Zealand showed what a Test match strategy is all about.

If the first innings was about mixing back of length deliveries with fuller length balls, the second saw the pacers coming from round the wicket and targeting the rib-cage. The line was disconcerting and it stifled them for good. It affected their mindset and when Ajinkya Rahane and Hanuma Vihari stepped out on the fourth morning, defeat was written all over as both looked ill-equipped to handle such high quality seam bowling.

Rahane (29 off 75 balls) and Vihari (15 off 79 balls) are players who only play long-form cricket at the international level and both are known for their patience.

But little did the Indian vice-captain apprehend that he would get a delivery from Boult, which, instead of moving away after pitching, held its line. With the ball doing exactly the opposite of what Rahane had thought, he had no option but to jab at it, and all he got was an edge.

Southee, who bowls lovely classical outswinger then bowled an off-cutter from the other end and before Vihari could comprehend, it came back sharply to peg the stumps back.

Within first 20 minutes, the two seasoned practitioners of swing had knocked the stuffing out of India’s resistance.

“A really brilliant all round game for us. It is also a step in the right direction as well,” Kane Williamson said.

Southee, who had a terrific match, deservingly completed his 10th five-wicket haul, and all it took was 16 overs to end the India innings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/flushed-at----the-basin---.html
180,25-2-20,One defeat can’t define team’s character: Kohli,"Captain Virat Kohli had no qualms in admitting that India were outplayed by New Zealand in the opening Test but said they “can’t help it” if a few want to make a “big deal” out of one loss.

“We know we haven’t played well, but if people want to make a big deal out of it, make a mountain out of it, we can’t help it as we don’t think like that,” the India skipper said at the post-match interaction.

“Some people might want it to be the end of the world but it’s not. For us, it’s a game of cricket we lost and we move on and keep our heads high,” Kohli said.

It is the acceptance of defeat that defines the character of a side, the world’s premier batsman said.

“We understand that we need to play well to win, also at home. There’s no cakewalk at international level as teams will come and beat you. You accept it and that defines our character as a side.”

If he had given credence to the “outside chatter”, he said the team wouldn’t have been where it is now.

“That’s why we have been able to play this kind of cricket. If we would have paid attention to the outside chatter, we would again be at No 7 or 8 in the rankings. We don’t really bother about what people are saying on the outside.”

One defeat can’t make a team, which has been winning games of Test cricket, “bad overnight”. “If we have lost then we have no shame in accepting that. It means we didn’t play this game well. It doesn’t mean that we have become a bad team overnight.

181,25-2-20,Bouncing back isn’t a term we use: Williamson,"The perfect execution of plans against India has pleased New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson but he refused to term his team’s 10-wicket win as “bouncing back” from their 0-3 debacle against Australia.

New Zealand came into the series after their nightmare in Australia and put up a splendid performance to outclass India in just over three days.

“Bouncing back isn’t a term that we use within our group. You can get carried away thinking about results (especially) when you have a number of poor ones and sometimes the want (urge) for a good one can be a distraction towards getting (achieving) it,” Williamson said.

The Kiwi skipper, who also was the top-scorer for his side with a well-made 89, seemed satisfied with the performances of each and every player of his team.

“So it’s about focussing on things that are important. The roles that give us the best chance of success and if we do that, the result manifests and I think that’s what we saw in this game and that was what was pleasing,” Williamson said.

“It was a really brilliant all-round game for us. Guys were really committed to their roles on a surface that offered enough to create a good balance between bat and ball. It’s a really important lesson moving forward to Christchurch,” he added.

But Williamson also wants to guard his team against complacency as he expects India to come hard in the second Test, starting February 29

183,25-2-20,200 & counting,"Cavani becomes first player to complete double century of goals for PSG

Edinson Cavani scored his 200th Paris Saint-Germain goal and Marquinhos netted twice as the Ligue 1 leaders bounced back from their Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund to beat Bordeaux 4-3 on Sunday, but their victory was marred by Neymar’s late sending-off.

After losing 2-1 in Germany in their Champions League last 16 first leg in midweek, PSG’s defensive weaknesses were again exposed as South Korean international Hwang Ui-jo gave Bordeaux the lead at the Parc des Princes.

PSG turned it around thanks to goals by Cavani and Kylian Mbappe either side of a Marquinhos brace, but at the other end there was a bizarre goal credited to the Brazilian defender Pablo and a Ruben Pardo strike had the home side hanging on at the finish.

The evening concluded with Neymar being sent off in stoppage time for a second yellow card for grappling with Bordeaux’s Yacine Adli, leaving the world’s most expensive player facing a suspension.

Along with the shortcomings at the back, it is another problem for coach Thomas Tuchel to think about, even if his team are now 13 points clear atop Ligue 1 from Marseille, who lost 3-1 to Nantes on Saturday.

Tuchel’s men endured a bad start against mid-table Bordeaux, with skipper Thiago Silva going off hurt just before Hwang put the away side in front on 18 minutes, heading in a corner for his sixth Ligue 1 goal.

PSG were level in the 25th minute, though, as Di Maria’s cross was headed in by Cavani, allowing the Uruguayan to reach a double century of PSG goals.

He then hit the post from close range before Marquinhos put Paris in front in first-half stoppage time, using his shoulder to covert Di Maria’s free-kick.

Nevertheless, there was still time for Bordeaux to equalise at 2-2 before the interval.

Selected ahead of Keylor Navas in goal, Sergio Rico’s clearance from a Marco Verratti back-pass struck Pablo and the Spaniard looked on in horror as the ball ricocheted back into the net.

However, Marquinhos netted from close range for his second of the night in the 63rd minute to make it 3-2. Then, when Ruben Pardo lost possession, Cavani set up Mbappe to score PSG’s fourth, and his 16th in the league this season.

Pardo made some amends with a stunning strike for Bordeaux’s third, and the ninth goal Paris have conceded in three games altogether.

Icardi then had another goal disallowed before Neymar was sent off for his second yellow at the death.

“They have had quite a difficult week in terms of results and their confidence has taken a knock too,” said Bordeaux’s Laurent Koscielny of PSG.

“When you lose points and games then your confidence can quickly disappear but they are great players and they are capable of overcoming that.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/200---counting.html
184,25-2-20,Trend Blazer,"Deepika receives flak over ’83 tweet

Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone faced a backlash over her tweet on the role of Romi Dev in the forthcoming film ’83.

The actor posted her look as Romi on February 19. It was the tweet that accompanied the post that didn't go down well with social media users.

“To be able to play a small part in a film that captures one of the most iconic moments in sporting history has been an absolute honour. I’ve seen very closely the role a wife plays in the success of her husband's professional and personal aspirations in my mother and 83 for me in many ways is an ode to every woman who puts her husband's dream before her own,” she captioned the image.

‘Some stories really encompass life. The story of two youngsters falling in love in Chhaju Ke Dahi Bhalle, the dark reality of a married couple in Sleeping Partner or Pinni or Thappad really show some real moments of life. While Thappad is a story of children, Pinni is the story of an elderly lady. That is the power of a short story.’

Actor Hrithik Roshan came in support of an individual who was asked to not to give a presentation in class due to stuttering issue. The actor said that stuttering should never hold him back from dreaming big.

A social media user wrote: “My cousin was giving a presentation in his class when the HOD/lecturer told him ‘if u cannot speak properly you shouldn’t study.’ He hasn't come out of his room since this incident.”

185,25-2-20,A literary escape,"Bestselling young adult authors are aiming at older readers

After gaining millions of young readers for her Divergent fantasy series, Veronica Roth decided she and her characters were ready for the next phase — a novel for adults.

“I grew up on stories like Dune, Harry Potter, and Ender’s Game about people who shoulder burdens when they’re too young to bear them,” says Roth, who tells the story of Sloane Andrews and her fellow fighters against the havoc of the Dark One in Chosen Ones, scheduled for April. “So the question of what comes after those stories just kept nagging me. Chosen Ones is about that after — about a group of 30-somethings who saved the world when they were younger, and they’re still dealing with the repercussions of it.”

Roth, Tochi Onyebuchi and Sarah J Maas are among several writers popular with young people who have books out this year intended for older readers. Some have never written for adults, while others move freely among teens and older readers. All are navigating one of the more complicated paths in publishing — how to consciously appeal to different audience for different books, from the use or absence of profanity to the choice of subject matter and how to present it. The history is mixed: Judy Blume and Neil Gaiman are among those who have succeeded well, while others, including Daniel Handler and Stephanie Meyer, never fully caught on with adults.

Roth’s first Divergent book came out in 2011, and she reasons that enough of her original readers have reached an age that they’ll be open to a mature approach. She considers her new work a “pretty natural” moment in her career, when you “get curious about other genres, other types of writing,”

Onyebuchi had published Beasts Made of Night and Crown of Thunder before completing his first book for adults, Riot Baby. It is set in part around the 1992 Los Angeles riots following the acquittal of policemen who beat Rodney King. Riot Baby is a dystopian fantasy about Kev, who has been jailed in Rikers Island, and his sister Ella, who holds the power and the horror of seeing the future.

A graduate of Yale University and Columbia Law School, among other schools, Onyebuchi has worked in private and government law and thought a long time about a book that could draw upon his education and background. He considers adult books his first passion but he found that writing for young people strengthened his storytelling, forcing him to write clearly and not “to obfuscate.” For Riot Baby, he was able to expand upon that discipline. “I could be straightforward and short and concise, and I could have a lyrical style that abounded in subjunctive clauses,” he said. “I didn’t just have to be Hemingway. I didn’t just have to be Faulkner. I could be both.”

Maas, whose bestsellers for young people include the Throne of Glass fantasy series, has her debut adult book out in March. Her Crescent City series begins with House of Earth and Blood, in which protagonist Bryce Quinlan — with the help of a fallen angel — seeks to track down the killers of her closest friends.

Maas said that the new series had been a secret “passion project” for years, an idea came to her when she was on a plane during a book tour, listening to the soundtrack from Gravity. The epic scene that came to her became the ending of House of Earth and Blood. Bryce’s age compelled Maas to think about a different readership.

“The moment Bryce Quinlan walked into my head, I knew she was in her early to mid-20s — an age that placed her story firmly in the adult range,” says Maas, adding that the main difference between writing for younger and older people is in the language. “I will admit that I can now get away with quite a bit more swearing!”

VE Schwab, who writes adult and young adult novels, says she doesn’t change her style or vocabulary: The difference is in her mindset. For her Monsters of Verity duology, she inhabits her 17-year-old self, a pretty angry teenager. For The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, an adult story coming in October about a woman who endures and is forgotten for centuries, she is closer to the person she is now.

“One of the primary themes in the book is this concept of 30 as a threshold for true adulthood, the feeling like you look down for a moment, and when you look back up, everyone else has raced ahead, and you’re still trying to get your bearings,” she said. “I wrote it essentially for a version of myself who never found writing. If I hadn’t become an author, these are the questions I’d be facing, this is how lost I would feel.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-literary-escape-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-literary-escape.html
186,25-2-20,The Rhythm of Renaissance,"Through a tableau of Biblical imagery, Mumbai-based artist Milburn Cherian’s series of artworks, Living Between the Times, reminds one of a Shakespearean tragedy and his other plays. By Team Viva

Intricacy in an artwork certainly grabs a lot of eyeballs. Not only does it make one wonder about how it has been created, it also inspires the viewer to find a number of meanings layered within them. You will feel it while taking a walk around the solo exhibition, Living Between the Times, by Mumbai-based artist Milburn Cherian at the Visual Arts Gallery.

The collection of artworks is a suite of captivating images that seem to bridge many gaps through the gospel and speak to us about the unity of man and his many ways. “In an otherwise photographically real world, painting to me is an expression of my way of seeing things. It comes naturally to me,” says she.

Cherian had no formal training in painting. She had to depend on her comprehensive communication course from the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, to learn the basics of art and aesthetics. She shied away from making a livelihood as a graphic artist after NID but knew that graphic designing taught you to “simplify things” and translate ideas easily. She says, “My thinking ran contrary to this, I realised later. I like doing just the opposite. I like detailing.” However, before the course, she had studied textile history and design, about which she says, “It was my launching pad into the world of art.”

It was then that her sister had gifted her a book on the works of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, an innovative Flemish Renaissance painter and printmaker, who is known for his sweeping landscapes and peasant scenes. She studied the books on Brueghel and then bought more books and researched the works at length. “I analysed how he created his characters and combined the Carnival and the season of Lent in one art piece. I then looked at the Proverbs in the Bible and began painting. A lot of my learnings came from reading books and going through reproductions of several famous painters,” she says.

Through rich and amusing narratives, Cherian reinvents Brueghel’s works in a way that it makes one reminiscent of a Shakespearean tragedy and his other plays. Through images of Biblical relevance — Christ’s Crucifixion and Proverbs — and rustic idylls, the images are far from beautiful but they reflect exquisite craftsmanship, which impel us to change how we experience the perspectives we share in art. Cherian, as an artist, connects not only with the humble human culture of the past but also recognises the culture of the poor and the underprivileged.

There is a certain sadistic element in most of her works, says art critics. Floating twisted torsos, with their hearts torn apart, dominate the canvas. She paints ghost-like creatures floating through air as if they were floating on water. Though various expressive faces, minute work on the dresses of her myriad figures, designs on the floor tiles, scene-depictions of a host of peasants and cultural symbols, her works boast of her love for detailing. Even though the paintings are filled with drama and the peasant characters tumble out of the past, art connoisseurs say that it’s her patience and precision that give the artpieces the rhythm of the Renaissance era.

She says that Salvador Dali, also known as the ‘Master of Surrealism’; Heironymous Bosch and the German Romantic, Caspar David Fredrich have greatly influenced her style. Cherian also takes inspiration from nature. However, she says, “On canvas, you’ll find only certain interpretations of that.” She has earlier played around with softer colours and pastels, too. But here, she has switched to earthy colours and even chrome browns and mauves to create a rich prism of shades.

Her works teem with more than 200 people, all nestled close to each other. The average size is around 14x12 inches, while some, for instance, Tsunami, Sienna Earth and The Healing, spread out to 61 inches. Cherian has also donated some of her paintings to charity and to organisations like the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, Cancer Patients Society, Khushii, SOS Villages in India and Save the Children Foundation.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-rhythm-of-renaissance-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-rhythm-of-renaissance.html
187,25-2-20,Message for the heart,"Artist Tyeb Mehta’s Shantiniketan series sets off a conversation about how humans represent nothingness, too. By Uma Nair

The permanent collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) has been brought down to the basement to give art lovers a glimpse of its archival importance, power and beauty,” says DG Adwaita Charan Gadanayak as he walks towards the magnificent triptych of Tyeb Mehta, the Shantiniketan series created as far back as 1985-1986.

Ramchandra Gandhi’s Svaraj

One cannot forget Ramchandra Gandhi’s Svaraj (2002). This grandson of Mahatma Gandhi had used artist Tyeb Mehta’s Shantiniketan Triptych as the focal point of the book. Philosopher and teacher of comparative religion at Vishwa Bharati, Ramchandra examined Mehta’s imagery of the rickshaw-puller, the falling man and the trussed bull by linking them with the Shantiniketan Triptych in terms of philosophy and sensibility.

He showed that this work is a three-panelled portrait of distortion and self-awareness necessitated by exclusivist self-identities — individual and collective, secular and religious, and the recovery of integrity of selfhood in inclusive self-realisation. He created a conversation about the realisation that we are things yet we represent nothingness, too.

Kala Bhavan Shantiniketan

Mehta painted the 170x445 cm painting in 1985-86, when he was an artist-in-residence at Kala Bhavana, Vishwa Bharati University. The painting represents Charak Puja, an end-of-spring ritual observed by the Santhal tribe and other marginalised communities of West Bengal. The first left is a panel showcasing a group of drummers and dancers. There’s a floating figure on the top-right corner of the painting. The central panel showcases a sacrificial site near the vertical charak pole with a seated woman and goat in close, protective embrace. There’s also the ritual sacrificer’s shadow looming over the scene. The third-right panel has a group of people pulling a rope and the audience watching the ritual. Here also, there is a figure floating at the top.

Although there are three separate panels, Mehta’s brilliance can be seen through the treatment of figures. The arms of women figures seem to be in wanton abandon but also transcend the superficial divisions of the canvas and reach out to each other. The throbbing vibration of stark colours mirrors the momentum of the drummers and dancers. In the tableaux, Mehta gives us a synergy of togetherness as if they share an unseen bond. The painting is a testament not only to the core values of an artist’s philosophy but shows how these values can be carried forward by new thoughts of blending tradition and modernity.

Santhals and Charak

In 2005, Mehta had explained in an interview his epiphany that occurred at Shantiniketan with the Spring Festival of the Santhals at Charak. “There was a Santhal woman whom I found very captivating,” reminisced Mehta. He added, “This lady in a make-believe temple stood almost naked. She poured some water near the tree trunk. I was so struck by her presence that it still remains with me. It was stunning. I came back and painted two women on a rickshaw and my work, Shantiniketan slowly happened. It was her role in the drama, something implicit in her image, which could not be explained but got etched in my memory. You see with myths one should not be in a hurry, they should settle onto the memory so that you can stop and dwell on them at length. You have to reflect without losing touch either with their image or with their intent.”

He stood apart for his interpretation — the ambiguous dichotomies between the masculine and feminine, the divine and mortal, and the human and the bestial — while also conveying a larger theme of consummation and destruction.

You draw your eyes towards the tender embrace between the mother figure and the graceful goat and the symbolism of the yogic pose by the disembodied head in the foreground of the central panel. At once, you think of the paradoxes of life and death and the culmination of the experience. Mehta transcends time in the mix of imagery and the suggestion of the beautiful goat which will be sacrificed.

Rooted in space and time

Shantiniketan stands apart and alone. It is rooted in space and time and as the great Roshan Shahani said, “They resemble the ‘peasant-cultivator-labourer’ — a prototype that has been placed in deadpan stances of beaten down melancholia.” Mehta draws attention towards the emblematic significance of his characters.

The power of this painting is poignancy and power — said and unsaid. In the emotive associations and evocations, we see the fragility of life, the uplifting aura of dance and the rhythm of the drummers. In the sinuousness of the dancing figures, we also observe struggles, despair and despondence. We must look at the feet of these figures, which are charged with a hypnotic rhythm.

Mehta captures the caprices of human behaviour. The dancing goat is a symbol of wound as well as sacrifice. Time has been stolen from the register of its destiny. The artist brings us back to the debate about how history feeds the memory.

The collection at the gallery makes you pay reverence to India’s greatest modern master, Tyeb Mehta, and recall the words of his close friend KG Subramanyan who said, “They snare you into a search. Those unindividual faces that seem benign or sad, those heave limbs that oscillate in mute gesture, those body postures that combine both elegance and awkwardness — they hold you captive of their teasing configurations. Clear, brilliant, tantalisingly visual, almost like blown up cameos in the centre of their impact, they carry a message for the heart.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/message-for-the-heart-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/message-for-the-heart.html
188,25-2-20,The Dutch master’s truth,"Museum’s Rembrandt knockoff turns out to be the real thing

Thanks to modern technology and some expert detective work, a nearly 400-year-old painting that had long been attributed to an unknown artist in Rembrandt’s workshop has now been judged to have been a work of the Dutch master himself.

For decades, the Allentown Art Museum displayed an oil-on-oak panel painting called Portrait of a Young Woman and credited it to the Studio of Rembrandt. Two years ago, the painting was sent to New York University for conservation and cleaning.

There, conservators began removing layers of overpainting and dark, thick varnish that had been added over centuries — and they began to suspect Rembrandt himself was responsible for the original, delicate brushwork underneath.

“Our painting had numerous layers of varnish and that really obscured what you could see of the original brushwork, as well as the original colour,” said Elaine Mehalakes, vice president of curatorial affairs at the Allentown Art Museum.

Conservators used a variety of tools, including X-Ray, infrared and electron microscopy, to bolster the case that it was the work of one of the most important and revered artists in history.

The scientific analysis “showed brushwork and a liveliness to that brushwork, which is quite consistent with other works by Rembrandt,” said Shan Kuang, a conservator at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts who restored Portrait of a Young Woman.

Outside experts who examined the 1632 painting after the completion of its two-year restoration concurred with the NYU assessment that it’s an authentic Rembrandt.

“We’re very thrilled and excited,” Mehalakes said. “The painting has this incredible glow to it now that it just didn’t have before. You can really connect with the portrait in the way I think the artist meant you to,” he added.

When Portrait of a Young Woman was bequeathed to the museum in 1961, it was considered to be a Rembrandt. About a decade later, a group of experts determined that it had been painted by one of his assistants. Such changes in attribution are not unusual — over the centuries, as many as 688 and as few as 265 paintings have been credited to the artist, according to Mehalakes.

The museum has not had the painting appraised — and has no intention of selling it — but authenticated works by Rembrandt have fetched tens of millions of dollars.

The painting, currently in the museum’s vault, will go on display from June 7.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-dutch-master---s-truth-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-dutch-master---s-truth.html

190,25-2-20,Spin the wheel,"Shafali, Poonam, shine bright in India's 18-run win against Bangladesh

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav delivered yet again with timely dismissals to lead India to a comfortable 18-run win over Bangladesh in their ICC Women’s T20 World Cup match, here on Monday.

Invited to bat, a substantial partnership eluded them after a fiery start but India still managed to post a competitive 142 for six at the WACA ground.

India were off to a flying start with opener Shafali Verma (39 of 17 balls) coming out all guns blazing in the Group A game.

However, the Indian innings never got the impetuous after the departure of the 16-year-old, who hit four sixes and two fours in her entertaining knock. Later, Veda Krishnamurthy (20 off 11) hit few lusty blows to help India post a fighting total.

Bangladesh fought through Murshida Khatun (30) and Nigar Sultana (35) but Poonam rattled the middle and lower order with her strikes.

In the end, Bangladesh could manage 124 for eight, giving India their second straight win in the tournament.

“The way Shafali and Richa played today, they showed how capable they are for the team. Veda’s innings was turning point. We needed boundaries at that point and she did a great job,” India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur said.

Poonam, who had helped India halt Australia’s chase in their opening game as well, was the top bowler again. She scalped Sanjida Islam (10), Fahima Khatun (17) and Jahanara Alam (10) to make it tough for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh needed 49 runs from last five overs but they failed to negotiate Poonam’s flighted deliveries.

The Indian spinner had Fahima caught by Shafali in the first ball of the 16th over while Rajeshwari Gaekwad saw the back of well-set Nigar Sultana.

Poonam then returned to dismiss Jahanara, who stepped out looking for a big hit only to be stumped by Taniya.

The runs dried up and Bangladesh now needed 22 off the final over.

Pacer Shikha Pandey clean bowled Rumana Ahmed with a perfect yorker and writing was clear on the wall.

Earlier, Shafali punished the rival attack with her fluent stroke-making.

Attempting a big one, Shafali skied one off veteran Panna Ghosh and was dismissed, caught by wicket-keeper Shamima Sultana.

This was after fellow opener Taniya Bhatia (2) was sent back by Salma Khathun.

Shafali turned out to be the best scorer in India’s innings.

Jemimah Rodrigues played a sedate yet crucial 34-run knock since hard-hitting skipper Harmanpreet Kaur was already dismissed by Ghosh.

With both Shafali and Harmanpreet cooling their heels back in the dug out, India’s run-rate took a dip.

Jemimah erred in judgement while calling Deepti for a single and was run out.

Richa Ghosh, who replaced Smriti Mandhana in the playing XI, hit two splendid boundaries before holing out to Nahida Akter off Salma Khatun.

The slide continued with Deepti Sharma (11) running herself out following a mix up with Veda Krishnamurthy (20 off 11).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spin-the-wheel.html

Kieran Trippier was also back after recovering from a groin injury and he was involved in Atletico’s second goal as Koke headed in.

Angel Correa had earlier cancelled out Paco Alcacer’s strike for Villarreal.

Atletico’s inconsistency this season means they are out of the title race, 12 points adrift of leaders Barcelona, who thrashed Eibar 5-0 on Saturday.

199,25-2-20,"India to host Commonwealth shooting, archery events","India will host the Commonwealth shooting and archery championships in January 2022 and the medals from the two events will be counted in the final tally of the Birmingham Games, an unprecedented move approved by the CGF.

However, the medals will be added one week after the conclusion of the multi-disciplinary sporting event in Birmingham, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Monday.

The decision was made at the CGF’s Executive Board meeting here from February 21 to 23.

It can be considered a big win for India since it had threatened to boycott the Birmingham edition of the Games for dropping shooting, an optional sport, from the roster. Archery is also another optional sport.

“A Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships is set to take place in India in 2022 after a proposal to stage the event was approved by the CGF Executive Board,” the CGF said in a release.

The two events will be held in Chandigarh in January 2022 while the Birmingham Commonwealth Games are scheduled from July 27 to August 7, 2022.

“The decision confirmed that Chandigarh 2022 and Birmingham 2022 will be two separately organised and funded Commonwealth Sport events. “One week following the Closing Ceremony of Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, the CGF shall issue a medal table that includes results from the Chandigarh 2022 Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships, as a further and final legitimate ranking of competing nations and territories from the respective competitions,” the CGF added.

Rarely the sporting world has seen such an arrangement that the medals of championships held outside major Games are counted in the final tally (of the main event).

National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) President Raninder Singh, who mooted the idea of the Commonwealth Shooting Championships, admitted that CGF’s decision was a “unique and unprecedented development” as well as “truly a game changing methodology”.

He was also candid in calling NRAI and IOA’s proposal as “admittedly against the grain”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-to-host-commonwealth-shooting--archery-events.html
200,25-2-20,Messi ‘greatest’ ahead of Maradona: Gattuso,"Lionel Messi is the “greatest” footballer of all time, ahead of even Diego Maradona, Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso said on Monday ahead of his side’s Champions League clash with Barcelona.

The 32-year-old Messi scored four goals at the weekend in Barcelona’s 5-0 win over Eibar and has now been involved in more than 1,000 goals in his career, scoring 696 and assisting another 306.

Gattuso was quick to praise Messi, comparing the Barca star to Napoli legend Maradona.

“He’s the greatest and an example for everyone,” said Gattuso ahead of the sides’ last-16 first leg today.

“He never says anything inappropriate. He does things that only exist on the Playstation, unthinkable things.

“But I saw him (Maradona) on VHS, or DVD. I never saw him up close, at a stadium.

“I know the champion he was and I know I missed something wonderful. I regret it. Today I see Messi doing things that Maradona was doing.”

Napoli captain Lorenzo Insigne was not so keen to accept that Messi has reached greater heights than 1986 World Cup winner Maradona.

“Messi is the best in the world today,” said Insigne. “But for us Neapolitans, Maradona is everything and I don’t want to compare them. Maradona is sacred.”

But Insigne and Gattuso agreed that their team have to be careful not to focus only on trying to stop Messi.

“We have to be careful with their whole team, because it's not just Messi,” said Gattuso.

Napoli are enjoying a recent upturn in form after a dreadful start to the Serie A season which culminated in the sacking of Carlo Ancelotti following a 4-0 win over Genk that sent them into the Champions League knockout stage.

Last season’s Serie A runners-up have won six of their last seven games.

“Tomorrow (Tuesday), I want a Napoli side that are not afraid,” added Gattuso.

“I want to see a team that knows how to battle... You need to stand up to Barcelona — you can’t worry.

“I want to see a lively team that plays with joy until the end. Can Napoli win the Champions League? Never say never.”

It is the first time Napoli have reached the knockout rounds since a last-16 loss to Real Madrid in 2017, while Barcelona are bidding to make the quarter-finals for a 13th consecutive season.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/messi----greatest----ahead-of-maradona--gattuso-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/messi----greatest----ahead-of-maradona--gattuso.html
201,25-2-20,Hong Kong's Lee tunes out critics for cycling worlds,"Sarah Lee will attempt to defend women's keirin and sprint gold at this week's track cycling world championships in Berlin, although some argued she should have been banned from representing Hong Kong over accusations of supporting anti-government protests.

Lee, who considering quitting cycling after her 2016 Rio Olympics flop, found herself in the middle of a social media storm last year over comments perceived as backing pro-democracy protests in the semi-autonomous city.

While she received plenty of support for embracing freedom of speech and speaking out for Hong Kong, Lee's remarks also prompted calls from netizens for her to be stood down.

The 32-year-old suspended her social media account in the wake of the controversy, but Hong Kong's Sports Institute -- where Lee trains -- declined to take action, saying ""there are no grounds for saying her comments had anything to do with the protest"".

Upon reopening her Facebook page three months later, Lee wrote that she had closed it for ""a lot of different reasons, among the biggest was that I did not want to see people abusing each other on the page, especially among Hong Kong people.""

She continued: ""I have to say I have been struggling for a while, fearing there may be fabrication from the media, fearing people who may use their own words to interpret my sentences, fearing speculation made by people on the internet, fearing getting involved in political turmoil, fearing it may affect the Olympic Games.

""But in the end I don't want to abandon it. I won't back down because of these fears.""

Lee wrote herself into Hong Kong's history books by winning the city's first ever Olympic cycling medal -- only their third overall -- with a bronze in the keirin at London 2012.

The Berlin Velodrome, built as part of the city's failed bid to host the 2000 Olympics, will from Wednesday welcome nearly 400 riders from 46 nations -- with India and Latvia set for their world championships debut.

The event, held on a track rebuilt in 2017, will be the final one in the Tokyo Olympic qualifying window. The ranking cut-off is on March 2.

Kenny double act

Husband-and-wife Olympic champions Jason and Laura Kenny will be among the names to watch, the latter opting against surgery on a broken shoulder in order to compete.

Laura Kenny, double Olympic gold medallist in the omnium and team pursuit, intends to defend both titles in Tokyo.

However, injury means she will miss the latter event in Berlin.

Three-time sprint silver medallist Stephanie Morton returns as part of an Australian squad that won a joint-best six golds alongside the Netherlands at the 2019 worlds in Poland.

Former sprint champion Matthew Glaetzer, who underwent surgery and treatment in November for thyroid cancer, was a late withdrawal due to a leg injury.

Kelland O'Brien, a member of the 2017 and 2019 gold-medal winning men's team pursuit line-up, has also been ruled out.

Germany's Roger Kluge and Theo Reinhardt will bid for a third successive triumph in the madison, which will be reinstated to the Olympic programme in Tokyo.

Dutch two-time defending women's omnium champion Kirsten Wild, 37, is again the favourite in the multi-race event, while Russian duo Daria Shmeleva and Anastasia Voinova will look to regain the women's team sprint title they last won in 2017.

Nicholas Paul of Trinidad and Tobago set a fyling 200m world record at the Pan American Games and is on the cusp of booking his Olympic spot.

202,25-2-20,Dhoni to start training for IPL-13 from March 2,"Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will start his training here from March 2 along with other players ahead of season-13 of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The 38-year old Dhoni, whose future in the game has been a subject of intense speculation since the ICC 50-over World Cup in June-July last year, will start training at the M A Chidambaram stadium for the upcoming IPL.

The IPL 2020 begins with a match between CSK and defending champion Mumbai Indians in Mumbai on March 29.

According to CSK CEO K S Viswanathan, Dhoni will be training with players who are available as the full preparatory camp of the team begins on March 19.

Former India captain Dhoni is expected to practice for a couple of weeks with the likes of Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu among others. He would then take a break before returning, sources said.

Raina and Rayudu have been training here for the past three weeks or so.

Sources said it would help the veteran stumper to bond with the new players in the CSK set-up.

'Thala' as Dhoni is affectionately called by the legion of CSK fans would also look to get into the groove as he has been away from the game for a while now. He had commenced training with the Jharkhand team some time back.

The Super Kings' practice sessions in the last two years had attracted crowds in thousands and with Dhoni set for an early arrival for preparation similar numbers can be expected this time around also.

207,25-2-20,Delhi violence: Death toll rises to 10,"New Delhi, Feb 25 (PTI) Smoke billowed in the air and mobs roamed unchecked through the streets, burning shops, pelting stones and threatening locals, as fresh violence tore through northeast Delhi, killing six more people on Tuesday and taking the toll in the communal clashes over the amended citizenship law to 11.

As tension smouldered in the national capital's northeast and the sun set over another restive day, violence cut a swathe through several localities, including Chand Bagh and Bhajanpura, with stones and other missiles hurled and shops set ablaze.

Rioters damaged two fire tenders in Gokulpuri and crowds raising incendiary slogans set on fire fruit carts, rickshaws and anything that came in their way in the epicentre of the trouble Maujpur and other places.

With US President Donald Trump also in the city, Delhi Police ramped up security. It fired teargas shells to disperse the rioters -- armed with stones, rods and even swords and many wearing helmets to protect themselves -- and was assisted by paramilitary personnel.

Streets were littered with mangled remains of vehicles, bricks and burnt tyres, mute testimony to the violence and bloodshed that took on a communal taint on Monday and injured about 180 people, including 48 police personnel.

According to GTB Hospital Medical Superintendent Sunil Kumar, six people were declared brought dead on Tuesday, taking the death toll in 11. At least 35 injured people were also taken to the hospital today.

""Fifty per cent of those injured have sustained bullet injuries,"" Kumar added.

As the violence continued unabated, police officials said the situation was under control and flag marches were conducted in Bhajanpura, Khajuri Khas and other places.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah convened a meeting with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Police chief Amulya Patnaik and others to address the situation.

The meeting resolved that workers of political parties should join hands to restore peace and peace committees should be reactivated in all localities.

In scenes not seen in the national capital for decades, frenzied groups thrashed people on the road and vandalised vehicles.

The media also came under attack.

Akshay, a journalist with JK 24X7 News, received a bullet injury and was in a serious condition in hospital, and two reporters from NDTV were beaten and punched by rioters. Many other journalists were heckled and told to go back. Schools were shut and fearful residents stayed indoors as restless crowds roamed the streets, seemingly unmindful of prohibitory orders restricting the assembly of more than four people imposed on Monday.

""There is hardly any police presence in the area. Rioters are running around threatening people, vandalising shops. Families need to be evacuated. We are unsafe in our own homes,"" said a resident of Maujpur, requesting anonymity.

Another added that this is the first time in 35 years -- possibly since the 1984 anti-Sikh riots -- that he has seen a situation such as this. ""The area had always remained peaceful,"" he told PTI.

Trouble continued through the day.

Around 5 pm in Chand Bagh, for instance, security personnel were pelted with stones. They chased the mob, only to be attacked afresh with some people also armed with petrol bombs.

A few residents in Yamuna Vihar and Jaffrabad told PTI they had seen rioters with swords in their hands.

The 11 killed include Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal. While Lal died of gunshot wounds, it is still not yet clear what killed the others or who they all were.

Among those killed was Vinod Kumar, a resident of Ghonda who was brought dead to the hospital and whose body is at the morgue of the Jag Parvesh Hospital.

Also killed was Mohammad Furkan from Kardampuri, near Jafrabad, who got married in 2014 and has two children. His brother, Mohammed Imran, overcome with grief, said they were both in the handicrafts business.

""He had gone to get some food for his children. Someone told me he had been shot. I couldn't believe it as I had met him barely an hour earlier. I kept calling him... I then rushed to GTB Hospital where I was told that he is dead,"" he told reporters, sobbing inconsolably outside the hospital.

Imran blamed BJP leader Kapil Mishra's tweet, giving Delhi Police an ultimatum to clear the streets of protesters and saying people would be quiet only until Trump is in India.

""Before that everything was peaceful,"" he said.

One person seen brandishing a gun before police on Monday was identified as Shah Rukh and been arrested yet. Police said 11 FIRs have been filed.

Kejriwal, who held a meeting with senior officials and MLAs of all parties to discuss the situation, asked people to refrain from violence and said all issues can be dealt with through dialogue.

""Stop this madness,"" he said after visiting the injured in GTB Hospital.

""I have met the people who were injured, also met some people who sustained bullet injuries. The biggest concern is to stop the violence. I appeal to everyone to stop the violence,"" he said.

211,25-2-20,"India, US finalise defence deals worth USD 3 billion","India and the US on Tuesday finalised defence deals worth USD 3 billion under which 30 military helicopters will be procured from two American defence majors for Indian armed forces.

The announcement on the deals were made by US President Donald Trump after his wide-ranging talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Talking about convergence of interests between the two countries, Modi said he and Trump have decided to raise the Indo-US ties to the level of a comprehensive global strategic partnership.

Under a USD 2.6 billion deal, India will buy 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters from Lockheed Martin for the Indian Navy.

213,25-2-20,India natural anti-terror ally: Trump,"US Prez lauds India for unity in religious diversity

India and the US are natural partners and both the countries are committed to defend their people from radical Islamic terrorism. This was the focal point of visiting US President Donald Trump’s riveting speech made before a capacity crowd at Motera stadium here on Monday. The crowd erupted in a thundering applause when the US President said his country “loves India and its people.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke both before and after the US President, hailed Trump’s visit as a “new chapter” in ties between the two countries.

Both the leaders made these points during a public event “Namaste Trump” at the new look Motera stadium shortly after Trump arrived here to commence his two-day visit to India. He was accompanied by his wife Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and top brass of his administration.

Modi and Trump will hold talks in New Delhi on Tuesday wherein the two countries will ink a $3 billion defence deal for 24 Naval multi-role helicopters and six Apache attack helicopters for the Army. While the Naval helicopter deal is about $2.6 billion, the Apache contract is over $980 million. Trump announced in his speech here about the two deals. The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) headed by Prime Minister Modi had cleared the two defence deals last week.

While the chemistry between Modi and Trump was fully evident as the two leaders shared many hugs and heaped praise on each other in front of 1,00,000-strong enthusiastic crowd, the traditional and colourful welcome left the US President impressed.

“Five months ago, the US welcomed your PM at a giant football stadium, and you welcomed us at the world’s largest cricket stadium. Thank you for spectacular welcome. We will always remember this remarkable hospitality,” Trump said.

Known for his fondness to tweet, Trump earlier took to Twitter and tweeted messages in Hindi, including one expressing eagerness to visit India, to which Modi responded by tweeting the Sanskrit phrase, “Atithi Devo Bhava (guest is god)”.

Talking about India’s rich culture and extraordinary diversity repeatedly, Trump said India is always admired around the world as the place where millions of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Jews worship side by side in harmony as it has great tradition of embracing individual freedom, rule of law, dignity of every human being.

“The First Lady and I have travelled 8,000 mile around the globe to deliver the message to all citizens across this nation — America loves India, America respects India, and America will always be a faithful and loyal friend to the Indian people,” Trump said.

During his nearly 30 minutes long speech at the stadium, Trump also said, “While our nations have many differences, they are both defined and propelled by a fundamental truth — the truth that all of us are blessed with divine light and every person is endowed with a sacred soul” and quoted Swami Vivekanand.

On his maiden visit to India as the President of the United States, Trump, who was welcomed by Modi on his arrival here, said his country will remain a “loyal” friend of India and called Prime Minister Modi an “exceptional leader” who works day and night for the country.

“India and the US are committed to fight terrorists and their ideology, that is why my Government is working with Pakistan to crack down on terror groups,” the US President said.

“Under my Administration we unleashed the full power of the military on blood-thirsty killers of ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. Today the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 per cent destroyed and the monster known as Al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, is dead,” he said.

He also announced that the two countries will firm up defence deals worth USD 3 billion on Tuesday and that the US will become India’s premier defence partner. “US looks forward to providing India the best and feared equipment on the planet,” he said.

“India and US have natural and enduring friendship,” Trump said to a cheering crowd. Trump said both countries are working on a “fantastic trade” deal, and observed that Modi is a “tough negotiator”.

The US President also praised Modi, saying the Prime Minister is a “living proof” of what an Indian can achieve with hard work as Trump referred to his humble background as a tea-seller. Modi praised Trump’s leadership in containing terrorism.

Trump said as the world’s largest economy, India gives hope to all humanity and has become an economic giant. “There is a difference between a nation that rises by coercion and one that rises by setting its people free -- that is India. India and the US have natural and enduring friendship,” he said.

He also touched on India’s cultural diversity and riches as he highlighted the success of its blockbuster movies like DDLJ (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge) and Sholay, and its sporting icons like Sachin Tedulkar and Virat Kohli.

He highlighted the boom in the US economy under his presidency and added that India will soon be home to the biggest middle class as it will eliminate extreme poverty in next 10 years.

Addressing the gathering, Modi termed the visit as a “new chapter” and said the relations between the two countries are no longer just another partnership but a far greater and closer relationship.

Welcoming the US President to “world’s biggest democracy”, Modi said foundations of new alignments, challenges, opportunities and changes are being laid.

“India and the US relations and cooperation will play an important role in deciding the course of world in the 21st century. I am of the categorical view that India and the US are natural partners,” Modi said.

Underscoring the strong ties between the two nations, Modi said the US is now India’s largest trading partner and the Indian military is involved in its biggest war exercise with the US.

Modi said Trump’s visit is a new chapter in the relations. “A chapter that will become a new document of progress and prosperity of the people of America and India,” he said.

Modi said the two countries also share spirit of enterprise and innovation, shared opportunities and challenges and shared hopes and aspirations. The Prime Minister also appreciated Trump Administration’s efforts in the field of health.

The biggest strength between two people or nations is trust, Modi said while quoting an old adage that “friendship is where trust is unshakable”.

Highlighting the achievements of the country, Modi noted that India not only has the world record of sending the maximum number of satellites simultaneously, but also is making the world record by doing the fastest financial inclusion.

“Increasing manufacturing in India, expanding infrastructure, will bring new possibilities for America. In this era of Industry 4.0, the expansion of the digital economy in India will create many investment opportunities for the US as well,” Modi said.

Industry 4.0 has been defined as a name for the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. Modi also said we are inspired by a long-term vision, not just short term considerations.

“Our bilateral relations will grow, our economic partnership will expand, our digital cooperation will increase,” he said.

The Indo-US ties are no longer just another partnership but have touched far greater heights, and the Trump’s trip with his family shows this, Modi said.

The PM said today 130 crore Indians are jointly building a ‘new India’. “Our youth power is full of aspirations. Setting big goals, achieving them is becoming the hallmark of new India today,” he said.

Modi noted that India not only has the world record of sending the maximum number of satellites simultaneously, but also is making the world record by doing the fastest financial inclusion.

“Today the country with which India has the most extensive research and development partnership is America,” he said.

Referring to military ties, the Prime Minister said the two countries have participated in a number of bilateral military exercises. “We can make an effective contribution not only in the Indo-Pacific region, but in the peace, progress and security of the whole world,” he said.

Referring to the key decisions taken by his Government in the recent past, Modi said not only 1,500 obsolete laws have been scrapped to clean up the statute books, new legislations have been enacted to empower society.

“Be it the rights of transgender persons, making law against (the practice of) triple talaq to respect Muslim women, extending priority to the disabled, giving 26 weeks of paid maternity leave -- many such rights have been extended to various sections of society,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-natural-anti-terror-ally--trump-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-natural-anti-terror-ally--trump.html

220,25-2-20,Nirbhaya case: SC to hear on Mar 5 Centre's appeal against HC verdict on hanging of 4 convicts,"The Supreme Court Tuesday said it would hear on March 5 the plea filed by the Centre challenging the Delhi High Court verdict which held that the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya case have to be executed together and not separately.

The apex court had made it clear on February 14 that pendency of the Centre's appeal seeking separate execution of the four convicts would not come in the way of trial court's issuing a fresh date for their hanging, which is now scheduled for March 3.

The appeal filed by the Centre and the Delhi government came up for hearing before a bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and Navin Sinha which adjourned the matter for next week.

""List the matters on March 5 at 3 PM,"" the bench said in its order.

The high court on February 5 dismissed the Centre's plea against the trial court's order staying the execution of death sentence of the four convicts.

It also faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps for issuance of death warrant after the rejection of appeals of the accused by the Supreme Court in 2017.

The trial court on February 17 issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 am for the four convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) -- in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

The top court had asked these four condemned prisoners to file their replies on the Centre's appeal.

The mercy petitions of three convicts -- Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay -- have already been dismissed by the President.

The fourth convict, Pawan, has till now neither filed a curative petition in the top court nor the mercy petition before the President.

The apex court had earlier dismissed separate pleas filed by Mukesh and Vinay challenging the rejection of their mercy petitions by the President.

Akshay has not yet challenged the rejection of his mercy petition.

222,25-2-20,DadiKaKehna,"Dry, flaky and rough skin are a part and parcel of summers. Roshni Devi shares home remedies that will help keep your skin hydrated during the season

Keeping your skin hydrated and smooth during the hot summer months can be very challenging. The scorching heat leaves no stone unturned to make you feel dehydrated, retaining moisture becomes a tedious task. Here are a few ways to retain your skin’s moisture without spending a bomb on several cosmetics.

Make water your best friend. Make sure to drink atleast eight to 10 glasses of water everyday if not more. This will help in retaining moisture and will keep your body hydrated thereby locking in the skin’s moisture to avoid dryness.

Fruits and fresh juices can help. Make sure to have ample of citrus fruits in your diet. One can also drink fresh fruit juices to avoid dehydration.

Skipping sunscreen is a big ‘no-no’. Many of us tend to ignore sunscreen and directly apply make-up. This is a strict no. Suncreens help to lock moisture and avoid the damage caused by UV rays.

Use glycerin. One can directly dab a cotton ball into glycerin and apply it all over the face during night. It will help to keep your skin hydrated. If you have oily skin, you can also add few drops of lemon juice into it to avoid making your skin look extra oily.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dadikakehna-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/dadikakehna-dadikakehna-2020-02-25.html
223,25-2-20,Tiptop,"The latest findings of India Diabetes Care Index unveiled that the average HbA1c level decreased to 8.47 from 8.76 during October to December 2019 as compared to the preceding quarter in Delhi. The overall HbA1c level decreased to 8.37 from 8.52 as compared to the preceding quarter in the country. The average postprandial glucose level, i.e. the average ‘post-meal’ glucose level was recorded at an alarmingly high 246.69 mg/dL. Uncontrolled diabetes is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by 2 to 4 times.

The India Diabetes Care Index, a part of the ‘Impact India: 1000-Day Challenge’ programme by Novo Nordisk Education Foundation studies the blood glucose levels across cities through various parameters.

Speaking about the status of Diabetes control in Delhi, Dr Ambrish Mithal, Chairman and Head of Endocrinology and Diabetes at Max Healthcare Hospitals, Delhi said: “We are happy that there is a marginal dip in the Hb1Ac level as compared to the last quarter. However, this marginal reduction in HbA1c can be further improved if we avoid the intake of high refined carbohydrate. This high carbohydrate content leads to high post meal sugar values. Post-meal spikes are known to increase the chances of cardiovascular diseases. We need to concentrate on addressing both fasting and post-meal glucose levels across all HbA1c levels. For this, people with diabetes should follow the right diet, exercise daily and doregular consultation with their doctors.”",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/tiptop-tiptop-2020-02-25.html

225,25-2-20,Studycentre,"E-cigarette users are exposed to increased concentrations of potentially harmful levels of metals that are linked to elevated oxidative DNA damage, a new study has found.

For the study, published in the journal BMJ Open Respiratory Research, researchers found that the biomarkers, which reflect exposure, effect, and potential harm, are both elevated in e-cigarette users compared to the other groups and linked to metal exposure and oxidative DNA damage.

“Our study found e-cigarette users are exposed to increased concentrations of potentially harmful levels of metals — especially zinc — that are correlated to elevated oxidative DNA damage,” said the study’s lead researcher Prue Talbot from University of California in the US.

Zinc, a dietary nutrient, plays key roles in growth, immune function, and wound healing. Too little of this essential trace element can cause death; too much of it can cause disease.

Its deficiency, as well as its excess, cause cellular oxidative stress, which, if unchecked, can lead to diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, pulmonary fibrosis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and lung cancer.

For the study, researchers have examined and quantified urinary biomarkers of effect and potential harm in relation to metals in e-cigarette users.

“Excess of zinc in their bodies can lead to nausea and diarrhea,”Talbot added.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre-2020-02-25.html
226,25-2-20,Exposure to alcohol ads can lead to teenage drinking,"Researchers have found that exposure to alcohol advertising changes teens' attitudes about alcohol and can cause them to start drinking.

In the study, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, researchers used a framework developed to show causality between tobacco advertising and youth smoking and applied it to alcohol advertising.

According to the researchers, youth are particularly vulnerable to the influence of advertising due to their potential for forming brand loyalties at an early age, limited skepticism, and high use of social media--where alcohol marketing is increasingly found.

""The association of alcohol and tobacco advertising exposure and adolescent perceptions, knowledge of, and use of these substances are remarkably similar, adding to the much-needed evidence that the association between alcohol advertising and teen alcohol use is causal in nature,"" said the study's researcher Michael Weitzman from New York University in the US.

In this study, the researchers used one of the key elements of the Bradford Hill criteria -- a well-known framework for determining causal links between environmental exposures and disease -- to determine whether marketing is a cause of youth alcohol use, focusing on the criterion that relies on analogous relationships already established as causal.

They found that, in every aspect studied, the influence of tobacco and alcohol advertising on teenagers were analogous.

For instance, both tobacco and alcohol companies have used mascots in advertisements, which research shows are easily recognised and trusted by children.

In addition, both tobacco and alcohol companies use or have used movies, television, and sporting events as opportunities for advertising and product placement, with studies showing that exposure to smoking and drinking increases the risk for youth initiation.

The researchers also found that neighbourhoods with large numbers of tobacco retailers expose youth to more tobacco advertising and make it easier to buy cigarettes.

Finally, the researchers found that exposure to tobacco and alcohol advertising and teen knowledge, attitudes, initiation, and continued use of the products are extraordinarily similar.

Many studies show that advertising is a risk factor for both smoking and drinking, with several studies showing a dose-dependent relationship, with more exposure to advertising increasing consumption, the researchers said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/exposure-to-alcohol-ads-can-lead-to-teenage-drinking-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/exposure-to-alcohol-ads-can-lead-to-teenage-drinking.html

228,25-2-20,"With 71 new coronavirus deaths, total number of casualties touches 2,663 in China","Seventy-one new coronavirus deaths were reported from China, taking the total number of casualties to 2,663, even as reports suggested that the number of new cases has seen a sharp decline.

According to a daily report released by the National Health Commission (NHC) on Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases has reached 77,658, a jump of 508 cases.

The report stated that 68 deaths were reported in Hubei, two in Shandong and one in Guangdong.

China's daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside ground zero Hubei came down to nine, indicating a continued declining trend.

The daily number of cured and discharged patients has surpassed that of new cases for the seventh consecutive day, the NHC claimed.

Monday saw 2,589 people walking out of hospital after recovery, much higher than the new confirmed patients, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

A total of 27,323 patients have been been discharged by the end of Monday, it said.

The agency reported that Monday marked the sixth consecutive day when China's daily number of new infections remained under 1,000.

Newly recovered coronavirus patients in both Hubei and Wuhan outnumbered new cases, it said.

Confirming the declining trend, Canadian epidemiologist Bruce Aylward, who headed the WHO mission to China, said the drop in the number of cases was possible due to actions taken by the Chinese government.

""I know the challenges with the statistics that come out of China, sometimes with changing numbers. What we had to do is to look very carefully at different sources of information to say confidently this is actually declining,"" Aylward told reporters here.

""A lot of compelling data and observations on the ground support this,"" he added.

Aylward headed the first WHO technical team on February 10 and later paved the way for a 12-member expert team that arrived in Beijing last Monday.

The team, along with Chinese experts, visited worst-hit Hubei province over the weekend to conduct field investigations on the virus outbreak.

Aylward said when he arrived in Beijing on February 10, China was reporting about 2,500 cases a day, which has now declined to over 400.

The observation was made from the data collected from fever clinics and the availability of hospital beds, he said, stressing that the numbers dropped amid heightened awareness and the push to get oneself tested.

Secondly, doctors in Wuhan are for the first time reporting vacant beds in hospitals to accommodate new patients, he said, adding that earlier China had to build two makeshift hospitals with a capacity of 2,300 beds.

Later, officials converted stadiums and dormitories into hospitals to accommodate more patients.

""The (WHO) team wanted to be convinced. Very rapidly multiple sources of data point to the same thing that the cases are falling and they are falling because of actions that are being taken,"" he said, adding that the world needed the experience and expertise of China.

Elaborating further, Aylward said old approaches like suspension of travel and quarantine were used to contain the spread of the virus by the Chinese authorities.

""These significant measures could only be adopted with tremendous collective will, not only in the community but also top officials, which is rare to see,"" Aylward said.

Liang Wannian, who headed the Chinese expert team, said the deadly virus has not significantly mutated.

""The animal host has not been confirmed--a bat could be the host, but also a pangolin,"" Liang Wannian said.

""The transmission route is respiratory droplets. The fecal-oral route needs to be further studied,"" Liang said in the joint press conference with Aylward.

Liang said 3,000 medical staff, mostly in the worst-hit Wuhan, are estimated to have been infected by the virus. Ten medical staff have died.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/with-71-new-coronavirus-deaths--total-number-of-casualties-touches-2-663-in-china-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/with-71-new-coronavirus-deaths--total-number-of-casualties-touches-2-663-in-china.html
229,25-2-20,Taj Mahal inspires awe: POTUS,"Walking hand-in-hand, US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on Monday evening went around the iconic Taj Mahal, hailing the 17th century Mughal-era mausoleum as a “timeless testament” to the rich and diverse beauty of Indian culture.

The American power couple spent almost an hour at the Taj Mahal, soaking in the beauty of the monument of love, and were briefed about the history and traditions associated with architectural marvel.

“The Taj Mahal inspires awe. A timeless testament to the rich and diverse beauty of Indian culture! Thank you India,” Trump and Melania wrote on the visitor’s book.

Trump, accompanied by his wife, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, arrived here from Ahmedabad where they attended the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at the Motera stadium.

The Taj Mahal, which was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631, was refurbished for the visit.

Holding hands, the couple took a stroll in the resplendent gardens adjoining the pool at the celebrated monument, as a cool breeze made their experience even more pleasant.

Trump, dressed in a dark suit with a tie of light shade, and Melania, wearing a white dress accessorised with a green waistband, also posed for photographs. Ivanka, wearing a white dress with red floral prints and red shoes, and Kushner, dressed in a sharp suit, took a stroll hand-in-hand around the monument.

She also captured the moments in her mobile phone and even gave her phone to a person to get a solo picture clicked.

Trump and Melenia were also briefed about the history and importance of the monument by a guide.

The US President’s visit to Agra and Taj generated huge excitement among local residents. Some shops even displayed their own banners, welcoming Trump to India.

Trump also took to Twitter to express his sentiments about his first official visit to India.

“First lady and I have travelled 8,000 miles around the world to give a message to each citizen of this country – America loves India, America respects India, and the people of America will always be true and committed friends of the people of India,” the American leader tweeted in Hindi.

From the Kheria airbase here, Trump’s convoy of over 30 vehicles drove to Oberoi Amarvilas hotel near the Taj Mahal complex, as over 15,000 school students who lined up on both sides of the route held US and India flags and cheered the US president as his motorcade passed by.

Massive billboards bearing greeting messages and pictures of Trump, First Lady and Modi dotted the nearly 13-km convoy route as street roundabouts decked up with US and India flags symbolised the US-India friendship.

An extensive three-layered security was in place for his Agra visit, and authorities had got the Taj Mahal premises cleared of visitors by noon, hours ahead of Trump’s visit to the celebrated architectural landmark.

The last US president to visit the the Mughal-era wonder was Bill Clinton who had come to India in 2000. He had seen the Taj along with daughter Chelsea Clinton. In 1959, then US president Dwight David Eisenhower had visited Taj along with then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

From massive billboards bearing greeting messages to street roundabouts decked up with US and India flags, Agra had waited excitedly to welcome President Trump and authorities made arrangements to present a “lively Agra” to the visiting president, seeking to shake off the old tag of ‘city of ghosts’.

“During Clinton’s visit the city streets were deserted due to security arrangements, prompting him to call it a ‘city of ghosts’. This time the excitement can be felt in the air,” said Mohit Kumar, who works at a hotel in Tajganj area.

“I was very young in 2000 when Clinton visited. We are very excited and happy that another US President has come to our city due to which the civic amenities have been improved,” he said.

Earlier, on his arrival at the airbase, over 250 artistes drawn from different parts of Uttar Pradesh performed the ‘Mayur dance’, ‘Rai folk dance’, Dhobia folk dance’ as sonorous sounds of ‘bumrasia’ nagada, dholak, mridang, added to the festive ambience.

A giant billboard there featuring Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and Prime Minister Modi greeted the couple with a message – ‘Grand welcome of India’s best friend to the City of Love –Agra’.

Trump was received at the Kheria airbase by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

“From the airport, the US President’s convoy travelled till the Oberoi Amarvilas hotel situated near the East Gate of the Taj Mahal complex. From there the President and his family and members of high-level delegation accompanying him moved into eco-friendly golf carts to travel into the monument premises,” a senior official said.

As per Supreme Court directions, petrol or diesel-operated vehicles are not permitted within 500 m of the Taj Mahal’s gate.

The architectural marvel inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 is made of white Makrana marble and red sandstones, and renowned for its intricate inlay work on the stone surface.

Taj Mahal, considered one of the seven wonders of the world, stands on the bank of Yamuna, and is always high on the itinerary of visiting heads of state.

In 2015, the then US President Barack Obama was scheduled to visit the monument during his India visit. It is said he could not do so due to security reasons. It is one of the most photographed sites in the world.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/taj-mahal-inspires-awe--potus-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/taj-mahal-inspires-awe--potus.html

232,25-2-20,Listen to skin call,"India accounts for 58% of total leprosy patients around the world. The reason being lack of awareness of the disease. DR Ritupurna Dash tells you ways to identify and treat it

Leprosy is an infectious disease which is also known as Hansen’s Disease. It is caused by a bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae and mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves and the eyes. The initial symptoms usually are loss of sensation on the affected area of the skin along with discolored patches on the body or painless ulcers which if left untreated can lead to permanent disability like disfigurement of hands and feet, loss of sensation and blindness.

Leprosy is still one of the most misunderstood diseases in the world and hence poses many unique challenges in controlling and eliminating it. Leprosy was declared as ‘eradicated disease’ in 2005, but India still accounts for the maximum number of people to be affected by leprosy in the world; 58 per cent of the total people globally suffering from leprosy are in India. The disease is still widespread in many parts of the country due to lack of awareness, socio-economic myths and beliefs and associated stigma. These commonly lead to delayed care seeking and treatment completion. Further major concerns include prevalence of leprosy among children, undetected new cases and problems with leprosy integration.

In India, people with leprosy frequently present in late stages of disease progression and usually with eye complications leading to blindness.

Symptoms

One of the initial symptoms can be excessive nose bleeding and a stuffy nose without reason. Numbness, loss of temperature/touch sensation, pins and needles sensations, joint pain, decreased or lost deep pressure sensations, nerve injury, weight loss, blisters and/ or rashes, large ulcers (relatively painless), discolored skin patches, eye damage (dryness, reduced blinking), loss of eyebrows, loss of digits and disability, and facial disfigurement are some of the other commonly encountered problems.

The complications of leprosy depend on how early it is detected and effectively treated. Very few complications occur if treatment is initiated early enough. However, if treatment is delayed or discontinued mid way, complications may manifest. Sensory loss (usually beginning in the extremities), permanent nerve damage (usually, again, in the extremities), muscle weakness and progressive disfigurement (for example, eyebrows lost, disfigurement of the toes, fingers, and nose) are some common complications. In addition, the sensory loss causes people to injure body parts without the individual being aware that there is an injury. This can lead to further problems such as infections, poor wound healing and ulcers. A condition called erythema nodosum leprosum (tender skin nodules accompanied by other symptoms like fever, joint pain, neuritis, and edema) is also encountered as a complication needing immediate attention.

Risks of transmission

Leprosy has low transmission rate. However, people of all age groups and gender are susceptible to develop leprosy. Transmission occurs only with close contact with the one suffering from leprosy. The risks also are raised to up to 10 times to develop and spread leprosy. The major concerns of developing and transmitting new cases of leprosy especially in India include — reduced functioning of the immune system due to malnutrition, related illness or ailments and at times, due to genetic conditions.

It is very crucial to develop a comprehensive approach to combat Leprosy. Some of these include educating public through awareness campaigns, programmes on sustainable livelihood and skill training for the affected people (economic mainstreaming), interventions to counter social stigma (social mainstreaming).

The writer is MBBS MD (Dermatology, Leprosy & Venereology)

Treatment

It is important to understand the symptoms and immediately consult the skin specialist for diagnosis. Based on the level of disease progression, the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment. The medication and condition varies from person to person and can only be planned with the initial diagnosis.

Treatment is quite effective if started in the initial stages, and hence timely diagnosis and treatment is important. Steroids may be given to minimise pain and acute inflammation. Majority of the cases can be treated with antibiotics only.

Depending on the stage, the dosage of the medication may vary. According to WHO, Leprosy is classified into two types — paucibacillary and multibacillary, and hence the medications also differ. The course of the medication is usually for six to 12 months to completely cure the condition.

Upon successful course completion, the bacteria is completely eliminated from the person’s body and further disease progression and damage is averted. But, the damage undergone already is not reversible with medications.

In such conditions, surgical intervention may be helpful to restore functions like movement related issues, neurological prolems, and cosmetic repair. Surgery is usually individualised and can restore the limb and neural functions lost in the course of the ailment.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/listen-to-skin-call-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/listen-to-skin-call.html
233,25-2-20,Dockyard : Keep a check on eyes,"As one age, he needs more light to see. Brighter lights in the work area or next to the reading chair will help make reading and other close-up tasks easier

Beginning in the early to mid-40s, many adults may start to have problems seeing clearly at close distances, especially when reading and working on the computer. This is among the most common problems adults develop between ages 41 to 60. This normal change in the eye’s focusing ability, called presbyopia, will continue to progress over time.

Initially, you may need to hold reading materials farther away to see them clearly. Or you may need to remove your glasses to see better up close. Print in the newspaper or on a restaurant menu may appear blurred, especially under dim lighting.

If you already wear prescription glasses or contact lenses to see clearly in the distance, these changes in your near vision can be corrected by switching to bifocal or multifocal lenses. Fortunately, people with presbyopia now have many options to improve their vision.

During these years, schedule a comprehensive eye examination with your optometrist at least every two years to check for developing eye and vision problems. Don’t rely on the limited driver’s license vision test or other insufficient vision screenings to determine if you have an eye or vision problem.

Adults over 40 who have the following health or work issues may be particularly at risk for developing eye and vision problems:

Chronic, systemic conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

A family history of glaucoma or macular degeneration.

A highly visually demanding job or work in an eye-hazardous occupation.

Health conditions related to high cholesterol, thyroid, anxiety or depression, and arthritis for which you take medications. Many medications, even antihistamines, have vision side effects.

Just like your body, your eyes and vision change over time. While not everyone will experience the same symptoms, the following are common age-related vision changes:

Need for more light. As you age, you need more light to see as well as you used to. Brighter lights in your work area or next to your reading chair will help make reading and other close-up tasks easier.

Difficulty reading and doing close work. Printed materials can become less clear, in part because the lens in your eye becomes less flexible over time. This makes it harder for your eyes to focus on near objects than when you were younger.

Problems with glare. When driving, you may notice additional glare from headlights at night or sun reflecting off windshields or pavement during the day. Changes in your lenses in your eyes cause light entering the eye to be scattered rather than focused precisely on the retina. This creates more glare.

Changes in colour perception. The normally clear lens located inside your eye may start to discolour. This makes it harder to see and distinguish between certain colour shades.

Reduced tear production. With age, the tear glands in your eyes will produce fewer tears. This is particularly true for women experiencing hormone changes. As a result, your eyes may feel dry and irritated. Having an adequate amount of tears is essential for keeping your eyes healthy and for maintaining clear sight.

234,25-2-20,Meditate to fight stress,"While much needs to be done to transform our education system to meet the needs of all, it is equally important to teach our children ways to manage stress, says DR PRAKRITI PODDAR

Data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that almost 28 student suicides were reported in India in 2018, translating into one suicide every hour. It is a tremendously worrying indicator for a country to lose its valuable young resource to suicides emanating from pressure of education. Critics have time and again pointed out that our education system tends to judge widely different students on single line parameters, which is unfair. While much needs to be done to transform our education system to meet the needs of all types of students, it is equally important to teach our children the art of taking stress in their strides. It is also important for parents to not impose the burden of unreasonable expectations on their children.

Steps have been taken over the past decade to make Board examinations less daunting for students. These include more focus on conceptual questions rather than long descriptive ones and making Class X Boards optional for students. Yet, children preparing for Boards examination often end up getting overwhelmed ahead of the examination season. Some students tend to experience episodes of anxiety and sleeplessness and even nervous breakdowns. This condition is compounded by constant scrutiny by parents, teachers and inquisitive relatives as well as constant comparisons with peers.

If you are a student preparing for Boards examination, here is a list of useful suggestions to help you cope with the pressure:

Treat Boards like any other exams. Board exams are just another exam based on the syllabus you have already studied. Train your mind to internalise the fact that these are just another exams. You have been there, done that.

Avoid comparisons with peers.

Give your mind an outlet. It is recommended that you must give yourself short breaks every now and then to indulge in activities that divert your mind from studies and helps it to unwind.

Learn meditation and mind calming exercises to manage stress.

Here are a few such techniques that can help invoke a relaxation response:

Breathing exercises: Taking slow, deep and long breaths works in two ways. Firstly, it counters the shallow breathing that comes with stressful state of mind and helps oxygen fill your lungs. Secondly, it helps divert your mind from the stressful thoughts and helps usher in a more relaxed state of mind.

Mindfulness: Practicing mindfulness is another very useful way to beat the stress response. Mindfulness implies focusing every moment on what you are doing, rather than letting stray thoughts creep into your mind. So, if you are eating, concrete on every bite; if you are bating, focus on every exercise during the bath. However, this doesn’t happen overnight You have to train your mind into practicing mindfulness every minute of the day.

Meditation: Meditation is another widely used technique to fight off stress. If you start your day by meditating for a few minutes, you will see that your mind is less distracted, less anxious and better focused on the job. Sit on your table every morning, close your eyes and just concentrate on a random point in space-time.

236,25-2-20,"South Korea reports 60 new coronavirus cases, total 893","South Korea reported 60 more novel coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the smallest increase for four days in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's morning updates.

The country now has 893 cases, the KCDC said -- the largest national total anywhere outside China -- adding one more person had died, taking the toll to eight.

For the previous three days, KCDC had reported triple-digit increases each morning as the outbreak took hold in South Korea, the world's 12th-largest economy.

The country has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and observers say that its health statistics can be treated with confidence.

But despite the smaller number of infections, authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

""The government will put highest priority on the people's health and lives and put all its efforts in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 in the community,"" said vice health minister Kim Gang-lip.

Of the latest cases, 49 are in the southern city of Daegu and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, KCDC said.

The streets of Daegu -- the country's fourth-largest city, with a population of 2.5 million -- have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.

Mask manufacturers have increased their total output to around 10 million a day, but availability remains limited and the government said it will ban people from exporting face coverings.

Masks have become standard wear throughout the country, and scores of events have been cancelled or postponed, from K-pop concerts to the start of the K-league football season.

The Korean Basketball League became the latest to take action on Tuesday, saying it would hold matches behind closed doors ""until the situation improves"".

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travellers to ""avoid all nonessential travel"" to South Korea.

Hong Kong has said it will not allow arrivals from South Korea other than returning residents, while a Mongolian ban on flights to and from the South came into force Tuesday.

Most of the country's infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, an entity often accused of being a cult.

A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services before being diagnosed.

With public criticism growing, Shincheonji's founder Lee Man-hee said in a statement Tuesday that the group would provide the government a list of all its members to have them tested for the virus.

""It will be done under the premise that the government will protect the privacy of our members,"" he added.

The organisation has previously called its members the ""biggest victims"" of the coronavirus.

South Korea's parliament cancelled sessions Tuesday as it closed for cleaning after confirmation a person with the coronavirus had attended a meeting last week. It is set to reopen Wednesday morning.

The leader of the main opposition United Future party Hwang Kyo-ahn had to be tested along with other senior party officials as they had come into contact with the patient, but all tested negative.

With the surge in infection numbers, the United States hinted at scaling back joint military exercises.

US and South Korea militaries were ""looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the coronavirus"", US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told reporters in Washington.

His South Korean counterpart Jeong Kyeong-doo added that 13 South Korean servicemen had been infected and all leave for the military cancelled to limit soldiers' movements.

""The situation is quite serious,"" Jeong said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/south-korea-reports-60-new-coronavirus-cases--total-893-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/south-korea-reports-60-new-coronavirus-cases--total-893.html

On his new film ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"", Ayushmann feels the film has been successfully made, released and accepted is because even before same-sex relationship became legal in India, many actors stuck their neck out and given the audience some brilliant work on the subject. He says he has all those actors and films to credit first.

""The fact that 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' is a success today is because the path was made for it by others. Many before me have toiled hard to make the path smoother. We have to realise and acknowledge the monumental work that was done by some of the finest actors of Indian cinema much before me,"" he said.

He added: ""Before 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan', our industry has also made some of the most soul-touching films on the subject. I don't think we can ever forget Shabana Azmi ji's incredible performance and Nandita Das's heart-wrenching acting in 'Fire', Sanjay Suri and Purab Kohli's vulnerability in 'My Brother Nikhil', Manoj Bajpayee's brilliance in 'Aligarh', and Kalki Koechlin's strength in 'Margarita With A Straw'.""

Ayushmann also mentioned films that brilliantly took on the stereotype faced by the LGBTQ+ community.

""Films like 'Kapoor And Sons', Karan Johar's 'Bombay Talkies' and Sonam Kapoor's 'Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga' have all depicted and handled same-sex relationships with profound thought, dignity, and sensitivity,"" he noted.

""Today, 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' is being celebrated the world over and I have to share this moment with all the actors and directors who had taken it on themselves to promote inclusivity in our country.

Regimes forces have since December clawed back parts of the last major opposition bastion of Idlib in violence that has displaced almost a million people.

Fighting raged Monday, killing almost 100 fighters on both sides around the jihadist-dominated bastion, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said.

Of those killed in the Turkish shelling, four lost their lives near the town of Nayrab while another five died near the town of Saraqeb, the Britain-based Observatory said.

247,25-2-20,"Harvey Weinstein found guilty of rape, criminal sex act","A New York court on Monday found fallen Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein guilty of committing a criminal sex act in the first degree, and rape in the third degree.

A New York Supreme Court jury of seven men and five women arrived at the verdict after deliberating in the case for more than 26 hours over five days, reports cnn.com. After the verdict, a handcuffed Weinstein was taken into custody.

On the first charge, the jury found Weinstein guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The guilty filmmaker could get a minimum of five years and a maximum of 25 years in prison on this count, according to theguarardian.com. On the second charge, Weinstein was convicted of raping a woman in a New York hotel in 2013. He could get a maximum of four years on this count.

The Guardian website added that the 67-year-old former film producer was acquitted of three further charges, including the two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence and another count of rape in the first degree.

During the trial, Weinstein's defense had tried raising the motion for a mistrial but had been denied by the jury.

The court has reserved the sentencing for a future date. According to cnn.com, Weinstein's still has to take to the stands for the hearing of charges against him of sexual assault and rape in separate incidents in Los Angeles.

In October 2017, according to reporst in The New York Times and The New Yorker, several women came out to accuse Weinstein of rape and sexual assault over at least three decades. The incident had a global chain reaction, triggering off the MeToo movement.

Harvey Weinstein was once acclaimed for his contribution to the development of independent cinema in Hollywood, and for also backing relevant content-driven entertainers with Oscar-winning films such as ""Shakespeare In Love"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".

248,25-2-20,Egypt state TV: Ex-President Mubarak has died at 91,"Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader who for nearly 30 years was the resolute face of stability in the Middle East, died on Tuesday, the country's state television said, ending his days after a swift and ignominious tumble from power in the Arab world's pro-democracy upheaval. He was 91.

Throughout his rule, he was a stalwart US ally, a bullwark against Islamic militancy and guardian of Egypt's peace with Israel. But to the tens of thousands of young Egyptians who rallied for 18 days of unprecedented street protests in Cairo's central Tahrir Square and elsewhere in 2011, Mubarak was a relic, a latter-day pharaoh.

They were inspired by the Tunisian revolt, and harnessed the power of social media to muster tumultuous throngs, unleashing popular anger over the graft and brutality that shadowed his rule. In the end, with millions massed in Cairo's Tahrir Square and city centers around the country and even marching to the doorstep of Mubarak's palace, the military that long nurtured him pushed him aside on February 11, 2011.

The generals took power, hoping to preserve what they could of the system he headed.

Though Tunisia's president fell before him, the ouster of Mubarak was the more stunning collapse in the face of the Arab Spring shaking regimes across the Arab world.

He became the only leader so far ousted in the protest wave to be imprisoned. He was convicted along with his former security chief on June 2012 and sentenced to life in prison for failing to prevent the killing of some 900 protesters during the 18-day who rose up against his autocratic regime in 2011. Both appealed the verdict and a higher court later cleared them in 2014.

The acquittal stunned many Egyptians, thousands of whom poured into central Cairo to show their anger against the court.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/egypt-state-tv--ex-president-mubarak-has-died-at-91-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/egypt-state-tv--ex-president-mubarak-has-died-at-91.html
249,25-2-20,Weinstein case could influence other sex crime prosecutions,"New York prosecutorsare hailing Harvey Weinstein's conviction as a pivotal moment that could change the way the legal system views a type of sexual assault case historically considered difficult to prove.

Most of the women who testified against Weinstein stayed in contact with him — and sometimes had consensual sexual encounters with him — after alleged attacks. None promptly reported his crimes. There was little physical evidence to bolster their stories.

The jury convicted anyway, finding the producer guilty of raping one woman in 2013 and sexually assaulting another in 2006.

“This is a new day,” Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Said after the verdict was announced. “Rape is rape whether the survivor reports within an hour, within a year or perhaps never. It's rape despite the complicated dynamics of power and consent after an assault. It's rape even if there is no physical evidence.”

But some women's advocates cautioned that it's too soon to know how much the legal landscape has shifted.

“This is not a signal that our systems and institutions are magically transformed,” said Sonia Ossorio, the president of the National Organization for Women's New York chapter, who sat through most of the trial.

“This is one case, one man. We've got to keep it in perspective.” If any case seemed to encapsulate the #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct, gender dynamics and power as a form of coercion, it was Weinstein's.

Dozens of women who crossed paths with Weinstein through the entertainment industry have said he bullied, pressured, coerced or overpowered them while demanding sexual favors. The alleged encounters took place over many decades, amid movie screenings in Los Angeles, film festivals in Cannes, and business meetings in New York or London.

The New York case involved only six accusers: three directly linked to the charges and three whose testimony was meant to bolster the prosecution case.

Weinstein's defense team argued that the encounters were consensual, if perhaps “transactional”: He wanted sex, they wanted access to his power over the film world.

While the law recognizes that people can be assaulted by intimate partners in ongoing relationships, those cases have rarely been prosecuted in the past, because they're difficult to prove, several trial lawyers said.

The tide is starting to change, however, as prosecutors take more risks and juries become more aware of the complexities of human behavior.

“This case challenges our notions of what is force in a sexual relationship, what is lack of consent in a sexual relationship,” said Paul DerOhannesian, an Albany, New York, defense lawyer, former sex crimes prosecutor and author of a guide to sexual assault trials.

He followed the trial coverage and found it telling that one of the first questions from the jury involved the legal definition of “consent” and “forcible compulsion.” Vance initially declined to prosecute Weinstein when a model claimed he'd groped her in 2015. Facing criticism of the 2015 decision after waves of additional women came forward two years later, Vance ultimately took some of their allegations to trial.

One of the first witnesses at trial was an expert on victim behavior, who testified that it isn't unusual for sexual assault victims to continue communicating with their attackers. A decade ago, that type of expert testimony was rarely allowed.

The jury ultimately acquitted Weinstein of two of the most serious counts: one of first-degree rape, and a second charge that he was a sexual predator, linked to the testimony of actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein barged into her apartment and raped her in the early 1990s.

But Weinstein, 67, still faces the possibility of up to 29 years in prison. He's also facing separate charges in Los Angeles involving two more alleged sexual assault victims.

The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sex crimes unless they grant permission, as Sciorra did.

Criminal defense attorney Richard Kaplan said the New York case could both empower women to come forward and embolden prosecutors to take on tough cases.

“Now there is a roadmap on how you can win this kind of case,” he said, predicting more people would come forward.

""There's always the fear of coming forward, you know, going through a trial, getting beat up and humiliated and then not getting that verdict. Now that they see it can be done, I think more people will come forward and definitely empower the movement.”

Lawyer Carrie Goldberg represents Weinstein accuser Lucia Evans, whose complaint against him was initially part of the indictment, but Vance's office ultimately dropped her allegations from the case. While Goldberg faults Vance for not sticking with her client, she said the conviction is a “watershed moment” — and a long time coming.

“I hope that prosecutors, all over this country, and all over the world, look at this case and realize that rape trials can be won,"" Goldberg said, “and that these aren't just 'he said, she said' stories, but they're actually crimes that are winnable and need to be brought.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/weinstein-case-could-influence-other-sex-crime-prosecutions-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/weinstein-case-could-influence-other-sex-crime-prosecutions.html
250,25-2-20,Global mkts down with coronavirus,"World stock markets, including Indian indices, and oil prices tumbled on Monday with Milan and Seoul falling hardest on growing fears of a coronavirus pandemic, as gold hit a seven-year peak on safe-haven buying, dealers said.

Wall Street stocks plunged in early trading on Monday, joining a global equity selloff on mounting worries that the spread of the new coronavirus will derail global growth. About 10 minutes into trading, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 28,191.85, down 2.8 per cent or around 800 points. The broad-based S&P 500 dove 2.6 per cent to 3,252.23, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 3.1 per cent to 9,282.16.

Losses were widespread with the technology, financial and energy sectors all down significantly as news of the infections in Europe, West Asia and Southeast Asia triggered more drastic efforts to stop people from travelling.

“There is burgeoning fear that the shutdown effect that has hit China’s economy is going to take over elsewhere, dealing another blow to global growth, and earnings growth, prospects,” said Briefing.Com analyst Patrick O’Hare.

Indian stock benchmark Sensex on Monday sank nearly 807 points, the second biggest single-day fall this year, tracking sell-offs in global markets as coronavirus cases rose exponentially outside China.

Starting off on a weaker note, the BSE gauge plunged to a day’s low of 40,306.36 after being caught in a panic selling as investors kept fretting over reporting of a large number of new virus cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran.

While, the broader NSE Nifty sank 251.45 points or 2.08 per cent to 11,829.40.

In late morning deals, Milan’s stock market dived almost five per cent following reports of a fourth death amid the COVID-19 epidemic, an 84-year old man in the northern Lombardy region.

It was the third death in Lombardy, where villages have been sealed off and security measures enforced to stem the spread of the disease. Traders’ screens were awash with red elsewhere in Europe too, with Frankfurt falling 3.7 per cent, London losing 3.5 per cent, Madrid down 3.3 per cent and Paris shedding 3.8 per cent.

Brent oil prices slumped four per cent as the burgeoning crisis sparked global energy demand worries.

Conversely, on the London Bullion Market gold surged to USD 1,689.31 per ounce --- a level last seen in January 2013 --- as investors snapped up the precious metal as a safety measure amid the market turbulence.

“Fears over an escalation of the coronavirus outside of China have caused a major retreat in global markets and prompted wild swings in commodity prices,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.

“Italy’s lockdown, as the country tries to control the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe, has caused investors to panic about how business and society will be affected. A large spike in coronavirus cases in South Korea has also added to market concerns.

“The result is a large sell-off in equities with... Europe and Asia deeply in the red,” Mould added.

Seoul nosedived 3.9 per cent as South Korea announced a surge in COVID-19 infections, while Hong Kong erased 1.8 per cent but Shanghai retreated by only 0.3 per cent.

With the outbreak showing little sign of easing, investors are increasingly concerned it could have a much longer-term impact on the world economy. Traders had been broadly optimistic that the virus -- which has killed nearly 2,600 and infected 80,000 -- was being contained outside China but a spurt of infections and deaths in other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran has fanned fears of a global outbreak.

On Monday, South Korea said it had 833 cases, making it the world’s worst-hit country outside China, with seven people now dead.

251,25-2-20,Don't think being cautious will help us: Kohli's message to Pujara & Co,"Indian captain Virat Kohli has exhorted his batsmen to shun ultra-defensive approach heading into the must-win second Test against New Zealand, saying it ""never pays off"" on overseas tours.

India were thrashed by 10 wickets in the opening Test at the Basin Reverse, failing to go past 200 in both their innings on seam-friendly conditions.

""I think the language we use as a batting unit, that has to be correct. I don't think being cautious or wary will help because you might stop playing your shots,"" Kohli said after the loss.

In the second innings, the technically sound Cheteshwar Pujara consumed 81 balls for his 11 runs and Hanuma Vihari made 15 off 79, as the batting unit failed to generate any momentum.

Pujara, at one point, went 28 balls without a run, forcing Mayank Agarwal into playing loose shots and perish.

Not running the singles and waiting for a good ball that has ""your wicket"" written all over it is unacceptable to the India skipper.

""You will start doubting that if even singles are not coming in those conditions, what will you do? You are just waiting for when that good ball will come and you will be dismissed.

""(If) you have that acceptance that it's ok if you are out to a good ball, at least I don't think that way,"" said Kohli, making his stand clear on what he thought about the approach of some players.

The skipper, who is known to take the attack back to the opposition camp, wants some of his batsmen to follow his leads.

""If I see a situation, if it is a green wicket, then I try to play counter-attacking cricket so that I can take the team forward.

""If you don't succeed, then you have to accept that your thinking was correct, you tried but if it didn't come off, fair enough. There is no harm in accepting that.

""But I don't think a cautious approach ever pays off, especially away from home,"" the skipper was clear in his thought process.

He again stressed on the mental aspect of Test cricket where clarity of mind, at times, becomes more important than the technical nuances of batting.

""If we start thinking too much about the conditions, then you won't be able to focus on your batting. When you are not playing in your (home) conditions, the game becomes more mental.

""We can sometimes get into too many technical discussions. But if your mind is clear, then any condition looks easy.

""Then it doesn't seem as if a lot is happening with the ball or that the bowling attack is tough. We will follow the same positive frame of mind we have been in.

""We were not able to execute in this game but when we do so, we know what we can achieve,"" the confident skipper said ahead of the Christchurch challenge.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/don-t-think-being-cautious-will-help-us--kohli-s-message-to-pujara---co-2020-02-25.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/don-t-think-being-cautious-will-help-us--kohli-s-message-to-pujara---co.html
