The bandh call in Nuapada district was given by the Dalit Adhikar Manch in support of a Bharat Bandh call at the national level.

""We demand withdrawal of the anti-reservation ruling by the Supreme Court. The Government should also withdraw CAA and NRC,"" said Dalit Adhikar Manch president Kamal Charan Tandi, who led the strike at Khariar.

Hundreds of people gathered at Boden Chhak of Khariar town to express their support to the bandh. Former Chairman of Khariar NAC Nimai Tandi and others like advocate Jyotilal Banjare, Kishor Bag and Tejraj Bag were present.

Life was also badly affected in Balangir town and elsewhere in Balangir district due to the 12-hour Bharat Bandh.

Shops and other business establishments remained closed and both Government and private buses were off the roads. The agitators detained the Surat-Puri Express train for a while.

As it was Sunday, the Government offices did not come under the bandh purview. As it was Sunday, the Government offices did not come under the bandh purview.

The India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) had won the tender and assigned the Tricolor India, a Delhi-based firm, for repair work of the light and sound show. The project has almost been completed. The show would restart shortly after examining the technical part of the system, Odisha Tourism (Bhubaneswar) Officer Ajay Kumar Rout has informed.

The show displays epic scenes from Dhauli’s eventful past. In a collaboration of the State and Central Governments at an investment of Rs 6.6 crore, the show was launched at the Shanti Stupa (Peace Pagoda) on August 15 in 2015. A ticket for the show costs only Rs 25.

In a 35-minute show presented in three languages, English, Hindi and Odia, the audience witnesses a great story glorifying the Kalinga empire, feuds within the Mauryan empire, King Ashoka’s rise to power and his epic transformation from Chandashoka (cruel Ashoka) to Dharmashoka (Ashoka on path of religion). It also shows the gruesome Kalinga War and its morbid aftermath as well as King Ashoka’s remorse at the massive bloodbath.

7,24-2-20,Misplaced enthusiasm,"We should focus on the inked papers, determinants and agreements that fructify or don’t, pursuant to Trump’s visit and not on ‘walls’ which are of little consequence in policy

Walls” and the US President Donald Trump seem to have some sticky fixation that goes beyond the contentious Mexico-US border “wall”, the cost of building which would be about $25 billion. The recent case is the much humbler 400-metre-long and seven-feet high wall in Ahmedabad. Trump’s visit to this city has led to an estimated drain of `100 crore. The said amount will be spent on resurfacing and constructing new roads, on security imperatives, for transport and refreshments of over 1,00,000 guests in the “world’s largest stadium”, transplanting trees, flower arrangements, cultural extravaganza as also the “contentious” wall-column that seems to have caught public attention for its ostensible purpose.

Clearly, this wall-column hides a slum cluster of some 800 families that dot the unavoidable road stretch — from the airport to the main venue. It does have some security angle, given the heavy population density along the road, which typically necessitates a smooth passage for the presidential entourage. But it is essentially a “beautification” move that is neither unique to India nor necessarily unwarranted in the context of sprucing any location in preparation of such events. It is certainly a sad reflection of the reality that besets any urban dwelling. However, the efforts towards putting forth a “picture-perfect” view is par for course in any civic engagement.

The Government cannot be faulted for projecting a certain ambience and operational flawlessness, especially as the event is aimed to enhance “magnificence” of an emerging India (with the inauguration of the “world”s largest stadium). Putting the best foot forward in terms of visuals is the norm, not the exception. But it certainly is tantamount to glossing over some reality that always lurks in the midst of any city, be it Ahmedabad, New Delhi or even Washington, DC. State visits are necessarily and deliberately over-sanitised and bedecked from all aspects of the diverse reality that always exists in proximity. The majestic drive from the Rashtrapati Bhawan to the splendorous Janpath, all the way up to the India Gate, or even to other parts of Lutyens Delhi, does not reflect the socio-economic diversity, reality and depravity of some other parts of the capital that is spared the cavalcade of such dignitaries.

The recent phenomenon initiated by the Modi Government of showcasing different cities across the country (beyond Delhi) is novel as it willy-nilly facilitates a modicum of development therein. Many cities have benefitted from the spotlight — be it Varanasi during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s visit or Chennai, which hosted Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. Ahmedabad, which had previously hosted Xi and is again prepping for the next high-profile foreign visit, may be benefitting disproportionately from such visits along with the Prime Minister’s political constituency of Varanasi. But again, as the son-of-soil of Gujarat and the “people’s representative” of Varanasi, he thought he is entitled to that bias.

Similar “walls” had come up at various places in Beijing during the 2008 Olympics. China had strategically used this occasion to announce its “arrival” on the global scale. At that time, the Chinese had spent over $130 million to just restore and paint their building-temple complexes that dotted the five-mile axis on the main Olympic zone. Much later, Rio de Janeiro had to face much criticism for its “walls of shame” that sprung up to divide the shiny new Olympic city in 2016 from the typical Rio de Janeiro shanties that populated the city. A five mile long highway from the airport was covered with a 10 feet “wall” that was painted with welcoming murals. Everyone knew that it covered the inequities that beset the Brazilian reality.

Later, activists derided such moves as Potemkin displays and used the facade afforded by such “walls” to post expressions of cynicism and revolt against the Government. But then, the alternative of leaving the reality in its naked sores is, perhaps, equally untenable and unhelpful, considering the larger stakes and ambitions involved in hosting such events.

The Commonwealth Games (CWG) in Delhi in 2010 had led to thick bamboo “curtains” being planted around squalid clusters. Beyond the political blame-game, the event selectively and successfully highlighted New Delhi’s gleaming new airport, swanky metro, wide roads with streetlights — an important infrastructural change that did alter the face and perception of the city.

In India, outside Delhi, the architectural development and approach of the city centre from the airport is such that it would entail many improvisations, sprucing up and even the inevitable “walls” from an aesthetic, practical and security perspective. A lot of public emotions is unnecessarily raked with debates on such “walls”, which could be more meaningfully directed at the more substantive part of the visit ie, the agreements, compromises and exchanges that take place, which have a long-term impact in affecting people’s lives.

While there can never be a universally-agreed formula to determine how much is “too much” on such “walls,” common sense suggests that an element of beautification and related requirements does require a semblance of “cover-up.” On the contrary, the public eye on the ball should remain focussed of the inked papers, determinants and agreements (with Trump, even disagreements) that fructify or don’t, pursuant to this visit. Puerile debate and passion on “walls” have a tendency to hijack the larger narrative at stake.

It is, perhaps, more pertinent to criticise the waste-of-moment captured in the famous tea ceremony on the swings on the banks of Sabarmati in Ahmedabad when Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted Xi, when at that very moment, the People Liberation Army (PLA) was involved in a face-off with the Indian armed forces at the border. Charm offensives have limited “utility” and the classical Atithi Devo Bhava (Guest is God) has very limited resonance with hard-nosed businessmen like Trump or Xi.

Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai (India and China are brothers) of the 1950s is a lesson not to be forgotten as is the memory of the US Naval fleet sailing into the Bay of Bengal in the 1971 Indo-Pak war. The minor “walls” in 2020, though not very elegant, ought not to be the substantive concern of the day.

8,24-2-20,It’s showtime,"Trump is show business and in Modi, he has found a kindred soul. But will anything meaningful come out of his visit?

Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 US presidential election will most likely be repeated in November this year, considering the rate at which things are moving with the Democrats. It isn’t surprising, therefore, that Governments across the world, no matter what their personal views on Trump, hitch their wagons to his train. But unlike other pragmatic leaders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump appear to have a genuine bond, at least in public. The sight of the two men holding hands at the “Howdy Modi” event in Texas dominated world media. It gave heartburn to Opposition politicians not only in India but to other leaders across the world, too. While parents teach their children that they should not look at friendships as quid pro quo arrangements, the fact is that India and the US need to leverage the relationship of the two leaders into something much more concrete. Of course, the strengthening of India-US defence collaboration is something that started under former Prime Minister Vajpayee’s tenure and was reinforced by the UPA Government under Manmohan Singh. The Modi Government is building on that edifice. India will be buying more American hardware, including helicopters and air defence systems but the signature deal that Trump wants is in trade, which seems to be very far away at the moment. America wants access for its dairy products but India is understandably wary of cattle fed with hormones and animal matter over there. Besides, there’s also the need to protect Indian dairy farmers as we are the largest milk producer in the world. On the other hand, India wants access to American markets under favourable terms and the US has said that is only for “developing” nations and as a member of the G-20, India is hardly “developing.”

Irrespective of the failure to clinch a trade deal worth just a few dollars — one of the reasons why he is not bringing his key economic aide —Trump’s visit will also need the ruling Government to do some tough answering. His appearance today with Modi will take place under conditions when our Government has failed to pass the “religious” test. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which calls for a religion-based code of identity, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), have put the nation on the boil, with protests refusing to die even two months after they started. The Government’s principle of challenging the very Constitution that called for “equality” of all religions by considering some to be less “Indian” than others, has led to several nations, even the UN, expressing concern over its authoritarian ways. The lockdown and detentions in Kashmir have caused much discomfort in the US, even among key Senators, who fear a subvention of democracy in the name of “Hindu India.” Allegedly, Trump has vowed not to miss this opportunity to address the issue and is bound to raise it both during his public remarks and certainly in private. He needs Pakistan to keep the Taliban in leash and will need to be seen as pushing some margins in Kashmir. If only as an arm-twisting tactic or to rile up Modi’s insecurities at a time when he wants to be seen as a hefty global leader. But we are hard-nosed, too, about business. So treat this as spectator sport; one of the biggest shows that India has ever seen. We could all laugh about the “10 million people” gaffe but there will be more people than Trump has ever seen greeting him. But nothing of substance might come out of it.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it---s-showtime-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/it---s-showtime.html
9,24-2-20,Alliance pressure,"The Sena doesn’t want to burn bridges with either its State allies or the Central BJP leadership

Ever since the Maharashtra Aghadi Government assumed power as an unlikely coalition of divergent ideologies — the Shiv Sena, the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress — there has been much speculation about its lastability. Particularly, the BJP, which lost out the power race despite being the single largest party because of its refusal to accommodate the Shiv Sena, leaves no opportunity to rile up the inherent tensions in the alliance. Which is why Chief Minister and Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray’s flip-flop on some of the most contentious issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) feathers the split theory considering both the Congress and NCP are vociferously against them. But when both NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut have assured that the alliance government will last five years, it points to a rationalisation of politics at the grassroots level. So the three parties, realising each needs the other to stay relevant, have successfully dissociated the local contexts from the national one. And although they have been long-standing foes for over a quarter of a century over local issues, they are desperate to prop each other up to stay in governance.

The Shiv Sena, being ideologically on the Rightist end of the spectrum, cannot disown the moorings of what made it. It has already successfully rewired nationalism as a definition of Marathi pride. But not quite sure about its run in a convenient arrangement, it doesn’t want to exactly burn bridges with the top BJP leadership. To expect it to discard its Right-wing face completely would be wishful thinking. So though he had initial reservations on the CAA, Uddhav is siding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interpretation of it not being against Indian Muslims. The NCP and the Congress are against the exclusionary intent of the CAA, which violates the Constitutional guarantee of equality of all religions. Similarly, Uddhav, while vociferously opposing the profiling-based National Register of Citizens (NRC), is going soft on the NPR, although that is largely being seen as a precursor to the NRC. By walking the thin line, Uddhav is also publicising that he is with the Centre on issues that wouldn’t hurt his State. Also, he probably wants to peg the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) on development rather than bringing in the national debate on Hindutva versus secularism. The illusion of calm within the Aghadi was blown off earlier with the Sena favouring an NIA probe into the Elgar Parishad case and NCP-Congress expressing strong dissatisfaction over it. His visit to Ayodhya and the Veer Savarkar issue was hugely discomforting for his partners, too. But such uneasy equations will continue and each party will clench their teeth and fists, knowing the importance of keeping the Government intact. The Sena knows the role of the Congress and the NCP in getting it the chief ministership. The NCP knows it can encash its role as the mediator from both sides. Letting go of the Government and risking the desertion by its regional leadership are the last mistakes the Congress would want to commit. If the alliance is to stay though, it is in the best interest of all three parties to stick to the CMP and not peak out of turn. Else, they could fall to the hawkish plans of the BJP, which loses no opportunity to embarrass the Sena among its core voters. And if they do not budge, they will turn the BJP’s dream of the Aghadi crumbling under its own weight into a reality. Unless its back channel diplomacies are making the Sena leaders have second thoughts.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/alliance-pressure-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/alliance-pressure.html
10,24-2-20,A tricky road ahead,"India must ensure that it does not cede ground in dealings with US negotiators accompanying Trump and end up doing what doesn’t suit its national interests — an Iran yet again

As US President Donald Trump visits Ahmedabad-Agra-Delhi today, the spectrum of expectations remains variegated. Although the agenda of the bilateral meet seems holistic, with a 12-member delegation accompanying Trump during his two-day visit to India, apprehensions remain regarding the deliverables coming out of the trip.

Besides, there have been quite a few changes in Trump’s itinerary and agenda, signalling last- minute negotiations, disagreements and possibly discontent on either side, on the key issues of trade. The US has adopted a hard negotiating position vis-a-vis India and has signalled its unwillingness to retract from that stance. Among other things, the US has been reluctant to reinstate India’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) status and has continued to seek market access for its dairy products.

New Delhi has held out till now, but it is going to be difficult to predict the course of negotiations in the coming future. If nothing concrete comes out of bilateral trade talks in the few months following Trump’s visit to the country, he could further harden negotiating grounds for the US, as was the case with China.

Even though many have held that the centrepiece of this visit, a substantive/mini-trade deal between the US and India, may have collapsed, the political signalling of Trump’s visit is strong for both the countries. For India, it means a continuation of the growth in strength of Indo-US ties with each successive President.

The short, 36-hour stay of Trump is being utilised in the most effective way, in so far as signalling is concerned. The Ahmedabad “Namaste Trump” event, Agra’s Taj Mahal stopover and the critically-decisive talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump along with the visit to the Raj Ghat, tie concrete deliverables with cultural symbolism.

For the US, as the domestic primaries are heating up, running up to the presidential elections at the end of the year, the timing and the targetted constituency of the Indian-Americans as vote bank, could draw significant advantages for the Republican Party and the Trump administration.

Trump’s tweet that, “We’re not treated very well by India”, but that he happens to “like Prime Minister Modi a lot” underscores the comfortable-uncomfortability of this visit. Both leaders realise the value of each other’s partnership in times when China is not the same option for partnership for either country as they are for each other.

Trump’s declaration that he is “saving the big deal” with India for later and he “does not know” if it will be done before the presidential election in November, signals two things: First, that the ongoing negotiations on trade are a hard bargain for either side and that neither party is willing to give concessions or cede positions. Second, both sides have desisted from earmarking a deadline for the finalisation of these negotiations, which speaks of the complex nature of the consultations involved.

In the end, the lack of availability of an immediate trade deal to sign for Trump may not be a pressing irritant. India’s trade surplus with the US has significantly come down in the last few years owing to energy imports from it, which is the sixth-largest source of crude oil imports for the country currently. Besides, the US continues to be India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade expected to cross $150 billion for the first time this year.

In the absence of any mega trade deals, both sides will tether the projection of successful US-India bilateral relations to defence deals, security cooperation and a commonly-visualised regional order in the Indo-Pacific. As such, defence deals are likely to be the highlight of the visit. In particular, the $2.6 billion deal to buy 24 Seahawk helicopters from American defence manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corporation is going to capture headlines.

The Cabinet Committee on Security headed by Modi recently cleared the purchase of the 24 helicopters and the deal is going to benefit India as these platforms are expected to boost the Navy’s anti-submarine warfare operations — an emerging area of maritime cooperation with the US and a critical component of the Indo-Pacific security resolve. At the level of the regional order in Asia, two issues will be very critical during this visit. The Trump administration could nudge New Delhi to play a larger and stronger regional role in the Indo-Pacific region.

First, the role that New Delhi would play in the Indo-Pacific region is of utmost importance to Washington. For a long time, the US and other partners of the Quadrilateral security grouping view India as a “dithering” member. The US views itself as having taken quite a few steps in the Indo-Pacific that haven’t been well reciprocated through actions by India. Among them, the renaming of the Indo-Pacific Command to pragmatically engage India directly in all matters relating to the Indo-Pacific. Washington views New Delhi as a key player in the US’ strategy in the Indo-Pacific.

The Raisina Dialogue held in January in New Delhi witnessed an important development regarding the Indo-US joint vision in the Indo-Pacific. The US moved to correct a potential disconnection in the Indo-US common view by declaring that its own vision in the Indo-Pacific now includes the Gulf region, which the US’ Indo-Pacific Strategy Report excluded initially. This small but significant change builds a common platform to advance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region for both the countries. However, even as both countries try to find common ground in the Indo-Pacific to work with, New Delhi should try to emphasise certain uncompromising positions of geopolitics in this vast region. India’s own relation with Iran has to be worked up, despite pressures from Washington and significant cuts in oil imports from Tehran.

India should deftly employ strategic hedging to work with both Iran and the US. While New Delhi knows that for a middle power like it, balancing between two major players — the US and China — is going to be much easier than balancing between a major force and a regionally-strong yet sub-middle power like Iran. The real challenge of diplomacy for India lies in its ability to navigate successfully without creating hostilities, especially in times when partisan geopolitics has threatened to become a diplomatic norm, beckoning the polarisation that characterised half a century before the current one.

In the continental dimensions of the Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan is going to be a critically-important factor given the timing of domestic politics in that country, China’s increasing role in Kabul and the US withdrawal lined up. Trump is a known pusher for India’s greater role in Afghanistan and this visit could see a diplomatic nudge to New Delhi to change its role in Afghanistan, if not increase it. President Ghani’s return to power in Afghanistan, the US’ deal with Taliban to be signed on February 29 and its subsequent withdrawal could be used as diplomatic tropes for India to increase its security role in Afghanistan.

India should be wary that it does not cede ground in dealings with the hard negotiators accompanying Trump and end up doing what doesn’t suit its national interests — an Iran yet again. Even if nothing much comes out of the upcoming Trump visit, India should prepare for uncompromising negotiations. sYet, the visit has the potential to catapult bilateral ties to a new level and set new grounds for engagements in the future. If Modi has initiated the culture of “informal talks” with China, with the US it is the “grand events” that mark a distinct note in bilateral relations. As such, the Ahmedabad event in the cricket stadium further pushes the idea of a large gathering to welcome visiting Heads of State towards a concrete diplomatic norm.

11,24-2-20,Mitigate India’s water stress,"The Govt should come up with a comprehensive roadmap and the States have to step up their efforts for successfully achieving the JJM target

India is a water stressed nation with per capita water availability of about 1,544 cubic metres. It has been ranked 13th among 17 extremely water-stressed countries as listed by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas released by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The country, closely followed by neighbouring Pakistan, was under “extremely high” levels of baseline water stress. As many as 12 of the 17 water stressed countries were from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the document warned that climate change may complicate the crisis in coming years.

A region is said to be water-stressed when the demand exceeds the available volume of water or when poor quality restricts its use. Alarmingly, both groundwater and surface water in the country are extremely exploited. In a grim reflection of the situation in the country, groundwater levels declined by more than eight centimetres per year between 1990 and 2014 in northern India.

The rapidly declining per capita water share, source vulnerability and growing contamination of groundwater are some of the causes for serious concern India. Both surface and groundwater resources are highly exploited and figures released by the Ministry of Jal Shakti paint a dismal picture. About 1,186 of 6,881 groundwater “assessment units” are categorised as over-exploited. It has been reported that India extracts more groundwater than China and the US combined. Also, the latest report of the Niti Aayog mentions that 21 cities of the country will exhaust their groundwater resources soon. Of the States and Union Territories, Chandigarh was the most water-stressed, followed by Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

To address these concerns, the Union Government launched the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) which promises water to every household in the country by 2024. In the Union Budget 2020, under the head of Wellness, Water and Sanitation scheme, (about Rs 3.60 lakh crore was approved earlier for the JJM) Rs 11,500 crore has been allocated for 2020-2021. The main focus this time will be on source sustainability and augmentation. Various water conservation measures like rainwater harvesting, renovation or rejuvenation of tanks and lakes, reuse of waste water, development of recharge structures, desalination along with watershed development and intensive afforestation will also be undertaken. These measures will not only enhance the water availability of the country but also ensure sustainability of the available resource. This is a much appreciated step as it was the need of the hour. The Government’s plan is a well-thought-out approach which will focus on the source which is needed for sustainable management of the resource.

However, the allocated Budget for 2020-21 is just 15 per cent higher than the previous year’s Budget that was around Rs 10,000 crore (the allocation for 2019-20 was almost double of that for 2018-19). It is an ambitious target to be achieved in the next five years, given that previously the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (currently subsumed under the JJM) aimed at providing drinking water supply in rural areas by 2030 at an estimated cost of Rs 6 lakh crore. But the JJM has low Budget allocations with a shorter timeline. Also, the allocation this year is just about three per cent of the total Budget sanctioned for the scheme, given that the first year is critical to impart momentum to this flagship programme. Also, there are lessons to be learnt from past programmes such as the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) which has now been subsumed under the JJM.

The target under the NRDWP was to provide piped water tap connections to 35 per cent of rural households by 2017 but the latest figures of 2019 showed that the connections have only reached around 18 per cent of the households. The performance of NRDWP was not very satisfactory and some of the reasons were that the contribution of States was on the lower side. Also, some States faced paucity of funds for the piped water scheme. Telangana had to borrow money from banks to operationalise its mission for piped drinking water supply from surface water sources (Mission Bhagiratha). Another key factor was that the allocated amount usually remained unspent because of late submission of proposals and the long time taken for implementation of the sanctioned projects.

The Government should come up with a comprehensive road map and the States have to step up their efforts for successfully achieving the mission target. Perhaps 2020 is a crucial year for both the Centre and the State Governments to overcome the challenges and expedite the implementation process.

(Grover is Fellow and Seth is Research Associate, Water Resources, TERI) India is a water stressed nation with per capita water availability of about 1,544 cubic metres. It has been ranked 13th among 17 extremely water-stressed countries as listed by the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas released by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The country, closely followed by neighbouring Pakistan, was under “extremely high” levels of baseline water stress. As many as 12 of the 17 water stressed countries were from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the document warned that climate change may complicate the crisis in coming years.

A region is said to be water-stressed when the demand exceeds the available volume of water or when poor quality restricts its use. Alarmingly, both groundwater and surface water in the country are extremely exploited. In a grim reflection of the situation in the country, groundwater levels declined by more than eight centimetres per year between 1990 and 2014 in northern India.

The rapidly declining per capita water share, source vulnerability and growing contamination of groundwater are some of the causes for serious concern India. Both surface and groundwater resources are highly exploited and figures released by the Ministry of Jal Shakti paint a dismal picture. About 1,186 of 6,881 groundwater “assessment units” are categorised as over-exploited. It has been reported that India extracts more groundwater than China and the US combined. Also, the latest report of the Niti Aayog mentions that 21 cities of the country will exhaust their groundwater resources soon. Of the States and Union Territories, Chandigarh was the most water-stressed, followed by Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

The main focus this time will be on source sustainability and augmentation. Various water conservation measures like rainwater harvesting, renovation or rejuvenation of tanks and lakes, reuse of waste water, development of recharge structures, desalination along with watershed development and intensive afforestation will also be undertaken.

12,24-2-20,The monster that they created still lurks,"The Reagan Govt spent millions on printing textbooks propagating jihad and disseminating them in Pak madrasas and schools in the 80s

In 1992, while working as a reporter for an English-language weekly in Karachi, I was assigned a feature on certain books that were part of the curriculum in schools operating in two low-income areas of the city.

These were not Government schools. They were largely run and funded by “charity organisations”, two of which were eventually banned by the Government in 2003. I managed to acquire two Urdu textbooks that were being taught to students between the ages of eight and 12. In simple Urdu, the books had chapters on jihad, infidels, obscenity and so on. When I asked an active member of one of the charity organisations about the books, he told me the tomes were not originally published in Pakistan. To my astonishment, the books were actually reprints of textbooks that were first authored and printed in the US in the early and mid-1980s. They were then shipped to Pakistan, where they were distributed to various schools and madrasas countrywide and to madrasas and schools in the villages of Afghanistan near the Pak-Afghan border. This was done during the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan between 1980 and 1988. Afghan and Arab insurgents were stationed in Pakistan and sustained by financial aid and support from the US and Saudi Arabia.

In the March 23, 2002 issue of The Washington Post, Joe Stephens and David Ottaway write that, during the insurgency, Ronald Reagan’s Government spent millions on the printing of textbooks (in Pashto, Dari and Urdu) “filled with violent images and militant teachings, as part of covert attempts to spur resistance to the Soviet occupation.” These books were sent to Pakistan with the billions of dollars’ worth of “aid” that Pakistan received from the US to facilitate the insurgency.

Stephens and Ottaway add that the books “were filled with talk of holy war and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines.” After the Soviet forces left the region, in the late 1980s, these books became part of the Afghan school system’s core curriculum. Stephen and Ottaway write that the same books were also used by the violent Taliban regime that came to power in Kabul in 1996.

In 2002, just months after the US forces ousted the Taliban from power, an American foreign aid official stated that a major “scrubbing operation” in Pakistan and Afghanistan had been launched “to purge from the books all references to killing.” This was briefly covered by a 2002 issue of Daily News, the now defunct Pakistani English newspaper. The reporter had added that, before “scrubbing” the books that it had circulated, the US was the first non-Muslim power to have propagated “holy war” among Muslims to undermine a “common enemy”. This is not correct.

The first to do so was Germany. On October 14, 1914, a senior cleric in Istanbul — which at the time was the capital of the Ottoman Empire — declared a “holy war” against Britain, France, Russia and Serbia. He did this with the approval of the Ottoman Sultan and on the behest of Germany.

The bankrupt empire had decided to become an ally of Germany during World War-I. The Sultan accepted a hefty payment from Germany to bolster the ailing Ottoman economy. He also saw the alliance as an opportunity for the empire to regain the regions that it had lost in the 19th century and onwards.

In the April 2011 issue of the journal War in History, historian Mustafa Aksakal writes that, to anti-German forces, the Ottoman jihad proclamation was understood as “a linchpin of the German scheme to revolutionise Muslim populations in territories of Germany’s enemies.”

According to Aksakal, the German lawyer, historian and archeologist Max von Oppenheim was one of the main architects of the “scheme.” A propaganda organisation, the Nachrichtenstelle für den Orient (The Intelligence Bureau for the East), headquartered in Berlin, produced and then circulated jihadist literature among the Muslims of Asian and African territories held by the British. The two most prominent texts in this context were a booklet by Jewish scholar and founder of Modern Islamic Studies in Germany, Eugen Mittwoch and a 1915 brochure by the Muslim scholar Salih Ash-Sharif Al-Tunisi. According to Samuel Krug, in his essay for the research project Making War, Mapping Europe, the booklet contextualised jihad according to contemporary politics, whereas Tunisi’s brochure explained it as a binding theological concept. Both texts were published in Berlin by the German Society of Islamic Studies.

The fallouts of the two schemes, one by Germany and the other by the US, were completely different. Due to the fact that Germany and the Ottomans badly lost the war, secular Muslim nationalism and hybrid Leftist ideas completely sidelined the jihadist fervour roused by German propaganda. German and Ottoman defeats strengthened secular nationalist narratives in Muslim countries and discarded theocratic ideas.

On the other hand, as British author Jonathan Steele demonstrates in his 2011 book, Ghosts of Afghanistan, even though it was the collapsing Soviet economy that forced Soviet forces to leave Afghanistan and then the stopping of aid to the Government that it left behind in Kabul, the US and Pakistan spun the Soviet departure to mean a “victory of faith against communism.” It was this perception that saw militant propaganda devised by the US to linger in the region. No wonder then, when the US forces invaded Kabul to topple the Taliban regime in 2001, they found madrasas still using textbooks that the US had circulated in the 1980s. What’s more, according to a December 2014 report in The Washington Post, despite the fact that, ever since 2002 ,Unicef in Afghanistan destroyed almost half a million of these books, many were still being taught to children in areas under the control of Taliban insurgents.

In 2015, Pakistani soldiers found similar textbooks in seminaries and schools in areas that were once dominated by extremist groups. These groups were ousted through a military operation. In other words, until 2015, textbooks authored and published in the US in the 1980s to glorify “holy war” in the minds of young Muslims were still being used in various seminaries and schools of the region.

Some commentators suspect many of these tomes are still out there. And they are expected to make a full comeback if (and/or when) the Taliban manage to return to power after the imminent departure of US forces.

13,24-2-20,High command’s apathy proves State Cong dear,"The Congress high command’s handling of the affairs of the Odisha party unit appears to be strange and self-destructing for the organisation in the State. In fact, it seems the party national leadership hardly bothers about revival of Congress in the State.

The party had the worst-ever show in the last elections with its number of members in the 147-seat Legislature Assembly dwindling to below two digits, that is, nine and it losing its main Opposition status to the BJP. It had been expected that the party under the stewardship of a senor-most leader, Niranjan Patnaik, would do much better. But that never happened. And to add to the party’s misery, Patnaik himself got defeated in both the seats he contested from.

As a result, Patnaik tendered his resignation as the Pradesh Congress Committee president; but even after nine long years, the AICC is yet to take a decision on his replacement. If he has to be continued in the post, the high command has to make an announcement to that effect and tell the party rank and file that no dissidence will be tolerated at all. But there is no such communication from New Delhi.

Of course, AICC in-charge of Odisha Jitendra Singh has, meanwhile, stated that Patnaik would continue as the PCC chief, but that is having no serious bearing among the cadres, who look forward to party president Sonia Gandhi’s fiat in this regard.

No wonder, a large section of the party’s leaders in the State has been camping in Delhi from time to time and pressing for Patnaik’s ouster from the leadership. The factionalism has had its reflections recently at places like Puri and Bhadrak with rival groups coming to blows and party workers being hospitalised. The shows of group clashes are even taking place in the presence of Jitendra Singh and Patnaik together.

The fact is the State Congress cannot come out of its present moribund condition without a firm intervention by the high command keeping in view that panchayat and cooperative bodies’ elections are approaching. There is now a demand in some quarters for a younger leader like Cuttack MLA Mohammed Moquim to take over the PCC reins. A new leader or Patnaik’s continuance, whatever, Sonia Gandhi has to act fast to save and activate the demoralised State party organisation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/high-command---s-apathy-proves-state-cong-dear.html

According to reports, the unidentified miscreants broke into the house at around 2 am when the family members were sleeping. They first attacked the house owner’s elder son Sabyasachi Naik with an iron rod and also threatened him brandishing a gun. Then, they decamped with over 30 grams of gold, cash of Rs 40,000 and other valuables.

“They barged into the house and hit my father with a rod. Hearing him scream, I rushed out of my room. As I tried to intervene, they placed a gun on my head threatening to kill me. Then, they locked us in a room and fled with the money and valuables,” said Sabyasachi.

“Besides gold and cash, they also looted ATM and credit cards. To ensure that we couldn’t contact anyone for help and avoid their detention, the dacoits snatched our mobile phones, tabs and damaged the SIM slots. They also took my car keys,” he added.

Sabyasachi’s mother Susama said that before fleeing, the goons threatened them of dire consequences if they informed police about the incident. On receiving information, police reached the spot and began an investigation into the crime.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/armed-men-loot-cash--gold-from-house-at-gunpoint.html

“The Raigarh police served me a notice asking for appearance before them for probe into the double murder case for which my father has been booked, a day after I and my cousin visited the police station to meet my father. They asked me to appear before them today when the vehicular traffic is completely disrupted due to the Bharat Bandh. They are conspiring to drag me into the case to harass my family,” alleged Sai’s son.

“The year when the murder took place, I was a third year student at ITR. I was served notice suspecting my involvement in the murder case,” he said terming the allegation by the Chhattisgarh police against his father as ‘conspiracy’.

“The police have threatened my father that they will not leave him till he admits to have committed the crime. They are harassing him mentally.

18,24-2-20,"2nd evening: Samarpan showcases Salabega, Kabir","The second evening of the annual Samarpan music festival hosted here at the Rabindra Mandap here on Saturday by the Bhubaneswar Music Circle showcased songs of two Muslim poets who are loved, revered and celebrated by Hindus the most over several centuries. They were Odisha’s very own Salabega, an ardent devotee of Lord Jagannath who lived in 17th century and has been a household name for the people of Odisha, and Kabir, the 15th-century saint-poet whom the Hindus and Muslims love to claim as their own.

“Bhajans of Bhakta Salabega”, the first segment of the evening was, obviously, the greater attraction for the audience. And eminent singer-composer Guru Ramahari Das was the right choice to render justice to the Salabega songs and the sentiment of the people attached to the songs. Gifted with a unique voice that traversed between the highest and the lowest octaves with effortless ease, words got wings with emotions as he sanga number of songs of the devotee-poet.

With his longtime collaborator Guru Dhaneswar Swain on mardal and fantastic flutist Abhiram Nanda as members of his orchestra, the concert was a feast to the ears of the connoisseurs.

“Kabir Vani”, the other segment, was presented by Mooralala Marvada from Kutch in Gujarat. Traditionally sung in the villages of Malwa region that stretches from western Madhya Pradesh covering parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat in India and beyond into Sindh in Pakistan, Kabir Vani has been the forte of Mooralala who is a Sufi folk singer from Janana village of Kutch and who has been featured as a singer in the Gujarati film ‘Hellaro’.

“I belong to the 11th generation of the Meghwal singers of the village in Gujarat's Kutch district. I sing the poetry of Kabir, Mirabai, Ravidas and many more but Kabir continues to be my most favourite,” stated the singer showing his 103-years-old Sitar with much pride and joy that he was playing while singing.

His concert showed how explaining the songs of Kabir are as important as singing the songs in the tradition of the folk music that he hailed from. Mooralala was accompanied by Bhikabhai Budhabhai Harijan on, Manjira, Marvada Mohan Govind on Gada Gamela (percussion) and Sukhdev Lakhabhai Harijan on Jhanj.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2nd-evening--samarpan-showcases-salabega--kabir.html

22,24-2-20,"‘Agri, edu, disaster infra should’ve got more’","The Odisha Budget and Accountability Centre (OBAC) and the Orissa Economics Association (OEC) presented an in-depth analysis of the Odisha Budget 2020-21 here on Saturday.

The State Budget 2020-21 is pegged at Rs1, 50,000 crores, which is 11 per cent higher than the 2019-20 Budget. The total outlay for this year’s budget is proposed to be financed mainly through revenue receipts of Rs1, 24,300 crore and borrowing and other receipts of Rs 25,700 crore.

Experts pointed out that the Odisha Government, contrary to the popular perception, is borrowing less than what it could without any threat to sustainability.

The State’s working age population is expected to cross 3 crore in 2021 as per the Odisha Economic Survey 2019-20. Along with the growing demand for creation of employment opportunities, safe housing for all and making agriculture and allied activities a viable source of livelihood are the stated policy directions and priorities of the Government for financial year 2020-21, they said.

The share of State’s own revenue in total revenue receipts in the Budget has increased by 2 percentage points in this year’s budget. However, stronger effort is required to mobilize revenue from own sources, they said, adding that the allocation of only 11 per cent of its total agriculture budget towards all rainfed sensitive schemes is a matter of concern considering the climate related risks in the State and doubling farmer’s income.

As the gap between the budget estimates and actual expenditure in FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19 is widening, experts have raised questions on ‘budget credibility’ as well. The gap is more persistent in the major departments related to agriculture and social sectors.

On budget management and scheme implementation front, one of the major challenges could be the huge vacancies in all levels across departments, especially in the social sectors, they said.

“State share in Cetral taxes and grants in aid from the Center contribute as much as 60 per cent of the overall receipts by Odisha and hence, any shortfall to affect resource availability,” said Joint Secretary, Finance, Satyapriya Rath.

Former Chairperson of the Odisha Public Service Commission, Vivek Pattnaik said, “We should also prioritise marginal and small farmers and agriculrtural labourers since the agriculture is the backbone of our economy.”

Prof Bhagabat Patra said efficiency- oriented Government schemes were need of the hour.

Delhi- based Center for Budget and Governance Accountability ED Subrat Das said the State Budget needed to give much greater priority to higher education, health and urban sanitation, while mentor and co-founder of CYSD Jagadananda sought strengthening of primary education system and disaster-resilient rural infrastructure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---agri--edu--disaster-infra-should---ve-got-more---.html

The deceased were identified as Dayanidhi Khuntia, Chinmay Khuntia and Kamesh Singh, residents of Jamadhara village under the Jajpur Sadar police station.

They were working at the Lotus Level India, a cotton mill in Ahmedabad since past three years. The fire broke out engulfing the factory in which they were engaged for work. They were charred to death.

Chinmay Khuntia had recently visited the village and gone back to Ahmedabad over a week back.

“We received the sad news yesterday. The labourers from this village died. Two persons from the village who were staying with them informed us about the mishap. But we have no information about the steps being taken by the local administration in Gujarat to send the bodies to their native place,” said Jamadhara Naib Sarpanch Mirza Anzaru Islam.

The villagers urged The Odisha Government for steps to bring the bodies from Gujarat and financial assistance under the State’s labour law.

“As the families of the deceased persons are living in extreme poverty, we want the State Government to provide them financial assistance under the State’s labour law. We also demand that the district administration take initiative to bring the bodies from Ahmedabad,” Anzaru Islam said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/3-jajpur-labourers-die-in-gujarat-mill-fire.html

41,24-2-20,Challenges tough for Sarada as R’kela BJD chief,"Rourkela MLA Sarada Prasad Nayak has won the confidence of BJD supremo and CM Naveen Patnaik for which he was been nominated as president of BJD Rourkela district unit.

The Sundargarh BJD District Orgnisational Committee has been again bifurcated with a separate Rourkela district unit. This arrangement was there from 2004 to 2017. In 2017, the two units were merged. But political pundits feel Nayak has to face many challenges ahead in Rourkela.

After May 29, 2012 midnight coup, allegedly staged by former BJD strategist and former Rajya Sabha MP late Pyarimohan Mohapatra against Patnaik, in which Nayak among a few leaders allegedly were Mohapatra’s close confidants, CM Patnaik had removed Nayak from his Cabinet giving a very negative remarks on him. Despite this, due to his patience and hard work over the years, Nayak managed to win back the faith of Patnaik when he got the BJD ticket for Rourkela Assembly seat in 2014.

Again, despite losing the election, Patnaik rehabilitated him as Chairman, Rourkela Development Authority and in 2017 assigned the responsibility of working president of party’s Sundargarh District Committee. Again in 2019, despite stiff challenges, Nayak got party ticket and was elected from Rourkela seat. Patnaik also appointed him as the President, Sundargarh District Planning Board and now assigned as president of BJD Rourkela unit.

It was nonetheless tough for Nayak to regain confidence of his boss, but after he was made the party chief of Rourkela unit, his challenges would be even tougher.

Nayak’s sour equation with many frontline leaders of the party here is an issue. This was manifest during 2019 election ticket allotment and campaign time. Many of Nayak’s loyals applied for ticket. Even a potential female leader Minati Debta filed nomination as an independent and after the interference of the top leaders in Bhubaneswar, she withdrew but so far, she has not been rehabilitated by the party in any glorified post.

Similarly, another prominent female leader Rashmibala Mishra who had come to politics and became Rourkela Municipality Chairperson with the blessing of Nayak is now a key critic of Nayak. Senior leader Anand Mohanty who was once upon a time an ardent supporter of Nayak and was party district chief for a long period of 13 years continuously is now criticising Nayak. Besides he was also a strong aspirant for the party’s district chief.

Another factor is Raghunathpalli MLA Subrat Tarai. It is an open secret that since last many years both Nayak and Tarai are not in good terms. Nayak is also not carrying good rapport with many party leaders and mass organisation leaders of all the four Assembly segments like Rourkela, Raghunathpalli, Biramitrapur and Bonai.

The immediate tough challenges for Nayak are the elections to the Rourkela Municipal Corporation, Biramitrapur Municipality, Rourkela Urban Cooperative Bank Director post and selection of Rourkela Development Authority chief. But observers are of the opinion that Nayak with his good organisational skill can manage them with ease.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/challenges-tough-for-sarada-as-r---kela-bjd-chief.html

47,24-2-20,Bhagavad Gita —A Manual of Holistic Well-being,"Bhagavad Gita is one of the best known religious classic and a highly regarded philosophical treatise. At the same time, it can also be called a perfect guide for healthy and happy living ; and a panacea for all lifestyle disorders. Through a dialogue between Arjuna and Lord Krishna, it has offered a great insight into different aspects of human life. It has also been explained in great detail as to how can one have a healthy body and a happy mind.

Krishna begins his teachings with shloka 2.11 wherein he has assured mankind that there was no cause for grief. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. It implies that any sorrow was uncalled for. Contentment was the natural state of one’s being. Leading a healthy and happy life was everyone’s right.

Essential to good health is proper diet. In shlokas from 17.7 to 17.10, Krishna has described various kinds of foods and their effects. Corresponding to the three modes of material nature, food is of three kinds. The foods which promote life, vitality, strength, health and cheerfulness ; and which are nourishing, wholesome and pleasing to the heart - such foods are dear to those who are in the mode of goodness (sattvic persons).

The foods that are bitter, sour, saltish, exceedingly hot, pungent, harsh and burning ; and which produce pain, grief and disease are dear to those who are in the mode of passion (rajasic persons). The food which is unclean, half cooked, tasteless, producing an unpleasant smell, stale and which consists of remnants eaten by others - such food is dear to those who are in the mode of ignorance (tamasic persons).

The foods in the mode of goodness promote strength and vitality, those in the mode of passion cause distress and disease ; and those in the mode of ignorance result in misery.

As the human body is made of food, quality of the food taken is of utmost importance. The kind of diet one takes has a great influence on one’s overall personality. One must, therefore, eat not only to gratify one’s tongue ; but also for the enhancement of his vital energy. And anything one eats must first be offered to the Supreme Lord.

Not only quality, but also the quantity of food taken is very important for good health. In shlokas 6.16 and 6.17, it has been advised that one should be regulated in eating, sleeping, waking and recreation. In other words, over indulgence in or total abstinence from any of these activities is harmful to the health. Moderation is the key to happy living. One must learn to exercise restraint.

Gita has also highlighted the importance of action. In shloka 3.8, it has been stated that without action, one cannot even maintain one’s physical body. By action, Krishna does not mean any action. In shloka 4.17, he says that one has to understand as to what is right action, what is wrong action ; and also what is inaction. In the context of healthy living, it means that one should involve himself in those activities which promote good health ; and must avoid those which are harmful.

To put it in simple words, for maintaining good physical health, one must have a balanced and nutritious diet and exercise regularly. Junk food, over-eating, excessive fasting and sedentary lifestyle must be eschewed.

Physical health is only one aspect of overall well-being. Equally important, if not more, is the mental health. Only a knowledgeable, relaxed and stable mind can handle effectively the physical viruses and emotional stresses of life. Gita has explained in detail as to how can such a serene and disciplined mind be obtained.

Through multiple shlokas, it has been elaborated as to how one can overcome fear, greed, anger, envy, anxiety ; and grief. How can one curb the lust, through control of the senses. How can one cultivate equanimity of mind. How can one remain content in himself. How can one attain perfect calmness of mind. How can one be free from doubt ; and gain self-confidence. Once such a discipline of the mind is obtained, one gets rid of self-indulgent habits through the power of his mind.

Gita has also recommend pranayma and meditation for blissful living. Regulation of the breath and concentration of the mind brings cheerfulness. One becomes joyful from within.

Apart from the body and the mind, Gita has thrown ample light on the metaphysical concept of jeevatman, the self. When one understands that his true nature is the self, which is the imperishable and eternal reality behind his physical existence, then he transcends all sufferings associated with the body and the mind. He overcomes the fear of old age and death. He can then appreciate the real meaning and purpose of life.

With such a strong body, serene mind and pure soul, one can effectively cope up with any stressful situation. No lifestyle disorder or psychosomatic disease can impact him for long. He can, thus, lead a healthy and happy life. Spiritual lifestyle is a blissful lifestyle.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bhagavad-gita----a-manual-of-holistic-well-being.html

49,24-2-20,Focus on boosting sports infra at local level: Sandeep Singh,"Haryana Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Sandeep Singh on Sunday said emphasis has been laid on constructing a playing field in every village as it may not be useful to build a stadium at block or district level and spend large amount of money on its maintenance.

""Players need well-maintained playing field for their regular practice and necessary facilities including proper diet on regular basis. Keeping this in view, government has increased the diet-allowance of sportspersons participating in state and national-level school sports competitions.” he said.

Talking to The Pioneer, the Sports Minister said, “Our focus now is to make Haryana a hub for sports training and talent spotting in the future. Big Sports stadium worth crores of rupees can’t be built everywhere. But we can build playground (some lakhs) for each village. Steps have been taken to provide them facilities of playground in their neighbour areas.”

Singh said that emphasis is also laid on training of players. In developed countries like Australia, New Zealand and other countries, they focus on training of players by investing big amount.

As international level tournament is being organised once in five years in a big stadium but cost of maintenance is very huge.

“Taking note of it, we have decided to focus on building infrastructure and facilities as well as training for players rather than spending huge money first constructing big stadium and its maintenance later on. We have sufficient number of stadiums in the State and no need to construct more big stadiums as of now.” he added.

The former Hockey star said that youths are encouraged to choose game as per their interest and strength and district officers of department of Sports and Youth Affairs have been directed to provide facilities to sportsmen based on their need. He said all sports are being promoted in the State and public representatives have been asked to design playground based on need of the players in their respective areas.

“We have come up with an ambitious plan for popularising sports by creating sports infrastructure as well as adequate facilities for sportsmen at the village level. Our Government is committed to building a playing field in every village,"" he said, pointing out that playground would be developed based on local youth’s choice and their strength on the games like football, hockey, badminton, kabbadi, kho-kho, volleyball, archery, basketball, handball and tennis as well as depending on the area provided by the local residents.

Legislators can submit proposal after the approval on construction of playground by the gram sabha and the gram panchayat. “After approval from the gram panchayat, the concerned technical assistant / junior engineer will prepare an estimate of the work as per drawing / design / verification of the playfield. The progress and quality will be the responsibility of the officers concerned of sports and youth affairs department, he added.

102 SPORTS NURSERIES SHUT DOWN AFTER BEING FOUND FAKE

The Sports Minister said that the State Government provides several facilities for sportsmen in sports nurseries. In course of recent inspection in some sports nurseries like archery, athletics, boxing, football, handball, kabaddi or kho-kho, swimming volleyball among others, it was found that genuine sportsmen have not been enrolled.

An inquiry was conducted by the department officers concerned and based on reports, 102 sports nurseries were shutdown in the State. “Permission for opening sports nurseries is being given to those who meet the necessary guidelines. Transparency is being maintained in giving permission to open sports nursery,” he said, pointing out that sports nurseries have been set up in the State to impart training to schoolchildren for different sports so that budding sportspersons could enhance their skills and compete in all national and international sports events.

ONLY WOMEN COACHES WILL TRAIN FEMALE SPORTS PERSONS

Due to some complaints in the recent past of sexual harassment against coaches, the Minister said that from now on, only women coaches would train female sportspersons in the state-run academies. Haryana’s women athletes, wrestlers, boxers, shooters and, most recently, a teenaged cricketer have earned laurels for the country. They will be given the best possible coaching to ensure that they become the best they can.

“The women players will feel more secure if they have women coaches and managers and their families too will be less anxious during their travel,” he added.

He said complaints regarding indiscipline among some players and coaches are being received, which was unacceptable. ""A flying squad has been set up to check attendance of trainers at stadiums, sports centres and nurseries,"" he said, adding that it would be ensured that outsiders were not allowed to disturb the training of players.

49 SPORTS PERSONS OFFERED GOVT JOBS

Singh said each year Haryana players get medals at national and international level and they are offered jobs depending on the criteria.

He said 49 sportspersons have been offered Government jobs under Haryana Outstanding Sportspersons (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2018 and cash awards of Rs 195.05 crore have been given to sportspersons for their achievements during the year 2018-19 and 2019-20.

The Minister who is a former Indian Hockey captain said that the State would prepare world-class players, for which a centre of excellence for between eight and 10 disciplines would be set up on the pattern of the NIS in Patiala. “Along with good trainers, players will get hostels and other facilities. If a player gets an Olympic, Asian or Commonwealth medal, the district sports and youth affairs officer of the district will be honoured,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/focus-on-boosting-sports-infra-at-local-level--sandeep-singh.html
50,24-2-20,Admin to launch special drive to check PGs irregularities in Chandigarh,"A day after a fire tragedy at an unregistered paying guest accommodation in Sector 32 here claimed three young lives, the Chandigarh Administration is set to launch a special drive to check such PGs violating rules in the city.

The fire incident had claimed the lives of girls namely Pakshi (from Kotkapura, Punjab), Riya (Kapurthala, Punjab) and Muskan (Hisar, Haryana), all aged between 19-22. After the unfortunate incident, UT Adviser Manoj Parida said that inspections of paying guest accommodations would be conducted in the city to avert such untoward incidents in the future.

Deputy Commissioner Mandeep Singh Brar had a day ordered an inquiry into the fire incident and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (South) has been directed to conduct a thorough probe and submit a report at the earliest. The SDM (South) is likely to submit the report in next three days. The UT PG accommodation policy makes it mandatory for the owner to provide liveable condition in PGs and get it registered. However, as per preliminary inquiry, as many as 34 people were stuffed in Sector 32 PG, compromising with living standards

The UT Police has arrested Nitish Bansal, who was running the Sector 32 PG accommodation. Bansal was arrested late on Saturday night, Inspector Baldev Kumar, Station House Officer of Sector 34 police station, said.

Bansal was booked under Section 336, 304, 188, 34 of IPC related to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, act endangering life of others and disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.

While three girls had died, two others were injured during the fire incident due to electrical short-circuit. The floor in which the fire broke out had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) partitions and other combustible material with some rooms having a common entry.

One of the survivors of the horrific incident, Jasmeen Kaur, 18, from Moga in Punjab, saved herself by jumping from the first floor of the house. Jasmeen, her relatives and some other girls staying at the PG recorded their statements before the police regarding the accommodation where they were staying.

Recalling the ordeal while speaking to the mediapersons on Sunday, Jasmeen said she was sleeping when her friend Pakshi did not care about her own safety and first went to wake her up telling her that a fire had broken out probably because of an electrical short-circuit.

As smoke filled up the congested floor which was partitioned by combustible material, Jasmeen told her to run towards the only narrow exit. Soon, the fire grew bigger and Jasmeen somehow managed to grab a chair to climb a nearly seven-feet high wall, jumped off and fell on a shed below and then subsequently onto the floor. “When I came out, Pakshi was still inside. I was injured and waited for her. When I climbed the wall, I lost balance and fell down on a shed. Later, we could hear Pakshi calling out to us and a friend of ours tried to rescue those trapped inside, but there were flames all over,” said an inconsolable Jasmeen, unable to come to terms at the loss of her friend and two others in the tragedy.

Being a weekend, she said most of the girls staying in the PG were out while some were still in college.

“There were just 4-5 of us on the floor. There was only one narrow exit and that too was blocked by fire. There were panelling on all sides and it was soon engulfed by fire,” she said.

Notably, the PG business is thriving in Sectors 15, 22, 23, 32, 34, 35 and 43, but not more than 125 PGs are officially registered with the UT Estate Department.

With Chandigarh being a hub to several educational and coaching institutes, the UT Administration had in 2006 framed rules to regulate functioning of the PGs. However, the unregistered PGs continue to run violating the rules.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/admin-to-launch-special-drive-to-check-pgs-irregularities-in-chandigarh.html

State. Dhindsa appeared to be responding to the allegations by Akali Dal leaders that he and his son Parminder Singh Dhindsa were being used as “pawns” by the Chief Minister and the Congress to “weaken” the SAD.

The Dhindsas were expelled by the Akali Dal for alleged anti-party activities on February 3, a day after holding a rally in their home turf — Sangrur.

Retorting, the Dhindsa father-son duo, along with various panthic leaders, on Sunday held ‘Save Punjab, Save Panth’ rally at the same place.

The rally was attended by SAD (Taksali) leaders Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, SAD (1920) leader Ravi Inder Singh, former MP Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, former Deputy Speaker Bir Devinder Singh, former president of Delhi Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee Manjit Singh GK and former Akal Takht Jathedar Ranjit Singh.

Dhindsa and other leaders lashed out at the Badal family, accusing them of “damaging” the Akali Dal. “Everybody knows Capt Amarinder Singh and Badal family are hand-in glove. Everything is going on as it is,” Dhindsa said.

“I want to ask them (Akalis) how many Congressmen have come here today. Who are Congressmen? The whole world knows Sukhbir Singh Badal is in cahoots with Capt Amarinder Singh.

Nobody stops his (Sukhbir) bus and their buses are plying without permits as usual. Nobody touched their cable business even today,” alleged Dhindsa, adding their business remained unaffected. The Akalis only make statements against the Congress but ""we will fight them,"" he said.

Referring to SAD’s February 2 rally in Sangrur, Dhindsa claimed that the Akalis had said that they organized the rally against the Congress government. “Did they speak against Congress? They spoke only against Dhindsa family. From this, it was clear who is with Congress,” he said.

Dhindsa said that the size of his rally was “much bigger” than the SAD’s. “Sukhbir you come here and see and this gathering is enough to break your arrogance,” said the senior Dhindsa. On February 2, the SAD leadership had accused the Dhindsas of “backstabbing” the party.

Dhindsa had rebelled against the Akali Dal leadership in a bid to “liberate” the SAD from the Badal family and revive its lost glory. He joined hands with SAD splinter groups, including the SAD (Taksali). His son too followed him.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/badals----hand-in-glove----with-punjab-govt--ss-dhindsa.html

57,24-2-20,Haryana Congress chief slams BJP-JJP Govt for new excise policy,"Haryana Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja has slammed the BJP-JJP alliance Government of the State for the new excise policy and the decision to take away the land of Dhauli (donation) given to the Brahmin families.

She said that those who used to talk of closing liquor vends in the state, have made arrangements for opening liquor vends from house-to-house today. Eliminating 15 percent quota in liquor vend contracts of Dalits exposes the anti-Dalit face of this government, she said.

The Congress leader said that the Dhauli (donation) land given by the Congress Government to the Brahmin families is being taken away by the present Government, which is highly condemnable.

In a statement issued here, Selja said that our State is already getting entangled in the swamp of drugs. On the other hand, the decision of the Government giving relaxation on sale of liquor in shopping malls, reduction in the prices of beer, allowing the bar to open till 1 am in midnight and giving permission to keep liquor boxes in house, shows that the Government promotes intoxication in the state. The real objective of the Government is to make reach of liquor easy to maximum number of people so that people would not even bother to go to the liquor vends for it. It shows how the Government is promoting drugs in the state, she added.

She said that the parties involved in this Government used to talk about liquor ban in the elections, but today the real face of these parties has come before the people of the State. This decision of the Government will have serious consequences, and the youth of the State who are already getting caught in the clutches of drugs will be increasingly trapped in the morass. Now liquor will be supplied from house to house and it will also have a direct impact on the law and order of the State, she said.

Selja said that be it the Government of the state or the Central Government, Dalits were repeatedly tortured in this Government. Sometimes there was a conspiracy to end their reservation, sometimes the law against the oppression of Dalits is not properly advocated, which was rejected in the Supreme Court. The 500-year-old Ravidas Temple was demolished in this government. At the same time, abolishing the 15 percent quota in liquor contracts of Dalits, once again exposes the anti-Dalit face of this Government, the Congress leader said.

Corneringthe Government for taking away the ownership rights of Dhauli (donation) land given to some other castes including the Brahmin by the Congress Government in the year 2011, Selja said that the anti-Brahmin face of this Government is also exposed. The anti-Brahmin mentality of this Government and Chief Minister Manohar Lal has been exposed many times. The anti-Brahminquestion in the Haryana Staff Selection Commission, and the threat given by Chief Minister Manohar Lal to behead the head of a Brahmin leader, tells how this Government maintains an anti-Brahmin mentality, she said.

She further said that in the year 2011, when the Congress was in power in the State, the Congress made law and people of the Brahmin community were given the right to own the land of Dhauli (donation). Under this, 37,836 Dhauledars became the owners of 14,187 acres of land. Now due to its anti-Brahmin mentality, this Government has decided to take away the ownership of the land of these people, which is highly condemnable.

She said that the Congress party is standing with the people of the State against these anti-people decisions and these decisions will be strongly opposed by the Congress.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-congress-chief-slams-bjp-jjp-govt-for-new-excise-policy.html

The Youth Akali workers took out processions through the markets of Muktsar, Amritsar Sahib, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Faridkot, and other districts while raising slogans like ‘Dinkar Gupta- Murdabad’ and ‘Sonia Gandhi- Murdabad’ before holding sit-ins in front of the district administrative offices. They also burnt effigies of the DGP and Congress president and castigated them for toeing the line of former minister Indira Gandhi by trying to label Sikhs as terrorists.

Speaking to mediapersons, Youth Akali leaders Gurpartap Singh Tikka and Talbir Singh Gill said Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta should be immediately dismissed from the top post for propagating falsehood against a peace loving community which always stood for protection of the underprivileged sections of the society.

“By calling the Kartarpur Sahib visiting Sikh pilgrimages as people who can be easily lured to terrorism, Punjab DGP has proved that he was deliberately attempting to malign the image of the Sikhs, for which he seemed to have received direct orders from 10 Janpath New Delhi,’ they added.

Youth leaders also demanded a public apology from Dinkar Gupta for hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikhs worldwide. They said the DGP had committed an act of sacrilege by labeling all Sikh devotees as potential terrorists who had visited the holy place of Kartarpur Sahib. “Gupta must explain that how many out of 50,000 devotees visiting the sacred place had become terrorists? they added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/yad-protests-against-punjab-dgp-for-making-anti-sikh-remark.html

In a statement issued on Sunday, the PCC president said that on the one hand the BJP government is raising the cost of important items and services like cooking gas and fare of roadways corporation buses while on the other it is making alcohol cheaper to turn Uttarakhand into a ‘liquor state’ and affect the health of the people negatively.Despite chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat assuring that the liquor trade will be decreased, the government is using even vans to deliver liquor at home, which the Congress strongly objects to.

Singh also questioned shifting of authority to grant liquor and beer bar license from the excise department to the district magistrate, stating that this will encourage corruption and bootlegging.

The BJP government has failed to control price rise and is shifting the burden of its follies on to the public, said the PCC president.

According to the UAS, the SCPCR is working for the welfare of children as well as their parents.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, the members of UAS claimed that private schools violate many rules and regulations like increasing the school fee every year by a large percentage, running schools without affiliation and No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the government. If an authority like SCPCR asks these private institutions to work as per the guidelines and laws, they call it harassment and interference. According to the UAS president Ram Kumar Singhal, “SCPCR is taking actions because parents and guardians complain to the commission about the apathy of the school management towards the interests of students and their parents.

The schools take many arbitrary decisions that affect parents and their children. Parents approach SCPCR when schools do not listen to them or their complaints. Now if the child rights commission is listening to us and taking some action, they are accusing it of interference. Do these schools want to do whatever they want with the parents having no one to complaint to?”“Private schools are just doing business.

They increase the fees every year by a big margin and besides the monthly fee; they charge money from students in different ways.

All such schools exploit parents and children mentally and financially and they do not even want us to raise our voice as if they are doing us some kind of favour by letting our kids study in their schools,” said Singhal. He further added that UAS will meet the officials of the state education department regarding the apathy of private schools towards the rules and regulation for the welfare of children. According to the Supreme Court orders, the private schools also come under the purview of Right to Information (RTI) act and they will have to provide the details of their earnings to the parents if they demand it but the schools refuse to provide such information to anyone, said parents of children studying in private schools of Dehradun.

They further added that no child counsellor or POCSO committee has been formed by the schools for welfare of the children and that they are happy that SCPCR is pressurising these private education institutions to follow guidelines to benefit students.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uas-comes-out-in-support-of-scpcr.html

67,24-2-20,Capt confered with 10th BCS ‘Ideal Chief Minister' award,"The Bhartiya Chhatra Sansad (BCS) on Sunday conferred the prestigious ‘Adarsh Mukhya Mantri Puraskar’ (Ideal Chief Minister Award) upon Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh for his initiatives to ensure good governance and holistic development in the State.

BSC is a non-political platform that provides political coaching to nearly 10,000 students in the age group of 18-25 from colleges and 400 universities across India.

The award was presented to Capt Amarinder by former President and Bharat Ratna Pranab Mukherjee at Vigyan Bhawan during the valedictory function of 10th edition of the four-day national conclave of BCS.

The BCS also acknowledged Capt Amarinder’s profound vast experiences and the values he had practiced, which had earned him recognition and eminence in society.

Several dignitaries, including Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Kiren Rijiju, former Union External Affairs Minister Kunwar Natwar Singh, Padma Vibhushan and Auroville Foundation chairman Dr Karan Singh, Founder of MIT World Peace University Vishwanath D Karad and Founder of BCS Rahul V Karad, were present on the occasion.

The award citation read, “Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has displayed outstanding conviction coupled with revolutionary ideas of clean governance to take Punjab on the path of development. You have constantly endeavoured to improve the social and economic status of the people through your people-centric policies. You have flag shipped the farm loan waiver scheme and organic farming, which have brought in agriculture growth in the state.”

“You channelized the energies of the youth of Punjab by curbing the drug menace. Quite aware of tumultuous relations between India and Pakistan, you used Track Two Diplomacy in the Kartarpur corridor incident in 2019. You are an epitome of honesty, integrity and had retained your image that of credible Chief Minister, who delivers on his promises of economic growth coupled with social welfare,” it added.

Capt Amarinder, addressing the gathering, exhorted the youth of India to play a constructive role in active politics as it was their duty, as future leaders, to transform the country’s destiny.

“Since we are on the way out and you are on the way in, it is your duty to serve your country with firm commitment, sincerity, and honesty, upholding the cherished values of democracy,” he told the youth.

Capt Amarinder urged the students, desirous of joining politics, to be well-versed with the socio-economic as well as demographic conditions of their respective states. “Join politics not for glamour or power but to serve the country or your state to make it better,” he urged the youth.

“Politics is not an easy profession; rather it is a 24X7 job as, being elected representatives, you have to solve the problems of people besides addressing their grievances,” said the Chief Minister.

Recalling his own experience, Capt Amarinder said that though he joined politics back in 1980 as Member Parliament, he realized, after some years, that he should enter the state politics to get a grip over the basic socio-political scenario of his State. He then contested and was elected to the state assembly, he said.

His government in Punjab was facing many challenges, with a hostile neighbour on one side, drug smuggling from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the slowdown in agriculture, which had been the mainstay of the state’s economy, said the Chief Minister.

Expressing concern over the brain-drain from Punjab, the Chief Minister said that its youth were going abroad in search of green pastures – a trend his Government was trying to arrest by ensuring gainful employment in the State.

Reiterating his commitment to completely eliminate the scourge of drugs, Capt Amarinder noted that his government had successfully broken the back of the drug mafia, thereby choking the supply line.

On the law and order front, the state had successfully neutralized 17 terrorist modules, besides stamping out gangsterism from the State, he noted.

Notably, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan got this award in 2015, followed by Andhra Pradesh’s N Chandrababu Naidu in 2016 and Tripura’s Manik Sarkar in 2017. Odisha Chief Minister won the coveted award in 2018 and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in 2019 during 9th BCS.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-confered-with-10th-bcs----ideal-chief-minister--award.html
68,24-2-20,Govt should withdraw new exise policy: Hooda,"Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday said that the State Government should immediately withdraw the new excise policy initiated by the BJP-JPP Government as it would push lakhs of youth into addiction.

He was addressing the Parivartan Rally at Petwad in Narnaund. Hooda said the Government had spent more than 100 days in office but the alliance partners have not yet been able to work out a common minimum programme.

He said the performance of the Government is evaluated on the basis of the steps it is taking to fulfill its pre-poll promises. “Based on what we have seen, we can say that this Government has not taken one single step to fulfill the promises it has made in the election manifesto,” he said.

Hooda launched a full-frontal attack on the Government on their new excise policy. “Our policy was aimed at encouraging sports and making our youth world champions on the sports field. Their policy is to push the youth of the state into addiction and the new policy is a recipe of disaster. We have already seen what has happened in Punjab, they are pushing Haryana in the same direction,” Hooda said.

Taking on the government on the issue of farmers, he said the government has worked towards increasing the input costs of farmers and not their profits. “The government is pushing our farmers in debt as the government has increased rates on agricultural inputs and has increased taxes on them and the increase in the prices of wheat and paddy has been minimal. We had brought a historic increase of Rs 193 in the rates of sugarcane while this government has only increased it by Rs 20 to 30,” he said, adding that the paddy scam has demonstrated that the government has not given the farmers their rights but has conned them through scams and corruption.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-should-withdraw-new-exise-policy--hooda.html

70,24-2-20,Vedran Smailovic: How one person can make a difference,"Artists of any kind, writers, musicians, painters, dancers and others respond to war and disaster in an individual way, but some of the greatest are those who have transcended fixed identities of religion and nation.

So many forces are involved in disaster situations that it is difficult to believe that one person, who is not a political leader, can make a difference. But the cellist Vedran Smailovic did just that. In Yugoslavia, the complex forces of history were at work. President Josip Broz Tito, who had kept the country and its component republic states together, died in 1980.

A few years after this the Soviet Union began to dissolve, and meanwhile Yugoslavia’s states struggled for independence, among them being Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Sarajevo, located in a valley through which the Miljacka river flows, was its capital. It was here in 1914 that the archduke of Austria was assassinated, leading to the First World War. After the war it became part of Yugoslavia.

In World War II it was captured by Germany and formed part of Utashe’s independent state of Croatia.

After this second war, it was again part of Yugoslavia, as the capital of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which included Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians, who, till then, had lived together in harmony.

Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia on 6 March 1992, but the Serbs did not accept this. The Serbs founded a new state, Republika Srpska, that would include some Bosnian areas. Radovan Karadzic , a Serb, was the president of the Republic of Srpska from 1992-96, launching the Bosnian war, aiming to bring other areas under his control.

Though one cannot go into the complications of the war here, Sarajevo, Srebrenica other places suffered, Srebrenica being infamous for the massacres that took place. Sarajevo, with a largely Bosnian population, was besieged at first by the Yugoslav army , and then by Srpska forces from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996. A siege force of about 13,000 encircled the city on the hills, and attacked with artillery, tanks and guns. Though there were 70,000 Bosnian troops in the city, they were poorly equipped.The siege of Sarajevo was possibly the longest siege of modern times. Sarajevo at that time was a city of about 500,000 people, but thousands were killed and 70,000 Sarajevo Serbs left and went to Republika Srpska.

History records several massacres at Sarajevo. In the Markale marketplace massacre on February 5, 1994, 68 civilians were killed and 200 wounded; there was a second Markale massacre on August 28, with 37 killed, 90 wounded. The besieged city soon had no electricity, no gas, no water, no schools, phones, transport or industry.

“We learned to live by candlelight again,” said Resad Tribonj, one of the survivors. Snipers on the hills shot people on the streets and were paid for every person they killed. It is said, they were paid extra for killing children.

According to UN estimates, almost 11,541 people were killed, and 56,000 wounded. Fifteen hundred children were among those dead and 15,000 among the injured. Hundreds of shells hit the city every day and in one case, July 22, 1993, there were 3777 shells counted. Finding ways to survive, ‘Sarajevo Roses’ was a poetic name given to craters created by shells. Ten thousand apartments were destroyed, and thousands more damaged.

But during this terrible time, there was one man who became a symbol of hope. On the afternoon of May 27, 1992, mortar shells hit a group of people waiting to buy bread in a market. Twenty-two people were killed and more than 70 were injured.

Vedran Smailovic, a well-known cellist of the city, saw it and was deeply disturbed. The next day he came to the spot, by then covered with flowers as tribute, and began to play his cello. He had not planned this, but he did it instinctively, and as people gathered around him, there was a sense of healing.

He continued to play there for 22 days, honouring the 22 killed, playing the same piece, Albinoni’s Adagio in G minor. There were snipers on the hills, and the cellist could have been killed at any time, but he played on. For another two years, he played at different places in the city, in the midst of ruined buildings, dressed in a white shirt and black tail coat, as if he was playing on the stage in an orchestra. Soon he became a symbol of courage for Sarajevo, and for the whole world. People called him mad, but he responded that it was the war that was mad. Inspired by him, classical and other music was composed, books were written, and other artists and musicians came to Sarajevo. There are more than 20 books, films, plays, and songs, on the siege, as well as video games.

Joan Baez joined him one day, Susan Sontag came to Sarajevo, as well as other world famous artists. Locally too, there was a surge of creativity, even while the city was dying. But the man himself did not want publicity. He left Sarajevo in December 1993 and moved to northern Ireland, where he lives in Warren point in an attic flat overlooking Carlingford Lough, composing music and playing chess.Vedran Smailovic did not try to become a leader. His was an independent act of ‘cultural resistance’, a defiance of power, an assertion of normal life, even in the midst of chaos. Somehow or the other, even though he played in full view, he was never hit by a sniper, though once his cello was destroyed.

His story became known throughout the world, narrated in newspapers and depicted on television. The world was indifferent to the siege, but the publicity he generated, without looking for it, and the numerous artists inspired by him led to an increased focus on the terrible conditions of the city. Vedran was a Muslim like most other Bosnians, but that was not his identity. He said, “I am a Sarajevan. I am a cosmopolitan. I am a pacifist. I am nothing special. I am a musician, I am part of the town.” In an insane situation, his was an act of sanity, of beauty and harmony, that brought hope to many.

Perhaps inspired by him, Karim Wasfi, conductor of the Iraq Symphony Orchestra, later played a cello on a bombed out site and was known as the Cellist of Baghdad. There have been many others too, who have used art as a symbol of what is normal and sane, in the midst of disaster.

71,24-2-20,"MCD collects Rs 9 lakh penalty on roadside debris, construction material","Penalty amounting in total to about Rs nine lakh has been collected by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) on debris and construction material placed on the roadsides so far. After a brief gap, the corporation is planning to resume this campaign from next month or later.

According to the Dehradun deputy municipal commissioner, Rohitash Sharma, “The sanitation inspectors from MCD have imposed the penalty on the people who placed their construction materials and debris on the roadsides. MCD seized all the material and after the owner paid the penalty for the material, it was released.

However, in some cases when the owner did not pay the penalty, the seized material was auctioned. In all, the corporation collected about Rs nine lakh in penalty till February 15.” He also added that construction material from many government construction sites was also seized by MCD officials.

Some of them submitted only the partial amount of the imposed penalty, so accordingly some material was returned and the remaining was auctioned. According to Sharma, for now, the team is not active but will be soon resume the campaign in March or later.

It is pertinent to mention here that the MCD had started the drive against construction material and debris on the roadside last year. The drive was initiated following complaints from the public about the debris and construction materials on the roadside and even on parts of the road in some places, disrupting traffic flow and causing inconvenience to the public. The corporation has also made repeated requests to those undertaking activities involving construction materials and debris to desist from placing these on the roadsides or the road. However, the requests have evidently had limited effect so far which is why the MCD is planning to resume this drive from the coming month.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-collects-rs-9-lakh-penalty-on-roadside-debris--construction-material.html
72,24-2-20,MCD collects about Rs 6 L property tax on Sunday,"The Municipal Corporation of Dehradun collected about Rs six lakh in property tax on Sunday. The MCD office had remained open specially to collect property tax. According to officials, so far, the MCD has collected about Rs 40 crore in property tax even though about 50 per cent of people are yet to pay the property tax.

While talking to The Pioneer, the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly said, “Around 190 people submitted the property tax on Sunday and the total collection was about Rs six lakh. So far, Rs 40 crore has been collected by MCD in which the number of non-residential building taxpayers is more than residential building taxpayers.”

According to Painuly, about 50 per cent of people have still not deposited the property tax. Hopefully, the taxpayers will submit the tax by the end of March.

The property tax of several government buildings is still pending in addition to the remaining 50 per cent taxpayers. This year MCD has set a target of collecting Rs 50 crore but considering the current collection of Rs 40 crore, the tax collection could easily surpass the target by the end of March. It is pertinent to mention here that for the third time this year, MCD extended the period of 20 per cent rebate on property tax for five days on February 20. The five days extension on the rebate is slated to end on February 25.

The period of submitting property tax will end on March 31 after which the taxpayers will be imposed with a fine according to the area of the property. If the tax submission is late by 30 days, five per cent of tax will be charged as penalty in the form of delay fee by MCD.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-collects-about-rs-6-l-property-tax-on-sunday.html
73,24-2-20,"Wards have increased, not sanitation workers: SSM","The municipal wards in Dehradun have been increased from 60 to 100 but the number of sanitation workers is still the same for the past many years, said the members of Samajik Samrasta Manch (SSM) during an event held in the Town Hall.

According to SSM, even after 20 years of the formation of Uttarakhand, no permanent appointments of sanitation workers have been made in the state as per the norms of the government.

The members of SSM said that the practice of manual scavenging still happens in many regions of the state and it should be ended by the state government.

As per the law, only selected trained sanitation workers should be sent to such areas only when no machine can reach the place.

According to the director of NHPC Bhagwat Prasad Makwana, the municipal wards have been increased in Dehradun from 60 to 100 but permanent appointments of sanitation workers have still not been made in the state as per the norms of the government. Only 28 permanent sanitation workers are available per 10,000 population of an area.

The workers, who have been appointed on a temporary basis, are given an extremely low salary and they are not even given the benefits like bonus, leaves, and insurance.

74,24-2-20,HC takes note of lawyers’ stir in Daltonganj,"The lawyers’ boycott of all court works here in civil courts Daltonganj entered its seventh day on Sunday and the Jharkhand High Court has taken cognizance of this week long stir. It has taken initiative to invite office bearers of the Palamu district bar association to the Ranchi Court on Monday.

Secretary of the bar association here Subodh Kumar Sinha said, “Here the Honourable Court means the Chief Justice and so our office bearers will be meeting the Chief Justice on Monday.”

Registrar Establishment HC Ranchi Akhil Kumar has sent a letter to this effect to the president of the bar association here requesting president of the bar association here to send in a delegation of office bearers to Hon’ble Court in Ranchi on February 24.

The registrar establishment’s letter did not mention any boycott of all court works by the lawyers here, nevertheless, it says the February 24 visit of the office bearers of the bar association in Hon’ble Court Ranchi will be in connection with what the bar association is facing over the past few days. President of the bar association here Sachidanand Tiwary alias Sachidanand Nehru who is a very senior lawyer here and commands respect in the legal fraternity said, “We have received the letter from registrar establishment. Our delegation will go to Hon’ble Court on Feb 24 in Ranchi.”

Sinha said, “We will take a decision as to who will represent us. On coming back from there we will again sit here with our esteemed lawyers and discuss the development and then take a final call.”

Nehru said “All the lawyers unanimously decided to boycott all court works here from Feb 15 in protest against the most sad and tragic behavior and attitude of a senior judge Pankaj Kumar.”

Nehru said it was he who became the victim of his unwarranted and unprovoked wrath which had hurt him and his dignity too much and the lawyers too have felt extremely bad about what was meted out to him by the senior judge.

As there is no spokesperson here in the civil courts the Pioneer could not get the version of the Bench on this issue and so it goes with Bar’s version.

State Bar Council too had rushed in here a 3 member team on a fact finding mission which met the bar, the concerned judge etc and went back said a lawyer here refusing to be identified.

The Pioneer did try to meet one of the members of the fact finding team of State Bar Council which reached here M A K Rashidi who politely declined to share anything in this regard with the media person.The stir of the lawyers has crippled entire legal works here in the courts. Clients are too uncertain as to when this deadlock will end. Bail seekers are thoroughly disappointed. SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta said this lawyers’ boycott of the courts has affected police’s move to get statement recorded under section 164 of CrPC.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hc-takes-note-of-lawyers----stir-in-daltonganj.html

80,24-2-20,BJP to get leader of Opposition today,"The State BJP has directed all the legislators to be present on Monday at the BJP headquarters in Ranchi for the election of leader of opposition (LoP). Former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi is likely to be elected the legislative party leader of the BJP on Monday, sources said. The election of Leader of Opposition will be made in presence of BJP national general secretary, P Murlidhar Rao who has been made the observer for election of legislative party leader.

Apart from P Murlidhar Rao, BJP national general secretary Arun Singh and State BJP in-charge OP Mathur will be present at the legislative party leader election. BJP sources say that the legislators' meeting is a mere formality. Babulal Marandi, who has rejoined the saffron party, is all set to be elected the legislative party leader.

On February 17, former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi merged his 14-year-old party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha will BJP in presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other senior leaders.

Marandi’s elevation as LoP also gain importance as after three senior BJP leaders including former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, former Speaker Dinesh Oroan and State BJP president Laxman Gilua losing the election, there was speculation that either Chandreshwar Prasad Singh (CP Singh) or Neelkanth Singh Munda having vast experience in party and House could be made as Leader of Opposition (LoP), but during the three day long special session of Jharkhand Assembly the LoP chair remained vacant.

Arun Singh said, “The BJP legislative party leader (LoP) will be elected on Monday in presence of BJP national general secretary P Murlidhar Rao among others.” Singh also said that apart from election of LoP, the BJP’s organisational election too be held.

After Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in 2000, Marandi had become the first Chief Minister of the state. Marandi was seen as a leader with a clean image. He is also known for his fight against Maoists.

The Maoists killed Marandi's son in 2007 in Giridih district. Marandi as Chief Minister worked on improving the condition of roads and road connectivity, especially in the rural areas.

He, however, failed to keep the BJP's allies together, who revolted against him and forced him to resign in March 2003 leading to the elevation of Arjun Munda as Chief Minister. Marandi quit the BJP just after the fall of the Arjun Munda government in 2006 and floated the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha-Prajatantrik (JVM-P).

Sources said that with Marandi’s elevation as LoP the BJP will reach out to masses especially attracting tribals who deserted from BJP in last Assembly election.

82,24-2-20,Community-based management of acute malnutrition,"The burden of undernutrition is high in India. One-fourth of India’s children are born with low birth weight, 35.7 percent of children under five are underweight, 38.4 percent are stunted and 21 percent are wasted. Iron deficiency is wide spread, exists across income quintiles and age groups (over 53 per cent of women of child bearing and over 58 per cent of children under five are anaemic, NFHS 4).

The immediate determinants of malnutrition at the individual level (inadequate dietary intake and disease) are products of underlying causes at the family or household level (insufficient access to food, inadequate maternal and child practices, poor water and sanitation, and inadequate access to quality health services) as depicted by 1990 UNICEF framework. Malnutrition manifested in the form of stunting, wasting, underweight, anaemia and low BMI in women are influenced by a set of immediate causes (nutrition specific) and underlying causes (nutrition sensitive) intervention. Dietary intake and disease status, immediate causes of malnutrition, can be addressed through nutrition specific interventions. The underlying causes of malnutrition i.e. food security, care and feeding practices for mothers and children and health services and healthy environment can be addressed through nutrition sensitive interventions. Both the nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions are further influenced by interventions which improve socio economic status of women, domestic violence, and education status.

Multisectoral interventions address the underlying and basic determinants of malnutrition. Whennutrition programs emphasize water, sanitation, and hygiene—and WASH programs emphasize hand washing before preparing food, feeding a child, and elimination of open defecation—both programs can maximize impact.

Research in India has shown that increased crop diversification improves dietary diversification in the home and helps children recover from growth faltering. When education programs invest in nutrition, it improves academic achievement. One example is school feeding programs, which can improve learning and academic performance. Students participating in school feeding and take-home ration programs have improved cognition.

These programs yield the greatest impact when coupled with other programs like deworming, micronutrient supplementation, and fortification. Integrating nutrition programs into school curriculum initiates life-long healthy behaviours.

By engaging multiple sectors, partners can leverage knowledge, expertise, reach, and resources, benefiting from their combined and varied strengths as they work toward the shared goal of producing better Nutrition and health outcomes.

Multisectoral Approach helps in addressing the issues in a focused way as it helps in pooling the resources and formulating the common objectives. One of the major advantages is optimization of usage of resources by avoiding duplication of inputs and activities which tremendously improve program effectiveness and efficiency.

Strong leadership and mandate at the policy level are necessary to plan and execute the successful multisectoral coordination. All the major stakeholders require sharing the common vision and perspective. Developing institutional mechanism is of utmost importance as it will standardize the processes of inter- sectoral coordination.

The POSHAN Abhiyan has undertaken the multisectoral approach to address malnutrition, the output of which is a multisectoral district nutrition action plan.

This multisectoral plan will ensure strong nutrition focus through institutional and programmatic convergence by integrating it in the planning, implementation and supervision process in all relevant direct and in-direct interventions and programs.

The key recommendations that emerged from various consultation on multisectoral convergence for improved nutrition are strengthening and promoting Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND) as a platform for multisectoral convergence at village level, local food mapping and promotion of kitchen garden to ensure nutritional security at household kitchens, priorities home visits but the FLWs, inter personal counselling (IPC), infrastructure development of health facilities to ensure privacy for antenatal check-ups and child care etc.

Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is defined by a very low weight for height with medical complications are treated at Nutritional Rehabilitation Centres (NRC) / Malnutrition Nutrition Centre (MTC) while the SAM without medical complications are provided energy and nutrient dense foods at household level. Intensive follow-up of cases at household / community level as well as in the NRC are crucial as per the CMAM review in India. Many studies indicated that maximum cases reported were in the age-group 6-24 months probably because the complementary food starts at 6 months and inappropriate complementary feeding and lack of breastfeeding after 6 months are the possible reasons. Some of the issues found were low bed occupancy rate, poor appetite and weakness in most of the admitted children. The number of follow up visit tends to reduce in the third and fourth follow up. Hence there is a need to strengthen NRC / MTC in terms of infrastructure, effective counselling and incentivising follow up visits.

There is a need of national CMAM guidelines to makes the scale up of SAM treatment. It is also felt that the implementation of an effective public health approach for addressing SAM requires a significant investment by policy& program leaders to develop need-specific sustainable as well as effective models of care that build joint capacity to treat the burden of children with SAM. This can happen only by a more holistic approach that incorporates preventive measures such as – Timely screening of all the children before development of complications, maximum coverage, integration with other programs including health, ICDS, WASH, hygiene promotion, clean water, prevention of prenatal macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, and the promotion of age-appropriate foods and feeding practices for infants and young children, provision of regular THR, effective VHSND, growth monitoring: monthly weight & quarterly height, community events / Jan Andolan, collating quality information / data for immediate corrective measures, etc.

87,24-2-20,Trump visit: ITC hotel turned into fortress,"The Delhi Police in concert with the central security agencies has thrown a massive security blanket in and around ITC Maurya hotel where United States (US) President Donald Trump will check-in on Monday. All roads leading to the hotel at Sardar Patel Marg have been sanitised with multi-layered security apparatus in place. Anti-sabotage teams of the National Security Guards (NSG), Army and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have carried out intense anti-sabotage checks on the routes to be taken by the visiting dignitary.

Indian security agencies are also working in close coordination with the US Secret Service responsible for manning the security of the US President. In view of the spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, there is a higher security threat this time and the agencies are more ""cautious and alert"" than ever, well placed sources said.

Delhi's sky would be a 'no fly zone' till the US President is in the national Capital, officials said. Anti-drone detachment of NSG, snipers, elite Special Weapons And Tactic (SWAT) commandos, kite catchers, canine units, sharp shooters on high-rise buildings and Parakram vans of Delhi Police have also been deployed along the routes and areas in and around the hotel where Trump will be staying, they said on Sunday.

According to senior Delhi Police officials, personnel from six districts have been deployed for the security arrangements and nearly 40 companies of CAPFs have been requisitioned to be part of the security paraphernalia.

Hundreds of high-definition CCTV cameras with night vision capacity have been installed across the Sardar Patel Marg where hotel ITC Maurya is located to monitor the situation round-the-clock, the officials said.

Five years ago, when Trump's predecessor Barack Obama visited the national capital, the Delhi Police had rented 605 CCTV cameras and spent more than Rs one crore in hiring, installing and later removing them after the presidential visit was over.

A senior police officer said, ""We have also requested the anti-sabotage checking teams from paramilitary and army. They have been regularly conducting anti-sabotage checks along every route to be taken by the US President during his visit here"".

Besides the multi-layer security cover, elaborate arrangements have been made by the Delhi Police, including placement of double barricading on all the roads where Trump's convoy is likely to pass, officials said, adding that aerial surveillance of the route will also be conducted as part of the security measures.

Jersey barriers (modular concrete or plastic barriers placed to organise traffic into lanes) will also be put up on the route, a senior police official said.

Delhi Police is also working in close coordination with civic bodies. The route leading to a Delhi government school where US first lady Melania Trump is scheduled to pay a visit will also be under a high security cover, according to officials.

Trees have been trimmed according to the directions of the security agencies as part of the protocol.

Meetings have also been held with US security agents on the elaborate security arrangements in place.

At the ITC Maurya, a three-layer security will be in place. The hotel, located in Diplomatic Enclave in Chanakyapuri, will have police personnel in plain clothes patrolling every floor.

Delhi Police's security wing personnel will form part of the inner cordon that will work in close coordination with the United States Secret Service.

The security wing of the Delhi Police is a specialised unit tasked with the security of VIPs and visiting foreign dignitaries.

The second layer of security will be deployed around the hotel's lobby area, parking, lawn area and the pool area, while the third one will comprise police personnel from the district police. There is a large stretch of green ridge area opposite the hotel and security personnel will be deployed there as well.

Even at the neighbouring Taj Palace hotel, security personnel are maintaining a tight vigil. The floor where the Grand Presidential Suite is located at the ITC Maurya is out of bounds for most hotel staff owing to the elaborate security arrangements.

Sources said security arrangements at the hotel have been underway for the last two weeks with NSG commandos and Delhi Police personnel surveying every floor on a daily basis. Officials from the US embassy are also monitoring the preparations with all details being kept under wraps.

The sources added that the hotel will be out of bounds for other guests during the time Trump and his entourage will be there, and all the 438 rooms of the five-star property have been booked.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/trump-visit--itc-hotel-turned-into-fortress.html

The residents said that they were not opposed to the cause of Shaheen Bagh protesters, but demanded the immediate opening of the roads for restoring normalcy in the daily commute.

""We do not belong to any party or organisation. We are the residents of Sarita Vihar and are troubled by the blockade.

92,24-2-20,Book on archer Deepika Kumari to be available soon,"A biography on the pride of Ace Archer Deepika Kumari will hit bookstores across the country before Tokyo Olympics 2020. The book titled ‘Kahani Diye se Deepika banne ki’ is being written by Sunil Badal (58), a current affairs broadcaster with All India Radio.

The book has been written in Hindi and will be of approximately 150 pages. It will be published by Prabhat Prakashan. Later, it may be translated to other languages including English.

Written in flashback, the book begins with the ace archer receiving the Padma Shri award in 2016 by the then President Pranab Mukherjee.

“For Deepika receiving the highest civilian honour has been nothing short of a dream come true. Just talking about their daughter’s achievements moved the proud parents Geeta Devi and Shivnarayan Mahto to tears,” said the author.

The book talks about the archer who comes from a humble background. It highlights her struggles and also how her parents supported her to achieve her dreams.

“On a visit to her maternal grandparents, Deepika came to know that a cousin of her is learning archery. That was what piqued her interest in the sport.

Though she had never seen a bow and arrow in her life, she did have a good aim since childhood,” added Badal.

Originally coming from old Ranchi, she belongs to a family of potters. With pottery gradually dying as a profession, her parents moved to Katantoli- a village near Ratu.

Among the numerous incidents mentioned in the book, one talks about how her parents took her to Kharsawan on a Rajdoot bike to participate in the selection process.

“On reaching the academy, Deepika stood in the queue for recurve archery instead of the one for simple archery.

The coach initially rejected the lean and lanky Deepika saying that she won’t be able to handle the metal bows.

The local coach then suggested they meet Arjun Munda’s wife Meera Munda to get admission in the institute. In the first meeting Deepika convinced Meera Munda to just give her six months to prove her caliber,” said Badal.

The determination to become an archer is what gave wings to the daughter of a nurse and an autorichshaw driver.

“The story of Deepika Kumari and her struggle to be where she is today, is an ideal example not just for budding sportsmen and young girls but also for the general public at large,” remarked Badal.

Badal is also a poet and has written a series called ‘Mangru’ which he will get published soon.

His other book ‘Moi Sushilla’ is also slated to release later this year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/book-on-archer-deepika-kumari-to-be-available-soon.html

96,24-2-20,Kodariya gram panchayat owes around Rs 13 cr to IMC,"The Kodariya gram panchayat, biggest gram panchayat of Mhow Tehsil which is also a big hub of Potato chips manufacturing in Madhya Pradesh, is a defaulter of around Rs 13 crores of water tax amount payable to the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC).

There are hundreds of factories running in Kodariya gram panchayat for manufacturing potato chips where thousands of labourers from nearby district are engaged and also hundreds of private colonies and new townships are coming up in this Kodariya gram panchayat

The IMC provides Narmada water from its pipeline to Kodariya gram panchayat and due to nonpayment of pending Rs 13 crore, IMC has severed the water connection of gram Panchayat Kodariya and more than 25,000 people are now facing acute shortage of water.

EE of IMC, Sanjeev Shrivastava, told The Pioneer that Kodariya gram panchayat consumes a heavy amount of water every month and according to our meter reading, we charge Rs 9 lakh monthly as water tax.

For the past 5 years of this present Kodariya gram panchayat Sarpanch Anuradha Joshi tenure, the total amount of water tax reached up to Rs 5.40 crore, including the pending amount of previous years it reached upto Rs 13 crore.

In past five years, Kodariya gram panchayat has not deposited the water tax of even 1 month and they have deposited the water tax only Rs 6.5 lakh against Rs 13 crore.

Locals said that the Sarpanch of Kodariya gram panchayat Anuradha Joshi has also received the Prime Minister award for village empowerment in the year 2018 but the true face of Kodariya gram panchayat is different.

People are facing scarcity of drinking water and the cleanliness condition of gram panchayat Kodariya is in worse condition as the segregation centre for which Kodariya gram panchayat has received lakhs of Government money for construction of segregation centre for dry and wet garbage is incomplete and the Government of India’s Swatch Bharat Abhiyan is in poor condition and Kodariya gram panchayat is sending its garbage to the trenching ground of Mhow cantonment board for disposals since years and recently Mhow cantonment board has also stopped talking garbage from Kodariya gram panchayat and now again the heap of garbage can be seen frequently at many places of Kodariya gram panchayat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/kodariya-gram-panchayat-owes-around-rs-13-cr-to-imc.html
97,24-2-20,Sangh does not discriminate over ideology: Bhagwat,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said that RSS has no problem with any political parties and the organisation does not discriminate on the basis of political ideology. Giving stress on working in rural development, Bhagwat said that Sangh works in coordination with people from different political ideology too. The RSS chief, who is on five-day visit to Jharkhand, urged people from different walks of life to come forward for development of rural areas.

The RSS chief urging people irrespective of their political ideology to come forward gains importance as Bhagwat on earlier occasion had said that this country belongs to Hindus. He said that 130 crore people in the country are Hindus. Explaining that all Indians are Hindus, the RSS chief said, “By saying that all are Hindus, we do not want to change anyone's religion, language or caste. We do not want any power centre other than the Constitution because we believe in it. Hindutva is a holistic approach and we believe that the ancestors of all were Hindus. This is unity in diversity and is marked by emotional integrity.”

The RSS chief while participating at the Sangh Samagam at Maheshwari Bhawan had asked for increasing membership. He assigned new tasks for RSS membership in state, with a focus on at least three per cent population in urban areas and one per cent in rural areas having RSS membership.

The RSS chief held a lengthy discussion on various subjects in separate sessions with officials from Bihar and Jharkhand. There were discussion on village development, social harmony, environmental protection, joint family and other issues. The Sangh chief also laid special emphasis on organic farming and promotion of agro and dairy based industry. After a five-day stay, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat will leave Ranchi for Deoghar.

He said, “The real development of rural areas can be made only if there is focus on dairy based industry. As vast chunk of country population resides in rural area, country cannot develop if the rural areas are left out.”

The RSS chief on the occasion also urged RSS cadres to become role models setting an examples for others so that a good image is created for RSS and the role gets more important for such RSS member who are seniors. Bhagwat on the first day of visit addressing Sangh Samagam at Ram Dayal Munda Footbal stadium had said that people should avoid using the word ‘nationalism’ as it has connotations of ‘Hitler, Nazism and Fascism’. At an event organised by RSS in Ranchi, Mohan Bhagwat suggested the use of ‘national’ or ‘nation’ and ‘nationality, instead of ‘nationalism’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sangh-does-not-discriminate-over-ideology--bhagwat.html
98,24-2-20,Moolchand to Motibagh signal-free,"The nightmarish experience of commuters and motorists travelling on the roads of South and South East Delhi towards All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dhaula Kuan, Gurugram, Moti Bagh and Naraina from Moolchand, would end soon. Keeping perennial traffic snarls in this part of the city into mind, the Delhi Government has cleared a proposal of the Public Works Department (PWD) to construct a 'Signal Free Corridor' from Moolchand to Motibagh and also merging all the major flyovers falling on the 10 kilometer stretch.

According to senior Government officials, integration of all the six flyovers on this stretch would not only reduce the travel time, it will also provide a seamless corridor of the vehicular movement of all type of vehicles.

Incidentally, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government has recently approved the proposal with an estimated cost of nearly Rs 3500 crore. The project is currently under consideration and the proposal has also been submitted to the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) for feasibility study and for final approval to begin the work on ground.

According government officials, the high end project will merge already existing six major flyovers - Moolchand, Andrews Ganj, Sreenivaspuri, South Extension, AIIMS, Safdurjung and Bhikaji Cama Place flyovers to Motibagh to create a signal free elevated corridor.

However, as per experts, the proposed project is one of the long pending and can say was an aim project of Delhi PWD as the same plan was already proposed a decade ago by the department but unfortunately it could not take up and the project dropped. After, which the department went on for constructing isolated flyovers like the Moti Bagh flyover and Naraina flyover, all came up after that.

""The proposed plan will provide a relief in traffic congestion and will definitely create a smooth pave for traveling but the thing is how they are planning to do it because currently as such there is not much red light intersection between Moolchand to Motibagh. Also, the elevated corridor will not cut the major portion of traffic but yes, about 40 to 45 percent traffic jams will cut. Secondly, the entire traffic cannot be diverted to the elevated corridor but yes the traffic coming and fro towards Naraina will be largely benefitted.,"" said Dr. S. Velmurugan, Senior Principal Scientist and Former Head, Traffic Engineering and Safety Division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI).

Velmurgan further added that, ""Currently, there is an underpass and upgrade and a flyover is existing across the Moolchand, thus, the new flyover may come up above this corridor at Moolchand. Further, it will separate and help to reduce the local and long distance traffic. If you see the merging of the flyovers is also possible only at few places but a proper plan may help decongestion. Earlier, also we studied and submitted our reviews, so yes overall it's a good project but there will not a major impact on the traffic reduction.""

However, Delhi Traffic Police officials said, ""More than lakh of vehicles use these flyovers and stretches but there are hardly red lights on this stretch, it only ramps vehicular movement . However, once traffic congestions occur at Dhuala Kuan and Motibagh, it impacts traffic movement and flow in South Extension and AIIMS.. It soon spills to other areas, hence a better road engineering is needed"".",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/moolchand-to-motibagh-signal-free.html

BJP State Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) came to power on the issue of development of tribal and locals but after coming to power, the Hemant Soren Government became a ‘virtual world Government’.

In Jharkhand, for every one lakh population only 300 people have the option to reach out to the Government through Twitter,” said Shahdeo.

Mocking the State Government the party Spokesperson said that the problem of the primitive tribes like Pahadia, Asura, Birhor living in remote forests and mountain area is not going to be resolved by Twitter and 80 per cent of the tribal and local people living in remote villages are also not going to reach the Government through Twitter.

“Real Jharkhand lives in the village and most of the villagers do not use Twitter. The Hemant Government is making headlines by giving directions on Twitter but the problems of 99.7 per cent of the people of Jharkhand are not reaching the Government,” said Shahdeo.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren has been actively solving problems on microblogging website Twitter since his Government came to power here.

The CM has also been pulling up officials for anomalies in Government machinery highlighted by Twitterattis.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-functioning-on-twitter--shahdeo.html

In a statement issued on Sunday, Akhilesh said thousands of people were being mobalised on the streets of Ahmadabad to welcome the US President. “Despite the mega show at Ahmadabad, people cannot be taken for a ride and made to forget the economic distress,” he said.

The SP president reiterated that they would not have any truck with any political party for the UP Assembly elections in 2022. He said his party, like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), would seek votes in the name of ‘work’ and not ‘Ram’ or ‘Hanuman’.

“I would not have to cite Lord Rama or Hanuman for an electoral win in UP. I will, instead, cite the work undertaken in the state during our party’s regime between 2012 and 2017,’’ he said.

He was apparently referring to the speeches of the BJP leaders, especially UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, during their election campaign in the recently-concluded assembly polls in Delhi in which they repeatedly invoked Lord Rama and Hanuman.

Stating at the electorate of Delhi had voted on development plank, Akhilesh said the people of UP would also do the same. “We will seek support of the electorate on the basis of our work. We will also urge them to ask the BJP government to talk about their achievements,” he added.

The SP president’s remarks assume significance as BSP supremo Mayawati has also hinted that her party would not have any kind of alliance with the SP or other rival parties in the state.

The Maharastra CM, to be accompanied by his wife and son along with state ministers and other Shiv Sena leaders, would directly reach Ayodhya from Mumbai on March 7 morning, Shiv Sena officials said on Sunday.

The Maharashtra CM and others will also have darshan of Hanumangarhi and other temples besides meeting saints during the day-long stay in the temple city.

After the Supreme Court gave its judgement on Ram temple on November 9 last year, Uddhav had announced to visit Ayodhya. However, his strained ties with the BJP after the Maharashtra assembly polls and formation of his government in alliance with the NCP and Congress delayed his visit.

“It will be a thanksgiving visit when Uddhav Thackeray pays obeisance to Ram Lalla,” a senior Shiv Sena official in Lucknow said.

Uddhav had last visited Ayodhya on June 16, 2019 along with 18 party MPs after the win in Lok Sabha polls. During that visit, he had predicted that the Ram temple would be constructed during the tenure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At that time, both the parties — BJP and Shiv Sena — were in alliance and he had praised Modi’s leadership.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uddhav--kin-to--seek-ram-lalla---s--blessings-in-ayodhya.html

After inaugurating he Arogya Mela at Surya Kund in Darshan Nagar in Ayodhya on Sunday, the Chief Minister said that the state government had started ‘Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela’ from February 2 so as to ensure better health services to the people. It was the fourth Arogya Mela organised in the state.

Chief Minister Yogi said that the programme was started simultaneously to achieve the goal of health through 4,000 primary health centres and wellness centres within the state.

He said if all the people became aware and committed to bringing the schemes of government to the poor, no poor would die due to lack of medicines, because Prime Minister Modi introduced Ayushman card.

“Every person should get the golden card of Ayushman made. Those who have got the cards are getting health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh per year. This programme (through Aarogya Mela) is essentially being extended on a war-footing,” he said.

“By 2025, we have to make India free of TB, filaria and all virus-borne diseases. This programme also has to be taken up by us and for that, ‘Arogya Mela’ is a big boon,” he said.

The CM said that during the last three years, several programmes of health awareness were conducted in the state.

“From 1947 to 2016, there were only 12 medical colleges in the state. Our government laid the foundation of 28 medical colleges in the state in just three years between 2016 and 2019. Seven medical colleges have been started, including the Medical College at Ayodhya, while 13 medical colleges will be built. Medical colleges will be built in places where there are none. Better health facilities will be available in every district,” the CM said.

117,24-2-20,UP govt issues notice to Sonbhadra mining officer,"The Uttar Pradesh government has issued a notice to the mining officer of Sonbhadra for issuing official statement about the discovery of around 3,000 tonnes of gold in the district even as the report was junked by the Geological Survey of India (GSI).

Mining officer KK Rai had earlier claimed that the GSI and UP Mining department had discovered around 3,000 tonnes of gold at Sone Pahadi and Hardi village area in Sonbhadra.

“Some newspapers had carried the statement of Rai. The government has issued a notice asking him about the source of his information about the discovery of gold and why he spoke to the media without taking permission from his seniors,” a government official told The Pioneer on Sunday.

He said the mining official had been given a week’s time to submit his answer. “Government believes that wrong information has sent a bad message and raised expectations that India may become ‘sone ki chidiya’ once again,” he said.

Excavation of gold has always been a big news in Uttar Pradesh. In 2016, a hermit, Shobhan Sarkar, had claimed that gold could be found in Dondiya Kheda village in Unnao district. Excavation was carried with the help of ASI but it proved to be an exercise in futility.

Earlier, the mining officer of Sonbhadra had disclosed that the gold was estimated to be around 3,000 tonnes at Sone Pahadi and Hardi village area. But the GSI clarified that it had not estimated such vast resource of gold deposit in Sonbhadra district. The northern region of GSI has carried out several exploration works for gold but the results have not been encouraging.

“The exploration was carried out in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and in the report, it had estimated a probable category resource of 52806.25 tonnes of ore with 3.03 grams per tonne for a strike length of 170 metres in Sone Pahadi area of Sonbhadra district,” GSI director and PRO Ashish Kumar Nath said in a press statement.

It was clarified that the total gold which could be extracted from the total resource of 52806.25 tonnes of ore was approximately 160 kg and not 3,350 tonnes, as mentioned in media reports.

The work for finding gold reserves in Sonbhadra started in the year 1992-93 after the Central Geological Survey of India took over. Reportedly, it was the British who first initiated the process to find gold reserve in Sonbhadra region.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-issues-notice-to--sonbhadra-mining-officer.html
118,24-2-20,Sunni Waqf Board to meet today,"Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board will meet in Lucknow on Monday to decide whether to accept the five acres of land allotted by the UP government for construction of a mosque in Ayodhya.

The Supreme Court, in its verdict on November 9 last year, had directed the government to allocate an alternative land at a prominent location in Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque.

“The board may also announce a trust for construction of a mosque. The trust can be named Indo-Islamic Culture Foundation,” sources said. They said the board would not only decide whether to accept the land but also about the usage of the land if it decided to take possession. There are several proposals like building a hospital or school at the site.

The Uttar Pradesh government has allotted a 5-acre plot for the mosque at Dhannipur village in Sohawal tehsil of Ayodhya district, nearly 25 kilometres away from the Ram Janmabhoomi temple complex. Litigants in the Babri case said that the land allotted by the UP government was far away from Ayodhya town and the government should find some other land at a closer location, otherwise they would be left with no alternative but to approach the Supreme Court once again.

“The site for the mosque is too far from Ayodhya. It will be difficult for people to go that far to offer Namaz. The decision should be reconsidered and the land must be allotted at a nearby place,” Haji Mahboob, one of the litigants, said.

In a historic decision, the Supreme Court had on November 9 last year directed the Central government to hand over the disputed site at Ayodhya for the construction of Ram temple and set up a trust for the same.

The apex court had also directed the government to give a suitable plot of land measuring five acres to the Sunni Waqf Board.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sunni-waqf-board--to-meet-today.html

The US president will be on a two-day visit to India and together with Modi is to participate in a roadshow in Ahmedabad after landing there.

""India looks forward to welcoming @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. It is an honour that he will be with us tomorrow, starting with the historic programme in Ahmedabad,"" Modi wrote on Twitter.

He was responding to a tweet by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani that said ""entire Gujarat speaks in one voice- #NamasteTrump"".

On Monday, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi will take part in a 22-km roadshow from the Ahmedabad international airport. Then they will proceed for the 'Namaste Trump' event at the newly built Sardar Patel Stadium in the city's Motera area, where over one lakh people are expected to be present.

The US President will visit Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad on Monday before heading towards a cricket stadium where he will address over 1,00,000 people.

Sabarmati Ashram was a key base of Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle. He lived there between 1917 and 1930. The US president will later fly down to Agra to visit Taj Mahal and thereafter fly to Delhi for the official engagements where ""major trade deals"" are expected to be signed by the two sides.

On the morning of February 25, the US president and first lady Melania Trump will be accorded a ceremonial welcome at the forecourt of the 'Rashtrapati Bhavan'. From there, they will go to Raj Ghat to pay homage at the 'samadhi' of Mahatma Gandhi. It will be followed by restricted and delegation-level talks between Trump and Modi at Hyderabad House. 'Namaste Trump' will be similar to the landmark 'Howdy, Modi!' event hosted by the Indian-American community in honour of Prime Minister Modi during his visit to Houston in September 2019, said an official. Trump, accompanied by wife Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, will arrive in Ahmedabad around noon on Monday for a little less than 36-hour-long trip to India.

Sharma, however, went on to say that the visit was important in relation to the fact that the US was a major power, but that is all, Sharma said.

""So far I do not have any positive indication of any major outcome. It will be a continuation of defence and security cooperation, and a reaffirmation of our cooperation in space and nuclear sciences. It is ongoing and it will not be a new thing,"" Sharma told news agency PTI.

SM Krishna, who was external affairs minister during the UPA and is now in the BJP, felt though Trump's visit comes in the US presidential election year and a sizeable Indian expatriate population will vote, but ""it should not be looked at from the narrow prism of US President's election"".

""It needs to be looked at a larger perspective as to what is happening in the region,"" he told the news agency.

Krishna said China will be closely monitoring the visit and the nature of talks that take place.""It is a very important visit. The US and India have a very close and fruitful relationship especially after the Nuclear Accord. We have moved strategically close to each other and it is important for us to nourish and maintain the relationship further,"" he said.

Sharma said the Trump visit should also not be seen as an attempt to balance the rise of China.

""China is five times bigger than us. India is in no position to balance. The US has its own equations with China (which) one should not forget. They make noises but they reach agreements quickly. They have a trade agreement.

Rolling out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had said that double toll charge would be collected from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag.

In order to give prime importance to existing FASTag users, dissuade defaulters and further encourage adoption of FASTags by national highways commuters, vehicles without FASTags entering the FASTag lane are being charged double the toll fee, NHAI said in a statement.

""Till now, a total number of 18 lakh vehicles defaulted by encroaching FASTag lanes across India has resulted in a double charge cash toll accumulation of about Rs 20 crore,"" it said. RFID based FASTag, an electronic toll collection system implemented by the NHAI, has proved to be instrumental in easing the lives of commuters on national highways within two months of its nationwide implementation, it said. Over 1.55 crore FASTags have been issued through multiple Point of Sale (PoS) locations.

NHAI has been observing increased sale rate of FASTags which is a clear indication of this digital system being accepted well, the statement said.

As a result, FASTag transaction has crossed a landmark count of 4 million per day, it added.

The statement said FASTag resulted in smooth and hassle-free movement of FASTag users on highways. The implementation of FASTags across the country has met with the desired response so far, it said adding the adoption of FASTags also means that it has brought in the much-needed transparency in collection at toll booths.

In order to further increase digital collection of user fee via FASTag at national highways fee plazas, NHAI has recently waived off the FASTag cost of Rs 100 for NHAI FASTag from February 15, 2020 to February 29, 2020.

Any road users can visit any authorised physical point-of-sale locations with a valid Registration Certificate (RC) of the vehicle and get a NHAI FASTag free of cost.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fastag-lanes--nhai-collects-rs-20-cr-from-18l-defaulters.html

Addressing his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' radio address, Modi referred to Tamil poetess Avvaiyar to drive home his point. “What we know is just a handful of sand. What we do not know is like a universe in itself,” he said quoting her. Similar is the case with the biodiversity of this country, said Modi.

We have to preserve it, conserve it and explore further,” he said. The Prime Minister said the traditions and the legacy we have inherited teaches us compassion toward all living beings and boundless love for nature.

Modi pointed out that more than 500 bird species across the world land in India every year.

He informed that recently, biologists discovered a new species of fish whose habitat is within the caves of Meghalaya. It is believed that this fish is the largest among aquatic species found under the surface of caves. ""It a matter of joy that India, and especially Meghalaya, is home to a rare species. It lends a new facet to India's biodiversity. We are surrounded by many such mysteries, which are still undiscovered. To discover such a phenomenal enigma calls for fierce detective passion,"" he said.

In his address, the Prime Minister also referred to the 'Hunar Haat' organised by the Ministry of Minority Affairs at the Rajpath. Last week Modi made a surprise visit to the Haat where he interacted

with people, had litti-chokha for lunch and enjoyed a hot kulhad of tea. He said the Haat is a fine example of India's diverse expanse, cultures, traditions, cuisines and the warmth of emotions.

""It is a venue where it is impossible to overlook the country's diversity. Besides handicrafts, it displays the diversity of India's varied cuisine too. In a single row, one could savour the sight of idli-dosa, chhole-bhature, daal-baati, khaman-khandvi ...,"" he said, urging people to visit such haats to be a part of the country's art-culture canvas. ""You will also contribute in the progress and prosperity of hardworking craft persons, especially women,"" he said.

PM also hailed the use of a mixture of 10 per cent indigenously produced bio-jet fuel to fly an Indian Air Force transport aircraft, saying such efforts will not only help bring down carbon emissions, but also reduce the country's dependence on imported crude oil. ""This was the first time that this mix was used in both engines. Not just that, the airport from which this plane took off from Leh is not only one of the highest altitude airports in India but also in the world,"" he said, referring the Indian Air Force's AN-32 aircraft took off from Leh's Kushok Bakula Rimpoche airport using a mixture of 10 per cent Indian bio-jet fuel.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/conserve-biodiversity--says-pm.html

In the wee hours on Wednesday, the Baloch groups killed 16 Pakistan armymen and abducted about 50 soldiers. This was the third such attack by Balochs against Pak Army this month.

The spurt in ambushes by the Baloch groups against Pak army has come in the backdrop of apprehensions that more and camps of LeT will be set up and lead to enhancement of atrocities against the community.

135,24-2-20,Pawar trying to implicate Hindutvawadis: Fadnavis,"BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday alleged that NCP chief Sharad Pawar was trying to implicate ‘Hindutvawadis’ (Hindutva supporters) in the Koregaon Bhima violence case despite the absence of any concrete evidence.

Fadnavis made the allegation while talking to reporters a day before the Budget session of the Maharashtra legislature commences.

“During my tenure, the state home department had carried out a thorough probe into the Koregaon Bhima violence case,” the former chief minister, who also held the home portfolio then, said.

“NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s first reaction on the violence was that Hindutvawadis were behind it. But police did not find any evidence to back up his claims,” he said.

“The entire investigation and its progress has not been objected either by the Bombay High Court or by the Supreme Court. Still by setting up a separate SIT, Pawar wants to implicate Hindutvawadis in the Koregaon Bhima violence incident,” Fadnavis alleged.

According to Pune police, the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, was supported by Maoists and inflammatory speeches made at the event led to caste violence at Koregaon Bhima war memorial in the district the next day.

Right wing leaders Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide are accused in Koregaon Bhima case.

The Pune Police have arrested Left-leaning activists Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao in the Elgar Parishad case for their alleged Maoist links.

Pawar had earlier termed the arrest of activists in the Elgar Parishad case as “wrong” and “vengeful”, and demanded that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) be set up to probe the action taken by the Pune police.Replying to a query over it, Fadnavis said, “The Maharashtra police have found a strong evidence that urban Naxal issue is not restricted to Maharashtra alone. It has spread in other parts of the country as well. Hence handing over its probe to the NIA is a welcome move of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pawar-trying-to-implicate-hindutvawadis--fadnavis.html
136,24-2-20,Ex-Maha CM attacks Pawar for demanding trust for mosque,"Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday attacked NCP chief Sharad Pawar over his demand for creation of a trust for construction of a mosque in Ayodhya on the lines of a similar body for Ram temple.

Speaking to reporters here on the eve of the Budget session of the Maharashtra legislature, Fadnavis asked why Pawar wanted to build a mosque in the name of a invader like Babar.

“Babar (the first emperor of Mughal dynasty in Indian sub-continent) was an invader. Why on the earth did NCP chief Sharad Pawar want to erect a new mosque in the name of Babar? If Muslims want a place for prayer, they should have one but why in the name of Babar?” asked Fadnavis, the Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.

Speaking in Lucknow on February 20, Pawar demanded the Central Government to form a trust for building a mosque in Ayodhya similar to the trust to oversee the construction of Ram temple.

“I also wonder why Pawar demanded a trust for a mosque when he knows that a Waqf has to be formed for the same,” Fadnavis said.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in November 2019 ruled unanimously in favor of Ram temple in Ayodhya. The court had said the whole disputed land spread over 2.7-acre will be handed over to a trust formed by the government, which will examine the construction of Ram temple at the place.

137,24-2-20,First see what’s happening under your watch: Uddhav to BJP,"Hours after the BJP criticised The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) dispensation over the law and order situation, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray hit back at the party saying that those targeting his Government should first see what is happening under their watch.

He asked why no “terrorist” (assailant) involved in the attack on students at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) last month has been arrested so far by the BJP-ruled Centre.

Thackeray was talking to reporters on the eve of the Budget session of the Maharashtra legislature.

Earlier in the day, the State BJP criticised his government over the recent incidents of crime against women.

When asked about the BJP’s allegations, Thackeray said, “Every crime against women is condemnable and not a single such incident should occur again.”

“While targeting us, the BJP should also see what is happening in the States ruled by it. Especially in the centrally-ruled New Delhi, where terrorists stormed the JNU and beat the students,” he said.

“I am going to call those assailants as terrorists. Despite so many days, not a single assailant has been arrested so far,” he said.

“Those targeting us on unjustified grounds should first see what is happening under their watch and then comment about us,” Thackeray added.Thirty-four people, including students and faculty, were injured on January 5 when a masked mob entered the JNU campus and attacked them with rods and sledgehammers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/first-see-what---s-happening-under-your-watch--uddhav-to-bjp.html
138,24-2-20,Uddhav to unveil first list of farm loan waiver today,"As the Budget session of the Maharashtra Legislature gets underway on Monday, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government will put its best foot forward on the first day by releasing the first list of farm loan waiver beneficiaries, even as the Opposition BJP will go all out to drive a wedge between the ruling Shiv Sena and its alliance partners — NCP and Congress — over the contentious issues like the CAA, NPR and Veer Savarkar.

Addressing a news conference after the Opposition BJP boycotted the customary tea hosted by him on the eve of the Legislature session, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that as part of the first list of farm loan waiver, the State Government will write off loans up to Rs 2 lakh each taken by farmers across the State.

“Tomorrow, we will announce the first list of list of farm loan waiver beneficiaries with dues up to Rs 2 lakh each. Unlike the previous BJP-led Government (of which my party was a part) which had made farm loan waiver without home work and did not execute its announcement, we have planned the loan waiver scheme well. We will complete the execution of the entire loan waiver process within three months,” Uddhav said.

Dismissing the criticism of his Government by the Opposition BJP on various counts, Uddhav said: “I do not think it is necessary for me to respond to the issues raised by the Opposition. Just because it criticises the Government does not make it a good opposition. At a time when the government is doing good work, it is improper on the Opposition’s part to say that the Government is not doing anything.”

Charging that the Opposition BJP could not stomach the fact the ruling MVA was providing a stable government in the state, Uddhav said: “Our is not a government that is counting

days.

The BJP is unable to stomach the fact that ours is a stable government. We have not just made promises, but we are implementing out promises. The people in the state think that it is their Government”.

“We are implementing a people-friendly initiate like Shiv Bhojan Yojana ( Rs 10 a meal scheme). Still the Opposition is criticising us. Here is a party (BJP) that did not did anything good for the people when it was in power. We are getting good response for the Shiv Bhojan Yojana. We are planning to enlarge the scope ofthis scheme in the coming days,” the Chief Minister said.

Among other things, Uddhav said that the state government was planning to come out with a legislation along the lines of the the Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law Amendment Act 2019 – better known as the Andhra Pradesh Disha law, which stipulates death sentences to convicts in rape cases within 21 days. “We have set a five-member official committee to study the Andhra Pradesh law and come out with a report on the proposed legislation that we intend out to introduce in the State Legislature,” he said.

Informed sources in the Opposition BJP said that its leaders would go out all the way to corner the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress front Government over contentious like Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and Veer Savarkar.

Talking to media persons after boycotting the session-eve hosted by the Chief Minister, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis — in an apparent effort to exploit the differences among the ruling MVA partners on contentious issues – dared Uddhav to move a resolution on the floor of the State Legislature to hail the contributions of Veer Savarkar on the occasion of the latter’s death anniversary on February 26”.

Slamming the Uddhav Thackeray dispensation for not being able to come grips with the challenges facing his government, Fadnavis said: “Three months have passed but the MVA Government is still in a state of confusion. It has not implemented the promises it made in the run-up to the Assembly elections. Though it announced it would waive the loans of farmers. But, it has not begun implementation of farm loan waiver scheme”.

“The Government has lost its control over the increasing atrocities against women. The Government is not sensitive at all when it comes to women issues. The government is trying to erode the morale of the police force in the State...This Government has stayed the implementation of various decisions taken by our government like the water grid and our flagship schemes like Gram Sadak yojana and Jal Yukt Shivara. The Shiv Sena is not ready to speak on the insults being heaped by the NCP and Congress on the descendents of Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji,” Fadnavis said.

On its part, the ruling MVA is preparing to dig up alleged irregularities in several schemes, including Fadnavis’ pet project “Jal Yukt Shivara”, implemented by the previous BJP-led saffron alliance government. During the course of the budget session, the state government is expected to either order inquiries or come out with details of corruption in the earlier Government.

144,24-2-20,"Another incident of assault on dalit youths in Raj, 5 held","Three dalit youths were assaulted after being accused of stealing donkeys in Jaisalmer district, the third such incident to come to light in Rajsthan in recent days.

Five persons have been arrested and three detained after a video of the incident surfaced, police said on Sunday.

The incident occurred on February 15 in Rama village of Fatehgarh tehsil of the district.

The youths were thrashed with sticks and kicked by nearly a dozen people for stealing donkeys. They were later handed over to Sangarh police.

“Five persons have been arrested and three minors have been detained so far. A case has been registered in the matter under sections of SC/ST Act and further investigation in the matter is on,” Station House Officer (SHO) of Sangarh police station Ugam Raj Soni said.

Similar incidents had come to light in Nagaur and Barmer

A chilling video of a man being beaten up brutally in Barmer allegedly for committed a theft had gone viral here, prompting the police to arrest a man and detain another on Friday for their alleged roles in the crime.

The video surfaced on Thursday close on the heels of brutal assault on two Dalit youths on similar allegation of theft in Nagaur.

The Barmer incident occurred on January 29.

Police have arrested at least seven persons in connection with the Nagaur case which occurred on February 16.

The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft.

In the video, a group of men is seen thrashing two persons with rubber belts. They later dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of the victims.

The incidents have triggered a political storm in Rajasthan with the BJP attacking the ruling Congress.

Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has alleged that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government is unable to rein in crime in Rajasthan.

Siddhu Koda, a 40-year-old CPI (Maoist) zonal commander, died at a hospital where he was admitted late Saturday night after he complained of pain in chest and abdomen, Deputy Inspector General of Police Manu Maharaj said.

Koda, who hailed from Chakai block of Jamui district, was arrested Saturday morning from a railway station in Jharkhand's Dumka by an STF team comprising policemen from Patna and

Jamui.

He was wanted in about 70 serious cases including murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion, Maharaj said.

After being brought here, Koda was interrogated, the DIG said. Based on the information he provided, raids were conducted in various parts of naxal-affected Munger district leading to the seizure of a large number of arms and ammunition, Maharaj said.

The Maoist, who carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh in Bihar and Rs 10 lakh in Jharkhand, complained of severe pain in chest and abdomen around 11 pm on Saturday.

He was taken to Jamui Sadar Hospital where he died. Since he died in police custody, the post-mortem examination was conducted in presence of a magistrate as per rules, the DIG said.

148,24-2-20,"People fatigued with bureaucratic, proxy rule in J&K: NPP","Accusing the Jammu & Kashmir administration of failure to address the basic issues of the people, National Panthers Party (NPP) on Sunday said the public were fatigued with the ‘bureaucratic and proxy’ rule and called for early restoration of democracy in the Union Territory.

NPP chairman and former minister Harsh Dev Singh said elected representatives alone could appreciate the concerns of the public as against the “outside bureaucrats” who hardly have any accountability to the people.

“The general masses were fatigued with the bureaucratic rule. There is a need to end the proxy rule (of BJP) and early restoration of democracy in the erstwhile State,” he said addressing a public meeting in Domana and Gho Manhasan here.

He said the advisors to Lieutenant Governor G C Murmu and secretaries were organising 'public hearing' campaigns but these had “failed to inspire the people in view of their lack of productivity”.

“The cosmetic public hearing exercise by the advisors and secretaries and the sojourns of central ministers had failed to inspire the masses who missed the much needed delivery on the ground,” Singh said.

He appealed the Lt Governor to put on the official website of various departments, the details of representations received in various public interaction programmes,

issues discussed therein and action taken in pursuance thereof so as to make the 'public hearings' relevant and meaningful.

Claiming that bureaucratic rule in the erstwhile state had proved a “flop show”, Singh claimed people were fast losing faith in the present dispensation which had failed to address even their basic concerns.

“With people across the new UT protesting on a day-to-day basis for uninterrupted power and adequate water supply, restoration of roads and other essential services, there did not appear to be any takers for their shrill cries,” he

said.

The NPP leader said the public interaction campaigns of advisors and secretaries had also proved to be “exercises in futility”, like the two successive 'Back to Village' programmes earlier.

Decrying the withdrawal of election notification for vacant panchayat seats after having announced the poll dates, Singh said there were several other instances to show that the present regime was moving in fits and starts accompanied by reverses.

“People were repeatedly assured of domicile law for J&K in public meetings by helmsmen and BJP leaders only to be told in the Parliament that the Centre had no proposal in this regard,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/people-fatigued-with-bureaucratic--proxy-rule-in-j-k--npp.html
149,24-2-20,Kolkata ‘hottest zone’: Study,"A 16-year study conducted by the researchers of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, have made a frightening revelation that rampant deforestation and construction have made Kolkata an extremely heated zone —the “hottest island” of the country.

The study says that rapid urbanisation and deforestation have made the City of Joy the “hottest of all the urban heated islands.” While an extended spell of winter has still kept the Kolkatans away from the “burning reality” a sweltering and harsh summer is awaiting the people of the city which till a couple of decades ago would not see the summer temperature climb beyond 36-37 degrees.

Unregulated urbanisation has let Kolkata’s temperature climb more than 2 degrees in the past three decades, experts say. A study conducted by IIT-k researchers between 2001 and 2017 have revealed that while day and night temperature of the urban centres including Kolkata has gone up remarkably the difference between day and night temperatures has decreased implying a rise in mean temperature, experts said.

This is a trend in 44 big cities of the country including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune, Guwahati etc the study has said. While average temperature of the other cities have risen by about 2 degrees in the past 30 years that of Kolkata has gone up even more than that the study conducted by IIT’s Centre for Oceans Reverse, Atmosphere and Land Science said.

Laxman Singh, younger brother of senior Congressman and former MP Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, said there has been enough “discussions and agitations” on the CAA.

Laxman Singh is the Congress MLA from Chachoda seat in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh.

“There has been enough discussions, agitations and protests in the country regarding the CAA, which has now become a law. It needs a majority in Parliament to make any change in the law. But (the opposition) doesn't have a majority. In my view, it will be fair to accept this law.”

He said Parliament did not belong to any one party, adding that the Congress too changed laws “when we had a Government at the Centre”.

“How would we (Congress) have felt if any state government had opposed it (legislations),” he asked.

Queried on CAA in Congress-ruled MP, Singh said the law will have to be implemented in every state since the country worked under a parliamentary system.

Singh also demanded a change in the venue of IIFA awards ceremony to be held in late March in Daly College here.

“Organising the IIFA awards ceremony in Madhya Pradesh is a good because it will give recognition to the state and increase employment opportunities. But, it is not appropriate to hold this function in Daly College during examinations as it will affect students.”

Singh is also the chairman of the select committee set up to discuss the “Madhya Pradesh Gowansh Vadh Pratishedh (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam 2019”, a law to ban cow slaughter, presented in the Legislative Assembly.

The incident occurred on Thursday and the 22-year-old accused was arrested late Saturday night by the Shivaji Nagar Police.

152,24-2-20,DoT’s test checks on variations in telcos AGR dues standard audit procedure: COAI,"Terming “test checks” proposed by the Government on telcos’ AGR arithmetic as standard audit procedure, Industry body COAI has said the DoT needs to ensure consistency among its different circles on calculation of dues to minimise any differences.

Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) also cautioned that any decision to encash bank guarantees will be “disastrous” for the telecom industry, which only has three private players.

“Any move to encash bank guarantees will precipitate an already precarious situation,” COAI Director General, Rajan Mathews told PTI.

Mathews termed the ‘test checks’ being proposed by the telecom department to examine deviation in calculation of dues by companies as a “standard audit procedure”.

He pointed out that while amounts need to be finalised as soon as possible, operators too should be given a fair opportunity to explain the deviations in calculation.

“There should be consistency amongst all LSAs (Licensed Service Areas) of the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) on how the amounts are calculated, so the differences are minimised,” Mathews added. The Government has made it clear that it will verify the companies’ claims on AGR math and examine any deviations from its own calculation, through random ‘test checks’ before March 17.

The Government will conduct ‘test check’ for any one year (of telcos’ dues) to examine variances between telecom companies’ assessment and the government’s own calculation of AGR liabilities.

The test check will happen for all telecom firms, but could start with those, which have already claimed they have made full and final settlement towards their statutory liabilities, like Tata Teleservices.

In all, as many as 15 entities owe the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore — Rs 92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court earlier this month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd for extension in the payment schedule and asked them to deposit an estimated Rs 1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences.

The apex court had warned that it will initiate contempt proceedings against top executives of these firms for non-payment.

Some telecom firms are already struggling with mounting losses and debt, and the additional liability has raised concerns of them defaulting on existing loans. Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea owe about 60 per cent. Vodafone Idea is confronted with total AGR dues of over Rs 53,000 crore. Of this, it has so far paid only Rs 3,500 crore in two tranches earlier this week.

Airtel has so far paid Rs 10,000 crore out of its estimated liability of over Rs 35,000 crore.Tata Teleservices has paid Rs 2,197 crore, the entire outstanding it believes to have arisen after the October ruling of the apex court for calculating dues.

Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra have submitted to the government the details of calculation in support of its payment, but sources in the DoT said that wide gap between the company’s calculation and the department’s assessment of about Rs 14,000 crore, will certainly be examined.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/dot---s-test-checks-on-variations-in-telcos-agr-dues-standard-audit-procedure--coai.html

She called upon the G20 countries to ensure that the consensus solution being developed by G20 inclusive framework for addressing tax challenges arising from digitalisation is truly inclusive, according to tweets by the Finance Ministry.

The Finance Minister emphasised on the need for a closer collaboration between revenue agencies to investigate tax affairs of offenders who cross-borders for escaping tax investigation, a tweet said.

During the second day of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Riyadh, Sitharaman highlighted the efforts undertaken by the Government of India to deepen the corporate bond market, such as removal of capital controls for identified categories of government securities (G-Secs) and increased Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) limit on the corporate bond market.

The Finance Minister said she looked forward to continued engagement with G20 on this agenda.

According to the tweets, Sitharaman explained the steps being taken to reform the credit default swap market, changing the method of buying and selling bonds electronically through exchanges, and facilitating on-tap issuances for all, among others, for further enabling greater investments in India’s bond market.

Speaking during the session on infrastructure investment, Sitharaman welcomed the efforts underway in G20 to develop infrastructure technology — the InfraTech Agenda.

However, she also cautioned that G20 should refrain from developing any common prescriptive approach since various countries are at varied stages of adoption of technology in infrastructure, according to the tweets.

The Minister highlighted successful Indian experience in the area of adoption of technology in infrastructure such as FASTags. She also pointed out the efforts being taken for installation of smart energy meters across India to reduce revenue leakages.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/global-community-has-opportunity-to-design-new-int---l-taxation--nirmala.html
154,24-2-20,FM apprises G-20 on steps taken to boost Indian bond market,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday apprised the G-20 countries on the steps taken in the Union Budget to open up India’s bond market.

During the Finance Ministers & Central Bank Governors meeting in Riyadh, she outlined the efforts taken to deepen India’s bond market such as removal of capital controls for identified categories of G-Secs and increased FPI limit on corporate bond market in the session on “Financial Resilience & Development” on the second day of the conference, the Finance Ministry said.

FPI limits with respect to investment in corporate bonds are proposed to be increased to 15 per cent. This may be a step towards local bond inclusion in global indices and internationalisation of the rupee.

The Finance Minister’s announcement should help boost investments in the Indian debt market, the Ministry said, adding Sitharaman looked forward to continued engagement with the G20 on this agenda.

Hiking the FPI limit in corporate bonds and concessional tax rate on interest income earned by FPIs are among the steps that can increase capital flows into the market.

To promote a deep and liquid market, the government has announced that a netting legislation would be formulated to expand the scope of the corporate default swaps market. This would also significantly help banks manage their capital requirements and exposure monitoring.

Sitharaman also congratulated the G20’s Saudi Presidency for identifying development of capital markets as a priority area.

155,24-2-20,Natural gas prices in India likely to be cut by steep 25% from April,"Natural gas prices in India are likely to be cut by a steep 25 per cent beginning April, in line with the slump in global rates, sources said.

The price of most of the natural gas produced by state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd, which account for the bulk of India’s existing gas output, is likely to be cut to around $2.5 per million British thermal unit for the six-month period beginning April 1, from $3.23 as of now.

This will be the second reduction in six months and will reduce rates to the lowest in two-and-half-years.

Sources said the price of gas produced from difficult fields too is likely to be cut to $5.50 from $8.43 per mmBtu now.

Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months — on April 1 and October 1 each year.

The rates, besides dictating the price of urea, electricity and CNG, also decide the revenue of gas producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).

Natural gas price was last cut by 12.5 per cent on October 1. Rates were cut to $3.23 per mmBtu from earlier $3.69. For difficult fields, the rates were cut from an all-time high of $9.32 per mmBtu to $8.43.

Sources said the reduction would impact revenues of India’s biggest producer ONGC as well as Reliance Industries and its partner BP plc which plan to start gas production from their ‘second-wave’ of discoveries in eastern offshore KG-D6 block from mid-2020.

The cut in price will lower the earnings of producers like ONGC but will also lead to a reduction in the price of CNG, which uses natural gas as input.

It would also lead to lower cost of natural gas piped to households (PNG) for cooking purposes as well as of feedstock cost for the manufacturing of fertilisers and petrochemicals.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/natural-gas-prices-in-india-likely-to-be-cut-by-steep-25--from-april.html

“We have given directions to the district education officers (DEOs) to set up POCSO cells in all schools of the state, starting March 1...

“There will be a committee headed by the headmaster in each school, which will look into the complaints and take necessary action, according to the provisions of POCSO Act,” Kiran Kumari, special project officer, Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC), told PTI.

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 aims to punish those engaging in sexual crimes against children, while safeguarding their interests at every stage of the judicial process.

In the first phase, the units would be established in secondary schools, she said, adding that the model would be later replicated in primary and middle schools.

Each committee will have the school principal or headmaster, a senior school teacher, a panchayati raj representative, a girl student, a boy student and a clerk as its members, Kumar explained.

“A student can either directly submit a written complaint of sexual exploitation or misconduct to the committee or leave it in the complaint box, with or without mentioning his or identity. The complaint box will be opened once every week.

“If the committee deems fit, the complaint will be forwarded to the nearest police station. It will be the panel’s job to find out the identity of the complainant at the time of lodging of an FIR. As per POCSO rules, confidentiality of the complainant will be maintained,” she said

Dr Nusratullah Warsi aka Dada (55), a property dealer, was shot dead on Saturday night at about 10:45 pm and an FIR against two people was filed in this connection on a written complaint of his family members.

According to police, it appears to be a case of murder due to monetary and property dispute and they are searching for both the accused.

Dr Kafeel Khan, suspended doctor of Gorakhpur BRD Medical College, was last month arrested under charges of giving a provocative speech during a protest against the CAA and NRC at Aligarh Muslim University and was later charged with the National Security Act.

Warsi on Saturday evening had gone to his lawyer Siraj Tariq’s house, a few metres away from his own house, and was returning home on foot when a man shot him in his head, killing him

on the spot.

“On the written complaint of family members, case of murder against one Imammuddin and Anil Sonkar has been registered and police has initiated probe and is searching for both the accused. Police met the women in their house and is interrogating them,” Circle Officer VP Singh said.

Prima facie it appears to be a case of property and money dispute, he said, adding, three teams have been constituted to investigate the case and soon the accused will be caught.

Dr Kafeel Khan had last month raised apprehension in a Mumbai court about being killed in an “encounter” by the Uttar Pradesh police after claiming that he had been “falsely” implicated in the case by them.

159,24-2-20,Present generation lucky to witness creation of Ram temple: Yogi,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Aadityanath on Sunday described the country's present generation as a ‘lucky’ one for being part of the struggle for having a Lord Ram temple in Ayodhya and being witness to its construction.

The Chief Minister made the remark during his first visit to the temple town after the September 9 verdict of the Supreme Court last year on the Ayodhya dispute that resolved the centuries-old tangle and subsequent setting up of a trust by the central Government to oversee the construction of the

temple.

The Chief Minister was here to inaugurate a health fair, Mukhya Mantri Aarogya Mela, at Suraj Kund in Darshan Nagar area of Faizabad.

Addressing a gathering of Hindu seers after inaugurating the Health Fair, Aditynath said, “Many generations perished in the struggle for the Ram Janambhoomi in last 500 years, but our generation is lucky as we have been the part of the Ram Janambhoomi struggle and we will see the Ram Mandir coming up.”

Commenting on the apex court's verdict over the Ayodhya dispute, the chief minister said, “The Supreme Court has shown its judicial power to the world by its verdict over the issue of Ram Mandir.”

The Chief Minister also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government “for delivering what he promised” including nullification of Article 370 and revocation of Jammu & Kashmir's special status.

“I always told saints of Ayodhya to have trust in Prime Minister Modi as under his leadership, we will achieve our goal of having a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.”

“Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India is emerging as a power in the world. The prime minister abrogated Article 370 and prohibited the practice of triple talaq,” he said.

“He also amended the Citizenship law to create a completely transparent system of giving shelter to the suffering humanity of the world, and under his strong leadership, a way has been paved for the construction of grand temple of Bhagvan Shri Ram in Ayodhya,” the chief minister added.

In Ayodhya, Adityanath also visited the residence of a Dalit community man, Mahaveer, with whom he had lunch when he had come to the temple town during 2019 Lok Sabha elections after being banned by the Election Commission from electioneering.

160,24-2-20,"Sunni Waqf Board meeting today, decision on mosque land likely","The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board is likely to take a decision in its meeting on Monday regarding the land given by the State Government for construction of a mosque.

“We have already said about honouring the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya issue,” board chairman Zufar Farooqui told PTI on Sunday.

“The meeting of the board will deliberate upon the documents pertaining to allotment of land by the government. A decision will also be taken as to what should be built on that piece of land,” Farooqui said.

Asked about Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma's offer regarding formation of a trust for construction of a mosque, Farooqui said: “The government formed the trust for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the directives of the Supreme Court. No such instructions were issued for the mosque. This offer will be discussed in the board's meeting.” On Friday, the board had said that it did not have the option to reject the alternative piece of land given to it under the Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict, but would decide how to use it when it meets on Monday.

In a historic verdict in November on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a temple. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque within Ayodhya.

Soon after the verdict, there were suggestions that the board should not accept the land.

“Following the Supreme Court verdict, the Sunni Waqf Board does not have the choice of rejecting the five-acre alternative land for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya as it would amount to contempt of court,” Farooqui had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sunni-waqf-board-meeting-today--decision-on-mosque-land-likely.html
161,24-2-20,DGP: Ceasefire violations by Pak rises manifold to push terrorists into J&K,"Ceasefire violations by Pakistan has increased manifold to push armed terrorists into Jammu & Kashmir and sabotage peace, DGP Dilbag Singh said on Sunday, asserting that the security grid is strong to foil the neighbouring nation's designs.

The Union Territory's director general of police (DGP) also said a few successful infiltration bids were made by terrorists but they were neutralised in the Kashmir Valley during counter-insurgency operations.

“The ceasefire violations by Pakistan has increased manifold with an aim to push as many terrorists into this side to sabotage the peaceful atmosphere.

“Despite increased ceasefire violations, we are alert to the challenge and have already foiled a number of infiltration attempts,” Singh told reporters after inaugurating the 9th Police Martyr's Memorial Inter Club T-20 Cricket Championship in Kathua district.

The security grid along the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) is strong to scuttle Pakistan's designs and ensure further improvement in the overall security situation in the coming months, he said.

Referring to the Nagrota encounter along the Jammu-Srinagar national highway near here on January 31, the DGP said the three Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists were neutralized hours after they managed to sneak into the Indian side.

“Our security grid is very strong and we are prepared to foil Pakistani attempts to push terrorists into this side,” Singh said.

The DGP expressed satisfaction over the drop in number of local youths joining terrorist ranks.

“The inclination of local youth to join terrorism in the Valley is on the decline,” he said.

Asked whether a rehabilitation policy for them is under consideration, Singh said the government is already working on different plans for youth engagement and their development.

“There are skill development programmes. Sport activities are getting a big boost with proper infrastructure and training,” he said. Singh lauded the people for their timely inputs regarding terrorist activities and said they will continue their support to the forces to wipe out terrorism from Jammu & Kashmir.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/dgp--ceasefire-violations-by-pak-rises-manifold-to-push-terrorists-into-j-k.html
162,24-2-20,Schools in Kashmir set to reopen today,"Schools in Kashmir are scheduled to reopen on Monday after remaining shut for nearly seven months following the abrogation of Article 370.

Officials of the Jammu & Kashmir education department said all arrangements had been put in place for the students to attend schools after the institutions remained shut for months since August after scrapping of its special status and due to winter break.

The Government had made several efforts last year to reopen the schools in a phased manner, but it failed to bear any fruit as the parents kept their wards at home due to apprehensions about their safety.

Towards the end of the year, few schools opened, but students were asked to attend classes without wearing school uniforms.

Kashmir School Education Director Mohammad Younis Malik said all arrangements had been put in place and the timing for the schools falling within Srinagar's municipal limits will be 10am-3pm, while in the rest of Kashmir division, the timing will be 10.30am-3.30pm.

The director urged the teachers to work with dedication for building capacities of the students for their better future. “It's our responsibility to extend our support to them and redouble efforts to get their syllabus completed well in time,” the director said.

He instructed the field officers to visit schools regularly to monitor the follow up of academic planner for timely accomplishment of the set targets.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/schools-in-kashmir-set-to-reopen-today.html
163,24-2-20,AAP to contest panchayat polls this year in UP,"Buoyed by its decisive victory in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has decided to turn its focus on Uttar Pradesh as it outlined its plans on Sunday to recruit 25-lakh members in the politically-crucial State and contest the panchayat polls later this year.

AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh said party workers would visit 1.07-lakh villages in the state during the next three months, and gather public opinion and information on issues that affect people.

“The entire feedback will be submitted to Kejriwal after three months,” Singh told reporters.

The Rajya Sabha member said the Arvind Kejriwal-led party planned to make 25-lakh members in the state and, within a month, 5,000 posters of the party would be put up in every assembly constituency.

The membership drive will be held from Monday till March 22 in over 12,000 wards in various cities across the state. “AAP will contest the panchayat elections (likely in October-November) in UP,” he announced.

However, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma dismissed the claims made by the AAP, saying the party had talked about expanding itself in the past as well.The renewed focus to diversify the AAP across the country comes nearly two weeks after the party, founded in 2012, registered a decisive win in the Delhi assembly elections for a third consecutive term.

After its win in Delhi five years ago, the AAP had made moves to expand, but did not find much base.

For Uttar Pradesh, the AAP spokesperson said, five ministers with origins in the state have been made Ministers in Delhi Government.

“They will play a key role in various campaigns by the party,” he added.

Hitting out at the Adtiyanath Government, Singh claimed that law and order had ceased to exist in Uttar Pradesh and the youth was disappointed with the BJP Government.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had campaigned for the Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of the Delhi Assembly election. “The statements made by Adityanath and the action on CAA protesters are a sign of an unsuccessful chief minister,” Singh said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aap-to-contest-panchayat-polls-this-year-in-up.html
164,24-2-20,Lotteries to attract 28% GST from March 1,"A 28 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be levied on lotteries from March 1, according to a notification. The GST Council had in December last year decided to impose a single rate of 28 per cent on state-run and authorised lotteries.

The revenue department notified the GST rate on supply of lotteries and amended its earlier Central Tax (Rate) notification. Accordingly, the Central Tax rate for supply of lotteries has been amended to 14 per cent and a similar percentage will be levied by the states. This will take the total GST incidence on lotteries to 28 per cent.

“This notification shall come into force on the 1st day of March, 2020,” the revenue department notification said.

Currently, a state-run lottery attracts 12 per cent GST, while a state-authorised lottery attracts 28 per cent tax.

There were demands that a uniform tax rate should be imposed on lotteries following which a group of ministers were set up to suggest the GST rate. Following this, the GST Council in December voted for a single rate of 28 per cent on supply of lotteries.

AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said: “Gambling in the form of Lottery has been allowed in a few states, where it has penetrated at grass root levels, now changing the tax rate from a prospective date would help the dealers in effectively implementing the new tax rate”.

EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said a uniform rate on lottery brings a parity between state-run and authorized lotteries; thereby aligning an equal footing for businesses in the same line.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lotteries-to-attract-28--gst-from-march-1.html

170,24-2-20,"Egypt to try doctor, parents for female genital mutilation","Egypt's chief prosecutor Saturday referred a physician to criminal trial for allegedly mutilating the genitals of a 12-year-old girl, leading to her death, his office said.

The girl bled to death last month in the southern province of Assiut following a 30-minute surgery. Her death sparked a nationwide outcry.

Despite battling the practice for decades, Egypt has one of the highest rates of female genital mutilation, also known as female circumcision, in the world.

Many families fear that an uncircumcised daughter will be unable to marry.

Public prosecutor Hamada el-Sawy also referred the girl's parents to trial, according to a statement from his office. No date has been set for their trials.

The doctor, Ali Abdel-Fadeel, told investigators he was performing cosmetic surgery on the girl, according to the prosecutor's statement.

But that claim was refuted following an examination of the girl's body by forensic experts.

The state-run National Population Council said in 2019 that 82 per cent of girls under age 17 in Egypt have undergone the procedure.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa decided to hasten the probe into the April 21 attack which had proved crucial in his decisive electoral victory last November. Rajapaksa used the Easter Sunday terrorist attack to portray himself as the leader who could stop terrorism.

The voters gave him a big mandate and elected him as President in November last year. Rajapaksa stormed to victory, trouncing his nearest rival Sajith Premadasa by a margin of over 13 lakh votes - 52.25 per cent of votes polled against 41.99 per cent.

172,24-2-20,"CAIT may challenge stay on CCI probe against Amazon, Flipkart","Following the Karnataka High Court ordering a stay on the anti-trust probe against e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) is likely to file a petition challenging the stay in the Supreme Court in the coming week.

Speaking to IANS, Praveen Khandelwal, National General Secretary of CAIT said that the trade body’s lawyers are currently working on filing a petition.

“I hope by Thursday or Friday we will be able to file the petition. The lawyers are already working on it,” he said.

“We can go to Supreme Court, because that is the right forum as the High Court has given its order. Most likely, it will be Supreme Court,” Khandelwal told IANS.

On February 14, the Karnataka High Court ordered a stay on the CCI probe into violation of competition laws by e-commerce majors. The order came on the writ petition filed by Amazon seeking a stay on the investigation.

The High Court was of the view that the ongoing investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) should be completed first. Last year, the ED initiated insvestigation against both Amazon and Flipkart for alleged violation of the foreign exchange law.

The anti-trust body had in January ordered an enquiry into the operations of both Amazon and Flipkart on multiple counts, including deep discounts and exclusive tie-ups with preferred sellers.

Further, days after the Karnataka High Court ordered a stay, Walmart-backed Flipkart also moved the court urging it to set aside the probe. In its writ petition, Flipkart Internet Private Ltd said that although the High Court has ordered a stay on the investigation, the probe order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) “deserves to be set aside”.

It said that the CCI directed an investigation without the existence of a “prima facie” case. It further said that the order was passed in a pre-determined manner, by treating allegations of abuse of dominance as an anti-competitive agreement.

In its petition, Flipkart also questioned the “bona fides” of CAIT, which has been protesting against what it calls “deep discounts” by the e-commerce majors and reached out to the CCI and the government against them.

“The CCI is duty bound to act with caution, especially, in assessing the bona fides of the informant. In this, the petitioner submits that Confederation of All India Traders has repeatedly indulged in forum shopping against the petitioner by approaching various judicial forums, directly and through its sister entities raising exactly the same baseless allegations against the petitioner,” it said.

The organisation has time and again written to and met Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, among others, to register their protest against what it describes as deep discounting and unfair means by both the online platforms, which has impacted the offline traders. CAIT has blamed both the platforms of violating the norms for foreign direct investment (FDI).The traders body had staged protests across India during the visit of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to India last month.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/cait-may-challenge-stay-on-cci-probe-against-amazon--flipkart.html
173,24-2-20,US surpasses China to become India’s top trading partner,"The US has surpassed China to become India’s top trading partner, showing greater economic ties between the two countries.

According to the data of the commerce ministry, in 2018-19, the bilateral trade between the US and India stood at $87.95 billion.

During the period, India’s two-way commerce with China aggregated at $87.07 billion.

Similarly, during April-December 2019-20, the bilateral trade between the US and India stood at $68 billion. It stood at $64.96 billion with China in the same period.

Trade experts believe that the trend will continue in the coming years also as New Delhi and Washington are engaged in further deepening the economic ties. An expert said that if the countries will finalise a free trade agreement (FTA), then the bilateral trade would reach at different levels.

“FTA with US will be very beneficial for India as the US is the biggest market for domestic goods and services,” Federation of Indian Export organisations Director General Ajay Sahai said.

He said that India’s exports as well as imports are increasing with the US, while with China both are declining.

America is one of the few countries with which India has a trade surplus. On the other hand, India has a huge trade deficit with China.

In 2018-19, India has a trade surplus of $16.85 billion with America, while it has a deficit of $53.56 billion with the neighbouring country.

The data showed that China was India’s top trading partner since 2013-14 till 2017-18. Before China, UAE was the country’s largest trading nation.

A top American business advocacy group has said that a free trade agreement between India and the US is a key to resolving their trade disputes as it will cover biggest irritants in ties, including tariffs and mobility of Indian professionals. Professor at Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) Rakesh Mohan Joshi said that India should be a bit cautious while negotiating a trade pact with the US in areas, including agriculture and food products, as America is the world’s largest producer and exporter of certain commodities like maize and soybean.

“A trade deal between the US and India would further increase the trade between the two countries easing tariff restriction and opening up of bigger market for products. India is a major exporter of steel, steel products and aluminium products with combined exports of $22.7 billion last year.

“Steel exports to the US have continued to decline and it went down from $372 million in 2017-18 to $247 million last year. This is only 2.5 per cent of our overall $9.74 billion steel export to the world,” Pawan Gupta, the Founder and CEO of online trade platform Connect2India observed.

Commenting on trade with China, Gupta said despite the fall in volume exports to the Asian neighbour increased 25 per cent last year to $16.7 billion while imports decreased by around 8 per cent to $70.3 billion last year.

The major reduction in imports from India has been on electrical machinery, equipment and apparatus category, the CEO said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/us-surpasses-china-to-become-india---s-top-trading-partner.html

Global growth was poised for a modest rebound to 3.3 per cent this year, up from 2.9 per cent last year, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said at the meeting in the Saudi capital.

“The projected recovery... Is fragile,” Georgieva said.

“The COVID-19 virus -- a global health emergency -- has disrupted economic activity in China and could put the recovery at risk,” she said in a statement.

“I reported to the G20 that even in the case of rapid containment of the virus, growth in China and the rest of the world would be impacted.” Alarm has been growing over the new virus as Chinese authorities lock down millions of people to prevent its spread, with major knock-on effects economically. The virus has now claimed 2,345 lives in China, cutting off transportation, disrupting trade and fanning investor alarm as businesses are forced to close their doors. Georgieva told the two-day Riyadh gathering that the outbreak would shave about 0.1 percentage points from global growth and constrain China’s growth to 5.6 per cent this year.

The IMF chief urged G20 nations to cooperate to contain the spread of the virus.

“COVID-19 is a stark reminder of our interconnections and the need to work together,” Georgieva said. “In this regard, the G20 is an important forum to help put the global economy on a more sound footing.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-puts-global-economy-recovery-at-risk--imf-to-g20.html

Multiple American media outlets declared Sanders as the winner of the Nevada Caucus for the Democratic Party's presidential primary.

The 78-year-old senator from Vermont had 54 per cent of the county delegates available when several national news networks, including Fox news and MSNBC, called the race with only four per cent of precincts reporting.

When last reports came in, Sanders had garnered more than half of the votes, with former vice president Joe Biden trailing at 19 per cent.

""Breaking: We won Nevada! We are building an unprecedented grassroots movement, and together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,"" Sanders tweeted.

Sanders, who lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries in New Hampshire, had won the New Hampshire primary recently and was in a virtual tie with underdog Pete Buttigieg in Iowa.

Trump congratulated Sanders in a tweet.

""Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden and the rest look weak, and no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential debates,"" the president tweeted.

""Congratulations Bernie, and don't let them take it away from you!"" Trump tweeted.

""We did it! We won the Nevada caucus, and we won BIG!"" said Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Sanders.

""This win is our win, in large part because of the record number of donations and volunteer enthusiasm for Bernie in the state,"" he said.

Nevada is the first state with a diverse population to hold a nominating contest.

""In Nevada, and in New Hampshire and in Iowa - what we showed is that our volunteers are prepared to knock on hundreds and hundreds of thousands of doors,"" Sanders was quoted as saying by CNN in San Antonio.

""That no campaign has a grassroots movement like we do, which is another reason why we're going to win this election.""

""Trump and his friends think they are going to win this election,"" Sanders continued. ""They think they're going to win this election by dividing our people up, based on the colour of their skin, or where they were born, or their religion or their sexual orientation.

President Xi, who attended a meeting here to double efforts in coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak, said the epidemic ""has the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control"".

In comments reported by state broadcaster CCTV, Xi said, ""This is a crisis for us and it is a big test."" He called the epidemic China's ""largest public health emergency"".

The meeting, in the form of tele-conference, was presided over by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Xi acknowledged that the epidemic will ""inevitably have a large impact on the economy and society"", but he said the effects will be ""short-term"" and controllable.

Chinese health officials in worst-hit coronavirus hit Wuhan city ordered 14 days' quarantine for all recovered patients following reports that some of them tested positive for the virus after recovery.

Ninety-seven more people died in China due to coronavirus, taking the death toll to 2,442, officials said on Sunday, as a team of WHO experts visited the worst-affected Wuhan city in Hubei province.

By the end of Saturday, 76,936 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions, China's National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily update on Sunday.

Ninety-six deaths were reported from Hubei province for which Wuhan is the provincial capital and one from Guangdong province on Saturday besides 648 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections, it said.

Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December last, reported 630 new confirmed cases, taking the total confirmed cases in the hard-hit province to 64,084, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Officials in Wuhan ordered that all patients who have recovered and discharged from hospitals be sent to designated places for two weeks of quarantine and medical observation.

So far 15,299 people who were cured of the virus have been discharged from the hospitals in Wuhan. But they were all asked to go for two-week quarantine after some of them tested positive after being discharged from hospitals, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/coronavirus-china-s-biggest-health-emergency--xi.html
179,24-2-20,Sri Lankan FM to officially announce Colombo's withdrawal from UN resolution,"Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena will officially announce Colombo's withdrawal from co-sponsoring a 2015 UN Human Rights Council resolution on accountability for war crimes during his address at the council's session on Wednesday, according to his office.

Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution along with 11 other countries, including the US and Britain, calling for an investigation into alleged human rights violations during the island nation's civil war, which ended in 2009.

Gunawardena will make the announcement on Wednesday during his address at the 43rd Session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva.

Ahead of the Session, Foreign Secretary Ravinatha Aryasinha briefed the President of the UNHRC Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger in Geneva on Lanka's decision to withdraw from the resolution, the foreign ministry said Saturday.

Gunawardena will also respond to the oral update on Sri Lanka by the UN Human Rights High Commissioner and is scheduled to meet the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet in Geneva.

Sri Lanka decided to withdraw from co-sponsoring the resolution after the US imposed travel restrictions on Army chief Lt Gen Shavendra Silva and his immediate family members over alleged gross violations of human rights during the final phase of the island nation's Civil War in 2009.

The resolution 30/1 on promotion on reconciliation in Sri Lanka was co-sponsored in 2015 by the Lankan government headed by then President Maithripala Sirisena.

Sri Lanka's ruling and opposition parties have strongly opposed the US move to impose the travel ban on Lt Gen Silva, saying America's decision was based on independently unverified information.

Foreign Minister Gunawardena earlier said that Lt Gen Silva was only conducting a war against a designated terrorist group which was the LTTE.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/sri-lankan-fm-to-officially-announce-colombo-s-withdrawal-from-un-resolution.html
180,24-2-20,The chronicles of mankind,"When tolerance is lost, man loses his patience, self-control and spirit of non-violence. If it had been sustained, all or many other virtues would have survived, too, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

Do you know the reason why world has no peace today? Well, it is because many nations and most individuals deny the supremacy of a moral order. The numbers of such people are increasing day-by-day, who think that wickedness, cunningness, vice is better than virtue and violence is better than non-violence. There are so many societies and nations that think man is merely an animal, hankering after material progress and comforts. They refuse to accept the evident, that man has higher aspirations, such as for peace, calmness and bliss. Even the most corrupt person has an inner aspiration for solace, satisfaction and peace. However, they fail to realise that peace, contentment and bliss are not the qualities of bodily cells; they are the qualities of conscient self in its state of moral greatness.

The scholars, with materialistic thinking and attitude, have presented their interpretation of history to the society. This view of man and history has been popularised and publicised by historians, economists and social scientists. The result is that the modern man does not believe in the supremacy of the moral law. Man has, therefore, ceased to apply human values to the problems he faces in day to day life. For example, take the problem of nuclear weapons. There have been many agitations and conferences to bring about disarmament. The conversations are vitiated and they do not lead to actual disarmament because no moral values are brought to bear the problem. Thus, it can be easily said that the lack of sense of moral responsibility is, in fact, the most sinister aspect of the modern civilisation. In fact, the whole modern thinking of man is characterised by lack of moral responsibility.

A psychiatrist, today, would explain that a person committed a murder because he had developed a complex after his father had beaten him with a stick when he was a child. So the responsibility is of the father, who had been cruel to his son. In many other forms, the attitude that ‘I am not responsible’, runs through every aspect of modern life. This has undermined the moral quality of life. So if we want world peace, the real effort lies in giving man a sense of moral responsibility. Let him realise that with all his limitations, he can, in this life, conquer attachment, lust, greed, anger and pride. And, he should think that it is his moral responsibility to eliminate these issues because these disturbs not only him but the peace of others as well.

Today, we see humans killing each other in the name of religion but does any religion has ever taught its followers to kill innocent people? The chronicles of mankind bear witness to the truth that millions of people have lost their peace because of intolerance that ensued from a hurt ego or an unfulfilled selfish motive or narrow-minded. Can anyone calculate or even imagine how many people have lost their peace and harmony and how many cities and civilisations were ruined because of intolerance? If only this virtue, called tolerance, had been sustained, all or many other virtues would have survived. When tolerance is lost, man loses his patience, self-control and spirit of non-violence. Therefore, as they say it is never too late. If even now those, who are mercilessly killing innocent people, begin to observe this virtue, mankind can be saved from the scourge of wars, communal riots and conflict on the basis of difference in religious beliefs.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-chronicles-of-mankind-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-chronicles-of-mankind.html
181,24-2-20,Let it bee,"Backyard gardeners can act to help bee populations

Chemicals are routinely applied around residential landscapes to kill insect pests and troublesome weeds but many are indiscriminate and devastate pollinators in the process.

Over the past 30-plus years, pollinator populations have crashed worldwide due to a variety of reasons, including pesticide and herbicide exposure, invasive pests and diseases, loss of habitat, loss of species and genetic diversity and a changing climate, scientists say.

Pesticide contamination of lawns, gardens and waterways is widespread, and even at sub-lethal levels can impact pollinators’ foraging ability and hive productivity. “Honeybees are not the most impacted of pollinators,” said Katie Buckley, pollinator coordinator with the Washington State Department of Agriculture. “Once-common butterfly and native bee species have become rare, with some on the verge of extinction.”

The rusty patched bumblebee, island marble butterfly, Taylor’s checkerspot butterfly and the familiar monarch butterfly were among those singled out by Buckley as greatly depleted.

Pesticides are over-applied by many backyard gardeners, said James Dill, a pest management specialist with University of Maine Extension. “They don’t read the labels, or they eyeball the amounts,” Dill said. “Sometimes, if maybe an ounce is called for, they’ll use two ounces. They often will use a calendar spray schedule or just spray because they had a problem in the past.”

But well-informed gardeners can be a big help in reversing the pollinator declines, especially those caused by chemical poisoning. “In general, the best defense is to avoid spraying plants that are in bloom, use pesticides that have a short half-life when possible and use pesticides with low toxicity to bees and other beneficial insects,” Buckley said. “Whether as a farmer or a homeowner, it is critical to always read and follow the label.”

Clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam are highly toxic to honeybees by contact and ingestion, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s toxicity classification scale for bees. Thiacloprid and acetamiprid are moderately toxic, the federal agency says. If you keep bees, finding the right apiary location is an important way to reduce pesticide exposure.’ Keeping colonies as far away from commercial agriculture as possible (4 to 5 miles) is the safest,” Dill said. “Drive around your area where you intend to keep hives and get the lay of the land so you know what you are dealing with. If you have a large, pesticide-free foraging area with diverse flowering plants nearby, that would be ideal.”

Supplying honeybees with uncontaminated water is also an effective deterrent, said Kevin Jensen, a pesticide management compliance investigator with the Washington State Department of Agriculture. “If the bees do not have a water source in the apiary, they will be forced to look for water elsewhere during the hot months,” Jensen said. “This can result in bees being attracted to an area that is being sprayed, even though that area may not have flowers blooming in it.”

Even pesticides allowed for use in organic agriculture can harm bees and other beneficial insects like flies, beetles, moths and wasps, entomologists say. “Homeowners should avoid using pesticides in backyards and instead use nontoxic methods such as soapy water to get rid of pests such as aphids,” said Ramesh Sagili, an associate professor-apiculture with Oregon State University.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/let-it-bee-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/let-it-bee.html
182,24-2-20,Tsitsipas defends Marseille trophy,"Stefanos Tsitsipas successfully defended his Marseille title on Sunday with a straightforward victory over Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Greek star Tsitsipas eased to a 6-3, 6-4 win to leave Felix still waiting for his maiden ATP title after his fifth final defeat.

Tsitsipas, who had arrived in southern France with a 3-4 losing record this season, enjoyed an emphatic return to form as he clinched his fifth ATP trophy.

“I did well mentally,” said Tsitsipas. “I didn’t crack when I was under pressure.”

Auger-Aliassime would have been confident of finally ending his wait for tournament success after two wins from his three previous meetings with Tsitsipas, but has still failed to even win a set in his five Tour-level finals.

“Playing a final is wonderful, you have to have that perspective, remember that everything is going in the right direction despite everything,” said Auger-Aliassime.

“It’s heavy, losing every time in the final. There is a little doubt... when will it be my turn?”

World number six Tsitsipas, the ATP Finals champion, broke in the third game and saved three break points to serve out the opening set. The second seed got the better of a run of three successive breaks in the second set to move 4-3 in front and only dropped one more point on serve.

185,24-2-20,Jitender ensures place in Indian team for Olympic Qualifiers,"Jitender Kumar sealed his place in the Indian team for the Olympic Qualifiers with a Silver medal at the Asian Championship here on Sunday, a result that could slam the Tokyo Games door on veteran Sushil Kumar.

Two-time Olympic medallist Sushil had skipped the continental event citing an injury.

A Gold eluded India on the second day of the men’s freestyle competition with Deepak Punia (86kg) and Rahul Aware (61kg) finishing with Bronze medals.

Up against Kazakhstan’s Daniyar Kaisanov, Jitender showed tremendous defensive skill, but was lacking in attack. The Indian lost 1-3 to the defending champion.

However, his performance was enough to convince the national federation that he should travel to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan for the Olympic Qualifiers, without a re-trial.

It means that Sushil, who also competes in 74kg, will have to wait and see how Jitender fares in Bishkek, where the finalists will directly qualify for the Tokyo Games.

If Jitender reaches the Gold medal bout there, it will affect the prospect of Sushil, who has been struggling since the 2018 Asian Games.

If Jitender fails to seal an Olympic quota in Bishkek, the last chance would be through a World qualifying event in April.

“I tried one move towards the end but could not execute it properly, it could have got me the Gold. There are improvements in the my game and it could be seen. This Silver is special. Now I will try harder to get Olympic quota,” said Jitender.

His attacking moves from a distance were not good enough to get a good grip on his rivals. Largely, he was defending from standing position.

In fact, in the semifinal against his Mongolian opponent, all three points were scored on passivity and the bouts lacked flare.

Before that, Jitender had won his qualification bout rather easily but just about managed to win his following bouts against Iran’s Mostafa Mohabbali Hosseinkhani (2-2) and Mongolia’s Sumiyabazar Zandanbud (2-1).

“We will not have trials in any category in men’s free style. We will see how our wrestlers perform in Bishkek,” Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said.

Much to the disappointment of the home fans, world championship Silver medallist Deepak lost his 86kg semifinal to Japan’s Shutaro Yamada.

His style was identical to Jitender’s and his moves from distance did not yield the desired result.

Against Yamada, the only points he scored from a takedown were removed after a successful challenge from his opponent’s camp.

In the fight for Bronze against Issa Abdulsalam Abdulwahhab Al Obaidi, the Indian looked a different man, winning it easily. He defated his Iraqi rival by technical superiority.

“I had not trained enough because of an injury I suffered during training after I arrived in India from Russia. I had six stitched just above my right eye,” Deepak, who won a Silver at 2019 Worlds, said.

In the non-Olympic 61kg category, Rahul, who won a Bronze at the Worlds in Nur Sultan, paid the price for being overconfident as his unnecessary challenges cost him dearly.

His movement was terrific and so were his attacks but untimely challenges resulted in him losing points in both the quarterfinal and semifinal.

In a fast-paced, high-scoring quarterfinal bout against Uzbekistan’s Jahongirmirza Turobov, Rahul won 11-9, largely because of his superior defence.

The Pune grappler lost his semifinal to Kyrgyzstan’s Ulukbek Zholdoshbekov 3-5.

He won Bronze after downing Iran’s Majid Almas Dastan 4-2 in an exciting bout.

In the 125kg, Satender won his qualification bout but later lost his quarterfinal and repechage rounds.

In the 92kg, Somveer’s challenge lasted just 24 seconds against his Uzbek rival Ajiniyaz Saparniyazov.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jitender-ensures-place-in-indian-team-for-olympic-qualifiers-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jitender-ensures-place-in-indian-team-for-olympic-qualifiers.html

187,24-2-20,Taliban wants to make peace deal with US: Trump,"The Taliban in Afghanistan are tired of fighting and want to make a peace deal with the US, President Donald Trump said on Sunday as he left for his maiden visit to India during which the two countries will significantly ramp up the defence and strategic ties.

Just before his departure for India, Trump told reporters at the White House that the time had to come for the US troops to ""come home"".

The President said he would sign a peace deal with the Taliban if it worked out over the next week.

""I want to see how this period of a week works out. If it works out over the next less-than-a-week, I would put my name on it,"" he said.

""Time to come home. The Taliban want to make a deal too. They're tired of fighting,"" he said.

Trump's remarks came a day after the US and the Afghan Taliban started a seven-day partial truce ahead of a possible peace deal to end more than 18-year-long war, raising hopes for a resolution to America's longest war.

The agreement struck during negotiations between the US and the Taliban, if maintained, may secure a peace deal that would lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.

In November, Trump announced the resumption of peace talks with the Taliban, but refused to give a timeline for the drawdown of the US troops from Afghanistan, as he made an unannounced visit to American soldiers stationed in the war-torn country.

After nine rounds of negotiations with the Taliban, Trump announced in September that he was calling the peace talks off after a US service member was killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.

The US currently has less than 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, but military officials would not confirm the exact number.

Trump is accompanied by First Lady Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and the top brass of his administration on his maiden visit to India.

During his visit, the two countries are expect to significantly ramp up bilateral defence and strategic ties.

189,24-2-20,Love will find a way,"Writer and filmmaker Faraz Arif Ansari has woven various themes of womanhood, sexuality, Islam, nationality and identity into one narrative to make the audience think over them sensitively in his short film, Sheer Qorma. He tells Chahak Mittal how he’s trying to fight the mindset that a queer person isn’t normal or is different from the rest

What’s your definition of mainstream? Something that catches the common eye easily? For filmmaker Faraz Arif Ansari, it’s something that each and every person present can relate to. “When we talk about mainstream, our understanding of it is quite limited. We think there would be dance, music, drama, action or some comedy. But the term’s actual meaning is ‘universal.’ Everyone in the room should relate to what is being showcased. It doesn’t need to be loud or have a wedding. And it can still be called mainstream with elements as subtle as they could be. My film very much tries to re-define and re-explore what mainstream is and should be,” says the director of short film Sheer Qorma, starring Shabana Azmi, Divya Dutta and Swara Bhasker, which is set to hit the screens soon.

For Faraz, cinema has forgotten how to depict love. “Love is multi-layered. We’re just worried about plot-lines and how to sell it. If you look at Bollywood films, depicting the problems of the LGBTQ have just become a topic to cash in on a popular trend. They don’t genuinely exercise the practice of inclusion. The issue has only become commercial. But I just focus on how many lives my work is going to change,” says he.

The film, he adds, is, hence, also a lot about representation. He tells us, “I have to break this pattern in the industry where people are so non-inclusive even though they harp about inclusion all the time. Around 96 per cent of my crew and cast in Sheer Qorma were women, which is intentional because representation matters, no matter how big or small.”

It was after Sisak, the award-winning short film and the first Indian silent LGBTQ love story, that Faraz felt that something more needs to be done around the issue, while focussing on women. “I realised that nobody is talking about women in the queer diaspora. The conversations are still very related to men. There is so much of patriarchy and inherent misogyny even within the queer community. You’ll always come across stories of a man loving another man. But when it comes to a woman loving another woman, people get uncomfortable for some strange reason. They don’t want to talk about it,” he says, explaining why he decided to give this film an angle where women explore their love for each other in the backdrop of a Muslim household.

Produced by Marijke De Souza, the film, Sheer Qorma, Faraz says, is a gentle, heart-rending narrative of the longing for love and acceptance felt by queer children in their households. The story is told through delicate characters of courageous Muslim queer women. With multiple themes of ethnicity and culture at play within the narrative, the story sensitively confronts the harsh reality of disrupted family dynamics through a sensitive and universal tale.

Faraz says that he has woven a lot of themes into the narrative to make the audience think over it sensitively. He points out that there is a common perception that queer people don’t have a religion or a family. He adds, “But that’s not true. Why isn’t anybody making a film about us? We’re real people like everybody else. I identify as a gay, non-binary, Muslim person. For me, my religion has always been a part of me as much as my sexuality. And our generation is more about co-existing rather than discarding. I felt that while I am talking about LGBTQ women, I should also address the persisting Islamophobia, which too exists within the queer community in the Indian and Middle East belt. This is why the film has so many layers. It is layered with women, non-binary people, Islam, nationality, identity, and sexual preferences. Moreover, the portrayal of Muslim women has been very stereotypical in Hindi cinema.”

He tells us that his inspiration for this film has been his khala jaan (mother’s eldest sister), who he calls a “badass” or a tough woman at a time when it wasn’t even normal for women to be rebels. “She never got married and was the manager of one of India’s leading banks. She brought up her siblings when they lost their parents. She would tell me not to listen to anyone and do my own thing. I grew up with her courage. My mother, on the other hand, has been the complete opposite. She’s very worried about what people would think, which is probably why, even though I came out to her when I was 21, she still hasn’t fully accepted me. She still hopes that one day, I will get better and realise that it was just a phase.”

Growing up around inspiring women, who’ve done some pathbreaking things in their lives, you certainly gain a very different understanding of the world. He says, “I’ve always wanted to make films. It started with me as a child, who used to stage elaborate skits with characters like Barbie and He-Man for family gatherings during festivals. It’s not a very toxic-masculinity kind of understanding. Even my father is a very gentle creature. And the film, too, has no man surrounding the women because in Bollywood, even though the films that have been about women, there is always some man bringing in the masculinity some way or the other. This is way different from that. This one is all about love and why it’s the only thing we need to win hearts. Hate cannot heal the world.”

The filmmaker says that his fight is also with the terms “normal” and “different.” He says, “In school, I heard a lot of ‘he’s not like us’, or ‘he’s so different’ or ‘he’s not normal’. When we talk about ‘normalising’ it, I even hate the term normal. It makes it seem like we are talking about something that is otherwise not usual or present around us. So when my sexuality and being a Muslim came into play together as part of my identity, I just carried on with my life and did what I believed in.”

Fighting yet another mentality, the Taare Zameen Par writer and creative director points out that if two women are in love, the perception is that the love must be different from the rest. He says, “I’m trying to fight this mindset. I had interacted with many women and shared my draft with them. They’d ask, ‘How did you know about our lives?’ I’d answer, ‘By knowing about my life’.”

He adds that the biggest compliment, perhaps, came from actor Shabana Azmi when she called the film “gender-free.”

She finds it disrespectful since no one bothered to consult her actor-father Anil Kapoor, who featured in the original, and acclaimed director Shekhar Kapur, who helmed the popular 1987 film.

“A lot of people have been me asking me about the Mr India remake. Honestly, my father didn't even know that the film was being remade, we found about it through social media when Ali Abbas Zafar tweeted. It's quite disrespectful and underhanded, if it is true, since no one bothered to consult my father or Shekhar uncle — two people who played a major role in making the film what it was and is,” Sonam wrote on social media.

‘Although I played a husband in the short film Zindagi InShort, this was a very different role that I played. Morally, it was a very tricky character. Set in a small town, it is the story of a couple and the involvement of a third person between them. The story addresses the topic of marital rape, which is a prevalent topic. It is a couple that looks perfect on the outside but there is darkness inside.’

Actor Kartik Aaryan has began shooting for the second installment of the Bhool Bhulaiyaa franchise in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

He took to Instagram to share a video where he is seen dressed in the godman's attire from the film. He is seen humming the tune of the title track of the film.

He captioned the video: “Iss look mein smile hi nahi rukti... Ting ding ting tiding ting ting... lets Roll... Mango Season Begins. Directed by Anees Bazmee, the film also stars Kiara Advani.

Not using any dating apps: Ben

Actor Ben Affleck has debunked all rumours suggesting he has turned to dating applications to find love.

Affleck has been single since last spring (2019), after splitting once more from his on/off girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus. In October, he was reported to have signed up to Raya, an exclusive dating app favoured by celebrities.

He said, “I am on any of the dating apps. I know so many people who are on them and they have a fun time, but not me.” He added that he prefers to do it the old fashioned way.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-02-24.html
191,24-2-20,Man or machines?,"Can AI flag disease outbreaks faster than humans? Not quite

Did an artificial-intelligence system beat human doctors in warning the world of a severe coronavirus outbreak in China? In a narrow sense, yes. But what the humans lacked in sheer speed, they more than made up in finesse.

Early warnings of disease outbreaks can help people and governments save lives. In the final days of 2019, an AI system in Boston sent out the first global alert about a new viral outbreak in China. But it took human intelligence to recognise the significance of the outbreak and then awaken response from the public health community.

What’s more, the mere mortals produced a similar alert only a half-hour behind the AI systems. For now, AI-powered disease-alert systems can still resemble car alarms — easily triggered and sometimes ignored. A network of medical experts and sleuths must still do the hard work of sifting through rumors to piece together the full picture. It’s difficult to say what future AI systems, powered by ever larger datasets on outbreaks, may be able to accomplish.

The first public alert outside China about the novel coronavirus came on December 30 from the automated HealthMap system at Boston Children’s Hospital. At 11.12 pm local time, HealthMap sent an alert about unidentified pneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The system, which scans online news and social media reports, ranked the alert’s seriousness as only three out of five. It took days for HealthMap researchers to recognise its importance.

Four hours before the HealthMap notice, New York epidemiologist Marjorie Pollack had already started working on her own public alert, spurred by a growing sense of dread after reading a personal email she received that evening. “This is being passed around the internet here,” wrote her contact, who linked to a post on the Chinese social media forum Pincong. The post discussed a Wuhan health agency notice and read in part: “Unexplained pneumonia???”

Pollack, deputy editor of the volunteer-led Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, known as ProMed, quickly mobilised a team to look into it. ProMed’s more detailed report went out about 30 minutes after the terse HealthMap alert.

Early warning systems that scan social media, online news articles and government reports for signs of infectious disease outbreaks help inform global agencies such as the World Health Organisation — giving international experts a head start when local bureaucratic hurdles and language barriers might otherwise get in the way.

Some systems, including ProMed, rely on human expertise. Others are partly or completely automated. And rather than competing with one another, they are often complementary — HealthMap is intertwined with ProMed and helps run its online infrastructure.

“These tools can help hold feet to the fire for government agencies,” said John Brownstein, who runs the HealthMap system as chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “It forces people to be more open.”

The last 48 hours of 2019 were a critical time for understanding the new virus and its significance. Earlier on December 30, Wuhan Central Hospital doctor Li Wenliang warned his former classmates about the virus in a social media group — a move that led local authorities to summon him for questioning several hours later.

Li, who died on February 7 after contracting the virus, told The New York Times that it would have been better if officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier. “There should be more openness and transparency,” he said.

ProMed reports are often incorporated into other outbreak warning systems, including those run by the World Health Organisation, the Canadian government and the Toronto startup BlueDot. WHO also pools data from HealthMap and other sources.

Computer systems that scan online reports for information about disease outbreaks rely on natural language processing, the same branch of artificial intelligence that helps answer questions posed to a search engine or digital voice assistant. But the algorithms can only be as effective as the data they are scouring, said Nita Madhav, CEO of San Francisco-based disease monitoring firm Metabiota, which first notified its clients about the outbreak in early January.

Madhav said that inconsistency in how different agencies report medical data can stymie algorithms. The text-scanning programmes extract keywords from online text but may fumble when organisations variously report new virus cases in a given time interval. The potential for confusion means there’s almost always still a person involved in reviewing the data.

“There’s still a bit of human in the loop,” Madhav said. Andrew Beam, a Harvard University epidemiologist, said that scanning online reports for key words can help reveal trends but the accuracy depends on the quality of the data. He also notes that these techniques aren’t so novel.

“There is an art to intelligently scraping web sites,” Beam said. “But it’s also Google’s core technology since the 1990s.” Google itself started its own Flu Trends service to detect outbreaks in 2008 by looking for patterns in search queries about flu symptoms. Experts criticised it for overestimating flu prevalence. Google shut down the website in 2015 and handed its technology to nonprofit organisations such as HealthMap to use Google data to build their own models.

In early January, Isaac Bogoch, a researcher at Toronto General Hospital, analysed commercial flight data with BlueDot founder Kamran Khan to see which cities outside mainland China were most connected to Wuhan.

Wuhan stopped outbound commercial air travel in late January — but not before an estimated five million people had fled the city, as the Wuhan mayor later told reporters. “We showed that the highest volume of flights from Wuhan were to Thailand, Japan, and Hong Kong,” Bogoch said. “Lo and behold, a few days later we started to see cases pop up in these places.” In 2016, the researchers used a similar approach to predict the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to southern Florida.

Now that government have launched measures to curb disease transmission, it’s harder to build algorithms for predictions, Bogoch said.

Artificial intelligence depends on prior data to train computers how to interpret new facts. But there are no close parallels to the way China is enforcing quarantine zones that impact hundreds of millions of people.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/man-or-machines--2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/man-or-machines-.html

193,24-2-20,It’s all connected,"Landscape architects shift emphasis to the ecosystem. They say there is a need to bridge the divide between personal gardens and the larger global situation

Landscape architects are finding themselves on the front lines of the climate change crisis, having to come up with creative ways to adapt and help mitigate problems like rising oceans and extreme weather as they design projects across the country.

“The focus on sustainability has been building slowly for a long time among landscape architects but in recent years that commitment has really taken hold,” says Jacquelyn Bianchini, a spokeswoman at the Washington, DC based American Society of Landscape Architects. She said those in the profession “have to deal with climate change more than almost any other design fields.”

Landscape architect Kate Orff heads the firm Scape, known for ecologically driven projects around the country. She feels a responsibility to take on projects that emphasise sustainability. “Our profession has been working hand in hand with the carbon-driven world since the field’s inception. We’ve been living in this world where we’re creating beautiful gardens in the foreground while the planet is collapsing in the background,” she says.

“My goal is to flip that relationship around so the focus is on ecological systems and we then link what we do with policy ideas and infrastructure to that reality,” says Orff, who recently became the first landscape architect awarded a MacArthur “genius” Fellowship.

She is the lead designer of a $60 million barrier reef and shoreline restoration project off Staten Island, New York, called Living Breakwaters. It incorporates oyster reefs, wetlands and strands to reduce the effects of storm surges. In Atlanta, it is developing a 100-mile trail linking communities along a vast distance to encourage mobility, equity and sustainability.

While landscape architects often focus on large, community projects, they say consideration of the environment also needs to take place at home, when people are designing their own gardens and deciding what to plant in their backyards.

“Even though gardening is listed in the top five hobbies of Americans, somehow we’ve not translated that into care for our environment. We need to try to somehow do a better job of bridging the divide between personal gardens and the larger global situation. It’s all connected,” says Orff.

Todd Forrest, vice president for horticulture and living collections at the New York Botanical Garden, concurs. “People who are creating home gardens or people like me who manage gardens for the public, deal with the reality of climate every day and always have. A gardener is the first person and the last person you should talk with about climate change, and we deal with issues of plant adaptability in everything we do,” he says.

Forrest, who used to teach a class called Gardening and a Changing Climate, says, “every citizen of the world should look across all their activities and ask themselves, ‘How can I live more simply or thoughtfully so that I’m not contributing to the eventual loss of native biodiversity around the world?’ We can design our gardens to provide habitat for insects. But we can also over-fertilise and damage the environment.”

To be a good environmental citizen, he says, you need “to learn and pay close attention, to adapt and at the same time be a part of the effort to reduce carbon emissions.”

At the botanical garden, that’s meant experimenting with more plants native to the southern mid-Atlantic states, a region south of New York City. The Long Leaf Pine is one example. “No one thought that it would grow here, and it’s now thriving here,” he says. “The challenge is that models suggest more extreme weather events, not a steady change. It’s hard to plant a garden that’s impervious to a hurricane or nor’easter. Even as the climate warms, we’re still going to have New York winters, so you’re looking to plants that can handle extremes.”

In 2017, the American Society of Landscape Architects convened a blue-ribbon panel on “Climate Change and Resilience” which resulted in a broad set of suggested strategies and policy guidelines. And last year, the group highlighted 20 case studies of projects that put the report’s recommendations into practice. That “Smart Policies for a Changing Climate’’ exhibition is on view at the Center for Landscape Architecture in Washington. “It’s everyone’s problem, and landscape architects are in the best position to help deal with this,” says Bianchini.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it---s-all-connected-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/it---s-all-connected.html
194,24-2-20,Jesus’ strike lift City,"Gabriel Jesus struck late to give Manchester City a 1-0 win at Leicester on Saturday, strengthening their hold on second place behind champions-in-waiting Liverpool despite more woe from the penalty spot.

Pep Guardiola’s men have endured a turbulent week after they were banned from European club competitions for two years for breaches of financial fair play rules.

But a second-half winner from substitute Jesus after Sergio Aguero had failed to convert a penalty put them 17 points clear of Tottenham and sends them into their midweek match against Real Madrid in good spirits.

City looked like they might have to settle for a draw after squandering their fourth penalty in a row in the Premier League, with each being missed by a different player.

“We have missed four penalties in a row but maybe we will shoot a penalty when we need it to win something,” Guardiola told the BBC. “The keepers are good too, but the next one we are going to score.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jesus----strike-lift-city.html
195,24-2-20,Three decisions for Lampard as Chelsea face Bayern clash,"Chelsea manager Frank Lampard faces some big decisions ahead of Bayern Munich's visit to Stamford Bridge in the Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.

AFP Sport looks at three major calls Lampard must get right if Chelsea are to take a step towards the quarter-finals: Keep faith with Giroud?

Having spent much of the season in exile, Olivier Giroud was back with a bang as he scored the opening goal against Tottenham on Saturday in his first Premier League start since November.

The France striker had been reduced to fringe status by Lampard's decision to give talented youngster Tammy Abraham his opportunity, but an injury to the England international and the ineffective form of Michy Batshuayi gave Giroud a second chance.

He made the most of it with a lethal first half finish in the vital 2-1 win over Tottenham, producing a combative performance that might have given Lampard food for thought.

Giroud's second club goal of the season and his first in the Premier League since April underlined the threat posed by the 33-year-old's physical style and clever movement.

Now Lampard must decide if Giroud, whose lack of match action meant he could only last 70 minutes against Tottenham, is capable of repeating that display against Bayern.

Chelsea, who have struggled to find a cutting edge for much of the season in home games, certainly looked more dynamic with Giroud leading the line en route to their first win in five league matches.

And in the back of his mind, Lampard will know Abraham, who came off the bench to replace Giroud, might be running out of steam with only one goal in 2020 and has just two in his last 10 games.

Retain defensive system?

Jose Mourinho's cheeky pre-match claim that Lampard would return to the five-man defence he had employed against Tottenham earlier this season proved correct on Saturday.

Now the Chelsea boss must be tempted to deploy the same system against Bayern.

Despite his knowledge that Lampard would use Cesar Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger as his centre-backs, with Reece James and Marcos Alonso bombing forward as wing-backs, Mourinho had no answer to the effective formation.

The tactics gave Chelsea a more solid look at the back and freed James and Alonso to join the attack, allowing them to overload their opponents in wide areas, a scheme perfectly illustrated when the ball was worked from right to left for Alonso to fire home from 20 yards.

It was the Spanish left-back's first start since December after he spending much of the season behind Emerson and even Azpilicueta, usually a right-back or centre-back, in Lampard's pecking order.

Lampard has twice out-witted Mourinho with the formation this season and, given Chelsea have often looked creaky at the back this season, it would be no surprise if he relied on that security blanket again to subdue the German champions.

Let Barkley run wild?

Like Giroud and Alonso, Ross Barkley had endured a frustrating campaign that suddenly offers hope of a rewarding finale after his influential display against Tottenham.

Liverpool-born Barkley has never looked comfortable among Chelsea's cosmopolitan squad since arriving from Everton in January 2018 and a series of diffident performances had raised questions about the midfielder's long-term future with the club.

The promise shown by Barkley as a youngster at Everton seemed a lifetime ago as he laboured to make an impact in west London, but Lampard might have found a way to unlock his potential at last.

Using the 26-year-old on the left side of Chelsea's attack on Saturday unchained Barkley from any defensive responsibility, giving him freedom to roam and take up positions that could hurt Tottenham.

He did just that with the assist for Alonso's goal by moving into a central position that took him away from any potential markers.

With Brazilian winger Willian rested after being used as substitute against Tottenham, Lampard will have to decide whether Barkley, who has raised eyebrows with some off-field antics since joining Chelsea, can be trusted to repeat that kind of mature show against Bayern.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/three-decisions-for-lampard-as-chelsea-face-bayern-clash-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/three-decisions-for-lampard-as-chelsea-face-bayern-clash.html

201,24-2-20,Identity-based politics good for democracy: Mukherjee,"Former president Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday said democracy and republicanism were two values people must strive to protect and cherish, and termed identity politics a positive development in relation to the deepening of democratic ethos.

He was delivering valedictory address at the 10th edition of the Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad here.

""Democracy in India gave rise to identity-based politics. Purely from the lens of deepening democracy, I see this as a positive development because it leads to wider representation. However, an electorate divided on caste and community lines throws up a polarised mandate,"" Mukherjee said.

Lauding the strength of Indian democracy, the former president said it had only deepened with time and added that good governance was critically dependent on prerequisites like inviolable adherence to rule of law, existence of participatory decision-making structure, responsiveness, transparency, accountability, corruption-free society, equity and inclusiveness.

""We have entered the 71st year of our Republic. Democracy and republicanism are two values which we must not only strive to protect, but also cherish, celebrate and treasure. Democracy is the rule of, for and by the people and the Republic signifies the rule of law,"" he said.

Citing instances to stress the maturity of Indian democracy, Mukherjee said the foremost achievement of the first general election lay in the fact that it cemented the painstakingly brought about unification of India.

""Despite the complex arrangement of categorisation under parts A, B, C and D of the Provinces, States, Territory and areas, the entire geographical territory of India voted as a singular electorate, electing for themselves a single Union Parliament.

""Of course, by the time the second general elections happened, the complex categorisation had been done away with, since there were just states and UTs in existence,"" Mukherjee said.

He described the participation of the Communist Party of India in the Constituent Assembly elections even though they were peripherally opposed to it as a marker of the strength of Indian democracy.

He said the third victory of Indian democratic principles was the successful suppression of the radical and violent rebellion in Naxalbari through the ballot paper.

""Indian democracy and its inherent power of assimilation have successfully thwarted insurgency and separate movements, and elections have successfully co-opted varied groups into the electoral mainstream.

""The various accords -- Punjab Accord, the Shillong Accord, the Mizo Accord, the Assam Accord and the recent Agreement on Bru- Reang and Bodo people -- are examples of the same,"" the former president added.

Three other top-flight matches were also pushed back — between Torino and Parma, Atalanta versus Sassuolo and Hellas Verona against Cagliari.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced late on Saturday evening that all sporting events in two northern regions would be suspended on Sunday.

Strong measures are being taken in Italy with over 132 confirmed cases in an outbreak that has claimed two lives in the country.

“I think it’s right to take the necessary precautions,” said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi.

“Do a lot of prevention, try to defeat and understand the problem by stopping the championship, because we shouldn’t underestimate what is happening.”

In Genoa, Adam Marusic scored the opener for Lazio with less than two minutes on the clock before Ciro Immobile, the top flight’s leading scorer this season, netted his 27th Serie A goal of the campaign six minutes into the second half.

The Italian striker pulled six goals clear of Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo who scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive Serie A game in his 1,000th professional match against SPAL.

Francesco Cassata pulled one back for the relegation-threatened hosts, but Danilo Cataldi secured Lazio all three points despite Domenico Criscito's late consolation.

“We’re doing something great. The lads know it and I’m not hiding from saying it,” said Inzaghi.

“In 21 games between the championship and the Super Cup we have won 17 times. In other championships we would be first, but here you have to fight with Juve and Inter.

“We are there in the chase and we will try to fight.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lazio-stay-on-juve---s-heels.html
204,24-2-20,India face B’desh in Women’s T20 WC,"Their confidence on a high after the impressive win over title holders Australia, India will look to carry forward the momentum against a plucky Bangladesh in their second Group A match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here today.

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav’s magical spell helped India beat Australia by 17 runs in the tournament opener on Friday but the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side can’t afford to take Bangladesh lightly as their eastern neighbours had beaten them twice in the 2018 T20 Asia Cup.

Jemimah Rodrigues and 16-year-old promising opener Shafali Verma, who hit a typically aggressive 29 off 15 balls against Australia, were not a part of that Asia Cup team and the duo will need to play crucial roles if India want to beat Bangladesh.

In the last five meetings between the two sides, India lead 3-2 on head-to-head record and a win today will take them closer to the knock-out rounds from the five-team group.

India will, however, need to improve their batting performance as they scored a below par 132 against Australia.

Since the tri-series preceding this World Cup, the Indian batting has been inconsistent and has not posted big totals barring a few matches.

Captain Harmanpreet and opener Smriti Mandhana, who both have done well in the tri-series before this World Cup, contributed little with the bat in the previous match and both will need to fire for India to put up a big total or chase down a target.

Another key middle-order batswoman Deepti Sharma came good against Australia with an unbeaten 49 off 46 balls and she would look to continue her good form.

Medium pacer Shikha Pandey also bowled well against Australia and Harmanpreet is happy that her team is not dependent on a few players only.

For Bangladesh, the key players will be all-rounder Jahanara Alam and top-order batswoman Fargana Hoque.

The 26-year-old seasoned Hoque has a T20I hundred to her name. She had played a major role in Bangladesh’s group stage win over India in 2018 T20 Asia Cup.

Alam is another key player for Bangladesh and she was a part of the IPL Velocity team under Mithali Raj in India’s domestic Women’s T20 Challenge tournament in Jaipur last year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-face-b---desh-in-women---s-t20-wc.html

Belgium forward Hazard, whose first season at Real has been plagued by injury, will now miss Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash with Manchester City and the Clasico with league leaders Barcelona next weekend.

Madrid did not announce a recovery time for Hazard but his latest setback will be a worry for Belgium boss Roberto Martinez ahead of Euro 2020 this summer.

206,24-2-20,Proteas end Aus win streak,"South Africa's bowlers held their nerve as the hosts bounced back from a record defeat to win the second T20I against Australia at St George's Park on Sunday.

Opening batsman David Warner hit an unbeaten 67 for Australia but it wasn't enough as South Africa defended a modest total of 158 for four to win by 12 runs and level the three-match series.

Australia lost three wickets for eight runs in the last 2.1 overs to finish on 146 for six. It was their first T20 defeat in nine matches going back to November 2018.

South Africa captain Quinton de Kock was named man of the match after he slammed 70 off 47 balls to get the home team off to a blazing start as they set out to recover from a record 107-run defeat in the first match in Johannesburg on Friday.

He hit two sixes in the second over, bowled by Pat Cummins, and raced to 50 off 31 balls.

Warner, Aaron Finch and Steve Smith got Australia off to a similarly fast start but both teams found scoring increasingly difficult on a slow pitch with low bounce as the ball lost its shine and hardness.

“We realised the new ball is really key with the bat,” said De Kock. “It gets more difficult towards the end so we were trying to capitalise on the powerplay.

“We thought 160 was par because we know this wicket. It was always going to be more difficult towards the end.”

The series decider takes place on Wednesday at Newlands in Cape Town, the scene of the ball-tampering scandal which led to bans for Smith and Warner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/proteas-end-aus-win-streak.html
207,24-2-20,"Tigers hit Zim with Najmul, Mominul fifties","Najmul Hossain and skipper Mominul Haque hit half-centuries as Bangladesh replied strongly to Zimbabwe in their one-off Test in Dhaka on Sunday.

Najmul made 71 off 139 balls while Mominul was unbeaten on 79 as Bangladesh reached 240-3 at stumps on the second day, trailing Zimbabwe by 25 runs in the first innings.

Pace bowler Abu Jayed earlier finished with a career-best 4-71, as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 265 in the opening session, after the visitors resumed on 228-6.

Najmul, who struck seven fours in his fluent innings, led Bangladesh’s initial batting charge after Victor Nyauchi removed opener Saif Hasan for eight to give Zimbabwe an early breakthrough.

He was involved in partnerships of 78 and 76 runs with Tamim Iqbal and Mominul on his way to a maiden Test fifty in only his fourth match.

Tamim made 41 runs before he edged Donald Tiripano to wicketkeeper Regis Chakabva.

Charlton Tshuma dismissed Najmul for his maiden Test wicket as Chakabva claimed a third catch behind the stumps.

Mominul, who hit nine fours, and Mushfiqur saw off the day without further damage as they shared 68 runs in an unbroken fourth-wicket stand.

Mushfiqur, who returned to the side after skipping the previous Test against Pakistan, remained unbeaten on 32.

Zimbabwe earlier added 37 runs to their overnight score before Jayed and left-arm spinner Taijul Islam wrapped up their innings.

Jayed dismissed overnight batsman Tiripano for eight when he nicked an edge to wicketkeeper Liton Das in the seventh over.

208,24-2-20,"Boult, Southee leave India on thin ice","The Indian batsmen, caught between over-cautiousness and impetuosity, produced yet another inept batting performance to put New Zealand firmly on the driver’s seat at the end of third day’s play in the first Test here at Basin Reserve on Sunday.

At stumps, India reached 144 for 4 in their second innings as the top-order found Trent Boult’s (3/27 in 16 overs) high-quality swing bowling too hot to handle.

India now trail New Zealand by 39 runs going into fourth day, which could well be the final day of this game unless Ajinkya Rahane (25 batting, 67 balls) and Hanuma Vihari (15 batting, 70 balls) show the art of survival that was distinctly lacking in some of the other top-order batsmen.

Asked what kind of total can be defended in the fourth innings, senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin remained non-committal.

“I know to keep it simple and say this is defendable and this is not, (it) is pretty much how you would want me to present it, but it’s too much — like six sessions to go and we are not even at a stage where we can say what is a good score to defend,” he said.

There is still something there in the Basin Reserve pitch, reckoned Ashwin.

“We have to take every ball at a time to be honest because there is still enough in the surface. We are not yet in a stage of the game from our perspective where we can look at it very far.”

After New Zealand’s tail wagged big time to post a good first innings total of 348, the deficit of 183 understandably put India under severe pressure.

If Cheteshwar Pujara (11 off 81 balls) paid for his ultra-defensive mindset shouldering arms to an in-dipper, skipper Virat Kohli’s (19 off 43 balls) split-second indiscretion became his undoing as he went for a needless pull-shot to a well-disguised short ball.

Mayank Agarwal (58 off 99 balls) was impressive in one session and lost concentration in the second, ditto to what happened on the first day and was caught down the leg-side.

The bowler on both the occasion was Boult, who successfully took over the job of tormenting the Indian batsmen from Tim Southee (1/41 in 15 overs) and Kyle Jamieson (0/33 in 17 overs). It was a top-class seam and swing bowling show on a third day pitch, which still had something for fast bowlers.

Boult bowled with a lot of fire as he exposed Prithvi Shaw’s (14 off 30 balls) poor technique, laying a trap for the opening batsman.

A short ball hurried the flamboyant Mumbaikar, whose huge back-lift became his undoing. By the time the ball grew big on him, he was fending it awkwardly with a closed bat and at the short square-leg Tom Latham was waiting gleefully for that chance.

Pujara and Agarwal did add 51 runs for the second wicket but it was largely because of the Karnataka opener, who played his shots and showed positive intent. He, in fact, hit Ajaz Patel for a six and a four but Pujara, at the other end, only looked keen on defending.

Just like first innings, Pujara was leaving balls on length but at one stage, he was stuck on personal score of 6 for 28 consecutive balls. While leaving Jamieson from length was not an issue, Pujara did not account for Boult, shouldering arms a delivery that came in sharply.

In the first session, Jamieson (44) continued with his dream debut as he and No 11 Boult belted the Indian bowlers for fun.

Ishant Sharma (5/68 in 22.2 overs) remained the stand-out bowler for India.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/boult--southee-leave-india-on-thin-ice-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/boult--southee-leave-india-on-thin-ice.html

Trump was received at the Kheria airbase by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

He arrived here from Ahmedabad after jointly attending with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the mega 'Namaste Trump' event at the Motera cricket stadium.

A giant billboard featuring Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and Prime Minister Modi greeted the couple with a message – 'Grand welcome of India's best friend to the City of Love –Agra'.

On his arrival at the airbase, over 250 artistes drawn from different parts of Uttar Pradesh performed ‘Mayur dance', ‘Rai folk dance', Dhobia folk dance', 'bamrasia' dance as sonorous sounds of nagada, dholak and mridang added to the festive ambience.

The city has been spruced up to welcome Trump amid a huge security deployment.

Massive billboards bearing greeting messages dotted the nearly 13-km route of his convoy while major street roundabouts are decked up with US and India flags.

Along the route, over 3,000 artistes spread over 21 designated designated areas will also present dance forms of Brij, Awadh and other regions, like Krishna Lila.

Over 15,000 school students are lining up the streets on the convoy route, holding US and India flags to welcome Trump as his motorcade will pass through the city.

Many billboards reflecting the bonhomie between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been put up in Agra.

A giant one near TDI Mall on the route practically covers an entire building showing the two leaders with a message – 'Namaste Trump: World's Oldest Democracy meets Worlds' Largest Democracy'.

The 17th century monument has been refurbished to welcome Trump and his family where they will spend about an hour to catch the sunset from the famed mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631.

Massive billboards bearing greeting messages and pictures of Trump, First Lady and Modi dotted the nearly 13-km convoy route as street roundabouts decked up with US and India flags symbolised the US-India friendship.

An extensive three-layered security is in place for his Agra visit, and authorities had got the Taj Mahal premises cleared of visitors by noon, hours ahead of Trump's visit to the celebrated architectural landmark.

Trump and the First Lady enjoyed the view of the marble marvel in the evening as a cool breeze added to the pleasant weather.

They also posed for pictures for photographers. The couple will spend about an hour at Taj to catch the sunset from the UNESCO heritage site, before heading to Delhi.

The last US president to visit the the Mughal-era wonder was Bill Clinton who had come to India in 2000. He had seen the Taj along with daughter Chelsea Clinton.

In 1959, then US president David Dwight Eisenhower had visited Taj along with then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

From massive billboards bearing greeting messages to street roundabouts decked up with US and India flags, Agra had waited excitedly to welcome President Trump and authorities made arrangements to present a ""lively Agra"" to the visiting President, seeking to shake off the old tag of ‘city of ghosts'.

""During Clinton's visit the city streets were deserted due to security arrangements, prompting him to call it a ‘city of ghosts'. This time the excitement can be felt in the air,"" said Mohit Kumar, who works at a hotel in Tajganj area.

""I was very young in 2000 when Clinton visited. We are very excited and happy that another US President has come to our city due to which the civic amenities have been improved,"" he said.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has left no stone unturned to make the roadshow a memorable experience for the dignitaries as well as the people.

Artistes and performers from many states were allotted a stage on the entire route to perform in their traditional attire. Around 50 stages were erected on the route, starting from the airport till Motera stadium via Indira bridge.

Authorities said over one lakh people are expected to line up along the route of the roadshow, which has been named as 'India Road Show' by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.

During the roadshow, both the leaders are scheduled to visit Sabarmati Ashram, where Mahatma Gandhi spent 13 years during India's freedom struggle.

225,24-2-20,"Shaheen stir peaceful, police blocking roads, Habibullah tells SC","Former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah has told the Supreme Court that the protest at Shaheen Bagh here against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is peaceful and inconvenience being caused to commuters was due to barricades “unnecessarily” put by police on roads far away from the site.

The same stand has been taken by social activist Syed Bahadur Abbas Naqvi and Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad in their joint affidavit filed in the apex court in the matter. Habibullah, Azad and Naqvi have jointly filed an intervention application in the apex court which is seized of the matter.

Habibullah had visited the protest site at Shaheen Bagh pursuant to the direction by a Bench of Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph. The Bench is scheduled to hear the matter on Monday.

The top court is hearing pleas seeking removal of protesters from Shaheen Bagh and ensuring smooth traffic flow in the area.

The apex court had earlier said though people have a fundamental right to protest “peacefully and lawfully”, it was troubled by the blocking of a public road at Shaheen Bagh as it might lead to a “chaotic situation”.

In his affidavit filed in the top court, Habibullah has contended that “Shaheen Bagh stands tall as a firm example of peaceful dignified dissent, more so in the face of various instances of state-sponsored violence on similar dissents across India.

“We have been sad and mute witnesses to police brutality and negative typecasting of a particular community across the country. Crushing dissent instead of entering into a dialogue is the new norm, but it is alien to our Constitution,” he has claimed.

Naqvi and Azad, in their joint affidavit, have alleged that “the present ruling dispensation, at the behest of its political masters, had devised a strategy of extinguishing these protests by falsely attributing violence and acts of vandalism to peaceful protestors”.

They have also said that police has “unnecessarily” barricaded numerous roads that “have no connection with the protest” and are at a great distance from the site, thereby, “abdicating their responsibilities and duties and wrongly laying the blame on the protest”.

“It is these barricading of unconnected roads that has led to a chaotic situation,” Habibullah has claimed and added that if the barricades are removed from the 10 points he has mentioned in the affidavit, “the chaos complained of in the petition would cease”.

In a separate affidavit, Naqvi and Azad have claimed the issue of inconvenience to commuters has been “deliberately orchestrated by the police” by blocking all the surrounding roads as well as the arterial roads connecting Delhi, Noida and Faridabad.

They have further alleged that one of the petitions has been filed by lawyer Amit Shani, who is an active member and supporter of BJP posing as a concerned citizen, as his place of residence, office and direct route of daily commute are nowhere near Shaheen Bagh.

Habibullah, in his affidavit, has also stated that the protestors have asked him to convey to the apex court that their dissent “was out of desperation and compulsion” as they see the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) as a “death knell” for their and future generations’ survival and existence.

The other concerns voiced by the protestors were that CAA and the intention behind it, as publicly voiced by those in power, “has struck a deep fear into the hearts of many poor and under-privileged citizens of India”.

He has said, “The assembly is peaceful. The question of their security is also crucial. Any attempt to forcibly shift them from the present site would compromise their safety.”

Restrictions have been imposed on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and the Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15 last year due to protests against CAA and NRC.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Sahni, who had first approached the Delhi High Court seeking directions to Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which was blocked by anti-CAA protesters on December 15 last year.

Separately, former BJP MLA Nand Kishore Garg has filed a plea in the apex court seeking directions to authorities to remove protestors from Shaheen Bagh.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-stir-peaceful---police-blocking-roads--habibullah-tells-sc.html

227,24-2-20,"Eat fruits, yoghurt daily to reduce stroke risk","Different types of food are linked to risks of different types of stroke, say researchers, adding that higher intakes of fruit, vegetables and dairy products is linked to a lower risk of ischaemic stroke.

For the study, published in the European Heart Journal, the researchers picked over 4,18,000 people in nine European countries and investigated ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke separately.

The study found that while higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, fibre, milk, cheese or yoghurt were each linked to a lower risk of ischaemic stroke, there was no significant association with a lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

However, greater consumption of eggs was associated with a higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke, but not with ischaemic stroke, the researchers said.

""Our study also highlights the importance of examining stroke subtypes separately, as the dietary associations differ for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and is consistent with other evidence, which shows that other risk factors, such as cholesterol levels or obesity, also influence the two stroke subtypes differently,"" said study first author Tammy Tong from University of Oxford in the UK.

Ischaemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery supplying blood to the brain or forms somewhere else in the body and travels to the brain where it blocks blood flow.

Haemorrhagic stroke occurs when there is bleeding in the brain that damages nearby cells. About 85 per cent of strokes are ischaemic and 15 per cent are haemorrhagic. Stroke is the second leading cause of deaths worldwide.

For the findings, the research team analysed data from 418,329 men and women in nine countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK) who were recruited to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study between 1992 and 2000.

The participants completed questionnaires asking about diet, lifestyle, medical history and socio-demographic factors, and were followed up for an average of 12.7 years.

During this time, there were 4,281 cases of ischaemic stroke and 1,430 cases of haemorrhagic stroke.

The total amount of fibre (including fibre from fruit, vegetables, cereal, legumes, nuts and seeds) that people ate was associated with the greatest potential reduction in the risk of ischaemic stroke, the researchers said.

Every 10g more intake of fibre a day was associated with a 23 per cent lower risk, which is equivalent to around two fewer cases per 1,000 of the population over 10 years, they added.

Fruit and vegetables alone were associated with a 13 per cent lower risk for every 200g eaten a day, which is equivalent to one less case per 1,000 of the population over 10 years.

No foods were linked to a statistically significant higher risk of ischaemic stroke.

The researchers found that for every extra 20g of eggs consumed a day there was a 25 per cent higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

The researchers said the associations they found between different foods and ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke might be explained partly by the effects on blood pressure and cholesterol.

228,24-2-20,"AQAP confirms death of leader, appoints successor: SITE","Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula on Sunday confirmed the death of its leader Qassim al-Rimi and appointed a successor, the SITE monitor said, weeks after the US said it had ""eliminated"" him.

The announcement came in an audio speech delivered by AQAP religious official Hamid bin Hamoud al-Tamimi, said SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist networks worldwide.

""In his speech, Tamimi spoke at length about Rimi and his jihadi journey, and stated that Khalid bin Umar Batarfi is the new leader of AQAP,"" it said.

SITE said that Batarfi has appeared in many AQAP videos over the past several years and appeared to be Rimi's deputy and group spokesman.

President Donald Trump announced Rimi's death earlier this month, saying the US had ""conducted a counterterrorism operation in Yemen"" that eliminated him.

That announcement came shortly after AQAP claimed responsibility for the December 6 mass shooting at a US naval base in Florida, in which a Saudi Air Force officer killed three American sailors.

Washington considers AQAP to be the worldwide jihadist network's most dangerous branch.

The Sunni extremist group has thrived in the chaos of years of civil war between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and Shiite rebels who control the capital.

""Under Rimi, AQAP committed unconscionable violence against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire numerous attacks against the United States and our forces,"" Trump said at the time.

""His death further degrades AQAP and the global Al-Qaeda movement, and it brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aqap-confirms-death-of-leader--appoints-successor--site-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/aqap-confirms-death-of-leader--appoints-successor--site.html

The country's National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports of 409 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 150 deaths from 31 provincial-level regions on Sunday.

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 77,150 with a total of 2,592 fatalities by the end of Sunday, the NHC said.

Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, the ground zero of the virus, continued to bear the brunt with 149 death while one person died in Hainan Province, it said.

The NHC also highlighted that recovered coronavirus patients have outnumbered new infections for the sixth consecutive day, indicating stabilisation of the virus situation in China.

Sunday saw 1,846 people walk out of hospital after recovery, much higher than the number of the same day's new confirmed infections which was 409, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

A total of 24,734 patients infected with the coronavirus have been discharged from hospital after recovery by the end of Sunday, the NHC said.

Meanwhile, the China-World Health Organisation (WHO) joint expert team visited Hubei Province, epicentre of the 'COVID-19' outbreak over the weekend to conduct field investigations, the NHC said.

The experts visited Tongji Hospital, the Wuhan Sports Centre that was converted into a temporary hospital, and the provincial centre for disease control and prevention to learn about the epidemic prevention and control as well as medical treatment, it said.

They also talked with officials and experts in the province and briefed NHC director Ma Xiaowei on their findings and suggestions, it said.

President Xi Jinping presided over a high-level meeting of officials on Sunday to review the progress of his government's efforts to contain the virus.

He warned that China's coronavirus epidemic is still ""grim and complex"" and called for more efforts to tackle the country's ""largest public health emergency"".

President Xi, who attended a meeting here to double efforts in coordinating the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak, said the epidemic ""has the fastest transmission, widest range of infection and has been the most difficult to prevent and control"".

""This is a crisis for us and it is a big test,"" he said.

The meeting, in the form of tele-conference, was presided over by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.

Xi acknowledged that the epidemic will ""inevitably have a large impact on the economy and society"" but the effects will be ""short-term"" and controllable.

""The epidemic situation remains grim and complex, and it is now a most crucial moment to curb the spread,"" Xi added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-team-visits-hospitals-in-china-s-coronavirus-hit-wuhan--death-toll-reaches-2-592-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/who-team-visits-hospitals-in-china-s-coronavirus-hit-wuhan--death-toll-reaches-2-592.html

231,24-2-20,"Earthquake kills nine in Turkey, injures dozens in Iran","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake in northwestern Iran on Sunday killed nine people, including children, in neighbouring Turkey and injured dozens on both sides of the border, authorities said.

Ambulances and teams of medics rushed to the scene after the quake left homes in piles of rubble in eastern Turkey, picking through the wreckage, while nearby schools were also reported damaged.

Turkish officials said four children were among the nine dead, and Iran reported more than 65 people injured, including 39 who were hospitalised. In Turkey, the earthquake was felt mostly in the eastern district of Baskale in Van province on the Iran border.

""We have right now no citizens trapped under the rubble,"" Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said.

At least 37 people were injured, nine in critical condition.

The epicentre of the quake, which struck at 0553 GMT was near the Iranian village of Habash-e Olya, less than 10 kilometres (six miles) from the border, according to the US Geological Survey.

The earthquake had a depth of six kilometres, Tehran University's Seismological Centre said.

A total of 24 aftershocks hit the region Sunday, two of them over 4.0 magnitude, Turkey's disaster management agency said.

Sunday's earthquake was felt in several Iranian cities, including Khoy, Urmia, Salmas and Osku, state media reported, though the impact was less severe than in Turkey.

Most injured in West Azerbaijan province, which was struck by two aftershocks Sunday.

The first aftershock was 4.3 magnitude and struck the same region at 1428 GMT, according to the US Geological Survey.

The second, at 1600 GMT, was 6.0 magnitude but it was four kilometres deeper than the one in the morning and therefore less likely to cause serious damage.

Both Iran and Turkey sit on top of major tectonic plates and see frequent seismic activity.

In November 2017, a 7.3-magnitude quake in Iran's western province of Kermanshah killed 620 people.

In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake in southeastern Iran decimated the ancient mud-brick city of Bam and killed at least 31,000 people.

Iran's deadliest quake was a 7.4-magnitude tremor in 1990 that killed 40,000 people in northern Iran, injured 300,000 and left half a million homeless. In December and January, two earthquakes struck near Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.

Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours have raised concerns about the reliability of the country's sole nuclear power facility, which produces 1,000 megawatts of power, and the risk of radioactive leaks in case of a major earthquake.

Turkey is also prone to earthquakes and over 40 people died in January after a 6.8-magnitude quake struck Elazig in eastern Turkey.

In 1999, a devastating 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Izmit in western Turkey, killing more than 17,000 people including about 1,000 in the country's most populous city, Istanbul.

Van, which was hit by a 7.1 magnitude quake in 2011 killing more than 500 people, was struck by tragedy again this month when two avalanches left 41 people dead.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/earthquake-kills-nine-in-turkey--injures-dozens-in-iran-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/earthquake-kills-nine-in-turkey--injures-dozens-in-iran.html

233,24-2-20,Welcome President Trump,"India, US likely to ramp up defence, strategic ties during visit

India and the USA are expected to significantly ramp up bilateral relations, especially in the defence and strategic ties, during US President Donald Trump’s two-day India visit starting on Monday.

Just before he emplaned for India on Sunday, Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi his “friend” and said he had committed to this visit long time back and he was looking forward to be with the people of India.

Trump is accompanied by First Lady Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and the top brass of his Administration.

Trump will arrive at Ahemdabad around 11.30 am, attend a roadshow, briefly visit Sabarmati Ashram, and also watch cultural performances. Prime Minister Modi is expected to receive him at the airport.

Modi will accompany Trump to the Ashram, which is closely associated with Mahatma Gandhi and India’s freedom struggle, in the midst of their joint roadshow from the international airport.

Earlier, confusion prevailed over Trump’s visit to the Ashram. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Friday said the White

House will take a call on such visit.

“Trump will arrive at the Ahmedabad International Airport at 11:30 am tomorrow (February 24). It was already announced that Trump will land here directly here from Washington. At the airport, he will be given the guard of honour,” Ahmedabad city Police Commissioner Ashish Bhatia said while addressing reporters. He said Trump would embark on a roadshow after attending a cultural programme.

“Trump will then proceed for the Sabarmati Ashram which he would be visiting for a very short time. From the Ashram, Trump will resume the roadshow, and reach the Motera stadium via Indira bridge,” the Police Commissioner said.

Modi and Trump are scheduled to address the “Namaste Trump” event at the Motera cricket stadium.

Just before his departure, Trump said he had committed to visit India long time back and he is looking forward to be with the people of India. “I look forward to being with the people of India. We are going to have many millions and millions of people. It’s a long trip. I get along very well with Prime Minister Modi. He is a friend of mine,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.

“I had committed to this trip long time ago. I look forward to it. I hear it’s going to be a big event... The biggest event they ever had in India. That’s what the Prime Minister told me. It’s the biggest event they ever had. It’s going to be very exciting. I am going to be there for one night,” said the US President in response to a question.

The maiden visit to India is expected to significantly ramp up bilateral defence and strategic ties but unlikely to produce tangible outcome in resolving thorny issues like trade tariffs.

The nearly 36-hour-long visit by Trump is also set to send across a clear message of growing congruence of interests on major geopolitical developments in the region and beyond, particularly when China has been expanding its military might and economic clout.

Trump, who is seeking re-election in the US presidential elections in November, will get a rousing welcome.

“Namaste Trump” will be similar to the landmark “Howdy, Modi!” event hosted by the Indian-American community in honour of Modi during his visit to Houston in September 2019.

From Ahmedabad, the US President will travel to Agra to have a glimpse of the iconic Taj Mahal. The Trump family will spend about an hour at the Taj Mahal before sunset. Then they will leave for Delhi for the main leg of the visit.

On the morning of February 25, Trump and the First Lady would be accorded a ceremonial welcome at the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. From there, they would go to Raj Ghat to pay homage at the “samadhi” of Mahatma Gandhi.

It would be followed by restricted and delegation-level talks between Trump and Modi at Hyderabad House. Prime Minister Modi would host a lunch for the US president following the bilateral talks.

In the afternoon, Trump is expected to attend certain private events at the US Embassy, including a roundtable with industry representatives. In the evening, the US president will meet President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

A banquet will be hosted by Kovind. President Trump would depart from India later that evening.

In their talks on Tuesday, Trump and Prime Minister Modi are likely to focus on a wide variety of bilateral and regional issues including trade and investment, defence and security, counter-terrorism, energy security, religious freedom, proposed peace deal with Taliban in Afghanistan and situation in the Indo-Pacific, according to Indian and US officials.

Trump’s visit to India comes at a time when the country has been witnessing widespread protests against a new citizenship law and strain in New Delhi’s ties with Islamabad over the Kashmir issue.

The visiting American delegation includes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and National Security Adviser Robert O’ Brien.

Senior advisers to the President Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, Chief of Staff to the First Lady Lindsay Reynolds, Assistant to the President and Special Representative for International Telecommunication Policy and Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff Robert Blair, and White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham are the other members of the delegation.

United States Ambassador to India Ken Juster is also part of the delegation.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/welcome-president-trump-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/welcome-president-trump.html
234,24-2-20,"Anti, pro-CAA groups clash in Jaffrabad","Police resort to tear gas, situation under control; several injured

Several people sustained minor injuries following a clash between pro and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters near northeast Delhi’s Jaffarabad area on Sunday. The police lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to mild lathi-charge to bring the situation under control. Later in the evening, the police took out a flag march to maintain law and order in the area.

The clash took place at 4 pm when the two groups started throwing stones at each other. All this happened in presence of heavy police deployment in the area. Witnesses said 500-odd people, mostly women, had gathered to protest against the new citizenship law. The protesters had also gathered in the area on Saturday night demanding that the new law be repealed.

As the anti-CAA group was shouting slogans against the new citizenship law, some people turned up shouting “Jai Sri Ram” slogans. “Suddenly, some people came and started throwing stones on the people gathered in the area,” an eyewitness told this newspaper. Soon, both the groups indulged in stone throwing, forcing the police to resort to lathi-charge. The police also lobbed teargas shells to disperse the crowd.

The trouble escalated further after BJP leader Kapil Mishra also decided to hold a rally in favour of the new citizenship law. Mishra, who arrived near the Jaffrabad Metro Station at 3 pm, demanded that the anti-CAA protesters be removed from the road. An hour later, some people came from a nearby street and started pelting stones.

Tension prevailed in the area as the protesters had blocked the road near the Jaffrabad metro station connecting Seelampur with Maujpur and Yamuna

Vihar.

This was the second day when the anti-CAA protesters had hit the streets, prompting Delhi Metro authorities to close the entry and exit gates of the Jaffarabad station. Later in the day, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) also closed the entry and exit gates to the Maujpur-Babarpur station.

A woman, who identified herself as Bushra, had said that till the time the CAA is not revoked, the protesters would not leave the site. Social activist Faheem Baig said there is resentment among people over the way the Government is handling the issue.

“This protest is against CAA, NRC and also seeking reservation for Dalits. The movement is primarily led by the women, while the men are only supporting them,” a protester named Shadab said. “We have blocked the road and we will not move from the site till the Centre revokes the draconian law,” he said.

In the evening Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) said stones were also pelted at the police. “The situation has been brought under control. Adequate personnel have been deployed and are conducting flag marches.”

Taking to twitter, Mishra said, “We have given a three-day ultimatum to the Delhi Police to get the road cleared. Get the Jafrabad and Chandbagh road cleared”.

In a video tweeted by him where he can be seen addressing the gathering, Mishra said, “They (protestors) want to create trouble in Delhi. That’s why they have closed the roads. That’s why they have created a riot-like situation here. We have not pelted any stone.

“Till US President is in India, we are leaving the area peacefully. After that we won’t listen to you (police) if the roads are not vacated by then,” he told the gathering.

The fresh sit-in protest comes at a time when efforts are being made to negotiate with the protesters at Shaheen Bagh whose agitation has resulted in traffic snarls along the Delhi-Noida route. A small stretch of the road closed for over two months was “opened” by a group of demonstrators on Saturday, though police barricades continued on one side.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/anti--pro-caa-groups-clash-in-jaffrabad-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/anti--pro-caa-groups-clash-in-jaffrabad.html

Protesters set afire a portion of a shop in the area, vandalised a police vehicle injuring some police officers. At least five persons were injured, two of them critically, said officials.

Following the clashes, mobile internet has been suspended for a six-hour period starting 6 pm. A RAF of UP Police has been deployed.

According to the cops the clashes took place after some protesters, who had gathered outside a police station to ask for permission to erect tents for protection against bad weather, allegedly threw stones and vandalized the vehicle of a local police officer - the Station House Officer -, prompting the cops to respond with a lathi-charge and fire tear gas shells to disperse the mob.

Speaking to reporters after the incident, Aligarh District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said the violence was under control and the mob had been dispersed.

“(The) violence started around 5 pm when a local police officer’s vehicle was pelted with stones. Soon after, the mob started throwing stones at us to disperse them and we had to use tear gas shells. The situation is under control,” Singh said, adding that the cops were also investigating the role of Aligarh Muslim University students in instigating the crowd.

240,24-2-20,Bouncing back isn't a term we use: Williamson on recovery after Oz debacle,"The perfect execution of plans against India has pleased New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson but he refused to term his team's 10-wicket win as ""bouncing back"" from their 0-3 debacle against Australia.

New Zealand came into the series after their nightmare in Australia and put up a splendid performance to outclass India in just over three days.

""Bouncing back isn't a term that we use within our group. You can get carried away thinking about results (especially) when you have a number of poor ones and sometimes the want (urge) for a good one can be a distraction towards getting (achieving) it,"" Williamson said after the first Test here on Monday.

The Kiwi skipper, who also was the top-scorer for his side with a well-made 89, seemed satisfied with the performances of each and every player of his team.

""So it's about focussing on things that are important. The roles that give us the best chance of success and if we do that, the result manifests and I think that's what we saw in this game and that was what was pleasing,"" Williamson said.

""It was a really brilliant all-round game for us. Guys were really committed to their roles on a surface that offered enough to create a good balance between bat and ball. It's a really important lesson moving forward to Christchurch,"" he added.

But Williamson also wants to guard his team against complacency as he expects India to come hard in the second Test, starting February 29

""The challenge is there in front of us because we know come Christchurch we will need to be on our game again. India is the number one in the world for a reason and they have had success all around the world,"" he said.

Man-of-the-match Tim Southee, who snared nine Indian wickets, was happy that there was some swing in offer for him.

""Being a swing bowler helps, and being able to swing the ball is always handy. The wind is always kind of assisting Trent (Boult) and me over his left shoulder and my right shoulder,"" Southee said.

""When it tends to be still here in Wellington, it does move around a bit more. It's about putting the ball in the right areas for a long period of time and we were able to get some assistance with the swing,"" the senior pacer added.

Southee said the drubbing against Australia did hurt New Zealand, but he and his teammates were looking ahead rather than losing sleep over what happened in the past.

""It's about looking forward rather than looking back and being able to move on from previous experiences.

""Just like this one, we'll enjoy tonight and our focus will shift to Christchurch. It's continuing to learn as a cricketer and enjoying every opportunity you get,"" Southee signed off.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bouncing-back-isn-t-a-term-we-use--williamson-on-recovery-after-oz-debacle-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/bouncing-back-isn-t-a-term-we-use--williamson-on-recovery-after-oz-debacle.html

242,24-2-20,Retired babus outdo netas in squatting Govt bungalows,"Politicians may be infamous for squatting on Government accommodations in Delhi, but it’s the Government employees — mostly retired — who beat the netas hands down when it comes to illegal occupation of official quarters. As many as 575 Government employees, from bureaucrats to beldars, continue to illegally occupy Government quarters.

The highest outstanding dues of Rs 95 lakh for such illegal occupation of Government quarters is in the name of a bureaucrat VP Rao.

Interestingly, even relatives of the babus have been found to be squatting on such premises. There are over 100 houses, where families or relatives of babus continued to occupy Government quarters even after the death of the original allottees. Some of these people have been over-staying for over two decade. The oldest being one who has ben squatting since 1998.

According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, a sum of Rs 30-40 crore is due on these illegal occupants as they have not paid rent so far. As far as 11 former MPs are concerned, many of them have vacated their bungalows except former MP Udit Raj. There are a number of babus who retired in 2000 and have not vacated their quarters. Of the 565 quarters, 244 are ‘type-II accommodations, while the rest are types VII, VI, V, IV and III categories.

As per the list, the family members of one Bale Ram, a beldar who died in 1998, have not vacated the Government quarter. They have also not paid any rent since 1998. The allotment of Bale Ram’s quarter was cancelled after his death in 1998.

SS Ramarao retired in 2000, but he has not vacated his type IV quarter so far. He has not paid rent since 2000 and his outstanding due is Rs 67 lakh. Commandant (retired) RK Swamy was allotted type IV quarter in Vikaspuri. He retired in May, 2001 but has not vacated his house so far. His outstanding rent is over Rs 74.38 lakh. Safai Karamchari Vijay Kumar retired in June 2003 but he has not vacated his quarter till date.

RK Sharma died in 2003. But his family is still staying at the Government quarter in RK Puram. They neither vacated the quarter nor paid any rent since 2003. The total due rent is over Rs 31 lakh. Pawan Kumar, a senior engineer, retired in 2003, but he has not vacated his type IV house in Munirka. The total amount of rent is due of Rs 67.44 lakh. PS Athmia retired in 2012 but is still occupying his accommodation illegally without paying rent.

SP Singh still occupied type V house in Vinay Marg and his rent amount rose to Rs 34 lakh.

Navneet Kumar Saxena’s case is unique. He took voluntary retirement in 2009 but has not vacated his quarter yet. The rent amount of Rs 57 lakh is pending on him. Indra Mohan Rawat, a havildar, retired in 2018, has also not vacated his quarter in Vasant Vihar.

Darneshwar Rai, a retired pump operator, has also not vacated his flat since September last year despite several reminders. In another case, the kin of Assistant Field Officer late RK Sharma have not vacated accommodations at RK Puram since 2005.

A total of 454 houses of type I, II and type III category, are occupied by class III and IV grade employees illegally without paying rent. As per the Ministry data, over two dozen cases are related to Kashmiri migrants.

The Delhi High Court has pulled up the Ministry for failing to vacate the illegally occupied Government accommodations in the city. “It appears that there is connivance from the officers of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Connivance over such a long time amounts to conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code. By their action, there is a huge loss to the Union of India, which is also an offence under the Indian Penal Code,” the court said.

The Court has directed the Ministry to submit a detailed report on action and recovery of dues from illegal occupants before February 27.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/retired-babus-outdo-netas-in-squatting-govt-bungalows-2020-02-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/retired-babus-outdo-netas-in-squatting-govt-bungalows.html
