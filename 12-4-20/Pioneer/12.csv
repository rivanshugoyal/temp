Besides, a 78-year-old woman who died on April 7, was found positive for

Covid-19 on Friday, officials said, adding that she was diabetic.

On Saturday, three fresh cases were reported from Jalandhar, two from Mohali and one each from Pathankot and Patiala, according to the medical bulletin.

In Jalandhar, the three people who contracted the infection were relatives of a man who died of Covid-19 on Thursday, the officials said. While a gardener of a Government officer tested positive in Patiala, a 42-year-old truck driver, who recently returned from Gurgaon, tested positive for the infection in Pathankot, the officials said. Out of the total 158 cases in the state, Mohali has the highest number of infected people at 50.

Nineteen cases were reported from Nawanshahr, followed by Pathankot 16, Jalandhar 15, Mansa and Amritsar 11 each, Ludhiana 10, Hoshiarpur 7, Moga 4, Rupnagar 3, Fatehgarh Sahib, Sangrur, Patiala, Barnala and Faridkot two each, and Muktsar and Kapurthala one each, according to the medical bulletin.

1,12-4-20,Ropar police sets example in fight against coronavirus,"Police officials in Ropar district have set an example for others to emulate in the fight against coronavirus, by converting a part of police lines area into a makeshift hospital with quarantine facilities.

DGP Dinkar Gupta said the wards of police personnel pursuing MBBS and nursing courses have volunteered to work at the hospital. With nine beds, which can be increased to 18, the hospital is well equipped to keep coronavirus patients in complete isolation, Gupta said in a statement.

The doctors and paramedics at the police lines are working round the clock to take care of the police personnel on field duty, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ropar-police-sets-example-in-fight-against-coronavirus.html
2,12-4-20,Punjab village sees 34 corona cases of close-knit families,"A village in Punjab's Mohali district saw two more coronavirus cases on Saturday, taking the total cases there to 34 in less than a week.

Health officials say all of them belong to close-knit and extended families of the prime patient, the 'panch' or an elected panchayat member of Jawaharpur village near Dera Bassi town, some 20 km from the state capital Chandigarh.

A day earlier, 11 cases came in Jawaharpur, which has a population of less than 3,000, and all contacts of the positive patient. Mohali Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan told IANS all the cases have no travel history and they were in the direct contact with the positive cases. He said all patients were relatives of an extended family and there was no case of community transmission.

""Extensive sampling has enabled us to identify more positive cases within the village and timely isolate them, hopefully containing the spread in the village with a population of 2,500 plus, as well as beyond,"" he said. The first case in the village was reported on April 4 with the 42-year-old 'panch', who runs a tent house, testing positive.

Doctors believe the tent house owner contracted Covid-19 from his part-time employee, who returned to the village after visiting Delhi's Nizamuddin Markaz in March. He has been missing since March 30. The panch's first cousin is the husband of village's sarpanch. Civil Surgeon Manjeet Singh said it is believed some outsiders stayed in the village till March 30 and they might be the source of infection. Most of the patients were asymptomatic and were detected only though tests. Jawaharpur is now a containment zone with a complete ban on movement of people along with three neighbouring villages.

Authorities blame the massive spread of the virus to frequent mingling of family members for the community kitchens organised by them to cater to the weaker sections during lockdown.

With the surfacing of 34 cases from a village, Mohali district that lies adjoining Chandigarh has emerged as a major hotspot of coronavirus with reporting of 50 cases -- almost one-third of state's total patients of 157.One woman was tested positive posthumously in the district, which saw 50 cases with two deaths.

""Health teams have sampled over 10 dead bodies and one positive case was reported,"" Dayalan said. He said the posthumously tested positive was a woman resident of Mundi Kharar. The Health Department said a total of 713 samples were collected in the district till April 9.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-village-sees-34-corona-cases-of-close-knit-families.html
3,12-4-20,Permit economic activities within the state during lockdown: Baghel urges PM Modi,"Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to permit economic activities within the state to continue during the lockdown period if it is extended.

Baghel also emphasized on the need to continue the restriction on inter-state road, air and rail transport, in view of the possibility of further spreading of the contagious coronavirus disease.

The CM made the suggestions during a video conference of the Prime Minister with the chief ministers of all the states to review the status of the coronavirus infection in different parts of the country.

The chief minister also urged the Prime Minister that the number of PPE kits should be increased and testing facilities should also be expanded.

Baghel also suggested that central university examinations should be postponed or conducted online and added that lack of clear instructions in the guidelines set by the Centre for the purchase of test kits is creating confusion.

Clear guidelines are required in this regard, the CM suggested.

He said that the MSME sector in the state is constantly demanding economic package and due to the extended period of lockdown, the existence of the sector, which provides maximum employment to the people, is in danger.

The CM informed the Prime Minister that of the 18 people in the state, who were detected with the coronavirus infection, 10 have recovered until now and the condition of the remaining eight patients is stable.

All seven people linked to Tablighi Jamaat who were found infected with virus, have been admitted to AIIMS Raipur, their condition is also stable. And no Covid-19 deaths in the state have been recorded until now, Baghel said.

In view of the increasing number of people getting infected with the deadly virus, the chief minister suggested that the lockdown and the restrictions on inter-state road, rail and air travel should continue.

On the occasion, state health minister TS Singhdeo, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, state additional chief secretary Subrata Sahu, health secretary Niharika Barik Singh, food secretary Kamalpreet Singh were also present.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/permit-economic-activities-within-the-state-during-lockdown--baghel-urges-pm-modi.html
4,12-4-20,Face mask mandatory,"The state health department on Saturday issued an order to make wearing of facemask or face cover mandatory in public places across the state.

5,12-4-20,Man booked for hiding foreign travel history,"Police have registered an FIR against a 47-year-old man for concealing his foreign travel history, police said here on Saturday.

“The man—a priest—had returned from Germany which is coronavirus-hit and was secretly residing at a church in Jorajam village in Jashpur district,” station house officer (SHO) Bagicha Saklu Ram Bhagat said.

The priest was booked after it was known that he had evaded the returning from Germany last month, Bhagat said.

On March 19, the Jashpur district administration had advised people with history of travel abroad to remain under mandatory quarantine due to possible exposure to coronavirus, irrespective of whether they show any symptoms of the infection, the SHO said.

The man has been admitted in a quarantine centre and an FIR was registered against him after getting a complaint from the office of Tahsildar, police said.

He has been booked under Section 269 IPC (unlawfully or negligently doing something which is likely to spread infection of any dangerous disease to life), Section 270 IPC (malignant act likely to spread infection of dangerous disease to life), Section 271 IPC (knowingly disobeying any quarantine rule) and Section 188 of IPC (for disobeying any government order) and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, the SHO said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/man-booked-for-hiding-foreign-travel-history.html

The 16-year-old boy from Katghora was discharged from a hospital, they said.

Now all the initial 10 Covid-19 patients being discharged from hospitals and only eight people infected with the infectious disease, who are linked to Tablighi Jamaat Marzak congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin and tested positive together in a bunch, a couple of days back, are undergoing treatment in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, the officials said.

No new cases of Covid-19 have reported in the state in the last couple of days, doctors and officials said.

All eyes are now on the new hotspot in the state—in Katghora town in Korba district—where test reports of the other quarantined suspects are awaited.

The state government and district administration have sealed off the entire town and have decided to test each and every resident of the town for Covid-19.

Meanwhile, sources in the state health department said that the test reports of all the 47 suspects, sent in the first lot, have tested negative.

The government is now waiting for the reports of the remaining 85 swab samples of the quarantined people linked to Tablighi Jamaat which were taken a couple of days back after eight new cases were detected simultaneously on a single day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/katghora-youth-recovers-from-covid-19.html
7,12-4-20,Ancient practices that made sense,"The threat from the tiniest of the creations of nature shows where homo sapiens stand in the scheme of things of the mighty universe. Pushed to the wall inside the homes, the haughty humanity seems to be at its wits end trying to tone down its ambitions of conquering the sun, the moon, the stars and the oceans. Once again, we learn the basic lesson that survival of humanity is a formidable challenge that economic prosperity may not help in fighting. But against this backdrop comes an important realisation that what our ancestors practiced during the ages which we lost in history and complacence made much more sense than what we thought, inebriated by the power of modern science. As the pleasant and mild Namaste becomes the norm replacing a hot and vigorous handshake, we understand the importance of social distancing. The present scenario takes me back more than 5 decades in the time machine when my mother had quarantined me after the infection from chicken pox virus and those painful and itchy eruptions had made life miserable. I was lodged in a room where only my mother would enter and give whatever was required. No outsider was allowed to visit the house nor anyone from the house would leave station. It made little sense to me as I had started studying everyday science in my standard 6 class. But my Quarantine was religiously followed in the name of Goddess Shitala and no chappals were allowed. My clothes would be taken and dipped in boiled water. The treatment, though largely palliative would involve warm water in which Neem leaves ware soaked to wash my face and body, and a few branches of thin Neem twigs with new leaves to brush and fan the rashes that had erupted. It all appeared so archaic. But I was given no option. The other regular feature of those days was that just in the beginning of first month of the Hindu calendar, the chaitra month, for the first 7 days we were all made to drink a few spoonful of juice of Neem leaves which was too bitter to consume. Again no option. Of course to counter bitterness we were given a few small pieces of sugar candy or jaggery. Similarly, there were many such practices that appeared meaningless but were religiously followed. One thing was always emphasised. The religious significance of those practices that made us adhere to them. As modern science now explains the significance of many of those practices we come to realise that our ancestors, too, had wisdom and scientific temper. It was our attitude towards those practices and the assumptions ingrained in our minds that West was best led to dismissing our traditional knowledge as trivial. But we need to revisit the treasure trove of our traditional knowledge and use them scientifically. Traditional knowledge and modern scientific information need not be two discrete bodies of knowledge but a Continuum for the benefit of humanity. We need to understand, as we struggle to buy hand sanitisers, that the potash alum the village barber used as after shave was quite effective and cheap. Similarly, the everyday practice of lighting lamps at dusk, with camphor pieces, also had a scientific basis. The rituals which we practice were not just rituals. They had meaning. It is time to recapitulate what has been gradually obliterated from our memories as a result of interventionist informational onslaught.

8,12-4-20,Covid-19 origin: Truth is stranger than fiction,"China’s ‘peaceful’ rise is today viewed with suspicion in many quarters. The threat of a Red China as propagated by the West during the Cold War era cannot be brushed aside. At this Covid-19 moment, China must come clean so that the global community can repose faith in its leadership

China is on its own course. This year it is completing the 71st year of its Independence. From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping, China has travelled a long distance. Dispelling fears among the world powers that its rise is absolutely peaceful. Despite its domestic problems and mounting global challenges, the country’s communist leadership has been able to make friends and allies and keep the enemies at bay so far. However, its neighbours in the Asian continent and the rest of the world view China with suspicion.

China is working hard to ensconce herself in a desired global order so that dominant powers, like the US, find it difficult to drag her away. Following the teachings of Sun Tsu, the veteran Chinese war strategist, Taoist philosopher and general of the 6th century BCE, the successive Chinese leaders have been able to overcome troubles since its birth as an Independent nation on October 1, 1949.

Mao Zedong, known popularly as “Chairman Mao” who ruled China from 1949 to 1976, established a Communist regime and ruled the country with iron fists. Marking a stark contrast from the then existing Communist regime in the USSR which was purely based on the teachings of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, Mao proclaimed his brand of socialism as “socialism with Chinese characteristics”. But then in reality, this socialism was none other than a kind of socialism that reflected Marxism-Leninism adapted to the Chinese circumstances.

During Mao’s “Great Leap Forward” from 1958-1962, as many as 45 million people died from his failed attempt to convert small family firms to communes while pushing them into steel production at the same time. And another disaster that Mao heralded was the “Cultural Revolution” from 1966 to 1976. What Mao did was another blot on the modern Chinese history. He indeed surpassed the record of the country’s first emperor Quin Shi Huang, who buried 460 scholars alive thinking them as threats to his power.

However Mao’s campaign to eradicate both cultural relics and the traditionalism they bring and academic intellectualism led to the killing of nearly 46,000 scholars. And this eventually brought down industrial production by 14 per cent in 1967. Though Mao era ended with more of chaos and internal disorder, China had made its unique mark in the comity of nations.

By 1979, Deng Xiaoping adopted the historic “Open Door Policy” which spearheaded the process to bring in a real economic miracle in the country. However the biggest irony was that the Communist China could not find its miracle within the tenets of its very own trilogy of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, but finally rediscovered it in the heart of capitalism only. The China advocates boastfully say that the country’s success comes from an effective hybridisation of both capitalism and socialism. And it’s not simply China’s taste of capitalism. For example, the hallmark of such hybridisation could be directly pointed out at the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that single-handedly dominated the country’s economy in the beginning, but then their roles were gradually reduced in successive years. Strikingly, the SOEs once again have received the same treatment now under the Xi regime.

What exactly operates in China is that sovereign help preferential financing, and large subsidies normally offer a big boost to Chinese firms in comparison to firms in other countries. With the coming of Xi in 2012, China has maintained a 6 per cent plus GDP growth. What critics say is that he has done it at the cost of massive debt. Under his tutelage, the building of ghost cities and roads have continued in the name of expanding infrastructure facilities and increasing employment opportunities. His regime has allowed select companies to remain as defaulters under his very nose even as he is raging a war against corruption, mismanagement and nepotism. At this juncture, the Western economists come to realise that China’s state- owned enterprises could easily devour bad loans the way it can’t be thought of in a market economy. Many analysts believe that Chinese banks may have ten times more bad loans than they actually report in public and to the outside world.

The ongoing trade war between the US and China revolves around many key issues. But initially President Donald Trump was really unhappy about the fact that American export to China was more than $540 billion whereas China to the US was $120 billion per annum in 2018. But this trade war includes range of other controversial issues such as theft of intellectual property rights to state subsidies. Around the same time, the controversy around the technologies made by Huawei, a Chinese software giant came to the forefront of trade tensions between America and China.

The US suspicion regarding Huawei predated the current trade dispute but the legal battle around the arrest of the company’s chief financial officer Meng Wenzhou added the tensions between Trump and Xi. The main controversy behind the Huawei is that its founder, and current CEO, Ren Zhengfei, was previously an officer in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

And many companies and Governments who normally mistrust the Chinese Government and its enterprises veer around the idea that the Huawei’s huge database of customers may be used by Beijing for espionage network.

The first of such espionage charges came out in 2012. Then a US Congressional panel concluded that both the Huawei and ZTE Corporation, a rival Chinese telecom company, could pose a security threat to the country. And it was followed by the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc, by excluding Huawei and the ZTE from their 5G network.

Today it has been realised that the 5G network developed by China with at least its three telecom giants is 20 times faster than 4G network. The 5G network can enable better connectivity among all kinds of devices starting from smartphones to driverless cars. On the other hand, the 5G network developed mostly privately and regulated by the federal and state agencies in the US has been allowed to play a much smaller role than the Chinese ones. These all have added to the growing business war between the US and China. It may be a conspiracy on the part of the Western Governments and trading companies to pull down a Chinese company that is fast taking both their business space and network.

The Covid-19, a Chinese originated epidemic from the heart of its wet market in Wuhan, has taken a deadly toll across the world. Today many in the West and around the world are simply branding this new virus as a kind of “biological weapon” launched by China to put the rest, especially the US and Europe, behind.

Some of the China sceptics are labelling this disease as a new type of “Red War” or “Red Threat” released by the Communist leadership in Beijing to teach the world a lesson. It is alleged that China has fought the Third World War even without fighting a single bullet. How has this dreaded virus challenged the scientific inventions and discoveries that have failed to stop its assault on the mankind around the world? Is it not unbelievable that despite the world fast turning out to be a graveyard, China is opening up the Wuhan wet market and business activities across the Hubei province? Surely, scientific research and technology can easily find a solution soon for Covid-19.

China’s fast opening of the Wuhan province seems little mysterious when the whole world is grappling with the fear of a virus originated in that city only. It means China must have made a new drug to control the virus and hence restarting its business and allowing people to come out. If it is so, Beijing must come out openly and help the rest of humanity to stop this menace. If it is not doing this, there must be some ulterior motive behind the spread of the virus. Only time, adequate scientific research and smart intelligence could establish the fact in due course of time.

Keeping these in mind, today it is uncertain whether China’s rise will be absolutely peaceful. In fact, it can’t be judged solely by its rhetoric or its politically framed narratives released by the Communist Party. When we go by the traditional liberal and conservative frameworks offered by global experts, what we gather from them is that a country will be willing to use peaceful means to resolve any conflict situation provided it is in the national interest of the nation.

But then history does not bear any single route for a nation to become a dominant power with a peaceful rise. And herein the rise of China certainly raises some pertinent questions as to its real intentions while engaging the rest of the world. While echoing the postulations of American theorist Hans J Morgenthau, one can safely say that it is very natural that a new rising power will definitely challenge the status quo. And this will lead to the rise of the new power less peaceful unless there is some kind of balance of power to tame the new one. While advancing his thesis for a fierce power struggle between the status quo and the new power, he strongly rejects the liberal thesis that advances in education, culture, and technologies enhance the prospects for peace and stability. But theorists such as Samuel P Huntington believe that it is not the power trajectory but there could be an obvious clash with China from cultural perspectives.

Huntington argues that “China’s history, culture, traditions, size, economic dynamism and self-image all impel it to assume a hegemonic position in East Asia. This goal is a natural result of its rapid economic development. All other major powers, Britain and France, Germany and Japan, the United States and the Soviet Union, have engaged in outward expansion, assertion, and imperialism coincidental with or immediately following the years in which it went through rapid industrialisation and economic growth. No reason exists to think that the acquisition of economic and military power will not have comparable effects on China”. This indicates that China will have a direct encounter with the West or with the rest of the established dominant powers in international politics.

Hu Jintao, the predecessor of Xi, advocated for “peaceful rise” and “peaceful development”. But many international observers remained puzzled as to whether this was a tactical or strategic move in that time or for future.

Also it was broadly discussed around the world whether such a strategy is going to last or to be changed as per the global and regional situation demands.

Alongside, many sceptics argued that when China obtains primacy in the global affairs, will it continue to seek reciprocal relationships with other dominant powers and maintain a benign position in the Asian continent.

But when we analyse today’s China and its leadership, we could visualise two different situations: first, the advocates of a revisionist China or China threat theory clearly points out that China will obviously try to alter the existing global order and its rule book as to suit its own demands.

And in fact, this was done by the major powers in the past. During the time of Hu, China was more or less non-aggressive and today under Xi, the country is fast appearing to take a more dominant rule, taking the advantage of the decline of the US and the EU’s roles at major global platforms and circumstances.

That’s why many of these China threat theorists underlined the point that the country’s current strategy seems benign and calm. But it remains unclear the course that China will follow if its current “peace and development” strategy fails to succeed.

When we flip through the pages of history, what we experience is more of a pessimistic scenario of China’s rise. In 2006, John Mearsheimer, in his seminal article in the “Current History” rightly highlighted that China’s rise would not be peaceful. It is very much evident from the policies and strategies adopted by Xi since the time he took over from Hu in 2012.

He has rightly moved from the earlier strategy of peaceful rise to his grand “China Dream” wherein he aspire his nation to be simply a globetrotter very much like him.

China has re-emerged for quite some time when the world has witnessed almost the downfall of the liberal order. Many say the West has experienced in many of its countries the rise of the illiberal order. And around the same time, the Eurozone is facing a debilitating financial crisis accompanied by a looming Brexit crisis.

Undoubtedly, China has filled this gap. Its doom as predicted by many liberal theorists with its entry into the era of market economy has not so far come true. Rather China and its Communist leadership have adequately placed its socialist system in tandem with the country’s capitalist expansion.

Sadly, with Xi, the country has seen an extraordinary level of animosity not only with its neighbours but also with the major powers of the world. He and his regime as dubbed correctly as a reincarnation of “Chairman Mao” is simply brewing infighting within the Party and chaos around the overseas territories of China such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea, East China Sea and most prominently, within the country in the restive province of Xinxiang.

His truly authoritarian style of functioning and making him the President for life i.e. lifting the two years presidential terms is indicating the return of a Mao-era.

His over-ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR), China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and rapid encircling of India in and around the Indian Ocean are simply starting new great game in the continent. High investments in Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and finally making Pakistan an all-weather friend can be regarded as the beginning of a new war theatre in the sub-continent.

China’s rise or re-emergence can be laced with high probability of big falls for sure. The threat of a Red China as propagated by the West during the Cold War era cannot be brushed aside. Its journey from peaceful rise to peaceful development is today viewed with apprehension in many quarters.

Its money, muscle power and authoritarian leadership all together have given what it has achieved today. Its attempt to expand beyond borders can create insecurity not only for itself but also for the rest of the world.

If China is strictly following what Sun Tsu said many centuries back: “the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting and all warfare is based on deception”, it would certainly lose the rare chance of leading world once and for all. At this Covid-19 moment, China must come out transparent so that the global community can repose faith in its leadership.

Truly speaking, by the beginning of the last decade of the 20th century, Wilsonianism seemed triumphant because the Russophobia and the Communist ideological trap had been overcome by the credentials of liberal democracy.

But then, with the start of the 21st century, when we largely encounter a downfall of the liberal order, an Asian order under the leadership of China (though many in Asia will simply reject Beijing’s mentorship) could have shown a new path to the international community. It seems China may rightly lose the same.

9,12-4-20,India rose to corona challenge rather well,"Every Indian — including those who complained bitterly on social media and argued that we had exercised the wrong options — contributed to this war effort and made sacrifices in some way or another. However, this was possible because we had the necessary leadership

In this time of enforced leisure and enhanced anxiety, it is impossible to not engage in bouts of counterfactual history. What if, it is repeatedly asked, China hadn’t been so pig-headed as to deny and underplay the coronavirus threat when it first manifested itself late last year in Wuhan? What if the overpaid apparatchiks in the World Health Organization hadn’t chosen to uncritically accept China’s version of the coronavirus? What if we had sealed off the world into compartments much earlier? And, in India, what if the bigoted head of the Tablighi Jamaat had realised the changed circumstances and called off his convention in Delhi’s Nizamuddin?

These are questions that will forever haunt us as we stare into an uncertain future and a totally disoriented world. In India, we are confronted with the very real likelihood of the national lockdown being extended till the end of April at least. By then — or so we hope and pray — the spread of the pandemic will have been contained and even if normal life doesn’t resume, we can get out of the abnormal existence we lead today.

To be a decision-maker at this time is a horrible prospect. In normal circumstances, the choices before the leadership involve calculating political, economic and social costs. Today, the choices are existential — a wrong decision can have catastrophic consequences. More to the point, there is no absolute right and absolute wrong. Each decision, however well-intentioned and considered, involves paying a heavy price.

On the strength of the ICMR’s modelling, it is said that if the Central Government hadn’t taken the drastic decision to impose a national, 21-day lockdown, some 8.2 lakh would have been infected by the coronavirus. The lockdown has —except in some areas where people have chosen to be contrarian — been reasonably successful and, at last count, the number of those tested coronavirus positive is just above 6,000. As for the one lakh people around the world who have died as a result of the pandemic, India’s contribution is negligible. It would have been even more so had some people acted with a greater sense of responsibility.

True, we have paid a huge social, economic and emotional cost in keeping India’s numbers manageable. The plight of migrant workers, left to fend for themselves by heartless employers and an inhospitable city, has been quite vividly captured, particularly by those who now feel that India over-reacted. However, what has been less documented and appreciated is the huge extent of support the poor and helpless have got from community, religious and political groups. The State has no doubt chipped in and at least ensured supplies of dry rations to most parts of India. But without the solid support from the voluntary groups and community organisations, India would have confronted social unrest. That hasn’t happened.

Incidentally, talking about organisations that have done sterling work organising relief to those who need it most, we have read about the contributions of the Sikh gurdwaras, the big temples like Tirupati and bodies such as the Bharat Sevasram Sangh and the RSS. However, I have searched in vain for the relief work done by those multinational NGOs who guilt-trip individuals in the West, particularly during Christmas, to contribute some money and salvage their conscience. Presumably they are busy during the lockdown preparing some weighty and over-sensationalised report on how the poor got a bad deal from the coronavirus crisis. I look forward to reading the reports and simultaneously gnashing my teeth.

The larger point I am making is that when the history of the coronavirus pandemic comes to be written, it will record that India rose to the challenge rather well. Every Indian —including those who complained bitterly on social media and argued that we had exercised the wrong options —contributed to this war effort and made sacrifices in some way or another. However, this was possible because we had the necessary leadership. Imagine what would have happened had the country entered the coronavirus crisis with a fragile Government led by someone who didn’t have the necessary political and moral authority? The results could have been absolutely calamitous.

I am aware that many sceptics and a section of the international community poked fun at Modi’s appeal for lighting a diya. The whole exercise got a spectacular response, even in areas where people are not accustomed to voting for the BJP. No doubt some people attached a quasi-religious significance to the 9pm-9minute appeal. But in the main people voluntarily participated for two reasons. First, because they wanted to be part of the larger national community and, secondly, because at a moment of grave challenge they felt that the leadership needed endorsement. This was less a political gesture than an endorsement of national solidarity.

The point needs to be highlighted because although the federal structure of India involves States tailoring their responses to suit specific requirements, there has been no bid to actually initiate a political war with the Centre. Some non-BJP Governments have actually done rather well —Delhi, Rajasthan, Odisha and Maharashtra being examples. Others, notably West Bengal have preferred short-term approaches that could be potentially damaging in the long-run. However, no Chief Minister has thought this was the time to trigger a constitutional crisis centred on wilful disregard of a national approach. Even Bengal has concealed its contrarian impulses by toning down the rhetoric while allowing social distancing to go for a six.

Creating a national approach has involved restraint from all sides. This is maturity and may be the basis of a healthier political order when life returns to normal.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/india-rose-to-corona-challenge-rather-well.html
10,12-4-20,4 worst-affected Haryana districts fall in red zone: CM,"To contain Covid-19 cases, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said four districts of the State, including Gurgaon, which have reported the maximum number of cases, will be declared red zones, meaning stricter restrictions will be placed in the areas to check the spread of the virus.

The four districts --Gurgaon, Faridabad, Nuh and Palwal -- account for more than 100 cases out of the over 160 cases reported in the state. Many areas in these districts have already been declared containment zones.

After interacting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference, Khattar said in a televised address this evening that the indications from the meeting were that the lockdown is set to increase by two weeks.

It emerged during the meeting of chief ministers that areas should be categorised depending on the severity of the spread, he said.

Khattar, who had urged people to wear a mask whenever they step out of their home, said now it is a must and they should make it a habit just like we wear clothes.

About Haryana, he said, the State will be divided into three categories the worst affected will be declared a red zone. Gurgaon, Faridabad, Nuh and Palwal are in that category.

The remaining 18 districts will be divided into two categories vulnerable areas in orange category, where coronavirus cases are fewer than worst-affectedareas. The third category will be of areas with minimum impact of coronavirus, he said.

The lockdown, however, will continue in all three categories. The restrictions could be milder in areas with minimally affected by the virus for economic activities, he said.

Khattar said all Chief Ministers gave their suggestions to the Prime Minister and most of them said the nationwide lockdown should be continued beyond April 14. A formal announcement will be made by the Prime Minister but all of us should be prepared, he said.

Khattar said the CMs said increasing the lockdown can help contain the spread of the virus and the Prime Minister stressed the focus now is on 'jaan bhi, jahan bhi'. Khattar said it was pointed out during the meeting that the economic activities have come to a halt and to keep these suspended for a long time is difficult for any Nation or State. If the lockdown is extended, the Prime Minister has indicated that some arrangements will be made so that small enterprises can restart. He said CMs also raised the issues related to the farmers.

Social distancing plan committees will be formed, which will work at the village, block,district, city level and will decide which industry can be allowed to run. Movement of raw material and finished goods will be allowed, he said.

To ensure there is no crowding when people go out to buy essentials items like vegetables, it has been decided to increase the duration for which such stores can open.

He said banks have been asked to work out an arrangement so that customers can request a 'token' over phone to reduce crowding at bank branches.

To provide healthcare facilities at doorsteps including medicines, the number of mobile dispensaries will be increased from 250 to 500, he said.

CHIEF SECRETARY DIRECTS OFFICERS ON MEDICAL FACILITIES

Haryana Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Saturday directed the officers concerned to ensure that the general public is not deprived of basic medical facilities and to start facilities of mobile clinics for which Haryana Roadways buses will be used.

She directed the Deputy Commissioners to personally inspect the procurement centres to ensure that all the arrangements are in place. She also said that it should be ensured that the movement of combines and harvesters should not be restricted so that the harvesting is not hindered.

During the meeting, Additional Chief Secretary, Haryana Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal said special mechanisms have been put in place in order to avoid rush at the centers. He said that details regarding which farmer will go to which mandi and on what day will be communicated to them through SMS and a list of the same will be given to the Panchayats of the villages in order to streamline the procurement process.

He shared that a Standard design for purchase centres has been prepared and designated seating plan of staff, Arthiyas, labourers has been made and every Deputy Commissioner has been directed to keep a check that the same is being implemented in each centre.

Kaushal said the entry and exit points of the procurement centres will be monitored closely and only those with unique IDs and gate passes will be allowed to enter. He said that an instruction booklet will be given to the Marketing Board employees, Arthiyas, procurement agencies, labourers, and farmers to help them navigate the procurement process smoothly. He said that since the number of procurement centres have been increased this year the employees of procurement agencies will fall short for which the employees of other departments will be deployed to ensure efficient procurement.

BIO-METRIC NOT TO BE INSISTED FOR PENSION

Giving a relief to the pensioners covered under various social security schemes, who are unable to withdraw their pension through biometric or voucher till June 30, Haryana Government has decided not to stop their pension.

Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, O.P. Yadav said presently it is mandatory that beneficiaries covered under various schemes like old age honor allowance, widow pension, Ladli pension and Divyang pension have to withdraw their pension through biometric or voucher at least once in three months but if they fail to do the same then the pension amount is sent back to the department through bank or post office and then the department stops the pension benefit of that beneficiary and he has to reapply for the pension after one year.

He said due to the ongoing lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak across the country and pensioners were facing trouble to withdraw their pension through vouchers by going to banks. He said that keeping in view the present circumstances, the Government has decided that the pension of the beneficiaries who are unable to withdraw their pension will not be stopped till June 30.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/4-worst-affected-haryana-districts-fall-in-red-zone--cm.html

14,12-4-20,District adm calls total lockdown for next 48 hours,"The Raipur district administration on Saturday decided to close all the grocery shops and vegetable vends on Sunday and Monday in order to enforce the lockdown more effectively, officials here said.

The ban will not be for enforced on the supply of essential commodities like medicine and milk supply, they said.

Medical shops as well as milkmen will be exempt from the total lockdown for the convenience for the people, the officials said.

Visualizing a drastic increase in the numbers of lockdown violators, the city police too are going to be tough against people venturing out in private vehicles without any valid reasons.

It has been noticed that a section of the people chose to ignore polite requests as the roads in the capital city are swamped with vehicles, officials said.

The excuse of going out for purchase of grocery and vegetables is a common plea of the violators and the police are helpless to control the situation, city police officials said.

Following the failure of a soft approach to implement the lockdown, the capital city police on Saturday decided to crack down on the violators in order to get the desired effect of the lockdown, they said.

“The polite request to the people of return back home, was not working and so the administration has decided to change their strategies and to take stern action,” a senior police official, who did not want to be named, said.

With the new stricture, it is expected that the number of people defying the lockdown will come down drastically in days to come, the official said.

Police will seize of vehicles of lockdown violators and notices under the Motor Vehicle Act will be issued within 48 hours, the official added.

15,12-4-20,"BJP mahila workers have stitched 1 L masks, distributed them free: Bansal","While Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is leading the fight against coronavirus to prevent its spread in the UP and provide relief to the needy, Bharatiya Janata Party state organising secretary Sunil Bansal has been holding the fort at the party level. He has been asking party workers to work at the grassroots level and ensure that no one sleeps hungry.

Here are excerpts of the interview with him.

Pioneer: The BJP government is doing its bit to control coronavirus. What is the BJP organisation doing? Have you directed BJP workers to tell people about prevention and control of spread of the virus.

Bansal: Yes, party workers were issued directives after the lockdown was imposed. We have told leaders and workers to go to the people and make them aware of the virus and preventive measures to keep it away. Medical guidelines are being followed in letter and spirit. Party workers have also been asked to contribute generously to the Covid Care Fund.

Pioneer: This is a contagious disease and you are saying that party workers are interacting with people. Is it not dangerous?

Bansal: The guidelines issued to workers are clear – maintain social distancing, use mask and wash hands frequently. They are not holding meetings and are only telling people at village level about preventive measures.

Pioneer: That means the workers have been asked to tell people to use mask.

Bansal: That’s correct. If they do not have mask they can use gamchha or women can use dupatta to cover their faces. The basic point is that one should not touch the mouth and nose regularly.

As we speak, our woman workers are stitching masks at homes. They have stitched and distributed more than one lakh masks. These are not medical but cotton masks which can be used. These are being distributed free to the people.

Pioneer: BJP is a big party with over a crore of members in the state. How is it coping up with the lockdown and what are the party workers doing during this period.

Bansal: Party workers have been asked to arrange food for the needy, open community kitchens in wards and blocks.

Pioneer: Are you monitoring whether BJP leaders and workers are actually helping people?

Bansal: Yes, we are doing it over phone or through video-conferencing. We also ask people to send photos and cross-check them from others. I can guarantee that the BJP workers are working at the grassroots level with ‘sewa bhav’.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-mahila-workers-have-stitched-1-l-masks--distributed-them-free--bansal.html

Noted chartered accountant (CA) Saras Jain said, “ Our Jain Samaj is feeding stray cows, calves and bulls even. We give them tawa roti, which is made of the same flour of which we eat rotis.”

Saras Jain said, “It all started when we gave rotis to some very hungry, old and a few pregnant cows and then to our surprise we found that a couple of cows just walked down behind our roti man for more rotis. It was a heart touching scene.”

Now on an average we have earmarked 200 to 250 tawa rotis for these hungry stray livestock every-day here said this CA.

The owner of a prestigious vegetarian restaurant Lazeez Tamkesh Jain has allowed Jain Samaj to use his restaurant for its community kitchen for food for the poor and the hungry.

Saras Jain said, “Food is prepared by our team of cook led by Gopal Maharaj. Preparation of food is done in a very hygienic condition. Quality of food is the same which this restaurant used to serve to its customers.”

Sources said 100 to150 packets of food of this Jain Samaj are taken down by personnel of Medininagar Municipal corporation for its distribution among the needy but the saddest part is that the food packets of Jain Samaj so distributed are passed as one from the municipal corporation.

As many as 40 to 45 packets reach Sewa Sadan a maternity hospital here for patients and their attendants who have no ‘root’ in Daltonganj. Traffic police unit gets 30 to 35 packets. Similar number of packets goes to Palamu medical college hospital.

A large bulk of packets goes to poor and hungry having no address except hunger on their faces lying in wait for food near railway station, at Chiyanki etc.

A software engineer of Amazon based in Hyderabad but at present in Daltonganj working from home Sumit Jain helps in packing of food every day said Saras Jain adding 450 packets are distributed for lunch while 250 for dinner.

“ Women and girls had offered to help us in preparing and packing of food but our Samaj decided to keep it all a male affair where people in the age group of 20 to 40 work with dedication and pious emotion in two shifts forenoon and afternoon’ said Saras Jain.

The Jain Samaj is spending nearly 25,000 a day for 700 packets said the CA who added, “ The determination and commitment of Jain Samaj is too high and money will not be a factor rather we are planning to spread our food cover more from 700 to 800 or so.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jain-samaj-of-daltonganj-feed-people--stray-animals.html

The Raipur MP said that instead of trying to honestly tackle the situation with available resources, for political mileage, the Congress government in the state has been taking hasty decisions, which is a mockery of the health of the people.

Soni further said that now only the AIIMS, Raipur, has the facility for treating coronavirus patients in the state.

He pointed out that until now, no cabinet ministers or even the chief minister has visited the AIIMS, where dedicated doctors and staffs are working around the clock, and both testing and treating patients.

“As a responsible opposition, the SP is aware of its duties and cannot run away from its responsibility.

42,12-4-20,Migratory birds yet to depart city reservoirs,"While every possible step is being taken to tackle the Coronavirus outbreak, it is surprising how the pandemic is affecting the environment in more ways than one. As Ranchi continues to be under the 21- day lockdown, one of the positive effects of this has been the tremendous reduction in the pollution levels.

“The quality of air has drastically improved and there are no dust particles present at the moment. The primary reason behind this is not too difficult to understand. Presently, there are almost no vehicles on the roads and all factories are also closed. Hence pollution levels have vastly decreased. The atmosphere is also free of poisonous gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. This will surely have a very positive effect on everyone’s health,”said Environmentalist and Assistant Professor, Department of Geology Ranchi University, Dr Nitish Priyadarshi.

In spite of the mercury levels gradually increasing, thousands of migratory birds can still be seen flocking around the water bodies in the State capital. The birds which travel from the far away land of Siberia in search of food and protection from the bitter cold, generally visit this region from the months of November to February.

“It is the second week of April and surprisingly these birds are still here where as they would latest fly off by March. These winged beauties can be seen around Kanke Dam and Bada Talab. The birds are here because there is absolutely no human interference and they are not being poached at the moment. The other reason being that the birds are in their natural habitat and are feeding on their natural vegetation in the water bodies. The birds will surely go back to their homeland but presently they seem to be enjoying the solitude and the pleasing weather conditions,” added Priyadarshi.

With the imposed lockdown and lack of air, noise and light pollution, this is also the ideal time to stargaze. With bright blue skies during the day, numerous stars and constellations can be seen at night.

“Right now there is no pollution in the environment and hence the visibility has also increased. Numerous constellations like the Saptarishi or the Ursa Major, Rohini Nakshatra and the pole star are all clearly visible. Nature can be seen in its true colours. Just like the planet and Mother Nature are healing itself, this is also greatly affecting human health.

68,12-4-20,Faces of corona depicted through Madhubani painting,"Amid the coronavirus scare across the globe, city based Madhubani painting artist Shalini Karn (27) is using her art form to depict its impact on humans as well as nature.

“I made the painting in two days and completed it on April 2. I was actually involved in making something else but on constantly hearing about the pandemic, I could not concentrate on it. That was when I thought of making this to show what really is happening in India. It also shows how during this crisis humans are divided by class,” said the artist.

While on the top left hand side, it depicts the commendable work of the corona warriors- doctors, nurses, policemen and media personnel. In the bottom corner it shows people watching Ramand Sagar’s Ramayan being aired on Doordarshan during the lockdown.

The right hand side of the painting shows migrant labourers walking for miles to reach the safety of their homes. It also shows the shocking incident where they were sprayed with disinfectants in Uttar Pradesh.

While the virus has severely affected mankind, the centre of the picture highlights its positive impact on Mother Nature. It shows how due to lack of tourists owing to the lockdown thousands of olive ridley turtles have flocked to the shores in Odisha to lay eggs. With no cars out on the roads to cause any pollution, numerous birds can also be seen in the clear blue skies.

“I have tried to portray the different faces of Corona through my painting. While the faces on the left and right show its scary and negative side, the one in the centre shows how its affect on nature without human interference. Made on handmade paper, the acrylic colours mostly used in this creation are grey, black, red and green which not only have a significance but also represent the present day situation,” added Shaalini.

Grey colour which represents sadness and sorrow has been used to portray the tireless efforts of the Corona warriors and also the plight of the migrant labourers. With humans locked in their houses, nature has been shown using shades of green and blue with a hint of other colours. The red faces of Corona on either side depict danger.

Shalini Karn is a mithila artist from Madhubani, Bihar and is now settled in Ranchi. In 2013 she got a scholarship from the Ministry of Culture for folk and indigenous work. In 2019 she also displayed her work at an international folk art market in Mexico City.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/faces-of-corona-depicted-through-madhubani-painting.html
69,12-4-20,CM seeks Central aid from PM,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today urged the Centre to provide special financial aid to Jharkhand in the present crisis situation. During a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conferencing today, the CM requested the PM to take steps for payment of dues from Public Sector Units, payment of GR grants and increasing MGNREGA wage to Rs 300.

The CM said, “We understand that the Central Government is also under economic pressure, but being a tribal and Dalit community dominated State, we expect that the Central Government will understand the pain and suffering of these sections. Necessary financial assistance should be made available to the State of Jharkhand so that the lives and livelihoods of these poor can be protected.”

“The State Government's economic situation is under pressure due to the lockdown. Our own revenue sources have closed. Desired funds are also not being received from the Centre. Dues are not being paid to the State Government by the Public Sector Enterprises of the Government of India,” he said urging PM to take initiative to make payment of outstanding dues of CCL, BCCL, SAIL etc at the earliest.

Soren requested that the limit for obtaining loans by the State Government fixed to 3 per cent of GSDP should be increased to 5 per cent so that the possible deficit in revenue can be met to some extent.

The CM said that there is a provision of GR grant of Rs 60 per adult in the Relief Code. He requested the PM that according to the Relief Code, every adult citizen is paid GR at the rate of Rs 60 per day at the time of disaster but the acceptance of payment of this amount in respect of COVID-19 was not received from the Government of India. It is therefore requested that in this hour of disaster, payment should be approved in accordance with GR grant, he urged.

Soren said that Jharkhand has the lowest MGNREGA wage rate in the country. He urged the PM that the MNREGA wage rate should be increased to Rs 300 in Jharkhand. “After the lockdown is over, about five and a half lakh workers are expected to return to Jharkhand.

After their return to Jharkhand, the State Government will need help from the Central government to quarantine them and provide employment. In this regard, I request that we should provide technical support from institutions like Paramilitary forces for construction of adequate number of tents and toilets.

The limit of the working day prescribed under MGNREGA should be increased so that the workers can be provided employment,” he said.

The CM apprised the PM that the State government has requested to provide 300 ventilators, 10,000 testing kits and 1 lakh rapid testing kits from ICMR / Government of India Public Sector Undertaking, but it has not yet been received. He requested the PM, taking this into consideration, to make the above materials available. Soren said that milk producers and vegetable growing farmers in the State have come under severe economic crisis due to the lockdown.

The CM told the PM that the State government is working on two dimensions of the Corona epidemic. The first dimension is social security and the second dimension is the protection of life. He said that the government has started work on social security and are providing hot food and dry ration in almost all the houses by arranging kitchens at every panchayat level in the State. The CM further said that 3 testing centers are functioning in the State, in which 1681 tests have been done so far, out of which 17 people have been found to be Corona positive.

81,12-4-20,"47 MP staffers, sr officials contracted Covid: Report","A district administration report has affirmed that as many as 47 staffers including the senior officials have contracted Covid-19.

These infected persons include senior officials including Principal Secretary Pallavi Jain Govil who was later removed, Health Director J Vijay Kumar, Addl Director Kailash Bundela, Joint Director Upendra Dubey, Addl Director Dr Veena Sinha, Dy Directors Pramod Goyal, Dr Ruby Khan, Dr Saurabh Purohit, Dr Himanshu Jayaswar and Director Dr Ranjana Gupta.

Others who contracted infection included technical staff, computer operator, peons, a gunman and others. Some of the kin of these staffers too have contracted infection.

Taking cognisance of media reports and a tweet from Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha about top Health officials making a mockery of Covid-19 protocol after contracting infection, the MP Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) had served a notice to Chief Secretary Iqbal Singh Bains seeking details of positive Health staffer and details of their hospital admission, days ago.

The letter forwarded by district collector to MPHRC on April 10 claimed that all the 47 staffers after testing positive for covid19 were hospitalised and kept in isolation.

The staffers were in constant touch of the officials who tested positive, affirmed the report.

The district administration has clarified that all the prescribed guidelines were followed in treatment in these staffers and there is no proof of these officials being guilty of any negligence.

To add, there are close to 50 officials and 250 employees in Health directorate based at Satpura Bhawan in Bhopal.

It was widely alleged that Health officers after testing positive weren’t hospitalised immediately and it was only after an intervention from senior Government officials that they were shifted to hospitals from their isolations.

MPHRC PRO affirmed that the district administration reply was received at 8.47 pm on Friday and the commission was studying the information and would react to it in due time.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/47-mp-staffers--sr-officials-contracted-covid--report.html

Pandit said 10 more positive patients have recovered taking the total number of cured patients to 12 in the State. And more number of patients would also be discharged soon as only two out of the remaining 37 active cases need doctors’ attention.

“Rest 37 patients have no flu-like symptoms. We have kept them only as a preventive measure for their safety and as well as of the community. They don’t need hospital care,” she said.

She further said that out of the 50 positive cases, 80 per cent were asymptomatic. Hence, the virus can remain in a person’s body without any symptoms of cold, fever and cough. Keeping this in view, the State Government has taken steps to intensify the surveillance.

Temporary sample collection centres are being set up in schools across the State. The number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the State would be increased to over 1,100 per day, she informed.

Pandit further said, “People aged above 60 years are most vulnerable to the virus. Fortunately, Odisha has just four per cent of that age group infected with COVID-19. That’s good news.”

Meanwhile, the State Government on the day released the details of the two cases which were found positive late on Friday night. They were linked to a 45-year-old man from Madhusudan Nagar in Unit-IV of Bhubaneswar, who had tested positive for the virus earlier.

Official sources said the 49th COVID-19 case was a 35-year-old woman whereas the 50th case was a 23-year-old youth. Both are the close contacts of the 41st case.

Eight lakh student will join special classes Happiness Curriculum and Mission Buniyaad at their homes from Sunday.

“Starting tomorrow, parents of students studying in classes up till Std 8. will receive audio calls (IVR) from the Education Department to guide them through as to how to take on the role of teachers at home. Step by step activities will be shared through pre recorded audio message on how to conduct Happiness classes and Mission Buniyaad at their homes”, said Sisodia.

“We are all gripped with anxiety today. These are unusual times and we do not know what to do as a fun activity,” said Sisodia,”We cannot go out, can't go for movies, or sit in the parks, we are confined to our homes, with our family. In such situations, it is possible to get irritated with one another, and we don't know how to refresh our minds as we are still restricted to our homes.Under this circumstances, Happiness class is all the more important.”

89,12-4-20,Recapping the Lockdown Survival Manual,"As the lockdown situation is likely to extend, in some form or the other, till we are able to contain Coronavirus COVID-19, there is an increasing need to maintain a disciplined lifestyle, says Kavita Devgan, as she shares a manual of dos and don'ts for everyone to keep in good health

Have you lost track of what day of the lockdown is it today? Or are you keeping a count? In times when there appears to be no immediate solution to tackling Coronavirus, except for physical distancing, have you wondered what is our biggest challenge today? The answer really is a no brainer. We just need to ensure that we follow whatever it takes to avoid a pandemic that has wreaked havoc all over the world from spreading. So how does one stay safe ? Is there even a way? Well clearly information is the key. Thankfully, a few things have been substantiated by now. So it is only safe to follow what is known and understood.

First of which, without doubt, is the fact that social distancing or staying away from other humans is the best known way to avoid infection. Simple solution for that is to stay put in your homes to stay safe. That’s the mantra that needs to be taken very seriously — chant it and practice it, strictly. After all your life may depend on it.

Secondly, soap and water are our first line of defence. And a very effective one at that. So wash your hands obsessively and don’t be embarrassed about getting obsessive about hygiene. Washing with the soap is found to be even more effective than using a sanitiser. The virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle and the weakest link is the lipid bi-layer. When you wash your hands with soap it dissolves the fatty membrane and the virus falls apart thus becoming “inactive”. So please wash your hands and keep washing them!

Third, and equally important, is to eat clean and right, Our body is under assault from a deadly virus. And if there is one thing one must do right, it is to begin eating clean. There are enough red flags about processed foods to convince anyone who values their health, to go off them. And this holds true specially now, when we need to give the body all the help possible to avoid and fight the virus. Eating clean is truly the most effective way to go, to give our body a fighting chance.

Clean eating means cutting down on processed foods and eating only real foods. So focus on local produce — fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds and whole grains, keep an eye on sodium, and cut down on sugar, and meat consumption. And just stop eating out of packets, cans and tins. This will also help to keep the weight in check.

Another benefit you can score during this time is that you be able to break your addiction to processed foods. All processed foods are designed to be addictive, to attack the reward centre of the brain, and not really to provide you nutrition. So be careful, take a good look at what you are eating, and start pruning the toxic foods from your diet. Understandably, a blanket ban is not possible, and not even needed, just a bit of pruning will go a long way in taking to healthy habits. Watch closely both the portions and the frequency of the processed foods that you consume. Make a rule, for instance, to consume no more than one processed food item a day. That should be a good start.

Fourth, boost your immunity. Strong immunity helps. It could well be the difference between you catching the infection or not, and if you do catch it, then in deciding the severity of the symptoms and your pace of recovery. A thriving immunity is, in fact, your best ally in these trying times. It is the body’s ability to protect itself from foreign invaders like viruses, disease and infection. It is a system that constantly patrols our body to detect and destroy infectious microbes.

Since we can’t just depend on the natural immunity that we are born with, specially because we keep devaluing it due to our toxic lifestyle, it is important to keep optimising its function — all the time, and specially now with the threat of coronavirus on our heads.

We must take this crisis as a wake up call to begin working on our immunity proactively. To share a food list that would help you boost your immunity, people who eat the most fruit and vegetables have the healthiest lung function. Our lungs need all the support as this organ is the biggest casualty in this pandemic. The connect is due to vitamins C and E that this food group delivers in plenty — both are known immunity boosters and thus help ward off flu. Here’s a list of easy, inexpensive foods that you need to include regularly in your diet to boost your immunity:

Amla: This humble, inexpensive food is actually the richest natural source of vitamin C. It is a powerful antioxidant and due to its antibacterial and astringent properties, it helps to fight against various infections, thus, making the immune system strong.

Flaxseeds: These have always been revered and for good reason. They contain alpha-linolenic acid, omega-3 fatty acid and phytoestrogens called lignans — all these ingredients are important for an efficient immune system.

Lemons: Lemons are the ideal food for restoring acid alkali balance. It helps maintain the body’s internal “climate” at a pH which supports healthy bacteria instead of the viruses and harmful bacteria which thrive in more acidic environment. Get lemons and make some lemonade everyday.

Carrots: Bugs Bunny rarely came down with the flu, and for good reason. Carrots, his food of choice, contain loads of beta carotene, which gets converted into vitamin A in the body, a powerful nutrient that boosts the production of infection-fighting natural killer cells and T cells. Carrots also deliver vitamin B6 which boosts the production of antibodies. Gajar ka halwa anyone!

Barley: This grain, that has all but disappeared from our kitchens, needs to make a comeback. First because it contains beta-glucan, a fibre with potent immunity boosting properties and second because it delivers the difficult to score trace mineral selenium that has a powerful positive effect on our immune system.

Chickpeas: Time to bring back khatte chole on the menu. That’s because chickpeas deliver a lot of antioxidants and mineral zinc that helps to control inflammation in your body.

Garlic: Swallowing a clove, or two of crushed garlic every morning was a norm earlier, and for good reason. Garlic stimulates the activity of “natural killer cells” and thus helps destroy viral-infected cells. Garlic also contains sulfur which assists the body with zinc absorption.

Sweet potato: There’s a reason why shakarkandi ki chaat was so popular. Sweet potato is high in vitamin C, which is a brilliant antioxidant and also delivers a lot of vitamin A, an ace immunity-boosting vitamin. In fact, one medium sweet potato provides your body with the complete recommended daily allowance of vitamin A and then some.

Mushroom: This food was probably not part of your traditional food platter, but it makes sense to include it now. This is one of the rare food sources of vitamin D, a vitamin essential for good immunity. Plus it helps increase the production of cytokines in the body, the cells that help fight off infection, and contains polysaccharides, compounds that support our immune system.

Back to the pointers, fifth don’t forget your mood. It is important to understand that eating healthy is important not only for our physical health, but our psychological well being as well. The best foods for our mental health are generally the healthiest foods. Just follow these steps, and you would be good:

Focus on complex carbohydrates, found in fruit, vegetables, whole grains and lentils. These nourish our body and mind, as they release energy slowly and help to stabilise our mood. Eat foods high in vitamins A, B, C, D and E, as well as the minerals — iron, zinc and selenium. Get in enough B vitamins, found in green vegetables like broccoli and spinach, beans, bananas, eggs, poultry, fish and beetroot, as they are needed for the functioning of the happiness chemicals, serotonin and dopamine. Their deficiency is in fact linked to depression. Care for your gut. The state of our gut has an impact on our mood and how we behave. Score prebiotics and probiotics, through fermented foods to cut inflammation, and stay happier. Do one calming activity every day — gardening, cooking, pickling, solving puzzles, craft, sewing, meditating, reading that pile of books on your bedside.

Sixth, sleep. Yes, it’s important. Just like our schedules for eating, working and exercising, it is important to follow a regular sleep routine. It can help keep you calm, in a better mood and with more stamina, plus help maintain a sense of normality. By the way, sufficient sleep doesn’t just allow your body to recuperate, it also boosts the immune system. During the slow-wave sleep phase, neurotransmitters are released and the immune system springs into action. Sleep deprivation during this time can affect your health negatively, seething you can afford these days.

Seventh exercise every day. Exercise makes us feel good and is also linked to better sleep and reduced stress and anxiety. Agreed you can’t move out and all the gyms are closed, but there lots that one can do at home. For instance, you can:

Walk in the house. Break that up into three 10 minute sections — 10 minutes in the morning, 10 in the afternoon, and 10 in the evening. There are online classes being offered for everything — yoga, pilates, dance teachers — some for free. Look them up and follow.

Walk up and down the stairs in your home, or in your building. Do some shadow boxing, or jumping jacks, or sit-ups, or push-ups. Play hide and seek with your children. Do gardening Housework — moping, cleaning, washing clothes etc are good workouts too.

Eighth, maintain social connection. Now more than ever, we need our friends — even if we can’t really go meet them. Social interactions don’t have to be face to face to be meaningful. The need of the hour is to invent and pursue new ways social connectivity. Meet up through video calls — you could organise a virtual dinner via apps like Zoom, Google Hangouts, or take a friend on a virtual walk or do a housebound activity together, like craft or drawing.

90,12-4-20,‘I connect better with fans in indie space’,"DARSHAN RAVAL recently released his first single of 2020 — Asal mein. He speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about how music finds a connect with listeners at a personal level and the reason why he loves digital platforms

What is the latest single about?

It is a sad song about a boy who is put in a friend zone, a story of many people out there. It has beautiful lyrics. Usually, I put out a song every Valentine’s Day and even during monsoon season. But this time instead of releasing it on that day, I decided to release post the day.

You have composed the song as well. How did that happen?

I have always been singer-song-writer-composer. In between I collaborate with songs. But when it comes to independent songs, I compose all my songs. Tere Zikr, one of my biggest hits has also been composed by me. There are others who pen down the words but for Kaash Aisa Hota besides composing it, I have written it as well.

I understand that you have been releasing a Valentine’s Day and monsoon single for the last 5 years. Any particular reason?

Like every festival people prepare for the festivities, I do a song for February and July. My fans wait for the song. People know that I will release a song on monsoon and Valentine’s Day. It has become a tradition. They even know the date and the time I will release it. No song for winters and summers since I am busy singing for Bollywood (laughs).

Is it tough to keep a balance between Bollywood and indie space?

It is not tough. This is because I am particular about the kind of project I take up for the industry. I don’t take up a song just for the sake of it. I do because I identify with it.

Why is it that most love songs centre around break-ups?

Love is a pure form of emotion. Any pure form of emotion brings sadness and happiness. Love songs that are on a happy note as just as popular. Sad songs on the other hand touch the hearts of the people. I make sad songs because I want people out there who are upset feel that there is someone out there who understands them and it with them. I want my songs to be like a friend to the people.

Do you think that music connects people at a personal level?

I was sceptical before. But when my songs started becoming popular, I was not able to gauge if there was a connect with the people even if the song was a hit. But for the last one year, after I started doing concerts, I came to realise that people find a connect. My song Tu Mileya has no video, just an audio and when I sing that song people cry. This is an emotional moment for me. I now know that they live the song.

What is the good, bad and ugly of the situation where two-three singers sing the same song?

Earlier, people used to have one composer. Now, you have four-five composers and each has a favourite voice that they want to use. Some time, you have one composer and four-five singers. This depends on the makers and what they are looking for. More people means more people get a chance. Also, this keeps the artist on his toes.

What is the attraction of doing independent songs?

One main reason is to connect with the fans. I have been doing independent songs for the last nine years. There is more freedom in this space. I can express myself better here. I wanted to create one-to-one connection with my listeners.

What about live performances?

Today, we differentiate among platforms and genres. But the main aim is to reach as many people as possible. If it means that I have to sing on the radio, I would do that as well.

What has been the best fan moment?

I have many, it is difficult to mention one. I just performed in Delhi and my fans had come with a cake to celebrate the success of my latest song. They wait for hours to take a photograph with me, they motivate me and share beautiful things. Each city has what I call Darshaners and Blue family. They give me extreme love.

What next?

There are a few movie songs that will release later this year.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-connect-better-with-fans-in-indie-space----2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---i-connect-better-with-fans-in-indie-space---.html

Hinting that agricultural and industrial sectors would be given relaxation rules, the Chief Minister said the Centre would issue in 2-3 days guidelines to be followed during the lockdown extension to ensure supply of essentials and revival of production.

""We must not compromise on lockdown because if the situation worsens, we have to face the consequences as a nation,"" Yediyurappa cited Modi as telling the chief ministers during the interaction.

The Prime Minister also hinted that lockdown would be lifted after April 30 in a graded manner to ensure the country passes through the virus crisis with minimal loss of life and damage to the economy.

94,12-4-20,AP CM for lockdown in ‘red zones' only but will stand by PM's decision,"Even as he favoured continuation of the lockdown in the state's red and orange zones, and relaxation in areas unaffected by COVID-19, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Saturday, assured his support to implement Prime Minister's decision on the matter.

During the course of the PM's interaction with chief ministers across the country, Jagan Reddy appraised him of the measures taken in the state and the impact of coronavirus on farming activities in the state.

Pointing out that the state is largely agrarian contributing to 35 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and employing nearly 65 per cent of the workforce, Jagan Reddy apprehended that lakhs of farm-families stare at destitution, if the present circumstances continued.

Speaking about the state's COVID-19 strategy, the Chief Minister said 141 clusters have been identified for focused containment measures. He pointed out that of the 676 mandals in the state, 37 are red zones or severely affected areas, and 44 are orange zones which are partially affected.

In all, 81 mandals are categorised as red and orange zones. The remaining mandals are unaffected and denoted as green zones, he explained to the Prime Minister.

""Lockdown should be limited to red zones. Restrictions can be continued in places with mass gathering. Social distancing can be continued in other places.

While I have given my opinion, the country should move ahead with one single strategy. Whatever strategy you suggest, we will go ahead with it,"" he assured the Prime Minister.

Drawing parallel to the influenza epidemic of 1918, which affected India's economy for nearly two years, the Chief Minister said that India should prepare for a long-haul strategy now.

95,12-4-20,KCR urges PM to extend it by 2 weeks,"Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the nationwide lockdown by another two weeks to check the spread of coronavirus.

He also suggested that the food processing industry be allowed to continue its operations so that farmers don't suffer and at the same time supply of essential commodities is maintained.

During the Prime Minister's video conference with all state chief ministers, Chandrashekhar Rao made various suggestions.

KCR, as Rao is popularly known, gave his suggestions with regard to saving people's lives, agriculture and economy, said a statement from the Chief Minister's Office.

Stating that India is unitedly combating COVID-19, the chief minister called for moving ahead with the same spirit. He noted that international journals are lauding India for its efforts in tackling the situation.

KCR said the Prime Minister standing by the states was boosting their morale. He exuded confidence that India will win this battle against coronavirus.

Claiming that lockdown proved helpful in controlling the virus, he felt that it should be continued for another two weeks.

KCR laid special emphasis on the need to help the farmers saying they are key to the country's food security.

He called for steps to ensure that food processing units operate smoothly. He said efforts should be made to operate rice mills, oil mills and various agro based industries.

He demanded linking agriculture to MNREGA to help the farmers in the distress. He said if farmers pay half of the wages from the labour from their pockets other half should come from MNREGA.

Stating that crores of tonnes of agricultural produce is ready to be harvested in the country, he said warehouses were not available to store the produce. He suggested that people be supplied ration for three months so that some space can be created for storage.

KCR suggested that the Prime Minister set up a task force to recommend a strategy to help farmers during lockdown and to run the economy.

He also wanted the Centre to take initiative to defer the loan installments to be paid by the states by six months.

He also called for extending FRBM limit from 3 to 5 per cent.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kcr-urges-pm-to-extend-it-by-2-weeks.html

Speaking to the press after an-hour long meeting of the Tamil Nadu Cabinet presided over by Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, he said the death toll due to COVID-19 reached ten on Saturday with one more patient succumbing to the pandemic at Erode.

Shanmugham said that the Chief Minister had participated in the video conference convened by the Prime Minister in the morning and had an exchange of information with the latter. “Any decision regarding the extension of the lock down would be announced by the Prime Minister when he addresses the nation and Tamil Nadu Government would abide by what he says,” said Shanmugham.

He said the Chief Minister had told the Prime Minister that air, train and road services should remain suspended for the next fortnight in the backdrop of the unabated spread of the disease.

The chief secretary pointed out that Tamil Nadu was the State with second largest number of corona virus patients and it cannot take a decision on its own about the extension of the lock down period. “The council of ministers which met this evening was of the opinion that the lock down should continue for a period of two weeks but the decision about the period of extension has been left to the Prime Minister,” said the Chief Secretary.

According to Shanmugham , 58 persons tested positive for corona virus on Saturday. “Containment and quarantine activities are in full swing all over the State. Our priority is to check the progress of the corona virus from the present stage -2 to stage- 3,” he said. It was also disclosed by the chief secretary that the PCR test kits ordered by the Government had reached the State and this would bring down the time taken for testing the samples to 30 minutes.

97,12-4-20,Finding Peace in these times,"Meditation is the process by which we take our attention away from the world outside and focus within ourselves, writes Sant Rajinder Singh

There is a lot of turmoil in the world right now. Television, newspapers, magazines, blogs, the internet, smartphones, tablets, and all other devices, are buzzing with breaking news about the catastrophe that we are dealing with today. It’s hard to go through any social media without hearing of the suffering that people are undergoing around the world.

News that worries us

The news seems to be filled with the tragedies being faced by the world. We are continually hearing of existing and impending financial and economic calamity. The stock markets have crashed. The very thought of health danger to us and our close ones is causing immense worry and anxiety.

A lot of us have started believing that life brings nothing but sorrows. People facing these challenges accuse life of bringing only suffering. Is that all life is but a series of disasters strung together? Is there any cure for the sorrows of life?

Breaking News that’s good

There is a place of safety where you can find refuge from the sorrows of life. There is a life raft to make it safely through the stormy seas of life. You can sail away from the sorrows of life to attain the happiness that is your birthright. There is a place you can go to relax far away from the sadness and suffering. You can renew your spirits and come in contact with a place free from sorrows.

Where can you find that place free of sorrows? That place free of sorrows is within you. It is a place where you can connect with the peace of your soul. You can find relief from the sufferings of life. You can find the peace within you by sitting in meditation.

In meditation, you have a period of time during which you are not bombarded with news of the sorrows of the world. It is a concentrated time when you can focus on your soul, on the spiritual treasures within. Immersed within, you are filled with peace and joys.

Meditation can help pass though the difficult times

In meditation, you can experience calm and bliss. You realise that within you is a place where there is no pain and suffering. Meditation can help you awaken to the realisation that your existence is more than the outer world in which your body and mind undergo suffering. You have a spiritual side which is connected to the peace and happiness within you.

When you emerge from meditation, you see the world in a different light. You know that the outer sorrows of life are temporary. They will pass. When you see for yourself that there is a place of peace and joy within, you are strengthened with fortitude to pass through the difficult times knowing that happiness is accessible to you within.

Through meditation you can find relief from the sorrows of life. While the wheel of life keeps spinning, you can take some moments to jump off the wheel to enjoy relief during the time you meditate. You can enjoy a few minutes, a half hour, or an hour or two, free from breaking news of the world’s sufferings. You will get a boost to help you soar above the realm of suffering, in order to experience realms free of pain and sorrow.

Meditation can also help us deal with anxiety and fear

These are stressful and confusing times for many of us. Fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in people. Daily life is disrupted completely for everyone across the globe. People are feeling uncertain about what could happen in the coming weeks. Feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and fear are very common today. People are worried about their own health and the health of their loved ones. How can we deal with all our fears under the current circumstances?

We need to learn that our empowered soul is the one who is really facing our challenges. If we connect with our empowered soul, we will overcome all fears and gain a lasting sense of peace and security. Our empowered soul, being one with God, is there for us. It is there to help us through the challenges of life. We just need to sit in silence and experience our empowered soul.

Let’s spread positivity

Meditation is the process by which we take our attention away from the world outside and focus it within ourselves. In doing so, we defocus from the turmoil of our surroundings and connect with our soul which is a part of God, source of all love and all joy. We cannot put an end to life’s challenges. We have no control over the outer universe. There is a lot happening in the world currently that might not be within our control. But there is something that is within our control. Amidst the uncertainty and ambiguity, we can control our attitude. What we can do is face these challenges with a sense of fearlessness so that we are not incapacitated by fear and despair. What we can do is take a break from constantly reading, watching or listening to news stories, including social media and spend time in meditation and experiencing our empowered soul. This is the time for us to be positive, and to spread positivity around us.

The upliftment we receive in meditation stays with us throughout the day. This may not change the outer suffering of the world, but we are able to spend some time daily in a place of joy and positivity that we can spread to others. Our own spirits are lifted and we can then make others feel good. When we realise there is a place free of sorrows within, we can help others to access that place too. We see life from a different angle.

This too shall pass

Through meditation we will also realise that all things are transient in life. This knowledge can help us maintain a sense of balance when we face the highs and lows of life. We can stay at an even keel through the storms and sunny days of life by finding a calm center. We can reach this still point through meditation.

So let us not forget that the current situation that we are facing is temporary. We will get through this. If we sit in silence and remember God daily, we will not be troubled by this temporary phase of life. We will find a still center, filled with peace and balance, which will provide us with permanent happiness despite the outer variations of life.

98,12-4-20,Steps to tackle stress,"Your dreams and your right to live a meaningful life is always worth a fight, says Karan Verma, as he suggests a 3 step approach to bounce back from adversity

Character and resilience of a human spirit is truly tested in tough times. Those who capitulate in the face of adversity become dispirited and there are also those who tap into something deep down and rise above the difficulties. In one voice, they decide to be tougher than the toughest times and rise above to realise their destiny. How do they do it? It is not because they are biologically or genetically different. What is different is their mental conditioning and the will to win.

The reason some people give up too easily is that they either indulge in self-pity and paint themselves as victims or they just don’t feel that their cause is worth fighting for and so they choose the easy route of giving up. Truth is that your dreams, your hopes and your right to live a meaningful life is always worth a fight. The moot point however remains — how does one get the strength to keep on going when nothing is working out. As the author of the recently released bestselling novel titled Dhruv — Love Story of an Alchemist, which is an ode to everyone who has survived through tough times, I believe that three things help us immensely in bouncing back from abysmal depths. Let’s be honest when we are hit by adversity in our gut, it pains and it pains hard. I suggest we should initially accept the pain for what it is but we should be quick to re-group ourselves and start preparing for a bounce back.

The first approach that always helps is having gratitude. Stepping back and counting your blessings gives us immense strength in bouncing back. As long as one’s health is intact, gratitude is the key to immense mental strength and it fires up our spirit to soaring heights. It is the secret drug that makes one fearless in the face of testing times. As for the proverbial question of glass half-full or half empty, I would always be grateful for it being half-full and be totally pumped up to make it completely full.

The second step that helps one bounce back is abandoning the fear of failure. The truth is that most of us are too afraid of failure, too afraid of being labeled foolish or dumb. This fear never really allows us to express ourselves in a free-flowing manner. It is like driving a car with the hand-brake on. Have you ever wondered why certain sports teams always choke under pressure ? Well the reason behind it is that they are too over-awed by the occasion. Even when they are in a winning position, the fear of losing continues to lurk in their minds. We have to abandon this fear of failure. There is a reason why Lord Krishna told Arjun on the battle-field that ‘Karma’ (action) belongs to him whereas the fruits of the action belong to the lord. This basic understanding of the fact that all we have control over is our effort, instills in us a fearlessness. It strengthens our mind to a point where we are so consumed by the process that we stop thinking about the result.

The third approach is the one that catapults you to a league of the extraordinary. I call it — loving the grind! Those who accomplish great tasks in life are the ones who can take both the bouquets as well as the brickbats with equal grace. They love the crests as well as the troughs cause most importantly they love the game of life. Every adversity for them is an opportunity to rise above to the next level. They push the envelope, they are pumped up all the time and when the hovering dark clouds of adversity pass by, they shine like the stars above.

These hustlers keep hanging in there during the toughest times cause they know that the darkest nights produce the brightest stars!

99,12-4-20,Change your attitude,"The pandemic is a wake-up call by God to mend our ways, and that can be done only if we change the way we operate, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

Have you wondered about why the world is in such a mess right now? Why has the climate change become such a burning issue? Why has plastic become such a menace? Why are powerful nations competing with one another rather than co-operating? The answer is that perhaps they are trying to become bigger than others. Let us examine this issue using an example that will shed light on this question. Heady after the success of a few films, an upcoming actress began accepting whatever films were offered to her. She became ambitious and wanted to be the biggest star. Some of these films were doomed to fail. Surely, her health suffered but she ignored the warning signs and continued till there was a serious breakdown. Her film career was ruined by her ambition to race to the top.

Unfortunately for all those who are trying to become big, there are ready traps opening up. A small soul will eternally remain small, a brief period of feeling big does not last long. We see the mighty getting humbled on a regular basis. Why don’t we try to become better or simply good, which will help all of us? What is wrong in doing that? Bigger does not help anyone, better does; good does.

Similar is the problem of becoming controllers. It is a natural tendency for human beings. We try to control events and we are unable to do so in the ultimate sense. Couple of examples will help here too. Silver has been a target for many investors; they have tried to purchase large stocks of the precious metal, and have hoped to manipulate its price to their advantage. Time and again they have failed in their attempts. On the other hand, Bill Gates has chosen to serve the humanity in a sincere way and has succeeded beyond belief. In today’s virus affected world, who is able to control the situation? Big leaders are either themselves stricken or are crying in public regarding their helplessness. Sooner we realise the reality of our severe limitations, being small souls, better for everyone that will be. God is the only controller and will remain the only one. Have you ever wondered why so few people genuinely take God’s shelter? Because they want to control and, therefore, endlessly keep on thinking about different matters hoping to control.

This brings me to the third major fault of us, we humans wish to be absolutely independent. Being independent as far as maintaining self goes is fine, because one should, but when we don’t wish to accept God’s position, we are in serious trouble like right now. Why is social distancing necessary in today’s troubled time? Why not continue to do what pleases us as we were doing. Why submit to lock downs? Why even Presidents and Prime Ministers are submitting to restrictions on what they can do and they shouldn’t? The same reality applies here also. God is the one and only independent entity and wise persons take His shelter. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has stated very forcefully this fact. In case anyone wants peace, etc. he or she must take God’s shelter, otherwise they be ready to suffer, just as humanity is suffering presently.

God has given us a wake up call. We have become godless and damaging the very nature, which sustains us. We have become too addicted to sense pleasures. We are in a self-destruct mode. We must change our attitude. A small soul can never either become big or become controller or absolutely independent. God occupies that position. We, small souls, should accept this reality. It is never too late. God gives ample opportunities to reform ourselves. As a small soul, our hope to exist well in this impermanent miserable world (9.33) is to take God’s shelter. (18.62) I have personally realized this truth and am beginning to reap some of its benefits. Please take advantage of God’s instructions.

100,12-4-20,GADGETS go viral,"A tunnel that disinfects people before they enter a market, a locket that beeps if a person breaches the six-foot Lakshman rekha of the wearer, a UVC LED mop to sanitise homes, a robot to minimise doctor-patient contact and a surveillance system to track the infected — the non-medical community is just as busy trying to save lives from Coronavirus. A report by SHALINI SAKSENA

The doctors and nurses are busy treating COVID-19 patients. Away from hospitals, entrepreneurs, IITs and even school students are busy giving their ideas wings to come up with gadgets that will keep people safe and healthy during and after the epidemic. Their motto: Prevention is better than cure.

D Venkatesh, an entrepreneur from Tirupur, Tamil Nadu, who runs a water treatment business (WTT Technology Services India Pvt Ltd), is one such person. Even though Venkatesh was staying home because his factory is shut, it didn’t stop him and his friends from talking about the Coronavirus impact. Long phone chats led him to explore options through which he could contribute. It was not until March 29, 2020 that he finally decided to do something about it.

“It was a Sunday. I had not stepped out of the house since the lockdown was announced. We needed some household items and went to the market. The scene shocked me. It looked like a mela. There must have been over 1,000 people at the farmers’ market in total disregard to social distancing. I had seen a tunnel structure on YouTube spraying people in Turkey with a disinfectant using the humidifying method. That fascinated me and got me thinking. Next day, on Monday, I opened my factory and worked on a tunnel that suited us. On March 31, 2020, the 16-foot tunnel was ready,” Venkatesh says.

Making the structure was easy but what came next, to figure out how to spray the disinfectant on the people was tricky. The tunnel uses one of the two disinfectants — hypochlorite and Chlorine. “I had started my career working with an Italian company and hence the attitude that human safety comes first. I had to ensure that the spray didn’t affect the eyes, nose and skin. This meant that no water droplets touched the skin. I made a system with a pump of 70 bar pressure with tiny holes of three microns. With such high pressure and tiny holes, the solution of water and hypochlorite becomes a mist. Another challenge was to ensure that the mist covered the entire human body — from hands to feet,” Venkatesh tells you.

The test was done in the local market after Venkatesh managed to speak with the Collector who gave him the go-ahead. He used hypochlorite with a PPM of 0.5, what is used in swimming pools. Venkatesh also had to ensure that this misty disinfectant actually killed the virus and people didn’t carry it with them. So, people needed to raise their hands with palms out when they walked through the tunnel. Just like one has to take a shower after a swim, a shower after the tunnel walk is also must after one gets home. But Venkatesh was not sure how many people would actually do so, hence the low PPM.

“It is judicious to shower once you are home. The contact time inside the tunnel is three seconds —enough to kill the virus but not harmful to humans if they don’t shower. There is also a reason why I kept the tunnel that long. I know that people don’t have the time or patience to stand in a queue. The 16-foot tunnel means that there is a steady flow of people doing away with long queues,” Venkatesh explains.

Since his test run on April 1, 2020, Venkatesh has been busy and has sold 50 such tunnels that cost Rs 85,000 each to various cities, including Bengaluru, Kochi, Calicut and Hyderabad. His idea was to make five such tunnels and donate them. But the overwhelming response that his invention got ensured that he is working long hours to make many more. He is getting queries from mall owners, the Railways and cinema hall owners. He is also getting calls from Ministers, Collectors and MLAs.

Up North, 2,845 km away, a team at Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Phagwara, Punjab, has been busy trying to find answers on how to ensure social distancing. Prabin Kumar Das, a BTech student (Electronics Communication and Engineering) at the university, along with his professors, has developed an IoT device — Kawachh — to promote safe social distancing. The device, a pendant, vibrates and glows in case someone breaches the user’s safe space of a metre. Not only that, the device is equipped with a handwash reminder that beeps every 30 minutes as well as a temperature sensor that alerts via an SMS in case their body temperature crosses the prescribed limit.

Dr Lovi Raj Gupta, Executive Dean of Science and Technology, LPU, tells you that, at present, there are three pressing issues to COVID-19. First, to maintain distance. Second, to wash and sanitise hands. Third, and most important, to monitor one’s health.

“People forget to maintain social distancing with family and friends. The battery-operated device helps on all three counts. It gives an alert after a specific time to wash hands and beeps if the one-metre distance is breached. The device also keeps a record of one’s health because we know it is not possible for people to monitor their temperature every few hours. To get an alert on one’s health, one needs to pair it with a device like one would do with a Fitbit,” Gupta explains.

He also tells you that they realised the Coronavirus doesn’t discriminate and it was necessary to keep the cost low. Building the prototype cost the team approximately Rs 500. Gupta and his team hope once the lockdown opens, they will be able to introduce this locket at a cost of Rs 400.

It is not just the safety of masses that is in question here. Several doctors too, who had been working with COVID-19 cases, fell prey to the virus. In order to keep the medical staff safe, three students — two from KIIT World School in Pitampura and one from Modern School, Barakhamba Road in the Capital, have come up with an innovative idea.

Saurav Maheshkar of Class XII, Nishant Chandna of Class X and Aditya Dubey have conceptualised, designed and built the robot — Prithvi — a battery operated prototype, a programmable board and basic motors at a cost less than Rs 5,000. Due to the lockdown, the trio had to make the bot with cardboard. However, when it goes for mass production, the bot would require a sturdier built. The aim here is to reduce contact between healthcare workers and COVID-19 patients.

Maheshkar tells you that the idea came after their principal asked students to come up Corona fighters. “The robot is meant to deliver food and medicine to those in quarantine. It can be programmed to go to the patient deliver food, medicine and if the person under quarantine wants, he can speak with his family via video conferencing. We have used — arduino controller — openly available chips that people use to make codes with motors to run the bot with a 25-volt battery that can run for an hour of continuous work. One can increase the battery volt to increase the working hours,” Maheshkar says. The three are now looking for help from universities to better their bot. Interestingly, Maheshkar and Chandna met Dubey at an activist meet to protest against the rising air pollution levels in New Delhi, last year.

Chandna tells you that there were some challenges even though this was not the first bot they had built for the healthcare sector. “The challenge came when I had to make the body. I had to use cardboard. We have been working on robotics for the last two-three years. Our team had won the nationals — we had earlier made a bot for the physically challenged. But this bot has been modified keeping in mind the virus patients. It took me around two weeks to complete the bot,” Chandna says.

Then there is the problem of keeping track of those people who have recovered from COVID-19 but their movement needs to be restricted. To meet this challenge, start-ups and entrepreneurs from IIT Roorkee have come up with a surveillance system. Raven Eye, an incubated start-up founded by Professor Kamal Jain, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Roorkee, has developed a system to fight COVID-19 through a tracking mobile application. Using geo-fencing technology, the system generates alerts if any individual violates quarantine.

There are some in-built guards against hacking. In case the network is not available, the app will send an alert through SMS. In case the phone is switched off, it will send a message to the main server. If the person steps beyond the Lakshman rekha, it will send a message. If the person tries to delete the app, it will send a message. “In no case can the person try to side-step the system which we have been using in tracking vehicles even before GPS came to India. So, tracking COVID-19 patients will not be a big task. The surveillance system is a plug-and-play device which allows tracking with an accuracy of +/- 5 metres through notifications at two, 10 or 20 seconds. Besides live tracking, the administrator can view the entire movement history of an individual,” Jain says.

The IIT Roorkee has also developed a low-cost portable ventilator. Named Prana-vayu, the closed-loop ventilator has been developed in collaboration with AIIMS, Rishikesh, and is equipped with state-of-the-art features. The manufacturing cost per ventilator is estimated at Rs 25,000.

Helyxon, a health tech start-up that works in close collaboration with IIT Madras Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre, has come with AI-enabled devices for better management of the pandemic. Vital health parametres like temperature, oxygen saturation as well as heart rate offer critical clues to the health condition of the patient and this can be done via two digital solutions – OXY-2 and 98.6 Fever Watch priced at Rs 5,799 and Rs 2,499, respectively. “The AI-backed biosensor devices reliably capture trend of parametres like temperature and alerts the remote medical staff or an attendant in case of anomaly. This allows immediate intervention when needed. It also cuts down the work of regular manual monitoring which is, in any case, impossible for thousands of patients,” Vijai Shankar Raja, founder, Helyxon, says.

In the North-East, the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati has developed a low-cost UVC LED-based disinfectant system for surfaces. Dr Senthilmurugan Subbiah, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, says that the aim is to disinfect surfaces — be it homes, hospitals or malls and even water. “This system works the same way a vacuum cleaner works. It has wheels at the bottom and one needs to move it to clean the floor. There is a velocity at which it needs to move. Anything faster and it won’t work. A certain area needs to be exposed for 30 seconds for the UVC LED light to kill the virus at the dosage that has been pre-set,” explains Subbiah whose team had started working on the mop back in mid-February.

The normal UV rays can damage the eyes, but this device will stop working the minute one lifts it from the floor. The idea is to protect people from the harmful rays. The rechargeable in-built battery-operated system will have variants depending on where it has to be used. Unlike for home where the mop will be manual, the ones for commercial areas will be automated and programmed to go wherever necessary. The team is also in the process of making a device that can be used to clean doorknobs. The team ains at ensuring that the device is not expensive by keeping the cost under Rs 1,000.

“The COVID-19 is protein-based with RNA and DNA. The UVC LED system interchanges the structure of the protein. Once its changed, it is more or less dead. If 36 Joules of a dose is given to a certain surface, it kills 90 per cent of the virus sitting on it. This mop gives 4-log dose killing 99.99 per cent of the virus. Whatever is left will not harm,” Subbiah says.

HACK THE CRISIS

It was one of its kind online hackathon in India to discover non-medical solutions to stop the spread of tOVID-19. It saw huge participation with over 2,300 registrations and close to 15,000 participants from across India and overseas. Over 300 top teams presented their innovative ideas with a pre-recorded video pitch via webinar. Out of the 300 submissions, 30 of them topped the Mentor Board and top 10 Leader Jury Board.

Gayatri Chhabria, Pune FLO member tells you that they aim to strengthen and bolster fight against COVID-19 for India. ""It inspired by an event in the second week of March 2020 where a hackathon was organised and invited non-medical staff to come up with ideas to tackle COVID-19. Payal Rajpal, South Asia head Robotex International and I approached Ritu Prakash Chhabria, chairperson, FLO Pune Chapter who gave us go ahead. We partnered with Garage 48 a private company based out of Europe which handled the backend of the hackathon for us. We also support of many ministries like Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Make in India, MyGov, MEITY Start-up Hub, Maharashtra State Innovation Society and Ministry of Skill and Entrepreneurship, Science and Technology Park to name a few. We have now been invited for a global hackathon to represent India,"" Chhabria says.

The kill zone

It has become imperative to identify technological opportunities and find unique solutions to contain or at least mitigate the chances of spread of COVID-19. Log 9 Materials Pvt Ltd., a Bengaluru-headquartered nanotechnology start-up, has come up with an innovative, first-of-its-kind product -- CoronaOven -- that makes use of UVC light (having wavelength of 253.7 nm) in order to disinfect surfaces from germs including bacteria and viruses.

The system is lightweight and portable disinfection chamber (20 litres volume) designed to kill Coronovirus. What makes the product stand out is its ability to kill virus/pathogens within 10 minutes from the time the object is placed inside the chamber for undergoing disinfection.

Akshay Singhal, founder-CEO, Log9 Materials tells you that that the product has been specifically designed keeping in mind the cell structure and characteristics of the Coronavirus. ""We were able to create this product and conduct simulations for the same within a couple weeks. Not only does the CoronaOven provide accurate and necessary energy via multi-focal UVC radiation on each point on the surface on an object to be disinfected/sterilised, but also guarantees 100 per cent destruction of the Coronovirus and other harmful microorganisms. It is a scalable and cost-effective solution built with easily available materials, and is as simple to use like a normal microwave,"" Singhal says.

The principle on which it works is simple. Once a specific intensity of UVC light is exposed to Covid-19 virus, it penetrates the virus shell, reaches its RNA strand making a permanent alteration in its RNA structure, which renders the virus incapable of infecting or replicating inside a live cell.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gadgets-go-viral-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/gadgets-go-viral.html
101,12-4-20,Talktime : ‘Won’t mind doing roles like Kabir Singh’,"Aayush sharma|He made his debut with Loveyatri in 2018. He now features in the recently released music video Manjha. Sharma speaks with Musba Hashmi about the success of the song, how he is spending time with family during the lockdown and roles that attract him

Your latest song Manjha received good response and is trending. How does that feel?

I am happy about it. The success of the song has gone beyond my expectations. I was sure that it will get a good response but trending was something that I didn’t expect. I am happy and excited that people like the audio and the lyrics and the song by and large. Because it is different from the kind of music that is coming out these days.

The song talks about the love for kites in the times of TikTok. Do you think relationships these days are losing essence?

The relationships are evolving with every decade. With the evolving technology, we are definitely losing the essence of a basic relationship. When was I a teenager, that time we didn’t have social media, there was no direct way of getting in touch with the one you love. If somehow one is to manage their contact number, then the confusion was how to call them up, what if their parent’s will answer the call. Somehow we used to get through and then feeling excited for the first conversation. People used to discover each others’ likes and dislikes gradually and in real time unlike today when everything is just a click away. Those days were just right for having and maintaining good relationships.

Now, once can find a partner or social media. The chase and the desire to be with your partner is lost in a way. Couples, even if they are together, are busy in conversing with the world through their mobile phones instead of each other. Therefore, relationships have definitely lost that essence and spark.

You featured in the song along with Saiee Manjrekar. How was it like to work with her?

She is an extremely pleasant person to work with. She brings a lot of positive energy on the sets. This is my first experience working with her and all I can say is she is extremely sweet. She has a lot of humour. And more than everything else, she is an qualified actor. She is a different person when the camera is not rolling and the moment the director says ‘action’ she becomes serious and just gets into the skin of the character. At times, I used to make funny faces in between the shots to make her laugh. But she just sticks around her character and didn’t even pass a smile.

What is keeping you busy these days?

We are all quarantined right now and the only thing that is keeping me busy is changing my daughter’s diapers, giving her food, carrying her around, spending time with Ahil (son) and watching animated movies with him. That’s what I am doing until the lockdown is over and post this, once everything is settled in the country we will be revealing the pre-production of my next film, which I am very excited about. The announcement shall come in sometime.

How do you think you have evolved as an artist?

I still haven’t reached the stage where I can say I have achieve everything or I am a versatile actor now. When I did Loveyatri, it was like teenage kind of romance now when I did Manjha, I changed my approach and my physique. I had to look like a mature man. So, I need to keep working hard and improving myself. No actor at any point can say that I have learnt it all. Every role you play and every project that you do, teaches you something new. I have just started off and I have a long way to go. After a career of 20 years, most likely I can say I have achieve it all. As of now, I am just a student of acting.

What are some of the milestones that you aim to achieve?

I want to bring in new things with every project that I do. I want to explore the field and just surprise the audience with everything that I do. I want to play an antagonist, a grey character and explore comedy. In the long run, I just want to come forward and say I have done it all. The milestone I want to achieve is that a person should turn around and say that we cannot imagine Aayush in just one thing. He can do everything out there.

What kind of roles attract you?

Like I said, I want to play a grey character. Films are very much made keeping in mind what appeals to the maximum number of people. When you are playing a protagonist, most of the times it is purely a white character irrespective of whatever is happening in the film. I want to play a honest character, who can have flaws. and something that reflects the society. He doesn’t need to be perfect. I want to experiment with that, now whether I will land such a role is a different conversation altogether.

Does that mean you would like to play a character like Kabir Singh?

We, at cinema say that we shouldn’t propagate something that is not right. It is a two conversation part. Both are right. The other says that we have the larger responsibility to make sure that people doesn’t imitate what we do on screen. Having said that, there is also a side of the society who are not influenced of what we are doing and they do certain things. What is right and wrong is a parameter that depends on the relationship of the person. The society can’t tell what is right or wrong, it depends on the relationship at the end of the day and what people are okay with and what not. I don’t see any problem with Kabir Singh because such characters are already there, you can’t deny the existence of such characters. I don’t mind playing a character like Kabir Singh. The kind of success the film has seen shows that people do associate with him. If not, they wouldn’t have decided to see the film. It shows that they understand that such characters do exist.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------won---t-mind-doing-roles-like-kabir-singh----2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------won---t-mind-doing-roles-like-kabir-singh---.html
102,12-4-20,Implications of distant planets,"Nobody, not even doctors were aware of coronavirus before it trapped the whole world into its fold. Only after pandemic broke out that the medical scientists have begun their research to find the right medicine and vaccine to checkmate this menace in future. So remains true about astrologers also. None could foresee this pandemic. I could just see possibility of mass death from eclipse chart of December 26, 2019. Now we are trying to analyse data relating to pandemics in earlier times to figure out planetary alignment pointing to possibility of such pandemics. Major pandemic broke out every 100 years — 1720, 1820, 1920, and now in 2020. In between also, pandemic broke out on various occasions, already discussed in one of my earlier issues.

In course of the study, it came out that the distant planets — Uranus, Pluto, and Neptune — play a very important role in so far as catastrophic events of large dimension are concerned. Unfortunately, most of Indian astrologers don’t pay any attention to these planets. Fact, however, remains that but for taking them into consideration, it would not be possible to explain unusual happenings of large scale. In fact, ever since Uranus, in course of its periodic motion, entered Aries sign in April 2017, I have been wondering its probable implications in world matters during its seven years of stay there. For, earlier during Uranus’s transit through Aries sign, have been marked with major issues confronting the world. Bear in mind, when astrological chart of the world is drawn, Aries sign is taken as lagna, as it is the first house of natural zodiac.

From 1933 to 1940, Uranus was there in Aries. Second world war happened during this period which took about 16 million valuable lives. In the process world economy was devastated. It took years to bring back the economy on rails. Period from 1849 to 1856 is marked with Taiping rebellion in China, which cost more than 10 million lives. Second British Burma war took place during this period. Crimean war happened. Period from 1765 to 1773 is marked with American revolution. Now we are faced with the present pandemic. It is nothing short of a world war like situation. During world wars, apart from the major players in the war theatre, about 20 to 30 countries would have directly or indirectly been affected. The present pandemic has overtaken the entire world.

Having said that, let me make it clear, Uranus alone can’t play that big a devil. Other planets carrying negative implications have to join hand. In this respect, Pluto is believed to be most lethal. Saturn, Mars, Rahu, and Ketu forming adverse alignment further add on killing propensity. During all unprecedented events, the chart drawn at the time of major eclipse during the year, Pluto has been found to be either with Jupiter, Saturn, or Ketu.

During 1720 pandemic, Pluto was there with Jupiter and Uranus. In 1820, Pluto was with Saturn, another death signifying planet. In 1920, Pluto was opposite Mars in the death indicating 8th house, which was ill-disposed off to Uranus. The Sun and Moon were placed adverse to mischievous Neptune. During eclipse that happened on December 26, 2019, Pluto, Jupiter, Saturn, and Ketu were together on the eclipse axis. The result is there to see. More than a million people have already been found infected. The death toll too has been mounting every day. The economic recession thereof needs no elaboration. So, we need to keep a watch on the movement of the distant planets to figure out their future implications in the world and over our country.

I am afraid, the impact of Uranus won’t be over even after this pandemic is brought under control. It has still to stay in Aries for another four years. Meanwhile, Saturn and Pluto are there in Capricorn sign. Jupiter too is there for a while but will be soon back to Sagittarius sign. Once again, Jupiter will enter Capricorn in November this year. So, during next year, Saturn will be degree-wise placed square to Uranus (an adverse placement sometime in 2021. At some point of time, Mars may also join hands with them. Such planetary alignment again points to possibility of a difficult situation, in what way, time ahead will speak. So, we can’t afford to be complacent. The purpose of this deliberation is not to scare you. It is, however, the need of hour to consolidate ourselves as much as would be possible, so that we are well prepared to take on the challenges ahead in strength.

103,12-4-20,Ramp it up,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with full of confidence specially-abled youngsters, who are walking the ramp and taking their disability with a smile

There is a difference between disability and inability. While some fail to identify it and surrender themselves to the circumstances, others decide to walk an extra mile and overcome the challenges that time has posed on them. A case in point is Aditi Sharma, a 20-year-old hearing impaired from Madhya Pradesh. She is a kathak dancer and is pursuing Bachelor of Fine Arts. She recently won the title of Miss Deaf India International 2020, organised by Wheeling Happiness Foundation, a brainchild of Devika Malik and co-founder Deepa Malik, and All India Deaf Arts and Cultural Society (AIDACS).

“I feel comfortable in expressing my inner beauty through modelling,” she says.

Sharma never had any apprehensions in taking up the field, all thanks to her sky high confidence. “I stepped in to the field because this is what makes me happy. I am performing kathak since my childhood and have been on stage many times, therefore I built up that confidence in me over time,” Sharma tells you.

Another reason behind Sharma’s confidence is her family who supports her through thick and thin. “My family has been extremely supportive. My father learned tabla and kathak todas for my kathak practice, my mom learned speech therapy to help me and my elder brother, Ankit Sharma, who is working in the US is my partner in crime,” she says.

Coming from a small town, Sharma faced many difficulties in finding a training institute for kathak. That’s when she decided to take the digital route. “I tried finding training institutes in my city, but couldn’t find any. That’s when my family advised me learn it online and it worked,” she tells you.

Sharma had to go through a lot of indifferent behaviour in school. “I faced a lot of difficulties in class. It was hard for me to understand what the teacher was saying or teaching. I used to feel alone and left out. My classmates thought that I was abnormal. It was disheartening,” she recalls.

But now things have changed. People have started recognising and respecting her. “After I won the title, there was a change in people’s behaviour towards me. They understood that I was not abnormal but specially-abled and there’s nothing to feel ashamed of. I got felicitated by Thavar Chand Gehlot, cabinet minister of Social Justice for winning. Saksham, an organisation that works for divyangjan (differently abled people) honoured me as the State Brand Ambassador on March 14, 2020. All this recognition have brought about a positive change in the behaviour of people towards me,” she tells you with a smile.

Another man who stole the limelight at the event and won the title of Mr Deaf India International 2020, is Ramesh R. A 24-year-old from a village — Sivasubramaniyapuram in Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu is able to live his dreams through modelling but is still searching for a permanent job. “I had that self-confidence since my childhood that even I can present myself well in front of others. Clicking selfies was my favourite pastime and I received a lot of compliments on my picture from friends and family. I knew that I can try my hand at modelling but that compliments came as a validation for me. That’s when I made up my mind to do modelling,” Ramesh tells you.

Like any other person, he too was a bit apprehensive to explore the unchartered waters. “Being a special person, I had the feeling that may be I couldn’t pick up beats and match my steps with the music while on the ramp. But like people say — Practice makes a man perfect. I too overcame all the challenges,” he tells you.

Ramesh doesn’t like to recall the hardtimes whatsoever. For him what defines one’s personality or destiny is passion. “With passion nothing is hard or impossible. I love the field I am in so it gradually became easy for me to make my way. Having said that, as being differently abled, I have to face certain problems in communication. Sometimes, I can’t understand what others are trying to convey and at times I receive phone calls which I can’t answer and have to depend on my family for that. But I cannot run from these things. All I can do is to accept the fact and never let anything pull me down,” he asserts.

Beauty is something you acquire naturally, everyone is beautiful in one or the other way, he says. “For me inner beauty is more important than physical one. But still there are a lot of people who value both equally and there’s is nothing wrong in it. The key is to know what suits you. Nothing expensive can make you look good unless it go well with your personality and physique. So anything that makes you look good is fashion and in trend,” he opines.

He has a piece of advice for those who fear to rise above the challenges. “Don’t follow the herd. Know who you are, do what you like to and follow your passion. Challenges are there in everyone’s life but remember that every ordeal has a solution. Try to find it. If not, then just believe in that it will vanish one day or the other. Follow an optimistic approach in life and see everyday as a new beginning. Lastly, never lose faith in yourself,” he tells you.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ramp-it-up-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/ramp-it-up.html

105,12-4-20,CMs seek financial support from Centre,"Congress Chief Ministers on Saturday demanded financial support from the Centre during a video conference meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened to discuss the future strategy of the Covid-19 lockdown. But Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy alleged that the PM refused to respond on the issue.

He said the CMs talked about lack of funds in the state. Not only the Congress-ruled States but even other Chief Ministers conveyed to Prime Minister that they don’t have the sufficient funds to meet the expenditures in their States, he maintained.

“The Prime Minister should give the package to all the States, increase their FRBM and also give moratorium on the debts and also give additional funds, for which the Prime Minister did not respond,” Naranswamy said.

On another question that the Centre says corporate wouldn’t be allowed to contribute their CSR funds to Chief Minister’s relief fund, Narayanasamy said on behalf of his counterparts: “In fact, I wrote to the Prime Minster, this issue was raised in the meeting. The PM Cares for which the money is being paid by the corporate, why not to the Chief Minister’s relief fund, for which there was no reply from the PM. But we are going to write to the Prime Minister and the corporate would like to contribute money for the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. It should not be prevented by the Central Government, when they are allowing the foreign countries to contribute for the spending the money for Coronavirus treatment, why not the corporate.”

Ahead of Modi’s meeting with the chief ministers, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram had urged those of the Congress-ruled to unanimously demand for transfer of cash to every poor family.

He said the poor have lost their jobs,exhausted their savings and now standing in lines to get free food. Chidambaram said remonetising the poor would cost only Rs 65,000 crore, which is economically viable.

Congress Chief Ministers who participated in the PM meeting were Amarinder Singh, Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel, V Narayanasami.

Chidambaram had also urged Congress alliance chief Ministers Uddhav Thackeray, Hemant Soren and E Palaniswani to tell the prime minister that just as lives are important, livelihood of the poor is important.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cms-seek-financial-support-from-centre.html
106,12-4-20,"To boost sales, Centre asks States to suspend farm law","After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s suggestion for agriculture and allied sector, including modification of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act to facilitate sale of farm produce, the Ministry of Agriculture has asked the States to suspend certain provisions of their respective APMC Laws to allow farmers to sell their harvest from multiple locations and to any buyer. Any relaxation in the provisions of the Act will have to be done through state governments. The APMC Act empowers state governments to specify market areas - operated and regulated by market committees - where farmers bring their produce for sale.

Top sources said that the move is aimed at encouraging social distancing and also ending farmer distress during the ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus disease, with disrupted supply chains forcing many producers to destroy their harvests.

During an interaction with chief ministers of all States and Union Territories, PM Modi has suggested that direct marketing for farm produce can be incentivised to prevent crowding in mandis, for which model APMC laws should be reformed swiftly. Such steps will help farmers sell products at their doorstep. He also suggested that direct marketing for farm produce can be incentivised to prevent crowding in mandis, for which model APMC laws should be reformed swiftly. Such steps will help farmers sell products at their doorstep.

The APMC Act regulates buying and selling of farm produce in about 5000 mandis or markets across the country. Any relaxation in the provisions of the Act will have to be done through state governments. The APMC Act empowers state governments to specify market areas - operated and regulated by market committees - where farmers bring their produce for sale.

Farmers in many states have been forced to dump perishable harvest due to lack of buyers, which has also depressed farm gate prices. Most farmers in northern and central India are in the middle of harvesting the biggest winter staple, wheat. The government has kept over 300,000 trucks ready to ferry harvests under the aegis of the national agriculture markets, an online trading platform that has been updated to meet the needs of farmers during the lockdown.

Officials of agriculture ministry also informed that Railways introduced 67 routes for running 236 Parcel Specials(out of which 171 are time table parcel trains) to supply essential commodities including perishable horticultural produce, agricultural inputs, milk and dairy products at fast speed which will facilitate farmers/FPOs/traders and companies for continuity of supply chain across the country.

According to the ministry, the Central Insecticide Board & Registration Committee (CIB&RC) through Virtual Private Network (VPN) have issued 33 Nos. of Import permits for import of more than 1.25 lakh metric tons of various chemicals. 189 certificates for exports have also been issued to facilitate exports of pesticides. 1263 certificates of registration have been issued in various categories to facilitate indigenous manufacturing of pesticides.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/to-boost-sales--centre-asks-states-to-suspend-farm-law.html

The MHA shot off a letter to the Mamata Banaerjee dispensation over the “gradual dilution” of lockdown rules in the State by allowing religious gatherings in mosques and ruling party TMC to distribute food to large gatherings besides permitting flower, sweet and pan shops to open in many areas.

In the letter to the State Chief Secretary and DGP, the Union Home Ministry expressed displeasure over the violation of lockdown rules and asked them to stop it immediately. The MHA also sought an action taken report from them.

The Home Ministry’s letter was shot to the State soon after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took up the alleged abuse of power by Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in her video conference meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“Corona is a deadly disease a dangerous virus and not a communal virus and so they should refrain from communalising the issue,” Banerjee said in an apparent reference to the letter.

Later in the evening, the Governor came out with a video message in social media appealing people of the state to keep lockdown and social distancing norms to prevent the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.

“As per further reports received from security agencies, gradual dilution of lockdown has been reported from West Bengal with an increase in the number of exceptions being provided by the State Government. For instance, shops relating to non-essential items have been allowed to function. There is no regulation in vegetable, fish and mutton markets where people have been thronging in complete violation of social distancing norms,” said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

It pinpointed the huge crowds in Kolkata’s Rajabazaar, Nakel Danga, Topsia, Metiaburz, Gardenreach, Ikbalpur and Maniktala. Incidentally, the stated areas are minority-dominated pockets — including large slums— of Kolkata.

In the strongly-worded letter, the MHA pointed out that Narkel Danga is already witnessing more Covid-19 cases. The MHA said, “It has been reported that police have been allowing religious congregations. Free ration has been distributed not through the institutional delivery system but by political leaders. This may have resulted in spread of Covid-19 infections.”

The Home Ministry said such activities are in violation of the Central government’s orders issued from time to time under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and are liable for penal action under the Act.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mha-objects-to----violation----of-lockdown-in-wb.html

This apart, more than 5,000 ex-servicemen are also pitching in the endeavour.

Giving details of the deployment of the NCC cadets, defence ministry officials said here on Saturday the cadets above the age of 18 are working shoulder to shoulder with civil, defence and police personnel in 12 States. The maximum deployment of the cadets is in Tamil Nadu.

As the lockdown continues, more and more states are in the process of requisitioning NCC cadets for various tasks. Headquarters Directorate General NCC is monitoring the number of cadets volunteering for the cause. Around 50,000 cadets have so far volunteered to contribute in ‘Exercise NCC Yogdaan’.

Volunteer NCC cadets above 18 years and from Senior Division (For boy cadets) and Senior Wing (For girl cadets) are being employed for these duties. The cadets are voluntarily contributing to the cause. It is ensured that the cadets are trained and properly briefed about the tasks before being deployed.

The State machinery is ensuring that all the cadets are provided with proper safety equipment like masks and gloves during their deployment. The cadets are being employed under the supervision of Officers and Junior Commissioned Officers to ensure safety and security of the cadets. They are not being employed in areas which are sealed or are earmarked as hotspots by the respective State Governments.

The cadets are deployed for various duties like, traffic management, supply chain management, preparation and packaging of food items, distribution of food and essential items, queue management, social distancing, manning control centres and CCTV control rooms. Apart from this, NCC cadets are sensitising the public against COVID-19 by sending messages on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp, etc.

The NCC is 14-lakh strong and has a reach throughout the country, with its 17 directorates cover all the 29 states and nine union territories. These directorates are further divided into 99 groups and 826 units, thus ensuring availability of cadets to the district administration in all the states. As the instructions have reached various district headquarters, to utilise the cadets for logistics and supply chain management duties, the district administration is seeking their support, by requisitioning them from the NCC directorates.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/2-000-ncc-cadets-deployed--50-000-on-standby.html
112,12-4-20,"Gowda: Farmers, labourers reeling under lockdown woes","Terming the sudden 21-day lockdown hasty and unplanned, Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) supremo and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda on Saturday said lakhs of farmers and workers were reeling under its domino impact.

""The lockdown was a hasty decision taken without foresight and proper planning due to which lakhs of farmers, labourers and workers across the state are suffering untold hardship as their life has been disrupted as never before,"" Gowda said in a letter to state Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in Kannada.

Though Gowda assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi of his support to the central government's war against the virus when the latter spoke to him on Wednesday, he did not mince words in saying the state government should have consulted experts, farmers, traders and other stakeholders before clamping the lockdown overnight, with buses, trains and flights suspended.

Though the central government tweaked the guidelines to allow farmers and growers to carry on their activities, including harvesting the crops and sowing for intermediary crops, the absence of transport and curbs like social distancing have hit them hard.

""With 60 per cent of the state's 6.5-crore population dependent on the agriculture sector despite its 3-4 per cent contribution to the GDP,"" Gowda said farmers and growers were facing acute financial distress due to the lockdown and the inability to sell their produce.

To mitigate the hardships of farmers producing food crops and growers of vegetables and fruits, their labour and intermediaries, Gowda said the state government should lift all curbs on their activities, including harvesting, procuring, processing and ferrying their produce to markets.

""As the lockdown, suspension of public transport service and strict enforcement of social distancing stalled even the movement of farmers and their intermediaries, growers are suffering huge losses due to vegetables and fruits perishing in tonnes in the summer heat,"" Gowda told Yediyurappa in the letter.

Touted as a 'son of the soil' and a farmer himself, the 87-year-old veteran leader urged the prime minister and the chief minister to ensure agricultural activity did not suffer further if the lockdown is extended beyond April 14.

Accusing the Centre of ignoring the warning signals since the first Covid case was reported in Kerala on January 30, Gowda said the lockdown was decided without planning and factoring in the plight of farmers, migrant labour, daily wagers and lakhs of workers in the informal sector.

""Though the Centre had two months to prepare for the inevitable, it kept quiet till mid-March and woke up to lock down 1.3 billion people across the country without giving them time or opportunity to prepare for enduring the crisis,"" recalled Gowda.

Appreciating measures to contain the spread of the virus in the southern state, especially in cities and towns and ensure social distancing was maintained to prevent community transmission so far, Gowda said the state government should lift curbs to ensure horticulture produce like fruits, vegetables and flowers were plucked in time and transported to markets for sale so that growers could benefit.

""The state government should also ensure the supply chain from farm to market is maintained by procuring the perishable goods from growers at a fair price and sold through horticulture kiosks across the state for the benefit of producers and consumers,"" Gowda added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/gowda--farmers--labourers-reeling-under-lockdown-woes.html

Huwel Lifesciences on Friday received approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the test kit.

Its production would begin at the company's Narsingi and Kokapet facilities on Monday, Huwel Lifesciences Director Shesheer Kumar told IANS on Saturday.

Quanitplus COVID-19 detection kit is based on published protocol of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the US.

""The kit has synthetic gene cloned in a plasmid as positive control. The primers set is cross-verified for specificity with several RNA and DNA viruses and bacteria,"" he said.

Designed to exclusively detect the Covid-19, it can also detect SARS-CoV and bat SARS related CoVs.

According to Huwel Lifesciences, all high-quality reagents required for the test, including enzymes, are made in-house. The company calls it a one-stop solution for detection kit, extraction kit, molecular transport medium and swabs for sample collection.

He said all testing technologies for Covid-19 were based on three different reagents of virus updated by World Health Organisation (WHO) and the CDC. ""Based on that you need to decide the technology. Too much experimentation can't be done at this point because of non-availability of too much data on sequences."" he said.

Only difference with other companies was Huwel Lifesciences makes its own enzymes. ""We make everything except one component which is imported. It's scaleable, quality can be controlled and consistency can be maintained,"" he said.

A test using Quantiplus COV kit costs Rs 1,000 and the result will be available in two hours. ""We have a single formulation where you don't need to add separate components while setting up reactions. It's easy to set up and also avoids contamination and reduces time of reaction,"" he said.

“We seek an urgent phase-wise opening of the alcoholic beverage industry in conformity with COVID-19 prevention guidelines,” the letter said, adding that trucks are stranded, distribution warehouses are locked with stock and retail shops are sitting on unsold stock.

“The industry which contributes almost Rs 2-lakh crores by way of various taxes, sustains livelihood of nearly 40 lakh farmers, and employs nearly 20 lakh people directly and indirectly is in dire straits,” CIABC Director General Vinod Giri said.

He also demanded extension of excise year for three months till June 30 and online sale of liquor.

“What has compounded the problems for alcoholic beverage industry is the fact that excise policy for many states come to an end on March 31. Prior to that date, there are several statutory requirements that ought to be met by companies for them to keep continuity of operations,” he said.

He added that a prolonged shut down of industry will not only have a huge economic cost on companies, it may also force lakhs of workers into joblessness.

“Shops should be asked to enrol for home delivery through online applications. Government may charge a fee, this being an addition to license.

126,12-4-20,Centre mulls more steps to keep cash-strapped discoms afloat,"The government may soon announce more steps — like cheaper working capital and lower tariff — for power discoms to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply during the lockdown to contain COVID-19.

“The Power Ministry is working on a proposal to provide relief to discom to keep them afloat during the lockdown, especially when the demand is low and their bills collections is negligible,” according to a source.

The power demand has came down by almost one third during the lockdown.

The demand met was down by about 29 per cent at 121.38 GW on April 10 compared to 170.52 GW on the same day last year.

The demand was down mainly due to lower requirements from industry and state power distribution companies (discoms).

The peak power demand met is the actual highest energy supply during the day across the country.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/centre-mulls-more-steps-to-keep-cash-strapped-discoms-afloat.html
127,12-4-20,"OFB comes up with two-bed tents for screening, quarantine","The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) has come up with a cost-effective solution for isolation wards with the manufacture of two-bed tents with medical equipment for screening, isolation and quarantine. These special tents can be used for medical emergency, medical screening, hospital triage and quarantine purposes. These tents with floor area of 9.55 square metres are made up of waterproof fabric, mild steel and aluminium alloy.

These tents can be set up in any place & terrain and help in creating additional facilities other than those in conventional hospitals within a short period of time. Ordnance Equipment Factory, Kanpur has manufactured these tents. Fifty such tents have been sent to Government of Arunachal Pradesh.

Moreover, Opto Electronics Factory, Dehradun, a unit of Ordnance Factory Board, has donated 2,500 bottles (100 ml each) of hand sanitisers and 1,000 face masks to the Governor, Uttarakhand, on April 6, 2020. Cordite Factory Aruvankadu, another unit of OFB, handed over 100 litres of sanitisers to the Nilgiris District Police authorities in Tamil Nadu on April 08 while High Explosives Factory (HEF) in Pune despatched the first batch of 2,500 litres sanitisers to M/s HLL, Belgavi on April 9.

Also, Ordnance Factory Ambajhari (OFAJ) Nagpur has developed fumigation chamber for the purpose of sanitisation. It is fully portable and can be shifted with ease. It is installed at the main entrance of OFAJ Hospital. Ordnance Factory Dehradun handed over indigenously made pedal-operated handwashing system fitted with soap dispenser to the police authorities on April 7. Ordnance Factory Dehu Road, Pune distributed food kits amongst labourers at Dehugaon village on April 6.

Two units of OFB namely the Small Arms Factory (SAF) Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the Heavy Vehicle Factory (HVF) Avadi in Tamil Nadu (TN) have been granted accreditation by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for conducting the ‘Test for Blood Penetration Resistance’ as the test equipment manufactured by them met the ASTM F 1670:2003 and ISO 16603:2004 standards.

The equipment was developed by a number of Ordnance Factories in a competitive mission mode in a record time of a fortnight.

The basic principle of the test is to expose the fabric, used as a raw material to manufacture coveralls to ‘synthetic blood’ at different pressure levels for specified periods of time. The test is essentially required to facilitate bulk manufacture of coveralls by manufacturers all over the country in large numbers for health workers and first responders dealing with patients afflicted with the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Hitherto, this test was available only with South India Textile Research Association (SITRA), Coimbatore in the entire country and testing of the fabric for manufacture of coveralls had emerged as a critical bottleneck especially during the nationwide lockdown and in the absence of logistics.

With the latest development, another test facility has been created in South India and the first such facility has been established in north India. This will not only enable the OFB to ramp up production of coveralls in the clothing factories, four of which are in UP and one in TN, but will also enable other agencies engaged in the manufacture of coveralls to avail this crucial testing facility",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ofb-comes-up-with-two-bed-tents-for-screening--quarantine.html

129,12-4-20,Delayed ventilator support is key reason for deaths: Study,"A delay in receiving mechanical ventilation— the device that becomes the decider between life and death-— has been a major reason for death of the majority of the Covid-19 patients, a study has found.

Ventilators’ shortage is endemic in the developing countries, including India.

The study, which assessed the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus infection in China, noted that only about one-fifth of patients who died of COVID-19 received invasive mechanical ventilation and further aggressive respiratory support prior to death. Covid-19 can lead to severe lower respiratory tract infection, which means patients often need ventilator support.

The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, assessed data obtained from 21 hospitals in Wuhan, China, about the demographic, comorbidity and respiratory support provided to 168 patients who died of COVID-19 between January 21 and 30.

According to the scientists, including those from Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University in China, while all patients received oxygen therapy during their hospital stay, 46 patients only received nasal or face mask oxygen before they died.

About one-third of patients, they said received high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, and 72 patients received non-invasive ventilation.

The study noted that only 34 patients were intubated and received invasive mechanical ventilation.

Based on these findings, the scientists believe that many patients had delayed intubation. So far over one lakh people have died across the world.

They said several reasons may explain this low proportion. First, the study said some patients with critically low levels of oxygen in the blood did not have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or dyspnea.

The lack of enough invasive mechanical ventilators was also an important reason preventing patients from receiving intubation, the researchers said.

Third, they said, a medical team which is not dominated by intensivists may not receive critical care training and may be uncertain on the timing for when a patient requires intubation.

The study also validated earlier findings that hypertension is the most common chronic comorbidity among patients who died.

Based on earlier studies, the scientists said the novel coronavirus infects the lungs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor.

However, they said further research is needed to find the mechanism of COVID-19, adding that clinical studies are also needed to confirm whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19.

Noting the limitations of the study, the scientists said the data analysed were from patients who died during late January 2019, and they may not be representative of later cases of COVID-19.

According to Johns Hopkins University, the demand for ventilator can be as high as 1 million in the country. Current availability in India is estimated to have between 30,000 and 50,000 ventilators. It says, the US has about 1,60,000 ventilators and is running short in most places.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/delayed-ventilator-support-is-key-reason-for-deaths--study.html
130,12-4-20,"Stringent action if one enters Ladakh without permission, says UT Admin","With the Srinagar-Leh national highway reopened for limited vehicular traffic, the Ladakh administration on Saturday warned of stern legal action against anyone attempting to enter the Union Territory without permission.

“The highway was only opened for limited traffic to replenish essential supplies in the twin districts of Leh and Kargil…It is not open for normal traffic for the time being so we reiterate our appeal to the people, including local residents staying outside, not to try to enter Ladakh,” Commissioner Secretary (Health) Rigzin Samphel told reporters here.

The 434-km highway, which is the only road linking Ladakh with Jammu & Kashmir, was reopened for limited vehicular traffic after remaining closed for over four months owing to heavy snowfall along the Zojila pass.

A convoy of 18 oil tankers carrying petrol, diesel and kerosene oil reached Kargil after starting their journey from Sonamarg in Ganderbal district of central Kashmir.

“Even if you manage to reach Sonamarg, you will not be allowed to enter Ladakh. If somehow, you manage to reach Drass (after crossing Zojila into Ladakh), you will be sent to quarantine for 28 days there besides action as per law will be taken for violation of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), Natonal Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act,” Samphel said and urged the people not to enter the region unless the government gives them the clearance.

As per the schedule issued by the Divisional Commissioner of Ladakh for the first week during the transition of vehicles into the UT, a maximum of 10 trucks would be allowed to cross Zojila on April 13, maximum 14 HPCL trucks carrying LPG cylinders on April 15, maximum 15 trucks on April 17, maximum 15 trucks on April 19, maximum 15 trucks on April 21 and maximum 15 trucks on April 23.

131,12-4-20,Supreme Court bar urges CJI to cancel summer vacation,"The Supreme Court Bar Association appealed to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde and his companion judges on Saturday to cancel the summer vacation this year and treat it as a working period in the larger interest of litigants and justice.

The lawyers’ body said now that restrictions are likely to continue after the first phase of coronavirus lockdown ends on April 14, the CJI and the companion judges should take more proactive steps to mitigate the distress of litigants. It also urged the judges to take measures to gradually restore the full functioning of the top court.

Accordingly, the Executive Council resolves to appeal to the CJI and his companion judges to cancel the summer vacation and treat the period “as working of the Supreme Court of India”, the resolution passed unanimously by the bar association said.

It said it is “deeply concerned” about the distress caused to litigants because of the restricted functioning of the courts throughout the country– first due to Holi recess and then due to the nationwide lockdown, which necessitated very limited hearing of only urgent matters through video link.

The SCBA resolves that all lawyers practising in the Supreme Court will give up the summer vacation scheduled from May16 till July 5 and make themselves available for work, the association said.

It demanded that the temporary video-conference facilities be improved for live-streaming of court proceedings using an efficient multi-user platform such as those being used by the Council of Ministers and government officials.

“It is only if all contesting lawyers, instructing Advocates in Record, and litigants can have simultaneous access to the video-conference proceedings, that the same can become an effective system for conducting full-fledged court proceedings at par with those which our judicial system requires should normally be conducted in open courtrooms,” the lawyers’ body said, adding, that its President Dushyant Dave should bring this resolution to the notice of the Chief Justice of India.

The bar association said it fully supports the restrictions, which were unavoidable in the unprecedented situation faced by all in the first phase of the lockdown. On Saturday, advocate Ashok Arora, secretary of SCBA said the CJI will review the functioning of the apex court every three-four days in consultation with other judges and officials of the Health Ministry.

He said the demand from bar leaders and other bodies that summer vacation this year be preponed can wait for a while and till then status quo is to be maintained.

“I spoke to Chief Justice of India on April 10 at12 noon and was informed that he was going to review the situation after every 3/4 days after consulting the other Judges and health ministry. Till then status quo. So better, we wait for a while,”Arora said. Meanwhile, senior advocate Dinesh Goswami has written to the CJI, requesting suspension of summer vacation. The top court on March 23 virtually went into the lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus and suspended for indefinite period the entry of advocates and other staff in the high-security zone on the basis of their proximity cards. On April 9, the Delhi High court decided to suspend the summer vacation this year, previously scheduled from June 1 to 30. The high court also cancelled the summer break of subordinate courts in June this year.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/supreme-court-bar-urges-cji-to-cancel-summer-vacation.html

The phone call was made after the ninth Extraordinary OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting that was held via webinar on Thursday.

In the meeting, the OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, except Mexico agreed to cut their overall crude oil production, so the agreement is valid per the approval of Mexico.

136,12-4-20,UK breweries join forces to ‘buy NHS a pint’,"Breweries from across the UK were coming together to “buy the NHS (National Health Service) a pint” to recognise its contribution during the coronavirus pandemic, a media report said.

139,12-4-20,Crime drops around the world,"The coronavirus pandemic that has crippled big-box retailers and mom and pop shops worldwide may be making a dent in illicit business, too.

In Chicago, one of America’s most violent cities, drug arrests have plummeted 42% in the weeks since the city shut down, compared with the same period last year. Part of that decrease, some criminal lawyers say, is that drug dealers have no choice but to wait out the economic slump.

“The feedback I’m getting is that they aren’t able to move, to sell anything anywhere,” said Joseph Lopez, a criminal lawyer in Chicago who represents reputed drug dealers.

Overall, Chicago’s crime declined 10% after the pandemic struck, a trend playing out globally as cities report stunning crime drops in the weeks since measures were put into place to slow the spread of the virus. Even among regions that have the highest levels of violence outside a war zone, fewer people are being killed and fewer robberies are taking place.

Still, law enforcement officials worry about a surge of unreported domestic violence, and what happens when restrictions lift — or go on too long.

It’s rare for a city to see a double-digit drop in crime, even over a much longer period. During New York City’s 1990s crime decline, one of the biggest turnarounds in American history, crime dropped about 40% over three years. That makes the drop-offs occurring now — in a period of just a couple of weeks — even more seismic.

Across Latin America, crime is down to levels unseen in decades.

“Killings are down, and the gangsters aren’t harassing so much,’’ Eduardo Perdomo, a 47-year-old construction worker, said while getting off a bus in San Salvador. “I think they’re afraid of catching the virus, and they aren’t going out.’’

El Salvador reported an average of two killings a day last month, down from a peak of 600 a day a few years ago.

Much of the decrease has taken place because of tougher security policies and gang truces. But the imposition of near-total limits on movement is likely driving it down further, according to analysts and national statistics.

In Peru, where crime levels fell 84% last month, Lima mortician Raúl González usually has as many as 15 bodies a day — many are homicide victims. This week he napped on a bench after six hours without a client. “There are almost no killings or car accidents these days,’’ González said.

In South Africa, police reported a stunning decline during their first week of lockdown measures. Police Minister Bheki Cele said reported rapes were down from 700 to 101 over the same period last year. Serious assault cases plummeted from 2,673 to 456, and murders fell from 326 to 94.

The US virus epicentre in New York saw major crimes — murder, rape, robbery, burglary, assault, grand larceny and car theft — decrease by 12% from February to March. In Los Angeles, 2020 key crimes statistics were consistent with last year’s figures until the week of March 15, when they dropped by 30%.

“There’s a lot fewer opportunities for criminals to take advantage of,” said Joe Giacalone, a former New York Police Department sergeant who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “Most burglars, they wait for you to leave the house.”

Policing has also changed in the face of the pandemic. Officers are increasingly getting sick; the NYPD, the country’s largest department with more than 36,000 officers, has more than 7,000 officers out and more than 2,000 diagnosed with COVID-19.

And U.S. authorities say they’re issuing citations instead of making low-level arrests, policing social distancing and putting detectives into patrol cars — which could, in turn, bring down crime rates.

While departments are unlikely to announce they’ve backed off policing certain crimes, “that’s going to be the case,” said Bowling Green State University criminologist Philip Stinson. “In many respects, over the next weeks, they’re really in survival mode,” he said.

But while narcotics arrests are down, drug sales continue, with dealers likely forced to change their strategies, said Rodney Phillips, a former gang member in Chicago who now works as a conflict mediator in the city.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/crime-drops-around-the-world.html
140,12-4-20,G20 Ministers struggle to finalise oil output cuts despite US efforts,"Top oil producers struggled to finalise production cuts during a virtual summit held by G20 energy ministers on Friday, despite US President Donald Trump’s mediation efforts to end a standoff with Mexico. The final G20 communique appeared to gloss over simmering divisions over energy policy, making no mention of output cuts and pledging simply to ensure oil “market stability” amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Mexico was the lone holdout in a record OPEC-led agreement reached a day earlier that would see output slashed by 10 million barrels per day in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.

The standoff had cast doubt on efforts to bolster oil prices, pushed to near two-decade lows by the demand-sapping pandemic and a Saudi-Russia price war that rattled global markets. The subsequent G20 meeting — hosted by Riyadh — was expected to seal the deal more widely with non-OPEC countries in the group including Mexico, the United States and Canada.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/g20-ministers-struggle-to-finalise-oil-output-cuts-despite-us-efforts.html
141,12-4-20,US tops Italy as worst-hit country,"The United States became the first country to report more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day, marking a grim milestone as billions around the world celebrated the Easter holiday weekend under lockdown from home.

The global death toll from the virus surged past 1,06,000 on Friday, with the United States quickly becoming the epicentre of the pandemic that first emerged in China late last year. Europe has so far shouldered the majority of all deaths and infections -- though there were signs of hope the curve could be starting to flatten in some of the hardest-hit countries.

On Friday, the United States reported 2,108 new deaths, the highest daily toll out of any country since the outbreak was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December. With more than half a million reported infections, the United States already has more coronavirus cases than anywhere else in the world. The global infection rate now stands at more than 1.7 million, though with many countries only testing the most serious cases the numbers are likely far higher.

But President Donald Trump said with the US infection trajectory “near the peak” and social distancing working well, he was considering ways to re-open the world’s biggest economy as soon as possible.

He acknowledged the risk of higher death tolls if businesses restart too soon -- after the World Health Organization on Friday cautioned countries against lifting lockdown measures too quickly.

“But you know what? Staying at home leads to death also,” Trump added, pointing to the massive economic suffering for millions of Americans.

It is unclear when that will be possible, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying millions in the state — the hardest hit in the US — will have to be tested before it can reopen. Easter weekend kicked off in near-empty churches around the world as parishioners remained locked in their homes.

Pope Francis was due to livestream his Easter Vigil from an empty St Peter’s Basilica later Saturday, after he presided over an empty Good Friday Service to kick off the holiday weekend.

The pontiff was praised by Italy’s Prime Minister for his “gesture of responsibility” to observe Easter in private.

“We will remember this spring as the one in which, for the first time in history, the pope presided over the general audiences and conducted the Angelus (prayer) by livestream,” Giuseppe Conte wrote in Italy’s Catholic daily Avvenire.

“His words, although spoken far from Saint Peter’s Square, which was wrapped in an unreal silence, have reached everyone.” Worshippers in Rome stocked up on traditional Easter cakes ahead of the weekend, some piling them onto scooters outside of grocery stores, eager to maintain parts of the holiday tradition even from home.

Across Europe, government urged citizens to stay home for the weekend, fearing people would flock outdoors to enjoy warm weather or flee to holiday homes.

France deployed some 160,000 gendarmes to patrol busy roads, while Lithuania set up road blocks to prevent travellers from leaving cities.

And Turkey announced with little warning Friday that a 48-hour lockdown order would be in place in dozens of cities, including Ankara and Istanbul, as its virus death toll crept past 1,000.

Shoppers crowded supermarkets in Istanbul late Friday in a rush to stock up on supplies before the curfew started at midnight. The World Health Organization has warned that prematurely easing lockdown measures — as has started in central China where to virus first emerged — could spark a dangerous return of the disease.

“Lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Friday. Some countries, especially in Asia, are worried about a possible second wave of infections imported from travellers as life creeps back to normal.

But Governments are under pressure to strike a balance between keeping people safe and keeping already battered economies stable. And while President Trump has discussed a rapid return to economic stability, the US government’s top infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said that despite signs of progress, “this is not the time... To be pulling back at all” on social distancing efforts.

The pandemic has shaken the global economy, and the International Monetary Fund — which has $1 trillion in lending capacity — said it was responding to calls from 90 countries for emergency financing.

146,12-4-20,"30 cr poor gets Rs 28,256 crore under PMGKY","More than 30 crore poor people have received Rs 28,256 crore financial assistance under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month to protect them from the impact of 21-day nationwide lockdown. As part of Rs 1.70 lakh crore relief package, the Government announced free foodgrains and cash doles to women and poor senior citizens and farmers to mitigate hardship faced due to the lockdown.

“More than 30 cr beneficiaries have been directly given support through Direct Benefit Transfer amounting to Rs 28,256 crore under #PradhanMantriGribKalyanPackage,” a tweet from the Finance Ministry said.

Of the total disbursement, Rs 13,855 crore have gone towards payment of first installment of PM-KISAN. Under the scheme, nearly 6.93 crore out of 8 crore identified beneficiaries got Rs 2,000 directly in their account. As many as 19.86 crore women Jan Dhan account holders received Rs 500 each in their account. The total disbursement under the head was 9,930 crore, it said.

147,12-4-20,"COVID-19 causes severe disruption to Indian economy, says World Bank","The World Bank on Sunday said the coronavirus outbreak has severely disrupted the Indian economy, magnifying pre-existing risks to its outlook.

In its South Asia Economic Update: Impact of COVID-19 , the World Bank estimated the Indian economy to decelerate to 5 per cent in 2020 and projected a sharp growth deceleration in fiscal 2021 to 2.8 per cent in a baseline scenario.

The COVID-19 outbreak came at a time when India's economy was already slowing, due to persistent financial sector weaknesses, the report said.

To contain it, the government imposed a lockdown' with restrictions on mobility of goods and people.

The resulting domestic supply and demand disruptions (on the back of weak external demand) are expected to result in a sharp growth deceleration in FY21 to 2.8 percent in a baseline scenario (an estimate subject to wide confidence intervals), the report said, adding that the services sector will be particularly impacted.

A revival in domestic investment is likely to be delayed given enhanced risk aversion on a global scale, and renewed concerns about financial sector resilience.

Growth is expected to rebound to 5.0 per cent in fiscal 2022 as the impact of COVID-19 dissipates, and fiscal and monetary policy support pays off with a lag, the report said.

In a conference call with reporters, World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia Hans Timmer said India's outlook is not good.

And if the domestic lockdown is prolonged, then the economic result can be much worse than what the World Bank has in its baseline range of forecasts.

Among the steps that India can take to address this challenge, Timmer said the first step is to focus on mitigating the spread of the disease, and to make sure that everybody has food.

Then, it is very important to prepare for a rebound and that means there should be a focus on temporary jobs programmes, especially at the local levels. Those initiatives should be supported. And it is important to prevent bankruptcies especially of a small and medium sized enterprise, Timmer said in response to a question.

In the longer run, this is really an opportunity to bring the Indian economy on sustainable path not just fiscally, but also socially, he said.

The World Bank is working with India to mitigate the challenge posed by COVID-19. It has approved USD1 billion to India, of which the first tranche has already been released to deal with the emergency in the health care sector.

The first tranche aims at delivering civilian diagnostic equipment, put in place additional capacity to deal with testing and make testing available that benefits the entire population, said World Bank Vice President for South Asia Hartwig Schafer.

The World Bank is also working with India on two additional operations, which is anticipated to be ready in a matter of weeks.

These include, employment, banking and micro, small and medium enterprise sector.

In its report, the World Bank said that the COVID-19 outbreak has magnified pre-existing risks to India's economic outlook.

The government is undertaking measures to contain the health and economic fallout, and the RBI has begun providing calibrated support in the form of policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance.

Given significant uncertainties, there is a wide confidence interval around the baseline estimate. If a large-scale domestic contagion scenario is avoided, early policy measures payoff, and restrictions to the mobility of goods and people can be lifted swiftly, an upside scenario could materialize in FY21, with growth around four per cent, it said.

However, if domestic contagion is not contained, and the nationwide shutdown is extended, growth projections could be revised downwards to 1.5 per cent, and fiscal slippages would be larger, the World bank said.

148,12-4-20,"Coronavirus impact: FPIs pull out Rs 9,103 cr in April so far","Overseas investors pulled out a net Rs 9,103 crore from the Indian markets in April so far as the Covid-19 crisis triggered a return to safe haven assets like gold and dollar-denominated securities.

As per latest depositories data, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) withdrew a net sum of Rs 2,951 crore from equities and Rs 6,152 crore from the debt segment between April 1-9. The total net outflow stood at Rs 9,103 crore.

In the previous month, FPIs had withdrawn a record amount of over Rs 1.1 lakh crore on a net basis from the Indian markets (both equity and debt).

The capital outflow in March was the highest withdrawal ever since FPI data has been made available on National Securities Depository Ltd.

""As Covid-19 pandemic worsens across geographies, the disruption to the global economy is inevitable. The pandemic has adversely impacted investor sentiment and infected the markets globally.

""Emerging markets have been worst hit with foreign investors marching out from there to take shelter in safer investment avenues. India has been among the worst hit in the emerging market basket. Enhanced volatility can be seen in both the markets with equity markets falling sharply and yields in the fixed income segment moving up significantly,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar India.

Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww noted that FPI investments in the equity category have been positive in the last two trading sessions of April and this can be explained by the sentiment in European markets changing on hopes that the virus is nearing its peak.

He further said an inflow of around USD 7 billion is likely as the weight of Indian stocks has increased in the MSCI index.

According to Srivastava, though the broader trend continues to be negative, this week the quantum of net outflow was much lower compared to the previous few weeks.

During this holiday-truncated week (between April 6-10), with just three trading sessions, ""FPIs withdrew net assets worth USD 457.5 million from the Indian markets. This was significantly lower than the net outflow of USD 1.7 billion recorded in the previous week.""

Net outflows continued from the Indian fixed income markets with investors preferring safer dollar denominated asset classes, or safe havens like gold, as against fixed income securities of emerging markets like India where risks are relatively higher, Srivastava added.

""FPIs are exiting emerging markets at every level. However, once there is semblance of control over Covid-19 virus, foreign portfolio flows are bound to return to emerging markets in general and India in particular.

""Hopefully, in six months' time, when the economic picture is clearer, FPIs will see India as a strong revival story, on the back of its largely self-reliant economy, beneficiary of low oil price and falling interest rates. The expected increased weightage in MSCI index, in the near future, will also support favourably,"" said Amar Ambani, senior president and head of research at Yes Securities.

149,12-4-20,Italy begins to grapple with how to ease virus restrictions,"With warmer weather beckoning, Italians are straining against a strict lockdown to halt the coronavirus that is just now showing signs of ebbing at the end of five weeks of mass isolation.

Italy was the first Western democracy to be hit by the virus, and it has suffered the most deaths of any nation: nearly 19,000. Now it is likely to set an example of how to lift broad restrictions that have imposed the harshest peacetime limits on personal freedom and shut down all nonessential industry.

Right now, schools are closed and children are not permitted to play in parks. Walks outdoors are limited to a distance of 200 meters (yards) and any excursion not strictly a matter of necessity risks hefty fines.

The official line is patience with measures that have shown success in slowing the virus spread, until there is a clear decline in the number of new cases. Still, officials have begun grappling with the question of how to manage social distancing on mass transit, re-open ordinary commerce and relaunch manufacturing without risking another peak.

The so-called Phase II is being described as a cautious reopening, as society continues to live alongside the virus until a vaccine can be developed, perhaps in 12 to 18 months.

“We obviously don’t want to delude ourselves that everything will change,’’ Premier Giuseppe Conte told Italians this week.

On Friday, Conte extended the nationwide lockdown through May 3. That includes all nonessential industry, after which, “I hope we can start again with caution and gradually — but restart,’’ he said.

A technical committee advising the government is working to expand testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. to get a better picture of how widespread it is in Italy before measures can be eased. Preparations are also underway to launch a mobile app that will allow people to know if they have been near anyone who is positive, something that is expected to take at least a month.

‘’With this you can allow people to have more freedom of movement,’’ said Walter Ricciardi, a public health expert and member of the World Health Organization board advising the Italian government.

The technology for the app already exists but authorities were working on technical details on how to deploy it.

Experts in Italy are coordinating with their European partners so the tracking can be applied across borders, which have been de facto closed by the virus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italy-begins-to--grapple-with-how-to--ease-virus-restrictions.html
150,12-4-20,"Watson ‘forever indebted’ to Dhoni, Fleming for keeping faith in him","Australian all-rounder Shane Watson said that the ability to trust players and keep faith in them is what sets Chennai Super Kings apart from other franchises. Watson had won the Indian Premier League title in the inaugural season with the Rajasthan Royals and a decade later, he won it again with CSK in 2018.

“You can go for 10 games not scoring runs and still get picked. Last season, thank you to MS Dhoni and Stephen Fleming for keeping the faith,” he said in an Instagram Live session on CSK’s handle.

“Every other franchise would have been ‘You are gone. Thank you for coming, but you are sitting and you are running the drinks’,” he said.

He smashed 117 off 57 balls in an innings that included 11 fours and eight sixes in the 2018 final against Sunrisers Hyderabad to almost single-handedly take CSK to victory. He almost repeated the heroics the next year against Mumbai Indians, scoring 80 off 59 but CSK fell incredibly short of MI’s total of 149.

Watson had experienced a lean run in the early part of that season but started firing towards the latter stages.

“Through that period, unfortunately I felt like I was batting well but I was just not scoring runs and that kept going on and on. At some stage I was feeling after a couple of games that they are going to have to move me on, but they didn’t,” said Watson.

“And then when things turned around, which I knew it would at some stage, I thanked MS and Fleming for keeping the faith, and they said there was never any doubt,” he said.

“And that’s phenomenal. That made me feel 10-foot tall. That’s the power of amazing leadership. To know when to stick with people you believe in, and that’s amazing for me. And I am forever indebted to those guys.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/watson----forever-indebted----to-dhoni--fleming-for-keeping-faith-in-him.html
151,12-4-20,Test series loss to India was a wake-up call: Langer,"Australia’s unprecedented home Test series defeat to India in 2018-19 served as a “wake-up call” for Justin Langer, who reckons the series will prove as the defining moment of his coaching career.

Langer was appointed as the Australian coach in May 2018, following the infamous ball tampering scandal that saw skipper Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner slapped with year-long bans.

Without their star batsmen, the Australian side struggled to maintain its high rate of success with Langer at the helm.

The men from Down Under tasted their first Test series loss to India on home turf. Virat Kohli’s men handed them a 2-1 defeat.

“That was a massive wake-up call and a really tough time in my life,” Langer was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.

“I’ve got no doubt in 10 years’ time, I will look back on that period and it will be the making of my coaching career.”

The 49-year-old compared it to another difficult phase of his life, when he was dropped as a player at the start of 2001 Ashes.

Used to playing at number three, Langer was picked to open the innings with Mathew Hayden later in the series which served as a turning point for him.

Langer’s career was rechristened as he became the country’s most successful opener, scoring 16 of his 23 Test centuries.

“In 2001 when I got dropped from the Australian team at 31 years of age I thought that was the end. That was the making of me as a cricketer and a person. It was amazing what lessons you can learn in adversity,” he said.

The former opener believes difficult situations are opportunities to learn lessons of life and shouldn’t be squandered.

“In adversity, like in the great crisis we are going through right now (with the coronavirus). Like the crisis of the Australian cricket team when sandpaper on the ball, in adversity never waste it.”

“Because great lessons come from them and if you grasp them you will be a better person.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/test-series-loss-to-india-was-a-wake-up-call--langer.html
152,12-4-20,Laxman ‘shocked’ to see Rohit's name missing from Wisden list,"The Wisden while naming the Five Cricketers of the Year in 2019 gave Indias ODI deputy Rohit Sharma a miss and it came as a huge surprise because Rohit hit five hundreds in the 2019 World Cup and former India batsman VVS Laxman has said the same, calling the move a shocker.

Speaking on Rohit Sharma not featuring in Wisden Cricketers of the Year list, Laxman said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected: “I think anyone who follows the game of cricket will be surprised and shocked not to see Rohit Sharma’s name in those five players list. The Ashes is an important series, the World Cup is bigger than Ashes. And someone who has scored five hundred; remember the first hundred was on a tough wicket in Southampton against South Africa and none of the other batsmen got runs. And he played another important knock against Pakistan. I am really shocked and surprised, and every cricketer will be shocked and surprised by this announcement from Wisden.” England’s Ben Stokes and Ellyse Perry of Australia were on Wednesday named the Leading Cricketers of 2019 by Wisden Almanack.

Across the 2019 calendar, Stokes hit 821 Test runs at 45, including an Ashes hundred at Lord’s, and 719 in ODIs at almost 60.

153,12-4-20,Chahal craving to play cricket again,"The coronavirus-forced lockdown is now getting into India spinner Yuzvendra Chahal’s nerves, so much so that he says he can do with staying away from home for three years once it is lifted.

“I will get lock-downed from my home, I will not come back to my home. I can’t take this anymore, can’t stay at home for longer now. These days of staying at home will suffice for the next three years now,” Chahal said during a chat with a television cricket presenter.

The cricketers, who would have been playing the IPL had it not been for the unprecedented global health crisis, are instead confined to their homes for more than a fortnight.

India leg-spinner Chahal, who plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL, is struggling to come to terms with the lack of activity.

“I will live in a nearby hotel but will not stay at home, that’s it for me now, can’t bear anymore lockdown days.”

In the absence of sporting action, Chahal has been busy on social media platforms.

“I am going to the ground, I really want to bowl. When there is a lot of cricket to play we say ‘there is so much going on’ but we start missing it when there is no action.

154,12-4-20,We’re mentally prepared for pay cuts: Azhar Ali,"Pakistan’s centrally-contracted players are mentally prepared for pay cuts if the health crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic persisted for a few months, Test captain Azhar Ali said on Saturday.

In a video interaction with the media, Azhar said he and his colleagues are aware that the situation is not ideal due to the COVID-19.

“It is not a good situation for any country and we know that if this lockdown situation continued for a few months, the Board might ask us to take pay cuts in the old or new central contacts,” Azhar said.

“If such a situation arises that we are asked to take pay cuts we are mentally prepared for it and we will sit down with the Board and take the best decisions.”

The veteran of 78 Tests also said that cricket playing nations and players cannot sit at home for months and no cricket is held.

“Yes at some stage if this situation persists the option of playing in front of empty stadiums can be discussed but only if proper health and preventive measures are put in place by authorities for all stakeholders,” he added.

“It is unfortunate that fans are not watching any action even on TV and if cricket is played behind closed doors, it will provide fans with an opportunity to (at least) watch some cricket, but the health of the public should not be compromised,” he said.

“We tried to reach their standard and set the bar high for ourselves. Nowadays, players tend not to compare their performances against others. Maybe they are just playing for themselves, that could be one of the reasons. Also, there are lot of cricketers these days due to T20 cricket so consistency is a bit difficult for players these days,” said Moin.

Wasim said that his aim when he first broke into the team was to consistently take more wickets than captain Imran Khan.

“When I broke into the team, my aim was to take more wickets than Imran Khan. When you came into the team your mindset must be to take more catches and effect more stumpings than your heroes,” Akram said.

156,12-4-20,Looking forward to watch Babar play in England: Atherton,"Former England skipper turned pundit Michael Atherton visited Pakistan during the Pakistan Super League and the former opener believes that while it was indeed sad that cricket returned to the country after a long hiatus due to security issues, the turn out during the PSL was also a positive sign as the country gears up to host more international cricket in the future.

“Well, you only have to look around: the crowds, enthusiasm and packed houses for every game. Importantly, all these foreign players will now know that it is safe here and they will be able to take that message to the players from their own countries.

“I was at the hotel and there were about eight to nine English players like Moeen Ali, Ravi Bopara, Tom Banton, Lewis Gregory, Liam Dawson and they were all saying how much they’ve enjoyed the competition, the tournament’s standard has been great and they feel perfectly safe here. So, this message will get passed back and that will encourage more and more players and teams to come,” he told the PCB’s media team during an interview.

Commenting on the Pakistan team which has over the years produced greats, Atherton said: “When I played against them, they had some great bowlers in particular. The last attack that I played against on my tour here of 2000, they had Wasim and Waqar (Younis) then Mushtaq (Ahmed) and Saqlain (Mushtaq). Now you have got four great match-winning bowlers there.

“Pakistan, of course, have produced great batsmen, but I think in recent times, the strength and depth of their bowling and particularly the kind of wicket-taking bowlers — pace bowlers and mystery spinners — have set them apart.

“I don’t know why Pakistan particularly produces great bowlers. I suspect it has something to do with the relative lack of infrastructure. In order to produce lots and lots of great batsmen, you’ve got to have facilities and infrastructure and coaches and a very formal system, but I think bowlers can spring and emerge from anywhere and that’s probably why Pakistan produce so many.”

Asked about Pakistan’s upcoming tour of England in the summer, Atherton said that he is looking forward to seeing the likes of Babar Azam shine in conditions which won’t be easy.

“It should be terrific. It’s a big summer for England. It won’t be as big as the last summer because that was the World Cup and the Ashes, which are always slightly different. But, this year, we’ve got Pakistan and West Indies coming. Pakistan have a very good record against England in recent years in England.

“They’re always a valuable team to come and they get good support from the crowds. The cricket should be good and highly competitive. We’re looking forward to seeing Pakistan in England this summer. Babar Azam looks a fabulous player to me. He looks so skillful and the game looks so easy to him at times.

I am very much looking forward to watching him play.

“It is a challenge for players when they come from the subcontinent to England. The last two, three years conditions, in England, have been extreme actually: the Duke’s ball and the floodlights and, you know, the way the ball has moved around, so it's going to be a challenge for all Pakistan’s batsmen, but I think they will be up to it,” he smiled.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/looking-forward-to-watch-babar-play-in-england--atherton.html

161,12-4-20,Pak to take decision on lockdown tomorrow,"Pakistan said on Saturday that it will take a decision on whether to extend the ongoing nationwide lockdown or ease restrictions on Monday, as the number of coronavirus patients rose to 4,970.

Speaking at a Press conference here, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said that Prime Minister Imran Khan will take a decision after his meeting with the National Coordination Committee on COVID-19, comprising senior officials of all provinces and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

“We will make a national decision on the lockdown,” said Umar. He also said that the country would suffer about Rs1,400-1,500 billion shortfall in revenues due to the nationwide shutdown.

Prime Minister’s Advisor on Health Dr Zafar Mirza said that Pakistan had lower number of cases than projected but people should not relax and follow the restrictions. “It will be a mistake to relax,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pak-to-take-decision-on-lockdown-tomorrow.html
162,12-4-20,"Don’t push Dhoni into retirement, cautions Nasser","The doubting thomases “should be careful” about what they wish for as there is no second coming for a once-in-a-generation player like Mahendra Singh Dhoni if people “push him into retirement”, former England captain Nasser Hussain said on Saturday.

Hussain, one of the most respected voices in world cricket feels that the soon-to-be 39 year old former India captain still has a lot to offer in Indian cricket.

“Once Dhoni is gone, there is no getting him back. There are some legends of the game, appreciating while around, because they are once-in-a-generation cricketer and don’t push him into retirement too early. Only Dhoni knows his mental state and in the end the selectors select and players turn up when asked to,” 52-year-old Hussain told Star Sports on its new show Cricket Connected.

Dhoni last played for India in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July. Since then he hasn’t played any competitive cricket with former legends like Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev making it clear that it’s getting increasingly difficult for the Jharkhand dasher to make an international return anytime soon after such prolonged sabbatical.

But Hussain, who led England from 1999-2003, feels otherwise.

“Is MS Dhoni still good enough to get in the Indian side? It is as simple as that. That should apply for anyone across the board. What I have seen of Dhoni, I still think MS Dhoni has a huge amount to offer for Indian cricket,” he said.

However one of England’s shrewdest captains admitted that Dhoni did err on a couple of occasions during World Cup where he couldn’t force the pace of the innings.

While Hussain’s comments didn’t specify which match he was talking about but it is in all likelihood the games against West Indies and England where he failed to force the pace of the Indian innings.

“Yes, its been one or two occasions where he (MSD) got it wrong in run chases, there was a World Cup game in England where he sort of blocked at the end for some unknown reason, but in general MS Dhoni is still a really good talent and be careful what you wish for,” elaborated Hussain.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don---t-push-dhoni-into-retirement--cautions-nasser.html
163,12-4-20,MS India chances bleak if IPL gets cancelled: Srikkanth,"The 13th edition of the Indian Premier League was set to be a testing ground for former skipper MS Dhoni. While some felt he was past his prime, head coach Ravi Shastri had made it clear that the IPL will decide Dhoni’s fate along with some others who were vying for a spot in the team for the Twenty20 World Cup at the end of the year.

Speaking on Star Sports’ show Cricket Connected, Srikkanth said: “I am not going to be diplomatic. I am talking about if I was the chairman of the selection committee, what would I do. If the IPL does not happen then his chances are very, very bleak. Because straightaway, in my opinion, KL Rahul will be the wicketkeeper-batsman. Rishabh Pant, I still think he might be a bit of a doubt, but I believe that Rishabh Pant is highly talented.

“So, I wouldn’t mind taking him along with the squad, but definitely, if the IPL doesn’t happen, then Dhoni will have a difficult time getting back into the team for the T20 World Cup. Let’s be very honest about it. He is absolutely fit, he is a legend, he is brilliant. I am a great fan of Dhoni myself. But the question is for the World Cup team. So you’ll have to put the Indian team first and then the individuals.”

Meanwhile Gautam Gambhir has backed former India star all-rounder Yuvraj Singh claim that there is not enough role models in the current Indian team besides Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, adding that the line of respect for seniors has become thin.

“I agree with Yuvraj that there is a dearth of role models in the Indian team currently, like in the 2000s, we had Dravid, Kumble, Laxman, Sourav and Sachin to guide the team. It is important to have senior players around you who can help you when you're going through a rough patch. Right now, I don’t think there are enough seniors in the Indian camp, who will set aside their self-interest to help youngsters,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ms-india-chances-bleak-if-ipl-gets-cancelled--srikkanth.html
164,12-4-20,Women’s game must not be forgotten in football’s fight for survival: Hegerberg,"Ada Hegerberg’s voice in football is a powerful one given she claimed the first ever women’s Ballon d’Or, owns four Champions League titles with Lyon and has earned her place among the finest female players on the planet, all by the age of 24.

Hegerberg’s talent is matched too by a fearlessness in standing up for the rights of her gender in her sport.

She refused to play for Norway at last year’s World Cup due to perceived inequality with the men’s team and drew widespread praise after collecting her Ballon d’Or in 2018, having refused to indulge a request that she twerk on stage.

Yet even for one of the game’s most successful players, the sprawling effects of the coronavirus pandemic bring doubt. “It’s a strange situation for everyone,” Hegerberg said. “Everything is uncertain.”

Unable to see her husband in Poland or her family in Norway, Hegerberg is confined to her apartment in the French city of Lyon, where she is recovering from the anterior cruciate ligament injury she suffered in January.

She has an exercise bike, physios, who visit but maintain the health measures in place, and history books. “I’m reading Ken Follett at the moment — history in the 13th century, it takes your mind off things a bit,” she says.

Fight for prominence

But Hegerberg is concerned about the future too and she is adamant the women’s game must not be forgotten in football’s fight for survival.

“It’s very, very important women’s football doesn’t lose position,” Hegerberg says. “Obviously men’s football is in first place, with all the questions about money and when leagues will restart, but it is very important women’s football pushes for position as well.

“We will be sitting in the second row in all of this but we can’t fade into the background.”

Most women’s teams in Europe operate at a financial loss, relying instead on the profits of men’s sides until progress allows them to support themselves.

But football’s economic crash as a result of coronavirus means nothing is guaranteed.

Financial struggle

With even the world’s biggest clubs taking measures to avoid extinction, the fear is staff, players and even teams on the women’s side will be deemed expendable.

“Women’s football is still in its beginning phase and we have to push for the same rights, whatever gets decided, and we have to push for the same changes we were pushing for before,” says Hegerberg.

“We also need men’s football to be stable so we have our position and get that financial help before we can support ourselves.

“If you see how the biggest men’s clubs are struggling, you can only imagine how this is going to affect women’s teams.”

Players have come under pressure to help clubs and their lower-earners through wage cuts but blanket agreements have proven difficult to achieve.

Lyon are yet to confirm reductions but Hegerberg, whose reported 400,000-euro ($440,000) annual salary puts her among the highest earners in the women’s game, insists players are ready to help.

“We are in discussions at the moment but for me, as an individual player, I’ll do whatever is necessary to help the club,” she says.

“We can all make a difference. We all have our own opinions but my view is, ‘how we can help?’ I can’t speak for all clubs but players want to make sure we come out of this. Crises can create solidarity too.”

Lyon were three points clear at the top of the French women’s Division 1 when the action was halted. The shame for the sport overall was that the pandemic developed just as women’s football was hitting its stride, with record crowds turning out across Europe in the slipstream of the 2019 World Cup.

The danger is momentum will be lost. “Of course there is that danger, there have been a lot of positive things happening in recent months and we have to keep pushing for it, now more than ever, because it won’t happen by itself,” says Hegerberg.

“It’s very hard to say where women’s football will be in weeks, months or even years, the uncertainty is everywhere right now. It would be a shame to cancel the season, absolutely, we all want to be doing what we used to do.

“But there are so many other parts of society at risk at the moment, it’s hard for me to say ‘we have to start the league again’. We have to sit still. We just have to make sure we are ready.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/women---s-game-must-not-be-forgotten-in-football---s-fight-for-survival--hegerberg.html
165,12-4-20,Pogba ''hungry to come back'' from injury,"Manchester United star Paul Pogba said he is eager to return from a lengthy spell on the sidelines when football resumes following the coronavirus pandemic.

The World Cup winner has been limited to just eight appearances for United this season after battling a nagging ankle injury.

""I'm already training and touching the ball,"" Pogba, who hasn't played since December 26, told the United Podcast.

""I've been frustrated, a long time ago. Now I'm almost there, so I'm just thinking about getting back and training fully with the team and everything.""

""You think bad but I've never had something like this in my career, so I always take it in a good way. It makes me more hungry to come back and do well. And, yeah, it just shows me as well how much I love football.""

Pogba's agent Mino Raiola has hinted the 27-year-old could leave Old Trafford if he is unhappy at the end of the season.

However, the Premier League has been put on hold indefinitely due to the spread of the deadly virus.

""You have to be very patient because, well my injury, I don't know if people really know what happened,"" Pogba added.

""So I had a foot injury, which came in the game against Southampton. It was early this season and so I carried this for a long time, training and trying to be playing with it. After I stopped, I found I had a fracture.

""I had a cast on it, a plaster-cast, so it went very well but too well. The bone got bigger and so, when I came back again, I played those two games against Watford and Newcastle, I could feel something again.

""So I had to have an operation and now here I am. I don't feel anything and, hopefully, I'll be back very soon.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pogba---hungry-to-come-back---from-injury-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pogba---hungry-to-come-back---from-injury.html
166,12-4-20,"Dhoni stuck now, should have retired after 2019 World Cup: Shoaib Akhtar","Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar says he cannot fathom why Mahendra Singh Dhoni has ""dragged it for so long"" as the right time for the maverick ex-India skipper to call it quits was after last year's ODI World Cup.

Akhtar said he hopes the 38-year-old Dhoni gets a resounding farewell despite his resolute silence on what the future holds.

""This guy has served to the best of his ability. He should leave cricket with dignity. I don't know why he dragged it for so long. He should have retired after the World Cup,"" Akhtar told PTI from Islamabad.

""If I would have been in his place, I would have hung up my boots. I could have played shorter formats for three-four years but I left (after the 2011 WC) as I wasn't into the game 100 per cent. So why drag?"" he asked.

Dhoni, who has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal in July, was preparing to make a much-anticipated comeback with the IPL, which is now unlikely to take place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

If he had done well in the IPL, there was a possibility of him playing the T20 World Cup in October-November.

Akhtar believes Dhoni is now in a limbo but deserves a grand send-off despite the anti-climactic turn of events.

""As a country, you should let him go with a lot of respect and dignity. Give him a nice send off. He has won you the World Cup and done wonders for India. He is a wonderful human being at the same time. But right now, he seems to be stuck,"" he said.

Akhtar said Dhoni should have ideally retired after last year's 50-over World Cup.

""When he could not finish the game in the semifinal (against New Zealand). I felt he should have retired but he can only answer why he didn't,"" he said.

""He should have played a farewell series after the World Cup may be and then said goodbye in a manner befitting his great stature.""

Talking about the Indian team's inability to win a global event since the 2013 Champions Trophy, Akhtar said Virat Kohli's team needs match-winners in the middle-order.

""Winning tournaments is one thing but staying at top is another. India is still the top-ranked Test team and is almost among the top teams in the limited-overs format. So, we should not base their performance only on their showing in ICC events.

""Of course, they should win ICC events and they have to. This team, when the top four score, they win more often than not. But if they don't, then it is an issue. Another thing I noticed is that you need a match-winner like Yuvraj (Singh) or Dhoni in the middle-order,"" he explained.

""When we toured India in 1998, we always thought we would run through India after getting the top order. There was no match winner until Yuvraj came in, followed by Dhoni.

""Then you started seeing change in results. Right now, the problem is lack of finishers,"" opined the 44-year-old.

Akhtar doesn't see any cricket happening for the next six to eight months as coronavirus continues to wreak havoc around the world.

But if India's tour of Australia takes place, Akhtar sees all four Tests going down the wire.

India had won their first ever Test series in Australia early last year. But this time, Australia will be a different kettle of fish in the presence of Steve Smith and David Warner, who were serving ball-tampering bans when India toured last.

""Despite the loss in New Zealand, I think India is a very, very good team and can give a tough time to Australia. But again, India have to prove that like they did the last time.

""However, I don't see that series happening. My assessment is there won't be any cricket for next one year. The T20 World Cup is not going to happen.

""We are dealing with a pandemic at the moment. Any industry, which requires crowd gathering, is going to suffer,"" Akhtar added.

He alleged that the people of Madhya Pradesh were ""befooled"" by the saffron party as there was no council of ministers or a health or home Minister in place in the state amid the crisis due to the coronavirus outbreak.

""Nowhere in the world this has happened,"" he added.

The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said the situation in the country due to coronavirus was very serious and the number of cases will rise if more testing was done.

Noting that the country is going to face a very serious economic crisis due to COVID-19, he said the Centre's economic package needs to be focussed and its success lies in its execution and on which sectors it focusses on.

171,12-4-20,Wadhawan bros come clean on Khandala-Mahabaleshwar trip,"Four days after a massive political furore, scam-accused businessmen Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan on Sunday gave their side of the story about their Thursday (April 9) trip from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar allegedly flouting lockdown norms.

The hill-station hopping trip between Pune and Satara districts sparked off a row after a senior Maharashtra IPS officer, Principal Secretary (Special) in Home Department Amitabh Gupta, granted a written permission on April 8.

While Gupta was sent on ""compulsory leave"", the Wadhawan brothers and 21 others have been shunted into compulsory quarantine at a Panchgani facility and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh ordered a probe into the fracas by a senior officer to be completed within 15 days.

The CBI shot off an email to the Satara police asking them not to release the Wadhawans without their permission while the ED has seized the five vehicles in which they travelled.

on Sunday, the Wadhawan brothers - named in the Yes Bank scam - issued a detailed statement through their legal firm, Rashmikant and Partners, giving their version of the entire episode and other related aspects of the probes carried out by Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)

The duo said they travelled from a rented accommodation in Khandala to their ancestral home in Mahabaleshwar as they were genuinely concerned for the health of their family owing to the coronavirus pandemic.

""They also heard that there were possible Coronavirus cases in Khandala. They were in Khandala alongwith their mother, aged 70 years, who has a multitude of health problems and their respective wives and children,"" said the lengthy statement.

Besides, Kapil Wadhawan suffers from hypertension and was recently hospitalised while Dheeraj Wadhawan is also a heart patient who underwent emergency angioplasty in Switzerland in January 2018, and spent time in a hospital ICU in October-November 2019 for a severe lung infection, which the ED was aware of, it said.

During his interrogation by ED, Dheeraj Wadhawan again suffered chest pains for which he was admitted to Hinduja Healthcare Hospital.

""Thus, Mr. Kapil Wadhawan, Mr. Dheeraj Wadhawan and their mother were highly susceptible to the coronavirus, which could pose serious risk to their health in view of their medical conditions. Considering the circumstances, the Wadhawans thought it fit to travel further away from Khandala and Mumbai and thus decided to go to their ancestral residence in Mahabaleshwar,"" said the statement from Rashmikant and Partners.

When they reached their home in Mahabaleshwar, they were informed by the local authorities to self-quarantine themselves for 14 days, and later shifted to a private quarantine facility in adjoining Panchgani hillstation.

The Wadhawans also refuted speculation that they are not cooperating with the ED and CBI, are absconding or flouting lockdown rules, as ""false and absurd"" and claimed ""none of their actions have been taken to defeat the law"".

Attempting to set right the record, the Wadhawans said that the within 24 hours, the CBI issued three notices to them in March for appearance at short notice. These were notice on March 13, 2020 to appear before it on March 14 at 10 am, a notice on March 14 to appear on the same day evening, and another notice notice on March 14 for appearance on March 15.

Responding to each notice, the Wadhawans requested for consideration as they were both travelling with their mother and respective families since March 6 due to Kapil Wadhawan's health issues.

On March 15, in the last communication to the CBI by the Wadhawans, they pointed out the advisories of the Centre and state governments to avoid unnecessary travel in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus, making it inadvisable for them to return to Mumbai from Khandala.

The lawyers said even the ED had issued three summons to them - on March 10 for appearance on March 13 morning, on March 13 for appearance on March 16 morning, and on March 16 for appearance on March 17 morning, and the Wadhawans responded akin to the CBI, seeking time to appear before the probe agency.

On March 17, the Wadhawans even sought a questionnaire about the information required by the probe agencies, but said there was no response from ED.

The Wadhawan brothers refuted all ""misinformation"" being spread that they are no cooperating with the ED-CBI, and said they had not ""skipped"" any appearances before them, as they felt comforted that their last request for aaccomodation' had been accepted in view of the Covid-19 pandemic threats.

he duo also reiterated that they are not linked to or concerned with the ongoing legal proceedings pertaining to the Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative Bank, and if they were trying to abscond, they would not have sought the Maharashtra government's permission to travel in their own names to their own house in Mahabaleshwar.

Rashmikant and Partners added that the Wadhawans have been in contact with all the investigations agencies and other authorities for various legal/officials matters, Kapil Wadhawan's passport is deposited with the ED while Dheeraj Wadhawan cannot travel abroad without the court's permission, so they are not a flight risk.

""In fact, they are quite anxious to join the investigation,"" the statement concluded.

172,12-4-20,Was trying to hit his stumps every ball: Broad on dismissing Warner,"England pacer Stuart Broad dismissed Australia opener David Warner seven times in 10 innings in the last Ashes and it was almost a given that every time Broad had the ball in his hand in the series, he had Warner’s number. The pacer has finally revealed how he got the better of the destructive opener as Warner finished the series with only 95 runs.

“He is such a dangerous player and one of the best third-innings opening batsmen in the world,” Broad said in a Sky Cricket podcast.

“Having played against him a lot over the last eight or nine years, I found that, as I am a taller bowler, when he sat back in the crease he was cutting and square driving me a lot to the boundary.

“I decided I was just going to try and hit his stumps every ball. I was not going to try and swing it away from it as I felt that gave him width, I was just going to scramble the seam.”

Broad said that after the dismissal at Lord’s, he believed that he was winning the battle between the two cricketers.

“Once I got him at Lord’s, the third time in a row, I just got that feeling like I was getting a bit of a competitive edge over him,” said Broad.

The pacer has 485 wickets from 138 Tests and has a brilliant camaraderie with opening bowling partner James Anderson.

Commenting on what makes them successful, Broad said: “I love the competitive side of cricket, the moment of winning, working a batsman out, getting a wicket, but he just loves any sort of bowling and is at his happiest just trucking in.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/was-trying-to-hit-his-stumps-every-ball--broad-on-dismissing-warner.html

174,12-4-20,Lyon has taken mantle from Ashwin as best off-spinner: Hogg,"Ravichandran Ashwin is a prolific performer but former Australia chinaman bowler Brad Hogg feels that Nathan Lyon has upstaged the Indian tweaker as the best off-spinner in longest format.

Just like most international players are doing during lockdown, the 49-year-old Hogg, who played 7 Tests and 123 ODIs for Australia, had a Twitter Q&A session for cricket lovers.

When asked whom among Ashwin and Lyon does he consider better in Test cricket, Hogg replied: “I feel Lyon has taken the mantle from Ashwin over the last year just as the best off spinner, but I love the way both continue to improve there games and not be complacent where they are at. #hoggytime,” Hogg tweeted.

Probably Hogg drew his conclusion from the fact that Ashwin hasn’t had great overseas success as compared to Lyon, who has got wickets in all conditions. Ashwin has so far taken 365 wickets from 71 Tests while Lyon has 390 wickets from 96 Tests.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lyon-has-taken-mantle-from-ashwin-as-best-off-spinner--hogg.html
175,12-4-20,2020 Int’l Champions Cup cancelled,"The 2020 International Champions Cup (ICC) football tournament has been cancelled due to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, organisers have announced.

The ICC is a series of pre-season friendly matches that take place primarily in North America and Asia, and has featured some of the world’s biggest teams since the tournament’s inception in 2013.

Already, planned summer competitions like Euro 2020, the Copa America and the Olympics have been postponed and now the ICC has joined that list.

Danny Sillman, chief executive of organisers Relevent Sports Group, confirmed the cancellation in a letter to fans, noting that the health and safety of players, staff and fans would take priority.

“The lack of clarity of when social distancing and shelter-in-place restrictions will be lifted and the uncertain international football calendar with the potential for European domestic leagues and UEFA tournaments being played into August, means planning a Men’s International Champions Cup this summer is unfeasible,” he said.

“We look forward to bringing the best clubs and most iconic matchups in the world to the US and Asia in 2021,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/2020-int---l-champions-cup-cancelled.html
176,12-4-20,Will consider becoming AIFF Prez in future: Bhutia,"Former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia has said that he will consider contesting for the post of All India Football Federation (AIFF) president in future.

Bhutia retired in 2011, after being Indian football’s posterboy for more than a decade.

“That is definitely something to be considered in future,” he said when asked if he wants to become the AIFF president one day, while answering questions on Facebook.

“At the moment I am focussing on grassroot football with Baichung Bhutia Football School and United Sikkim club and also at district level (in Sikkim). In future, I will definitely consider it (the AIFF president’s post),” said the legendary striker who was known as Sikkimese Sniper for his goal-scoring abilities.

The current AIFF president Praful Patel has effectively been at the helm of affairs since 2008 when then chief Priyaranjan Das Munshi fell sick.

He was elected as president in 2012 and again in 2016, and is unlikely to be eligible to fight for the top job this year under the Sports Code.

The 43-year-old Bhutia, who was the first Indian footballer to have played 100 international matches, picked India and FC Goa player Brandon Fernandes as the country’s best midfielder at the moment.

“The most gifted striker right now is obviously Sunil Chhetri, there is nobody else. He has been scoring goals and the record itself speaks a lot.

“The midfielder who has really impressed me this year is Brandon Fernandes of FC Goa. He has really done well for FC Goa. The way he had controlled the midfield for FC Goa (in ISL) and linked up with the upfront has been fantastic. He is also in the national team.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/will-consider-becoming-aiff-prez-in-future--bhutia.html
177,12-4-20,"Turning homes into ranges, shooters gear up for int’l online championship","Some of the world’s elite shooters will transform their living rooms into competition ranges on April 15 for a first-of-its-kind international online championship, the coronavirus lockdown triggering another out of the box thinking.

An electronic target setup, beside a mobile phone with internet connection, is all they require to shoot in the championship.

From India, the event has attracted big names such as Manu Bhaker, Sanjeev Rajput and Divyansh Singh Panwar, whose Tokyo Olympics dreams have been put on hold for a year after the Games’ postponement last month due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

An initiative of former India marksman Shimon Sharif, the championship, which will be live streamed on the internet, will see about 50 shooters, including double Gold medallist at the 2019 World Cup in Delhi Veronika Major (Hungary), Nicolas Fraga Corredoira (Spain), Emila Faulkner, Isobel Mactaggart and Lucy Evans (all Scotland), among others.

To make it more interesting, there will be live commentary by Olympian Joydeep Karmakar.

This comes after the unprecedented global health crisis forced the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) to cancel all their tournaments this year, including the World Cups.

“This competition is an effort to keep our sport alive even in these tough times,” Sharif, who run the indianshooting.Com portal said.

“This one is only for the elite shooters but later we will organise competitions which will be open to all once every quarter with a prize money.”

All participants will shoot at the same time from their respective homes and it will be streamed live on internet through an app which “makes the competition very transparent”.

The world’s first international online championship will also be streamed Live on the indianshooting.Com Facebook page so that more people can watch Live action.

There will be a panel of jury who will also be logged in to monitor the shooters throughout and keep a track of scores.

The competition will be held at 4:00 PM India time. Shooters from different countries and time zones will all have to join in and shoot at the same time.

“The idea is that without travelling abroad and spending so much on travel etc shooters can compete against each other from their home or their local ranges.

“All they need is an electronic target set up and a mobile with internet. It could be very motivating for a junior shooter to shoot alongside a world class shooter,” Sharif, who has competed in an ISSF World Cup in Korea, said.

Besides India, shooters from Hungary, Spain and Scotland have already confirmed their participation.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/turning-homes-into-ranges--shooters-gear-up-for-int---l-online-championship.html
178,12-4-20,Beating virus would be ‘real' victory: Sarabia,"Paris Saint-Germain winger Pablo Sarabia says that beating the coronavirus would be the ‘real victory of the season’, with most professional football shut down due to the pandemic.

France's Ligue 1 was suspended on March 13, with PSG sitting 12 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table, while having also reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2016.

But Spanish international Sarabia says public health has to come first ahead of getting back onto the pitch.

“No, I’m not afraid about that (the season not restarting), it’s not the thing I am worrying about,” he said.

“I am thinking about my family first and foremost and then about getting this sorted. This is a critical situation.

“Who knows right now whether the league will restart or not — it is hypothetical and we all need to focus on the pandemic. Coming through this would be the real victory of the season.”

Football players have come under pressure to take salary cuts, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich stars all among those to accept a reduction in pay.

And Sarabia says that the French clubs are also planning to take similar measures.

“All that is in our hands, if we can help, donate something, do what is in our hands, (we will),” he said.

“We are talking about it and our captains are in discussions and all we can do to help PSG and the country in general, we will try to do that.”

Euro hopes on ice

Sarabia, 27, joined the French champions from La Liga outfit Sevilla last year and has impressed in Paris, scoring 14 goals in all competitions so far this season.

He is hoping to use his unexpected free time to improve his French, having signed a five-year contract with PSG.

“I like to talk and if I don’t understand the language and can’t communicate that frustrates me a bit,” said Sarabia.

“I’m trying to make the most of these days to study and come out with a better level of French.”

PSG’s main aim since the takeover by a Qatari investment group in 2011 has been to lift the Champions League trophy, but the capital club have still not reached the semi-finals since 1995.

A last-16 victory over Borussia Dortmund last month, though, having trailed after the first leg, raised hopes that PSG could finally make a serious tilt at European football’s greatest prize.

“It was a difficult time when we lost in Dortmund but everything that has happened has shown how united we all are as a team,” said Sarabia.

“I could see in the eyes of my teammates that we were going to get through, you could feel it.

“(But) there is still a long way to go before the final, and as I said before I don’t think we should be thinking about that just now.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/beating-virus-would-be----real--victory--sarabia-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/beating-virus-would-be----real--victory--sarabia.html

180,12-4-20,HCQ consignment from India arrives in US,"A consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India has arrived in the US, days after New Delhi lifted a ban on export of the anti-malarial drug, seen as a possible cure for COVID-19, to America and some other countries on humanitarian grounds.

Earlier this week, India at the request of President Donald Trump cleared the export of 35.82 lakh tablets of hydroxychloroquine to the US along with nine metric tons of active pharmaceutical ingredient or API required in the manufacturing of the drug.

""Supporting our partners in the fight against COVID-19. Consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today (Saturday),"" India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu tweeted.

Trump, during a phone call last week, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lift the hold on American order of the anti-malarial drug, of which India is the major producer. India, which manufactures 70 per cent of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine, lifted the ban on April 7.

Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York.

Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The arrival of consignment was welcomed by Americans. ""US will never forget this great humanitarian gesture by India. Under President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the two largest democracies of the world have come together than ever in the past, said New York-based Al Mason, a real estate consultant and a Trump supporter.

A wonderful gesture by India to its friends in need, tweeted Dr Sampat Shivangi. Describing this as a wonderful gesture , Steve Filipovic, who works in the construction industry, thanked the Indian Ambassador.

Meanwhile, according to a new French study of 1,061 hospitalised COVID-19 patients showed a 91.7 per cent cure (viral shedding) within 10 days of hydroxychloroquine treatment along with anti-biotic. It also reported a 96 per cent cure rate after 15 days.

Early this week, the National Institute of Health reported that a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adults hospitalised with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun, with the first participants now enrolled in Tennessee.

Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat malaria and rheumatoid conditions such as arthritis. In various studies, the drug has demonstrated antiviral activity, an ability to modify the activity of the immune system, and has an established safety profile at appropriate doses, leading to the hypothesis that it may also be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, NIH said.

The drug is not without risks as even short-term use can cause cardiac arrythmias, seizures, dermatological reactions, and hypoglycemia, it added.

Many US hospitals are currently using hydroxychloroquine as first-line therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 despite extremely limited clinical data supporting its effectiveness, said Wesley Self, emergency medicine physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and PETAL Clinical Trials Network investigator leading the ORCHID trial.

Thus, data on hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 are urgently needed to inform clinical practice, he added.

According to NIH, participants will be randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily for two doses (day one), then 200 mg twice daily for the subsequent eight doses (days two to five) or a placebo twice daily for five days.

COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

As of Saturday, more than 16 lakh people globally tested positive and more than one lakh have died. The United States has emerged as the hotspot with 20,000 deaths and 5.3 lakh cases.

181,12-4-20,Stay where you are: Ambassador Sandhu tells stranded Indian students in US,"India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has advised the Indian students, stranded in America due to the sudden closure of universities and the ongoing lockdown back home because of the coronavirus pandemic, to stay where they are and assured them help in this crisis situation.

Sandhu addressed the concerns of over 500 Indian students who attended the Instagram Live session hosted by the Indian Embassy on Saturday. The session was coordinated by India Student Hub Team.

There are an estimated 250,000 Indian students in the US, a significantly large numbers of whom are stranded due to the sudden closer of the universities and asked to vacate their hostels and follow stay-at-home order issued by the authorities to contain the spread of the pandemic in the country.

The Indian government imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown from March 24 to stem the tide of the fast-spreading disease and also suspended rail, road and air services during the period.

At this time the most advisable thing to do is stay where you are, Sandhu said in response to a question during the live session.

Assuring the students that the Indian embassy is in constant communication with the US Government on the issue of their visa, Sandhu said that they can make travel plans to India once the situation improves.

My strong advice to you is to stay where you are. We are in touch with you . We will help you out, he said.

Later Sandhu tweeted, an engaging interaction with Indian students in the US on Instagram Live this afternoon.

Young students are our future and we look for innovative ideas from them, he said.

Soon after the coronavirus outbreak in the US, the Indian embassy and its five consulates started a student-specific help line to address their concerns in this emergency situation.

The embassy has also started a Peer Support Line, which is run by Indian students.

According to the Johns Hopkins University data, the number of COVID-19 fatalities in the US has crossed 20,000 and over 530,000 Americans have tested positive for the disease, that has wreaked havoc across the globe.

182,12-4-20,‘Playing this role was big challenge’ ‘Playing this role was big challenge’,"PUJA BANERJEE who plays Maa Vaishno Devi in Star Bharat’s Jag Jaanani... speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about the preparations that she had to do, rapport with co-actors and hobbies

What is your role in Jag Jaanani Maa Vaishnodevi — Kahani Matarani Ki

I play grown up Maa Vaishno Devi in the show. The story unfolds as Vaishnavi realises her powers that of a goddess. She goes on a journey to become the universal Mother, where she makes sure that all the sins are diminished in the world. She strives to end paap (the evil in the world) and not the paapi (the sinner).

What brings you to the show?

I am glad that I am playing Maa Vaishno Devi in the show. Well there’s a saying: You don’t choose a character, character chooses you. Something similar happened with me as well. I have always been a bhakt of Maa Vaishno Devi. And getting an opportunity to play a character as such is a meet of destiny. When I was approached for the character I didn’t give it a second thought. I immediately said yes. This is not just a character. This is something people worship.

What preparations did you have to do?

The show has already completed more than 100 episodes. The character has already been built in the mind of our audience. Maisha Dixit who played younger Vaishno Devi in the show has done an amazing job to hook the audience with her striking acting skills. Now, to play an older version of Maa Vaishno Devi in the show, I take it as a big challenge. I have always made sure that I give my best when it comes to playing such roles. The viewers don’t just see you as a character but as a divine person whom they have a godly connect with. To get into the nook of the character I researched a lot by reading books. I spent some time with Maisha too trying to get those minute details which I can use in my character.

What kind of rapot do your share with your co-actors?

People in the show have already been working with each other since the beginning. I have entered recently in the show. But all of my co-actors have made it easy for me. We have gelled well and are having a fun time working together.

What is your take on the trend of mythological shows?

I believe that there is a lot to learn from Indian mythology in terms of wit, strength and life lessons that will help you grow as a person. More than that, these mythologies form our roots. These shows not just entertain the viewers but also educate them about our values and culture. Like for this show, we have made the story relevant to today’s youth as it’s very important for them to understand our core values.Today, not many people like to read about the mythology, so these shows are a medium to showcase our roots in an entertaining way. This is what I like the most about this trend.

What kind of fitness regime do you follow?

First things first. My take on fitness is everyone should understand their body type and then identify and follow a particular pattern of fitness. One should be healthy only then the person can be fit. And it goes for everyone as generally people are careless about their fitness and they feel only actors need to be fit, but it’s wrong. All of us should be equally careful about our health and always be fit so that during hard times like these we don’t have to be scared much. Exercise boosts our immunity and a balanced healthy diet plan will keep us in good health always. I follow a balanced diet more than working out as I get very less time to go to gym, but I prefer doing yoga daily.

What do you do when not acting?

I love travelling and dancing. This is something that I do to refresh my mind. A person needs to take a break out of his/ her busy schedule. These are the things that I do to rejuvenate and reenergise myself.

What are your upcoming projects?

As of now, my focus is only on Jag Jaanani Maa Vaishnodevi — Kahani Matarani Ki. No plans for future, completely committed to my show.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---playing-this-role-was-big-challenge-------playing-this-role-was-big-challenge----2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---playing-this-role-was-big-challenge-------playing-this-role-was-big-challenge---.html

Some moments are not just moments, those are precious memories that one cherishes forever in their life.

The actor who is essaying the role of Maa Kali in the show Jag Jaanani Maa Vaishno Devi — Kahani Mata Rani Ki is making the best use of quarantine. She has been in constant touch with her fans on Instagram and is motivating people during these difficult days.

Recently, she shared her memories with Govinda from the year 2012. She posted this video on Instagram where both of them gave a performance together on a Bengali song. Ishita wrote a very sweet caption where she considers herself very fortunate that she got a chance to share the stage with Govinda sir in the year 2012.

She also mentioned that: “Both of us had not practiced at all for that performance. Half an hour before going on the stage we both met each other and he told me that we will keep doing the steps that we remember.”

Ishita further said tha: “I still remember when Govinda sir told me that you have very good skills. You will definitely come to Mumbai one day and reach great heights. Memories as such will never fade away.”

Karan’s hidden talent

Zee TV's latest fiction drama Qurbaan Hua has kept everyone at the edge of their seats ever since it was launched. Be it the unique storyline, the constant twists and turns or the fantastic performance by Karan Jotwani and Pratibha Ranta, the show has surely grabbed everyone's attention. In fact, Karan Jotwani's daredevil stunts and his intense portrayal of Neel has also impressed one and all. His fanfare has grown massively and to keep his followers entertained during this COVID-19 lockdown, the actor did something really interesting recently and you surely cannot miss it!

While the lockdown has surely made everyone across the world feel blue, it has also given people and actors alike, a chance to explore their hidden talents. While some actors seek for the chef or painter within them, others have chosen to sing their hearts out. Qurbaan Hua star Karan Jotwani is one of them and he has been experimenting with his vocational skills. He showed off his hidden talent when he shared his rendition of Ranveer Singh's Doori from Gully Boy and Arijit's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil track. But what makes it even more special was the intensity with which he sang the songs as well as his expressions and the way the video was presented!

Karan recently took to his social media pages to share videos. While one video features the actor's heartfelt rendition of Arijit's popular song, the other video depicts his multitasking capabilities as he raps and completes his household chores simultaneously. Sharing his thoughts on the same, Karan Jotwani mentioned: “Doori is currently one of the top most tracks on my playlist, while Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is a personal favourite. In fact, I share a deep love for Arijit's tracks, and you will always catch me singing to his tunes. Apart from that, I also love Ranbir Kapoor. He is a great human being and an even better actor. So, I've loved lip syncing Ranbir's songs and hence, I had to sing Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. I'll try to do some more renditions of Ranbir Kapoor songs. As for Doori, I believe it's just a way of exploring the rapper within me and making the best use of this quarantine time.”

Well, we'd surely love to see the actor post more such entertaining musical covers. Wouldn't you?

Angoori’s obsession with jhumkas

It’s often said that a woman can never have enough shoes! But who said its only limited to owning some pretty pairs of shoes? Call it a confession or revealing an obsession, a celebrity’s love for splurging on fashionable trends has never been on a low. Our Angoori Bhabhi played by television actress Shubhangi Atre in &TV’s Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai shares a personal love towards ethnic jewellery especially when it comes to colourful unusual yet elegant jhumkas. The actress hoards a collection of nearly 500 pieces that she personally wears apart from also giving her character, Angoori that perfect desi look.

It has been four years since she started her journey as Angoori Bhabhi and ever since then she has been collecting earrings. Big, small, dainty she has all types of them but specifically the actress loves the traditional kundan work jewellery. Shubhangi feels that kundan jewellery suits Angoori the best as it gives her character a traditional and ethnic look.

Talking about her huge collection of earrings the actress shares: “As a teen, I used to love dressing up to go to college and hoarding clothes and accessories has been a habit ever since. Over the due course of my acting career I realized my love for jewellery and more specifically of earrings. When I started shooting for Bhabiji Ghar Par Hai the love for earrings became a fetish and I started collecting new pieces that I handpicked on my trips in and around India. I specifically love kundan jewellery so on a recent trip to Jaisalmer I picked up a beautiful pair of earrings that I love the most from my entire collection.”

185,12-4-20,Walk down memory lane,"After Doordarshan brought back the classics, channels like Zee TV and Star Bharat are also bringing back some of the most loved shows, including Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Khichdi and Hum Paanch. MUSBA HASHMI tells you more

The year 2020 will be engraved in our minds for decades to come. The COVID-19 villain has managed to do the impossible — it has brought shooting of shows to a complete stand still. This means that the viewers have nothing new to watch. In such a scenario, many people are taking about the good old shows that used to keep them captivated. The Gen Z also wants to know what made these classics so good that their parents still talk about them even though it has been years since they went off air.

Just like Doordarshan has brought back shows like Ramayan, a few other channels are also geared up for the re-run of some iconic shows in order to maintain the daily dose of fun, laughter and thrill.

While Star Bharat is back with the laugh-riot — Sarabhai vs Sarabhai and Khichdi, from April 13 between 10 am and 12 pm, Zee TV is no less and Hum Paanch is back too from tomorrow — Monday April 13, 2020. The re-telecast signifies how these shows are still in demand.

Ashok Saraf who played Anand Mathur in Hum Paanch says that the only reason that these shows have always been in demand is because they are still relevant.

“The sole reason that these iconic shows have been so popular is because of the fact that they were and still are relevant to the audience and hence, they are making a comeback on TV. I believe Hum Paanch is relevant to the audience even today. This is because the makers were such visionaries that they created a show in a manner that the audience could relate to it at any given point of time. It is a show that was written so well, inculcating such minute details and every episode depicting something new, that it never failed to surprise the viewers. A new issue was addressed every single time and they were also dealt with innovative solutions. This made it stand out. As humans, our problems have remained more or less the same, we just deal with them differently. The show depicts exactly that, with hilariously accurate comic timing,” he tells you.

He tells you that everyone on the sets used to listen to him since he was the eldest. “To be honest, everyday felt like a rollercoaster ride on the sets, it was so much fun. I miss those days and since I was the eldest, I remember everyone used to listen to me. We all worked like one big family,” Saraf recalls.

He adds that the pace of comedy shows has changed over years and become extremely fast. “These days people don’t pay much heed to the script. I fail to understand how they take something so essential, so lightly. As hard it is to write a comedy, at the end of the day, a good script is the backbone of it. Improvisation is obviously a necessity, but a good script can do wonders. The comedy scene today is very different, or if I may say, fast as compared to what we used to do back in the day. Moreover, TV these days doesn’t really make comedy shows anymore either. Today, the daily soaps are dominated by the saas-bahu drama, may be because audience also likes it, but I feel comedy will always have a special place. Also, today’s comedy shows are more of reality shows,” he says.

Sumeet Raghavan who played Dr Sahil Sarabhai in Sarabhai vs Sarabhai agrees with Saraf and says that he is waiting for the re-run of Buniyaad and Hum Log.

“All these shows have a special place in the hearts of the people. We have grown up watching these shows therefore there’s a different connect with them or for that matter with the characters Sarabhai vs Sarabhai came in 2004. The show is still evergreen. While these shows are available on digital platforms there’s a different feeling of watching it with your family on TV and even eagerly waiting for it to come. This feeling can’t be replaced. It has a nostalgic value. It is a great step taken by the channels to re-telecast these shows,” he says.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/walk-down-memory-lane-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/walk-down-memory-lane.html
186,12-4-20,'Mental health consequences of physical distancing decoded',"As people across the world adopt physical distancing measures to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have assessed the consequences that self-isolation will have for mental health and well-being in both the short and long term.

According to an analysis, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, these consequences are so important that immediate direct intervention efforts are needed to address the impact of the outbreak on individual and population level mental health.

Scientists, including those from Boston University School of Public Health in the US, said large-scale disasters, whether traumatic such as mass shootings, natural phenomena like hurricanes, or environmental disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, are almost always accompanied by increases in depression.

They said cases of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder, other mental and behavioural disorders, domestic violence, and child abuse may also increase following such episodes.

For such events, the researchers said, the impact on mental health can occur in the immediate aftermath and then persist over long time periods.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, they said there may be substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, loneliness, and domestic violence.

As schools remain closed, there may also be an epidemic of child abuse, the report cautioned.

According to the scientists three steps, taken now, can help governments across the globe proactively prepare for an increase in mental health conditions triggered by the pandemic.

First, they said, it is necessary to plan for the inevitability of loneliness and its sequelae as populations physically and socially isolate and to develop ways to intervene.

Using digital technologies, social distance can be bridged even while physical distancing measures are in place, the research noted.

Normal places of congregation, such as gyms, and yoga studios, can conduct online activities on a schedule similar to the ones in place before social distancing, the scientists said.

""Some workplaces are creating virtual workspace where people can work and connect over video connections, so they are not virtually alone,"" they noted in their analysis.

The researchers said employers should ensure that each employee receives daily outreach during the work week, through a supervisor or buddy system, just to maintain social contact.

Efforts should be made to ensure connections with people who are typically marginalised and isolated, including the elderly, undocumented immigrants, homeless persons, and those with mental illness, the scientists said.

Using social media, they said, groups could be connected, while also directing individuals to trusted resources for mental health support.

For children who are out of school, ensuring that they have access to regular programmed work is important, according to the scientists.

While online substitutes for daily routines, as mentioned above, can be extremely helpful, not all children have access to technologies that enable remote connectivity, they cautioned.

Efforts to bridge this gap are essential, the report said.

Mechanisms for surveillance, reporting, and intervention, particularly, when it comes to domestic violence and child abuse are critical, it added.

""Individuals at risk for abuse may have limited opportunities to report or seek help when shelter-in-place requirements demand prolonged cohabitation at home and limit travel outside of the home,"" the researchers explained in the report.

Systems for social distancing with the availability of safe places for people at risk, and social services systems will need to be creative in their approaches to following up on reports of problems, the scientists said.

While providing counselling, and related consultations, the study said, the practice of delivering the most effective, least resource-heavy treatment to patients in need, and then stepping up to more resource-heavy treatment based on patients' needs, is a useful approach.

""Scaling up treatment in the midst of crisis will take creative thinking. Communities and organizations could consider training nontraditional groups to provide psychological first aid, helping teach the lay public to check in with one another and provide support,"" the report noted.

According to the scientists, telemedicine mental health visits, group visits, and delivery of care via technology platforms will be important components of stepped care for both acute crisis management and routine communication.

188,12-4-20,"Jaan bhi, jahan bhi: PM","Modi, CMs on same page on lockdown extension for 2 more weeks with leeway for migrants, farm workers, daily wagers

After a marathon video conference that lasted more than four hours, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Ministers on Saturday agreed to extend lockdown in the country for two more weeks beyond April 14 with a possible relaxation for agriculture, migrant and daily wagers.

Maharashtra and West Bengal Chief Ministers separately announced extension of lockdown in their States till April 30. Odisha and Punjab Chief Ministers have already announced the continuation of lockdown in their respective States.

The Prime Minister, who held the video conference with the Chief Ministers to firm up a decision on extending lockdown to contain any surge in the coronavirus cases, agreed with them that it was important to “balance lives with the livelihood”.

After the video conference, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced his decision to extend the lockdown in the State till April 30. “Maharashtra will continue to be locked down till April 30. The State will show the way to the country even in these tough times,” he said.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also said the State would extend the lockdown till the end of the month and added that educational institutions will remain shut in the State till June 10. “The PM has officially decided to extend lockdown till April 30, we will not differ,” she said. “We will also extend it till April 30 and review closer to that date.”

Both Odisha and Punjab Governments have already extended the lockdown in their States till the end of the month.

Modi discussed with the Chief Ministers exit-plan which sources said would be “gradual” or in a phased-manner. With the harvest season ahead, the agriculturists along with the daily wagers and migrant workers may be given some leeway.

Modi suggested specific measures for agriculture and allied sector, including modification in Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) laws, to facilitate sale of farm produce. Fisheries zone will also be given relaxation during the extension of lockdown after April 14.

The Prime Minister gave a new mantra of “Jaan bhi, jahan bhi” by improvising the popular saying “ Jaan hain to jahan hain.”

Modi said “next two or three weeks are crucial” towards the effective containment of the virus which in last 24 hours has registered a sharp rise of 1,035 cases and 40 deaths in the country.

The Prime Minister said the efforts made by the Centre and the States have definitely helped reduce the impact of Covid-19 but since the situation is rapidly evolving, a constant vigil is of paramount importance. “ Team work is key to facing the challenge”, he said.

It is expected that the Prime Minister may address the nation in a day or two and detail his views on the extension of the lockdown.

While speaking to Chief Ministers, Modi pointed to the importance of Arogya Setu App saying it is essential tool in country’s fight against Covid-19 and can subsequently act as e-pass to facilitate travel.

While focusing on social distancing which remains the main weapon to battle out the coronavirus, the Prime Minister condemned attacks on health professionals and incidents of misbehaviour with students from North-East and Kashmir.

Giving a strong warning against black-marketing and hoarding, he assured the CMs that the country has enough supplies of essential medicines. He talked about strengthening healthcare infrastructure and reaching out to patients through tele-medicines.

This was the third interaction of the Prime Minister with the Chief Ministers after those held on April 2 and March 20.

The Prime Minister was of opinion that the crisis is an opportunity to become self-reliant and turn the country into a “powerhouse”.

All the CMs sought the Prime Minister to extend the lockdown saying that an early ending of it could impact the gains made in last three-weeks in containing the spread of coronavirus in the country.

The interaction was also attended by Union Home, Defence and Health Ministers and Principal Secretary and Cabinet Secretary.

In his discussion with the PM, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal favoured extension of the lockdown till April 30, saying “if the lockdown is eased, all kinds of transport, either rail or road, should not be allowed.”

Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot also argued for extending the lockdown for one fortnight and urged the Centre to provide special concessions for industry and agriculture sectors and faster supply of rapid testing kits. They also said that proper strategies should be made to help farmers in harvesting Rabi crops.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and UP CM Yogi Adityanath have also asked PM Modi for an extension of the lockdown period.

Goa CM Pramod Sawant said he also suggested that the lockdown should be extended but economic activities should continue. “From Monday, OPDs of private and Government hospitals will begin to function. While from today, fisheries activities have started in the State,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jaan-bhi--jahan-bhi--pm-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jaan-bhi--jahan-bhi--pm.html
189,12-4-20,"Sans lockdown, cases would’ve risen to 8.2L by April 15: Centre","8,000 Covid-19 cases, virus has killed over 239 people

The Centre on Saturday claimed that without lockdown and containment measures, the country would have witnessed 8.2 lakh Covid-19 cases by April 15. The figure of positive cases would have gone up to 1.2 lakh with containment measures and no lockdown.

The country is in the third week of the world’s biggest ever lockdown involving 1.3 billion people with nearly 8,000 Covid-19 cases. The virus has killed over 239 people from across the country with Maharashtra topping the list of worst-hit (1,666 cases) and 110 fatality.

Talking to reporters here at a Press briefing, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, reiterated importance of following social distancing measures and containment strategies which he said were like a social vaccination that can help the country from spreading the disease.

“Without these steps, Covid-19 cases could have registered a 41 per cent cumulative increase to 8.2 lakh cases by April 15. With containment measures and no lockdown, it could have gone up to 1.2 lakh till April 15,” said Agarwal, citing a statistical model to capture the projected cases.

He cited example of Agra saying it has emerged as the finest example in best practices in cluster management, where a smart city control room was converted into a war room to fight the outbreak of coronavirus from a person who had returned from Italy on February 25.

In the management plan under slogan “Corona Haarega, Agra Jeetega’’ (coronavirus will lose, Agra will win)”, a framework where all the city authorities coordinated, was deployed for a data-driven active contact screening and isolation of coronavirus cases.

A total of 1,248 teams were deployed, which surveyed over 9.3 lakh population by screening 1.65 lakh households in Agra, the first cluster in India where operations were carried out under containment and rapid emergency response.

In this initiative, the private sector also contributed, and the local authorities maintained the essentials supply chain. Active public-private partnership helped in setting up testing and treatment facilities and isolation centres, said the Health Ministry.

Agra had a total of 38 epicentres of the coronavirus impact were identified, and 10 epicentres have been closed so far.

A total of 4,054 quarantine centres were made functional -- 566 paid institutional quarantine centres, 3,060 free institutional quarantine centres and 428 official quarantine centres. Till April 11 in Agra, 5 cases have recovered and 87 are under watch.

Agarwal said, “Contact tracing began after February 25, after the arrival of a positive person from Italy.

“The authorities tracked his movement in Agra at his residence, at the restaurant he visited and also the factory he had gone to. The district administration identified the epicentre and hotspot and then a cluster containment plan was prepared.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sans-lockdown--cases-would---ve-risen-to-8-2l-by-april-15--centre-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sans-lockdown--cases-would---ve-risen-to-8-2l-by-april-15--centre.html

It has marked a total of 586 hospitals as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals having capacity of over one lakh isolation beds and 11,500 ICU beds.

Similarly, the Indian Railways is transforming up to 20,000 old coaches into emergency care units that can be deployed to remote and hard-hit areas experiencing a shortage of hospital beds.

Emphasising that India has been deploying a graded response to fight coronavirus outbreak, Union Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said on Saturday, “At least 1,00,000 isolation beds and 11,500 ICU beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients across the country. Also, 587 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals have been earmarked at Central and the State levels.

“PPEs, ventilators and other critical medical supplies are being ensured by the Centre to States. The containment action plan, contact tracing and other planning are being ensured,” Agarwal said while talking to reporters here.

While the Government has chalked out three-tier plan to categorise the patients depending on the severity of their infections, private hospitals across India have been asked to designate dedicated wings to treat the affected patients, prepare for sample collection, discharge patients who are stable and divide medical staff into two groups so that even if one group gets infected, the other can work.

The Indian Council Of Medical Research (ICMR) said 1,71,718 samples had been tested. On Friday, 16,564 tests were conducted through a network of Government and private labs.

Maharashtra which reported over 200 cases on Saturday is severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic with total 1,666 cases. With 13 news deaths, the death toll in the State surged to 110. Maharashtra accounts for over 45% of the total coronavirus deaths in the nation.

After Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu confirmed the highest number of Covid-19 patients. As many as 58 people in Tamil Nadu tested positive for the coronavirus in last 24 hours, taking the total tally in the State to 969 while Delhi also witnessed a steep rise in coronavirus patients. The national Capital recorded 166 new cases on Saturday and its total stood at1069.

Kerala, which had reported first coronavirus case in the country, has registered 364 cases while Madhya Pradesh confirmed at least total 678 cases. The death toll in the State stood at 39. Uttar Pradesh confirmed over 400 coronavirus patients.

Andhra Pradesh recorded 405 Covid-19 cases. Gujarat registered 90 fresh cases in last 24 hours, raising the total count in the State to 460. 22 people died in Gujarat since the outbreak emerged.

More than 215 cases have been reported in Karnataka and 224 in Jammu & Kashmir. Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab too reported new cases.

In the meantime, the Union Health Ministry maintained that no community transmission is taking place as yet in India. The World Health Organisation has put India in a category named ‘cluster of cases’.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govts-gird-up-for-covid--586-hospitals--1-lakh-isolation-beds-ready-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govts-gird-up-for-covid--586-hospitals--1-lakh-isolation-beds-ready.html
191,12-4-20,"Parents drive 2,100 km for Shaurya Chakra awardee son’s cremation","Parents of a commando officer awarded with Shaurya Chakra for gallantry had to drive more than 2,100 km from New Delhi to Bengalaru to attend his cremation there on Saturday as red tape between Defence and Home Ministries did not permit them to travel in a service aircraft. This happened despite clearance by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who alone can only authorise airlift for a civilian in a military plane.

The dilly-dallying between the two departments that forced the 70-plus grieving duo to drive all the way from New Delhi to Bengalaru has led to outrage amongst the veterans. They gave vent to their feelings on the social media with former Army Chief General VP Malik tweeting

“Deepest condolences! Have a safe journey. Sad GOI (Government of India) did not help. Rules are never written on stone. They are modified or changed in special circumstances.”

There was a deluge of messages from the former soldiers offering condolences to the father and condemning red tape that came in the way of t giving permission in such exceptional circumstances when there is a lockdown and rail and air travel are closed.

The deceased Special Forces officer Colonel Navjot Singh Bal, 39, died fighting cancer in a military hospital in Bengaluru on April 9. He was awarded Shaurya Chakra, nation’s third highest gallantry medal during peace time, in 2008 for counter-terrorist operations in Jammu & Kashmir. His father Lt Colonel KS Bal is a retired officer from the Garwhal Rifles. The deceased officer is survived by wife and two sons aged 8 and four respectively.

A day before he passed away, the commando officer clicked a selfie from his hospital bed which went viral on social media. He was highly respected in the Army for his leadership abilities. He diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2018, and in 2019 his right hand was amputated to contain the spread. Despite this amputation, Bal led his men in an exercise in Rajasthan last year.

After he succumbed to cancer, his family was given the option to airlift the mortal remains to Delhi to perform the last rites. Bal’s wife and children were in Bengaluru, so his parents wanted to travel there instead, sources said here.

Following this, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reportedly gave the permission to airlift the parents to Bengaluru in a C-17 plane which was on a scheduled flight there after Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat brought the matter to his notice.

However, it was felt that due to the lockdown concurrence of the Home Ministry was needed and the Home Ministry had requisitioned the transport plane. While verbal approval was given by the Home Ministry, some officials in the Defence Ministry insisted on a written approval which Home Ministry officials were not sure they could provide. Bal’s parents had no option but to take the road route.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/parents-drive-2-100-km-for-shaurya-chakra-awardee-son---s-cremation.html

Mostly from Odisha, these workers wanted to be provided logistics for them to return to their native places and disbursal of their unpaid dues. Making a mockery of the lockdown, the workers took to the streets and set ablaze handcarts.

Police have detained around 80 migrant workers. This is the second time that the migrant workers have taken to streets in Surat. On March 30, over 90 migrant labourers were arrested in Surat city for defying the lockdown.

“Hundreds of workers, mostly from Odisha, hit the streets demanding that they should be sent to their native places. They also claimed that the food served to them by an NGO is tasteless and they have to stand in queue to get the meal,” ACP CK Patel said.

“Out of anger, they torched some handcarts and tyres in Laskana area. We have detained 80 migrant workers. Heavy police deployment and strict vigil by the administration has brought the situation under control, he said.

The Surat episode will send alarm bell ringing in other cities also where migrant workers have been staying and are desperate to get back to their homes amid uncertainty about the duration of the lockdown.

""A very high plateau for the epidemic appears to have been reached but the epidemic remains very active,"" he told reporters. ""We must absolutely remain vigilant.""

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.

For the third consecutive day, the number of coronavirus patients in intensive care was down, with 121 fewer people in such units for a total of 6,883.

Salomon said that if the plateau trend continues it means ""we have succeeded in reaching a first step together and the lockdown is showing its first effects.""

But he warned: ""It remains a very high plateau... there are still many hospital admissions... It is far too early -- and not reasonable -- to make predictions about the future.""

French President Emmanuel Macron is due on Monday to address the nation for a third time during the crisis and is expected to announce that the lockdown will be extended beyond its current April 15 expiration date.

But he repeated calls on Iranians to limit movements outside to ""necessary"" tasks and remain vigilant, as it remains difficult to ""comment on the future"" of Iran's battle with the virus.

199,12-4-20,"Virus mutes Easter celebrations as Europe's death toll tops 75,000","Billions around the world celebrated Easter Sunday from lockdown at home as the pope urged solidarity to fight the coronavirus pandemic and the European death toll from the virus topped 75,000.

Unprecedented scenes of empty churches emerged from Italy to Panama and the Philippines, as religious leaders found creative ways to address parishioners marking the holiday weekend from the confines of their homes.

More than half the world -- over four billion people -- are in lockdown worldwide as governments scramble to halt the pandemic's deadly march across the globe.

The death toll from the virus soared past 109,000 this weekend, with more than 1.7 million reported infections globally.

Europe is by far the hardest-hit continent and on Sunday marked a grave milestone with more than 75,000 dead, according to an AFP tally.

The United States was quickly emerging as a hotspot as well, and on Saturday marked its own grim landmark: more than 20,000 dead, out of around half a million infected.

The US now has the highest death toll and the most cases out of any country in the world.

Speaking from a near-empty Saint Paul's Cathedral, Pope Francis' Easter Sunday message was largely focused on the pandemic, offering prayers for the ill and urging a united European front to fight the pandemic.

""For many, this is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorrow and hardship that the pandemic is causing, from physical suffering to economic difficulties,"" he said, in a livestreamed message beamed around the world.

He called for European ""solidarity"" in the face of the virus, adding: ""After the Second World War, this beloved continent was able to rise again."" The pope had earlier urged creativity to mark the holy weekend -- a call that appears to have been met by some of the world's two billion-plus Christians.

In Panama an archbishop blessed his nation from a helicopter, while worshippers in Spain blasted music from their balconies and US President Donald Trump said he would be among those following Easter services online.

In a church north of the Philippines capital Manila, hundreds of pictures of parishioners were taped to pews as a priest held a Sunday service to a near-empty room.

""Those photos are the representations of the people who are watching and attending mass through livestreaming, so we also feel their presence virtually,"" said Father Mark Christopher De Leon.

""This is our way of being with them, praying for them spiritually, praying for them, praying for their safety.""

As virus-tinged Easter celebrations were held worldwide, leaders in some hard-hit countries expressed cautious optimism the number of deaths and infections could be starting to peak.

Spain saw its daily death toll drop for three days straight -- but on Sunday reported a slight spike again with 619 fresh fatalities. And though Italy was nearing the 20,000 dead mark, its daily death toll and rate of new infections has started to level off.

In France, newly reported coronavirus deaths fell by one-third from Friday to 635 on Saturday.

""A very high plateau for the epidemic appears to have been reached, but the epidemic remains very active,"" said French health official Jerome Salomon, urging people to remain vigilant. In the United States, New Orleans and hardest hit New York saw a slowdown in the number of new infections, deaths and hospitalisations, offer a shred of hope.

Trump said this past week that the disease was near its peak in the US and he was considering ways to re-open the world's biggest economy as soon as possible.

""We look like we'll be coming in on the very, very low side, below the lowest side of the curve of death,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News.

In Britain, the death toll continued to mount and fatalities are likely to soon top 10,000.

Virus-stricken Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from hospital Sunday after he was admitted for coronavirus last Sunday, and spent three days in intensive care.

He praised his medical team Sunday before he left hospital. ""I can't thank them enough. I owe them my life,"" said 55-year-old Johnson.

There were worrying signs the virus could be taking hold in new -- and vulnerable -- parts of the world, from the crowded slums of Mexico City, Nairobi and Mumbai to conflict hotspots in the Middle East.

Conflict-wracked Yemen reported its first case last week, sparking dire warnings from aid workers about the burden an outbreak could have on an already ravaged healthcare system.

And in Mumbai's crowded Dharavi slum -- one of Asia's biggest and the inspiration for the 2008 Oscar-winning film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" -- more than 43 cases were confirmed.

All shops, except pharmacies, were closed near so-called ""containment zones"" to limit the number of people in public spaces. ""We have been running extensive medical camps in Dharavi and other areas of Mumbai to test more people for coronavirus and make sure carriers are not ignored just because they don't display symptoms,"" a local official spokesman Khabale-Patil said.

Many experts and the World Health Organization are cautioning countries against lifting lockdown measures too quickly to avoid a second wave of infections.

201,12-4-20,Badshah: Want to make a new song with Ratan Kahar,"Rapper Badshah was caught off guard with the plagiarism accusations against him over his new single ""Genda phool"", with regard to Ratan Kahars Bengali folk song ""Boroloker biti lo"". The rapper wants to set things right by doing a song with the veteran folk artiste to ""do justice to it"".

He also plans to get him registered on the copyright bodies and register all his work, so that he can get royalties.

Living far away from spotlight in poverty-stricken condition in Birbhum district's Siuri town with his family, Kahar found himself in the limelight because of his all-time Bengali folk pop hit ""Boroloker biti lo"", which he created in 1972 -- all thanks to Badshah and the virtual world.

Badshah used portions of the song in his new single, ""Genda phool"". Soon after the song was released, netizens pointed out portions of the song have been lifted from the popular Bangla folk hit of the seventies. Acting swiftly, the rapper reached out to Kahar and deposited Rs 5 lakh to the veteran folk artiste's bank account.

Asked if the controversy caught him off guard, Badshah told IANS: ""Yes, of course, it did. But my team and I had done our complete research on the sample before using the sound, done our due diligence and everywhere it was mentioned as a traditional folk song.""

""There was no existing record on any of the past releases of shri Kahar as the lyricist and which is why we went ahead and used the sound in the first place. However, in a couple of days, we started getting tagged in a lot of articles and posts that suggested otherwise according to just popular belief and still with no documented proof. But when I saw and heard his story, irrespective of the credits, I think he is one of the gems that should have been preserved and taken care of. My team reached out to him through some of the people who had run his story, as I definitely wanted to get him the recognition that he deserves,"" he added.

Badshah continued: ""A lot of work has obviously been difficult because of the current lockdown, but as soon as things are back on track, I intend to visit him and request him to do a song with us that Sony Music India will release and do whatever I can do being from the same fraternity, financially or otherwise. But I really wish and hope that he had been taken care of, being the traditional legacy that he is. I come from Punjab and we really nurture and celebrate our legends here and it was sad to see shri Kahar in a situation that he is right now. Hopefully, this will change things.""

Due to the lockdown, Badshah spoke to him on a video call.

""He is like any of our elders -- lovable and extremely affectionate. He sang a few of his songs for me, blessed me and I have promised him I am going to be seeing him and do whatever I can in my strength to celebrate and take care of his legacy… Make a new song with him and do justice to it. If required, get him registered on the copyright bodies and register his works and whatever else is required for him to receive his royalties. It was sad to see that an artist of his stature has been in such a situation.""

As a ""basic gesture"", Badshah deposited Rs 5 lakh in his account, and wants to do more.

""Once I visit him after the lockdown, I will try and understand exactly where his difficulties are, in health or his children's education, and take necessary measures to help him further. That is the least and a matter of honour and pride, I can do is, from the new generation of musicians for one of our traditional legends of music,"" said the rap star.

Though he started his career in 2006 alongside Yo Yo Honey Singh with band Mafia Mundeer, Badshah has paved a way for himself in the industry by giving chart toppers and party numbers.

When it comes to Bollywood, there's ""Saturday Saturday"", ""Kala chashma"", ""The humma song"", ""Kar gayi chull"", ""Tareefan"" and ""Abhi toh party shuru hui hai"". In the section of non-film chartbusters, there are ""Proper patola"", ""DJ Waley Babu"", ""Mercy"" and ""She move it like"".

As Badshah 2.0, he released ""Genda phool"", the video of which features actress Jacqueline Fernandez. The song, which comes with a Bengali touch, is themed around Durga Pujo, and is directed by Sneha Shetty Kohli. It has got over 150 million views on YouTube.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/badshah--want-to-make-a-new-song-with-ratan-kahar-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/badshah--want-to-make-a-new-song-with-ratan-kahar.html
202,12-4-20,Passengers from virus-stricken ship land in Australia,"More than 100 Australians and New Zealanders landed in Melbourne on Sunday after two weeks stranded aboard a virus-infected cruise ship off Uruguay, officials said.

An unmarked charter plane arrived in the morning at Melbourne's Tullamarine carrying roughly 110 passengers from the Greg Mortimer liner, an AFP photographer saw.

A small group of New Zealanders immediately transferred to a separate charter plane bound for Auckland.

Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed the flight had landed safely, tweeting: ""Thanks to all involved, a very complex undertaking.""

Of the 217 mostly elderly tourists aboard, 128 had tested positive for the novel coronavirus and the ship had been blocked from docking in Montevideo before the Uruguayan and Australian governments reached an agreement to bring them home.

The Australian and New Zealand tourists on the flight included people who tested negative and others confirmed ill with the virus.

The Victoria state health department said unwell Australians and those showing symptoms would be taken to hospitals in Melbourne, while the rest would be transported to a hotel to begin a 14-day quarantine period.

The tourists were on an expedition to Antarctica, South Georgia and Elephant Island when their adventure was called off on March 20 due to the nearest South American countries -- Argentina and Chile -- closing their borders and imposing lockdowns.

The ship travelled to Montevideo as it was the nearest port still open but had been anchored off the coast since March 27.

Five remain in Montevideo hospitals, including two Australians who are in intensive care. Their partners remained on the Greg Mortimer rather than taking the flight.

Flights from Delhi and Peru were also scheduled to land in Melbourne Sunday, with about 1,200 stranded Australian travellers due to return from overseas on the weekend.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/passengers-from-virus-stricken-ship-land-in-australia-2020-04-12.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/passengers-from-virus-stricken-ship-land-in-australia.html
203,12-4-20,"COVID-19 to hit S Asia very hard, likely to wipe out gains made in poverty alleviation:WB","The global coronavirus pandemic will hit South Asia very hard and the significant gains made in poverty alleviation in the region are likely to be wiped out due to the impact of the deadly disease, the World Bank warned on Sunday.

In its twice-a-year regional update, the bank said that South Asian governments must ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage for fast economic recovery.

The latest report 'South Asia Economic Focus' anticipates a sharp economic slump in each of the region's eight countries, caused by halting economic activity, collapsing trade, and greater stress in the financial and banking sectors.

The COVID-19 pandemic will hit South Asia very hard and the significant gains made in poverty alleviation in the region are likely to be wiped out, the report warned.

In this fast-changing and uncertain context, the report for the first time presents a range of forecast, estimating that regional growth will fall to a range between 1.8 and 2.8 per cent in 2020, down from 6.3 per cent projected six months ago.

That would be the region's worst performance in the last 40 years, with temporary contractions in all South Asian countries. In case of prolonged and broad national lockdowns, the report warns of a worst-case scenario in which the entire region would experience a negative growth rate this year.

This deteriorated forecast will linger in 2021, with growth projected to hover between 3.1 and 4.0 per cent, down from the previous 6.7 per cent estimate, it said.

Maldives is expected to be the worst hit along with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, wherein the full range of forecast is in negative territory, said Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region.

The other countries are likely experiencing short term recessions, but the fiscal year growth numbers could be seen positive, he added.

""For example, India we forecast in the baseline growth between 1.5 and 2.8 per cent. In the worst case scenarios, all countries would experience the decline in GDP in their annual growth numbers,"" he said.

""The priority for all South Asian governments is to contain the virus spread and protect their people, especially the poorest who face considerable worse health and economic outcomes,"" said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region.

""The COVID-19 crisis is also an urgent call-to-action moment to pursue innovative policies and jumpstart South Asian economies once the crisis is over. Failure to do so can lead to long-term growth disruptions and reverse hard-won progress in reducing poverty,"" he said.

According to the report, the impact of the pandemic will hit hard low-income people, especially informal workers in the hospitality, retail trade, and transport sectors who have limited or no access to healthcare or social safety nets.

The report notes that the COVID-19 shock will likely reinforce inequality in South Asia.

As played out across the region, the sudden and large-scale loss of low paid work has driven a mass exodus of migrant workers from cities to rural areas, spiking fear that many of them will fall back into poverty, it said.

While there are no signs yet of widespread food shortages, the report warns that a protracted COVID-19 crisis may threaten food security, especially for the most vulnerable.

In the short term, the report recommends preparing weak healthcare systems for greater COVID-19 impacts, as well as providing safety nets and securing access to food, medical supplies, and necessities for the most vulnerable.

To minimise short-term economic pain, the report calls for establishing temporary work programs for unemployed migrant workers, enacting debt relief measures for businesses and individuals, and easing inter-regional customs clearance to speed up import and export of essential goods.

Once lockdown restrictions are loosened, South Asian governments should adopt expansionary fiscal policies combined with monetary stimulus to keep credit flowing in their economies, it said.

Since many South Asian countries have limited fiscal space, these policies should target people worst hit by the freeze on economic activity, it said.

The report urges governments to adopt temporary spending measures and coordinate with international financial partners to avoid unsustainable long-term debt levels and fiscal deficits.

""After tackling the immediate COVID-19 threat, South Asian countries must keep their sovereign debt sustainable through fiscal prudence and debt relief initiatives,"" said Timmer.

""And looking beyond the present crisis, lie great opportunities to expand digital technologies for payment systems and distant learning to unlock remote areas in South Asia,"" said the World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region.

The novel coronavirus which originated from China in December has killed 108,862 people and infected over 1.7 million people globally. The US has the highest number of infections at 529,887, while Italy leads the death toll with 19,468 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Noting that cluster infections have been reported in some parts of the country, Mi urged the public to strengthen protective measures and avoid gatherings, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Trump asserted that situation was improving in places like New York, where there is a drop in new patients. Responding to a question, he said he wanted the country to open up as soon as possible.

However, he has not taken a decision so far, even as some media reports said that he the President was looking for early May.

""I think it's going to be the toughest decision that I've ever made. I really, hopefully that I ever will have to make. But it's certainly the toughest decision that I've ever made. I hope that I'm going to make the right decision,"" Trump said, adding that he will be making a decision reasonably soon.

""We're setting up a council now of some of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field including politics and business and medical. We'll be making that decision fairly soon,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that its investigations have revealed that the president was warned about a potential pandemic but that internal divisions, lack of planning and his faith in his own instincts led to a halting response.

222,12-4-20,Lockdown extended in T'gana till April 30 due to coronavirus outbreak,"The Telangana government on Saturday decided to extend the lockdown in the state till April 30 to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Noting that the state shares a long border with Maharashtra, where the virus spread is rapid, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said tough steps are needed to ensure that Telangana is protected.

The state cabinet decided to continue the lockdown in the state till April 30. It will definitely be implemented in a tough manner, Rao told reporters on Saturday night.

Appealing to the people to cooperate with the government in the fight against the deadly disease, he said there could be a possibility of lifting the lockdown after April 30 in a phased manner if things improve.

If not fully, at least, we may get a situation to lift in a phased manner and move ahead. Therefore, I request all to cooperate, Rao said.

Referring to the concerns of students with regard to annual exams, he said a decision would be taken about class 10 exams, which came to a halt midway.

The cabinet has decided to promote students of class 1 to 9 to the next class, the chief minister said.

According to a media bulletin on COVID-19, two fresh deaths and 16 positive cases were reported in the state on Saturday.

With two fresh deaths, the death toll due to coronavirus rose to 14 in the state.

The number of active positive cases in the state mounted to 393 after the addition of 16 new cases on Saturday, the bulletin said.

Fifty-one people were cured/discharged from hospitals on Saturday. With this, the number of people discharged went up to 96.

Observing that there is a fall in revenues of both the state and central governments against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, Rao said a policy of Quantitative Easing (QE), which is followed all over the world, is the only way to deal with the situation.

Explaining the issue, he said if funds are pumped into the society, there is a possibility of getting some relief and reviving the system.

There are demands made to the government for support from different sections, he said.

Rao said he explained the issue in detail to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a video conference.

During the lockdown, the chief minister said the food processing industry should be allowed to function to ensure that farmers are not put to losses and that there was no difficulty in supply of essential commodities, an official release, issued earlier in the day, quoted him as saying.

Rao also urged Modi to increase the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management) limit to five per cent from the existing three.

He suggested that a task force with the prime minister as chairman and cabinet ministers as members be set up to come out with an action plan on helping farmers and the policy to be implemented on the economic situation.

""To counter (economic crisis) this we need a strategic economic policy. RBI should implement quantitative easing policy. This is called Helicopter Money. This will facilitate the states and financial institutions to accrue funds. We can come out of the financial crisis. Release 5 percent of funds from the GDP through Quantitative easing Policy, he suggested.

Bring a policy by which farmers would pay half the wages for labourers and the other half would be from the MGNREGA funds. With this, we will be able to support farmers during difficult times, he said.
