0,08-2-20,The flaming forests,"Forest fires are a growing challenge facing not just India but nations across the world. A vigorous and carefully laid-out approach is needed to contain their prevalence

The Minister of State in the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Babul Supriyo, while replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha on February 3, 2020, said that forest fires affected 93,273 hectares in India in 2019. His statement once again underlined the extent of destruction that forest fires cause in the country, which loses Rs 1,176 crore a year to these disasters. Worse, their incidence is increasing. According to Kiran Pande in an article in the Down To Earth magazine (February 27, 2019), these increased by 125 per cent between 2015 and 2017. Their number shot up from 4,225 to 14,107 between November 2018 and February 2019.

Forest fires devastate large tracts in many States, including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south, and Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh in the north and several others in the Northeast. These, according to Pande’s article, accounted for 209 out of the 558 fires in India between January 1 and February 26, 2019. This is worrisome. In a wider panorama, India alone does not suffer from forest fires. Australia, Brazil, the US and Canada were among other countries affected last year. Australia, where these continued to burn into this year, has clearly been the worst sufferer. As of January 12, 11 million hectares were burnt, 2,200 homes destroyed and 29 people killed. At least a billion animals and birds are estimated to have perished so far. The actual number may turn out to be even higher. The estimates did not take into account bats, frogs and invertebrates like insects, worms and spiders. The number may reach trillions if these are counted.

Species that have been particularly affected include the long-footed potoroo, a marsupial of the kangaroo family, the black-tailed antechinus and the silver-headed antechinus. According to estimates, over 80,000 koalas have been lost. The vulnerable Richmond birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera richmondia) and many species of peacock spiders are among those that might have been badly impacted. Many threatened and vulnerable species have had their habitats destroyed. These include the glossy back-cockatoo, Kangaroo Island dunnart, Hastings River mouse, regent honey-eater, Blue Mountain water skink, bush-tailed rock wallaby, southern corroboree frog, quokkas, western ground parrot, northern eastern bristlebird and the greater glider.

Loss or serious reduction of their habitats may lead to the extinction of species, particularly endangered ones, which have adapted themselves to specific eco-systems and come to depend on particular types of vegetation or pollinators. Australia, it is feared, may not recover anything like the diverse wildlife population it had before the latest round of fires started. Worse, many of the potentially lost species are found only in Australia and become extinct worldwide. Besides, the forest-related segment of the economy has been hit. For example, the species of bees used by the bee-keeping industry, located on the eastern coast, have been killed or had their habitats destroyed, seriously affecting the industry’s future.

Perhaps no other country has suffered as much from forest fires as Australia. In the US, California is perhaps the State that suffers most on an increasing gradient. Things were, doubtless, better in 2019 than in 2018. In late October last year, however, forest fires forced 200,000 people to leave their homes and led to the declaration of an emergency. The period from January 1 to November 22, 2019, witnessed 46,706 wildfires compared with 52,080 in the corresponding period in 2018. About 4.6 million acres perished in the fire in the 2019 period, compared with 8.5 million acres in 2018. Towns, property and houses have been destroyed and people killed.

It is a different story in Brazil. The Amazon rain forests in the country, the largest of their kind in the world, play a critical role in the fight against climate change because of the vast amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide it absorbs. Unfortunately, the number of fires rose from 68,345 in 2018 to 89,178 in 2019, an increase of 30.5 per cent, causing global concern.

Roughly 8,000 forest fires occur each year in Canada, burning, on an average, 2.5 million hectares a year. Densely-forested areas across much of the country are vulnerable and fires are known to have devastated towns, buildings and infrastructure besides killing people.

Forest fires are bound to increase in number, intensity and spread as climate change gathers further momentum. The contribution of climate change becomes clear on recalling that across the whole of Australia, 2019 was the hottest and driest year ever. It witnessed the continuation of drought that had hit the country in 2018. It became particularly hot towards the end of 2019, creating dry conditions in which a lightning strike could start a major conflagration. In Canada, where climate change has been cited as a cause, 45 per cent of all forest fires, accounting for 81 per cent of the total area affected, are started by lighting strikes. The debate over the causes of the California fires has also pointed to climate change as an important cause.

Human activity has also accounted for a lot. According to India’s State of Forest Report 2017, people set fire to forests for, among other reasons, clearing areas for shifting cultivation, non-timber forest produce collection and for hunting/poaching purposes. Another reason is making room for growing towns and villages. Humans are responsible for 90 per cent of forest fires in the US, according to the latter’s Department of Interior. Campfires left burning, the burning of debris, downed power lines, unextinguished cigarettes and deliberate incendiarism are among the causes. In Australia, the New South Wales police have charged at least 24 people with deliberately starting bush fires and 183 people of offences relating to the fires since November 2019. In Brazil, farmers and ranchers have been setting large tracts of the Amazon rain forests aflame while the Government is accused of being either indifferent or not encouraging enough.

Of course, this cannot be said of all Governments. The State Government of California has been active in combating forest fires. The Australian Government has been accused of waking up too late. Nevertheless, it has sprung to action and announced, among other steps, $50 million to rescue and protect wildlife affected by the fires. Unfortunately, nearly 24 per cent of the meagre fund of Rs 50 crore awarded for forest fire prevention were not spent in India during the last two financial years. We need a more vigorous and carefully laid-out approach to containing forest fires.

1,08-2-20,Abrogate leaders,"Booking Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti under the draconian PSA Act might just boomerang on the Govt

When the Prime Minister makes a statement in Parliament condemning protests and dissent as anti-national, Opposition critique as sedition and those with an alternative viewpoint as traitorous, like the tukde tukde gang, then he has, in a single blow, legitimised autocracy as the only mantra of his regime. And by extension, viciousness and vindictiveness its only practice. Going by Narendra Modi’s blustering speech in the House, which went beyond his pet pillar of anti-Congressism and subverted democratic convention by equating any sort of divergence with a threat to nation-building, he has codified new rules of statecraft. Or perhaps we should call it stagecraft, a demagoguery so virulent and Orwellian that it blinds truth and coopts blind faith in its place. And puts a wilted Opposition in its place. This then is going to be the discourse of our times, total subservience, wimpy acquiescence or nothing. And coming from the highest executive post of the land, both the Opposition parties and citizenry have been warned. Little wonder then that the examples quickly followed. Soon after Modi, while defending the abrogation of Article 370 in the House, lambasted how political leaders in Kashmir had said it would lead to turmoil and secessionism, the dreaded Public Safety Act (PSA) was slapped upon detained political leaders. That included two former Chief Ministers and one-time allies of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti. The 82-year-old ailing NC chief Farooq Abdullah has already been booked under PSA. If the Government indeed wants to make an example of Kashmiri politicians, some of whom have traded loyalties on either side of the LoC for their political continuity, then it would be advised to expose such deliberate acts on facts. Apart from opposing Article 370 and saying its scrapping would not be accepted by Kashmiris — an observation made by countless observers and analysts — there is nothing which was inflammatory, going by their recorded statements. Besides, the Government must realise their detention can only give them some political relevance and victimhood as most Kashmiris had believed both the Abdullahs and Mehbooba had shortchanged their interests by siding with New Delhi’s concerns. The Modi Government has to then answer if its predecessor, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime, was wrong or unreasonable in trusting moderates like Omar Abdullah as a bridge to the people. One cannot ignore that through the decades of conflict, mainstream parties in the Valley acted as a filter, kept militancy in check and gave some semblance of credibility to the election process. Can former Chief Ministers, democratically elected and for years nurtured as assets by the Centre, be disowned as troublemakers under a draconian law? One which makes them look as bad as terrorists? Particularly, Farooq and Omar, who have sworn by the Constitution and neutralised cries of azaadi. Post-reorganisation as a Union Territory and with a militaristic lockdown, Kashmir may be numb but could be brewing a generation with a more subterranean and sharper form of resentment. One cannot begin to imagine how that would manifest itself. The bearded forbearance of Omar — as his pictures went viral — may prove counter-productive for propaganda. Instead of scrapping his political career, it might just end up relighting it.

Dangerously enough, the justification for holding him, when civic rights have also been frozen, makes little political sense. If the government is not even able to restore normal lives despite its heavy-duty security presence, crackdowns and an information blockade, then there will only be a flood of questions on its intent to engage with people or convince them of their stakeholdership. For that to happen, people must be heard and allowed to speak. Coming at a time, when even the US is concerned about continued detentions of political leaders and rights denial in Kashmir, the Government is clearly sending out the message that it won’t be reactive to opinion of any kind, international or national. Neither is it worried about the lack of political will to pursue real concerns of people, except extending branches of Central schemes as the panacea for upending a people’s emotion and dignity. The Abdullahs may be a spent force but Kashmiris who had invested in the idea of India at their call will only see this as betrayal. Conformism was a long shot anyway, it will be a mirage now.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/abrogate-leaders-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/abrogate-leaders.html
2,08-2-20,Destroying Delhi’s dil,"Citizens are as much stakeholders in Rajpath’s redevelopment as the Govt. Why the secrecy then?

Every city has a character and aesthetics that are unique to it and which the citizenry is proud of. Delhi is defined by its rich cultural heritage, the centrepiece of which is Lutyens’ Delhi and the Central Vista. For many generations of Delhiites, this 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South Block up to India Gate is Dilli ka dil. It is their heritage, their pride and holds a host of memories. It is bad enough that the Union Government has decided to redevelop the iconic Central Vista and is planning to change Delhi’s skyline. But why is it not giving heed to the protests and objections being raised by Delhiites and people around the country over this erasure of history? Because erasure of heritage it is, as the redevelopment could mean the loss of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, the National Museum and the National Archives. Ever since the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) made the proposal to change land use of the Central Vista public in December and asked people in the “spirit of fairness” to “state their opinions” on the issue, over 2,000 people, both from within and outside Delhi, have written to the DDA opposing the proposed move on many counts.

Not only do Delhiites see this as a bid to grab their public space, they are also worried by the prospect of the loss of stretches of water bodies, fountains and evergreen trees. In the absence of any official clarity on the height of the new structures, there will be environmental consequences as covering up large open spaces will mean that the ground water charging will be impeded. There could be a potential loss of the micro-climate that the Central Vista and Lutyens’ zone constitute in arid Delhi. Why did the DDA, which published a notification in newspapers on February 5 regarding a public hearing on the proposed land use changes, give just a two-day notice on something as monumental as this? Also, it did not invite all those who wrote letters opposing the move and selectively sent it to just 1292 people. It also asked the invitees to place their comments within nine hours over a period of two days, effectively giving them a paltry 2.5 minutes to put their point across. Plus the media was barred from the meeting and those present there were not allowed to record it. The Rajpath has been our ceremonial pivot. Attempting to change it for no pressing reason, therefore, is like marginalising and eroding its place-based identity. Simply because of its historicity as a power statement. One that the current regime wants to overlay by force.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/destroying-delhi---s-dil-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/destroying-delhi---s-dil.html
3,08-2-20,Learn from Assam mistakes,"In the context of determination of illegal migrants, sane decision-making and using the proportionality principle will help policymakers

Though the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) and the protests surrounding it have been highly politicised, the fact remains that the leaders involved in amending the Act have not made any effort to reach out to the people. However, the same leaders can be seen on national television channels emphasising the need to educate the people about the CAA and explain the rationality of the Act to them in simple words. Like the ruling party, many of us do believe that though our population of billions is like an ocean, we still need immigration regulations — Acts, manuals, a quota system and a futuristic system that handles work permits. These can be designed to discourage (or even encourage) the inflow of un/skilled or un/qualified people into the world’s largest democracy, like many other nations across the globe do, keeping the balances of a democracy intact. Knowing the size of the population that has to be combed to arrive at the right numbers, the diversity of it and the fact that so far nothing has been achieved in this sphere, the task is vast and unique. The Assam experience of 30-odd years, dealing with this very issue, needs to be analysed and drawn from.

The Foreigners’ Act, 1941 as enforced in Assam in 2005 — following the failure of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 — but applicable to the whole nation, is an ambitious one and has been amended recently in 2019 keeping in mind bigger strategic plans around it. This amendment empowers District Magistrates to form Foreigners’ Tribunals (quasi-judicial courts) in every nook and corner of the country as required, where the accused foreigners are to be tried and either acquitted as an authorised resident or pronounced guilty and thereby put in deportation camps. The process of arriving at the size of the migrant numbers and composition, which is the basic requirement for implementing the Assam Accord, took more than three decades in a single State with a poor outcome as reflected in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) numbers last year. This holds testimony to the intricacy and nuances of the process, for anything similar implemented in the whole country.

While setting forth on the task of identifying reliable data sources for number assessment, we must remember that New Delhi shares no deportation treaty with Dhaka, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the Indian Government can detect-delete and deport immigrants of any specific category it wishes to.

Unlike a few developed nations like the USA, neither does India have any third-party deportation deal with any country, as New Delhi is yet to find a Hondura or Salvador (countries of the Northern Triangle of Central America) who had agreed to be illegal migrant deportation destinations.

Political analysts will agree that besides focussing on identifying illegal migrants, we need to have standard procedures for handling the accused in alignment with the International Human Rights norms. Regarding the extraction of meaningful data for the process, this also needs to conform to international data regulation norms as all these measures would help us avoid human rights violations during the process, as well as maintain the international image India has built over the years.

The best the state can do with the identified illegal migrants after a successful operation is to expel them from electoral rolls or land ownership rolls, creating a cohort of “stateless people.” This, in turn, may put India in the same bucket of countries like Estonia, Kuwait, Latvia, Myanmar, Russia, Syria, Thailand and Uzbekistan, in the context of global statelessness.

The identification of illegal migrants in Assam was mostly done on the basis of suspicion, based on their general demeanour, poverty, illiteracy, existence in groups, certain ways of dressing, food habits and their typical accents.

The Assam Police Border Organisation, (a wing of the State police) tasked with detecting foreigners, identified and readied the cases for the Foreigners’ Tribunal courts to decide who was an illegal migrant and who was not. Allegations exist that the Government gave the border police a monthly target to detect people of suspect citizenship and refer them to the tribunals.

Documentary proof of citizenship by blood as recognised by the Indian Constitution was a hard task in an overtly illiterate population of migrants who are subject to rapid dislocations and displacements due to economic reasons and the yearly floods that inundated their huts and shanties by the bank of the Brahmaputra river and in marshy forest areas, yards away from herds of rhinos and buffaloes.

The last decade saw people lining up in front of Government offices to submit documents with mud and water marks, that they could hardly read, related to birth, land ownership and education certificates. Many of them, who didn’t have any documents for proof of the years they had spent in the region, sat slapping their foreheads, many lied and some of them resorted to declaring/creating false connections to citizens picked out from the legacy data (digitised data with the Assam Government drawn from the 1951 census and voter list of 1971 used for data verification) that the authorities used.

For example, dozens of young people claimed to be the children of the same father or mother who was already part of the legacy database, so that they could get counted in.

To combat fraud of this kind and identity thefts, officials started going over family trees of two generations of each applicant to corroborate information about parents and siblings. This data collection is closest to ethno survey designs for illegal migrant determination for suspected Mexican immigrants in the US, which sorted the suspected migrants to detect the ones most likely to be unauthorised by looking at where they were born, when they came to India, how old they were, how they were related to other people in their households, what kind of jobs they had, what kind of income and whether they were getting Government benefits, among other factors.

The result of this process, spanning decades, was that a few people declared as foreigners were the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate and the most hapless ones, who couldn’t have managed or manipulated fraudulent documents or a good lawyer to fight their cases. If we plan to attempt to “cleanse” the rest of the country of such people, the process must be with a clear roadmap and strategy so as to avoid starting the engines of another chaos machine.

Many in the State maintain that foreigners’ cases have assumed the form of a money-making industry and graft mushroomed all over the State, that indulged in turning Indians into foreigners and foreigners into Indians on the basis of fake documents. A few months ago, the All-Assam Minority Students’ Union claimed that the border police and tribunals were “foreigner-making factories” and “officials have orders to harass the religious and linguistic minorities.”

In the context of illegal migrants’ determination, sane decision-making and using the proportionality principle will help policymakers. Healthcare professionals often are confronted with the task of assessing the benefits or harm of procedures or treatments to be done on a significantly-ill patient where there’s a direct application of this principle.

The treating doctor needs to decide whether a procedure/treatment would be beneficial to the patient and hereby decide to do it, or the patient is better off without it for his overall health and well-being. Finding the precise therapy is the overriding goal of medicine and these I believe are very pertinent thoughts applicable to this scenario in our country around the illegal immigrants’ issue. Rapid succession of “addressing and resolving” of one critical issue after another even before the issues (the Jammu and Kasmir issue being the predominant one) have actually settled and normalised in a background of economic lassitude, is leaving the masses shocked and wide-eyed.

4,08-2-20,Harness IQ for sustainability,"Education to develop human capital could act as a key catalyst in climate change adaptation

Careful and deep thought would definitely enable us to answer why some nations have higher environmental sustainability than others. So far, most of the researches have linked the concept of climatic sustainability with economic growth and income level with the recent ones to globalisation, democracy and the quality of institutions. Though the integral connect between the role of human behaviour and the status of sustainability dates back to 1927, no pertinent successful attempt is available to investigate international variations on environmental issues. On global platforms, this issue is debated quite enormously due to the paucity of any universal benchmark that could depict climatic quality per se. The current literature directs usage of carbon emissions, deforestation and ecological footprint as the often-used proxies to quantify climatic deterioration that may serve satisfactory yardsticks, not the sufficient ones for sure.

What remains missing includes various aspects of ecological change i.e. ecosystem protection, resource management and environmental health, all of which have led to the confinement of a topic of such major concern to philosophy and theory. In 2000, the World Bank proposed “genuine savings” (GS) as an appropriate proxy for environmental progress, where the GS rate is estimated as gross domestic savings adjusted for the depletion of natural capital, investments in human skills and depreciation of physical capital. If the GS remains negative for a long period of time, the economy is termed to be unsustainable. Additionally, intelligence is productively combined with economic growth, human capital, health, corruption and the shadow economy till now whereas the influence of intelligence on climate at the macro-level has yet to gain the required attention among academicians.

To overcome the above shortcomings, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) given by the Yale Centre for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University in 2002 is believed to be a much better composite indicator to evaluate comprehensive progress toward ecological sustainability. The EPI addresses the methodological shortcomings of the GS and consolidates 20 indicators in two core policy domains: Protection of human health from environmental damage and protection of the ecosystem.

Further, as per one of the economic theories, intelligent economic agents are more likely to neglect the consumption of natural capital today for higher levels of welfare in the next period. All the economists today have established that externalities (free-rider issues) and public goods are the leading causes of market failure, holding the utmost level of relevance of environmental economics.

As per current researches, it is empirically established that intelligence (in general, proxied by intelligence quotient scores given by Lynn and Vanhanen) may mitigate environmental market failures via social capital as an important aspect of enhancing the attitude of society towards the management of natural wealth. Rather some of the laureates have argued that the social capital is presented as feedback, playing the role of a homeostatic mechanism of keeping the sustainability of economic systems in dynamics. Also, while higher levels of social networks lead to considerable welfare gains for society, there is evidence that intelligence is associated with interpersonal trust and social interconnections that are instrumental in enhancing capacities to solve environmental problems. Moreover, intelligence is negatively correlated with authoritarian regimes since authoritarian systems lack the motivation to adopt environmental policies.

Much said and done, undoubtedly, higher cognitive development scores of nations may converge to aid the better climatic health of a country; of course, after controlling other macroeconomic disruptions that may arise due to variations in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population growth and democracy levels. The impact may remain heterogeneous across nations and groups depending upon the associated stage of development.

Indeed, current studies indicate that educated economic agents are better aware of long-term negative externalities of environmental degradation. The involvement of intelligence may for the time-being provide short-lived happiness by shifting the focus from economic growth (that has historically proved detrimental for environmental sustainability especially in the case of emerging/developing nations). Nonetheless, education to develop human capital could act as a key catalyst in climate change adaptation. Education does more to reduce deaths from climate-related disasters than economic growth as per one of the recent research findings. Education can also deliver the scientific facts about the biggest issue facing young people, something that is being felt by millions worldwide. It equips the youth with the skills to help combat climate change and be part of a green, recovering and positive future. Lastly, the foundation of tomorrow shall positively be laid today.

After the success of the 11th DefExpo 2020, the Uttar Pradesh government is set to organise two more big events this month — the laying of foundation stones of Bundelkhand Expressway by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and induction of HAL-made Dornier aircraft for intra-state air connectivity..

Announcing this, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the state government would launch UDYAN scheme in which two Dornier aircraft of HAL would be used for civil aviation.

“With this aircraft, we will try to connect smaller cities and increase the flights gradually,” he said

Besides, the prime minister would lay the foundation stone of the ambitious Bundelkhand Expressway at Jhansi on February 29, which will be the main groundbreaking ceremony of the defence manufacturing corridor in the state.

“Once this expressway is complete, it is bound to change the face of Bundelkhand region,” the chief minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pm-to-lay-stone-of-bundelkhand-e-way-on-feb-29.html
6,08-2-20,Indian defence exports to be USD 5 bn by 2024: Rajnath,"





|

Marching ahead to fulfill the promise of achieving USD 5 billion defence export target by 2024, over 200 partnerships were formed with the signing of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs), Transfer of Technology and product launches on the third day of DefExpo 2020 at a ceremony coined ‘Bandhan’ in Lucknow on Friday.

“The pacts, aimed at forging and renewing partnerships for innovative collaboration and transformation of defence manufacturing in the country, were inked by representatives of public sector companies, Indian private defence firms and foreign companies. The signing of MoUs is a step in the direction to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s $5 billion defence exports target in the next four years,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said.

The MoUs were signed in the presence of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Among the MoUs signed, 23 were by the Uttar Pradesh government.

“The defence PSUs and Indian defence private industry are better placed today to lead India as the emerging global R&D hub. Liberalised licensing regime brought out by the government would surely attract large investments by both Indian and global companies,” Singh said.

“The MoUs signed by us today will strengthen defence industrial base and benefit the country. You all must be convinced that our policy in defence sector has started yielding results,” the defence minister said.

Singh added, “In 2018-19, defence export stood at Rs 10,745 crore, which was seven times the export in 2016-17. By the success of the DefExpo, I am sure that by 2024, we will achieve the target of five billion dollar of defence exports.”

The defence minister said that Bandhan meant ‘tie’ and he was of the firm view that the alliance between companies or the government would continue.

Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said that DefExpo 2020 would be remembered for many firsts.

“This includes signing of the largest number of MoUs, ToTs and product launches. The Bandhan ceremony witnessed more than 13 product launches, signing of 124 MoUs between DPSUs, private and global defence manufacturing companies,” he said.

Defence Research and Development Organisation Chairman Sateesh Reddy said that it was DRDO’s duty to ensure that the defence manufacturing corridor in UP flourished and hence it signed a technological partnership agreement with UP government to impart skill training, hand-holding and providing guidance in all aspects of technology.

“A collaboration cell was already set up in the state to facilitate the process. A research and development centre would be set up in UP which would act as a catalyst for defence development. Technology transfer was made available at no cost to companies in order to further the defence ecosystem in India,” Reddy said.

During the ceremony, a major announcement in the form of issuing Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) certificate of Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) was issued to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).

The LUH has been designed and developed as a replacement for Cheetah and Chetak helicopters, currently being operated by Indian armed forces.

The LUH is a new generation helicopter in the 3-Ton class incorporating the state-of-the-art technology features to meet emerging needs in this class of helicopters in coming decades.

OFB launched ‘Sharang’ , a 155mm artillery gun with 36 km range and handed over a model to Chief of Army Staff, Gen MM Naravane.

The OFB also launched JVPC Alpha gun with 100 mt range, light machine gun of 800 mt range and UBGL (under barrel grenade launcher.)

The BDL launched Amogha-3 anti-tank guided missile. It is a man portable fire and forget missile.

7,08-2-20,DefExpo showcased possibilities in UP: Yogi,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that by successfully organising DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh had made the country and the world aware of new possibilities as the government signed 23 MoUs worth Rs 50,000 crores through UPEIDA that would generate employment opportunities for over 2.5 lakh youth.

“Through this international event, we have showcased the possibilities available in Uttar Pradesh. In 2018, we organised Investors’ Summit and invited people to invest money in the state,” Yogi said during an interaction with media persons in Lucknow on Friday.

The chief minister said that during the last two-and half years, his government was successful in getting investments of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crores in the state, that would help in providing jobs to over 33 lakh people.

Yogi said that during the last two years, efforts were made to organise various programmes related to defence manufacturing corridor with the Defence Ministry. “We are doing this as large industries, small-scale and micro industries are also engaged in defence production in UP. “We have not only formulated a Defence Aerospace Policy in the state but have also prepared a policy on different focus centres in the state and increased possibilities of investment,” he said.

The chief minister said that out of the six nodes of the defence manufacturing corridor, the land banks at Aligarh and Jhansi had been booked.

“Now we have lands available in four nodes. We will build industrial clusters along Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and Ganga Expressway,” he said.

Yogi further said that the government had already made a 12,500-acre land bank for defence manufacturing corridor and in the next two years, the land bank would increase to 25,000 acres.

“Air connectivity has increased in UP. In 2017, there were two airports and now we have six operational airports in the state and work is underway on 11 others. Besides, an international airport is coming up at Jewar and hence connectivity will not be an issue in the state any more,” Yogi said.

The chief minister said that people were now willing to invest in UP as there was improvement in law and order and the government was in the working mode.

“We have single window problem redressal system which is providing an environment to industrialists to invest in UP,” he added.

10,08-2-20,"‘NYK should become pivot of youth thinking, their hopes’","Chief Minister Kamal Nath has said that Nehru Yuva Kendra should become the pivot of youth thinking, their hopes and expectations. He said that previously, the youth worked in the fields but today's youths are educated. We have to identify these changes and work towards creating a Nehru Yuva Kendra of 2020.

Nath said that for this, the Youth Centre should prepare an action plan which can be effectively implemented throughout the region with the help of the State Government. The Chief Minister was addressing a meeting of the State Level Youth Programme Advisory Committee of Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan in Mantralaya. Chief Secretary SR Mohanty was present at the meeting.

The Chief Minister said that when Nehru Yuva Kendra was formed in 1972, our goal was to give a constructive direction to the youth power by linking it with the Constitution, country building, culture, civilization and social values. Kamal Nath said that today, we need to evaluate how much success we have achieved in this. He said that today we have to lay down the infrastructure and process of the Nehru Yuva Kendra as per these goals as well as the changes in the mindset of the youth. The Chief Minister said that the youth should face the challenges that are there today.

“We have to develop such thinking within the youth that with Gandhiji's ideals and principles, they should recognise the greatness of the land of unity in diversity and contribute towards it.

He said that it is the first responsibility of the Nehru Yuva Kendra to retain our social values with pluralistic culture, religion, mutual love and harmony.

The Chief Minister said that the Nehru Yuva Kendra should not be mere museums, following the old path, but they should energise the youth so that they use their power to protect the future of the country.

Nath said, 'I have a strong link with Nehru Yuva Kendra. I want it to be a representative organisation of youth and its role to be effective.” He said that the organisation should prepare an action plan for coordination with sports, youth welfare and concerned departments of the State Government along with its routine activities.

The Chief Minister felicitated the youth and the organization who excelled in various activities conducted by Nehru Yuva Kendra. One lakh award of state level youth division was awarded to village Bahuti of Rewa District. In Swachhta Abhiyan Manju Rathore, Anuppur, was given the first prize of 50,000, Ramvan Raamayanai Mandal Betul, 30,000 second and Fragrance Narayani Shahdol was given third prize of 20,000 rupees.

11,08-2-20,‘Bhola’ staged at Shaheed Bhavan auditorium,"A Hindi play “Bhola” was staged at Shaheed Bhavan auditorium here on Friday.

The misfortune, a burglar faced when he went to rob a Minister’s house, unknown to him was a web of situations in which he got caught.

Directed by Mridula Bharadwaj, the play marked the conclusion of 14th Bhopal Rang Utsav. The play was performed by the artists of Trikarshi Theatre Troupe.

Based on the Italian play The Virtuous Burglar by Dario Fo, the 1 hour 30 minute play was all about a whirl of laughter. It is a satirical play in which a burglar who is in the act of burgling the house is interrupted by the arrival of a couple who are in fact having an affair.

The farcical complications that ensue also involve the arrival of the burglar's wife. In the end, as they are all arguing among themselves, yet another burglar arrives to burgle the flat.

The play begins with a burglar breaking into a luxury flat. His wife phones him and he is annoyed.

As he hangs up, the owner of the house who is a minister and a woman turn up. The burglar hides inside. The owner and the woman are having an affair.

Later, various incidents took place on stage that created great confusion. Suddenly, the owner's wife turns up.

The owner takes the gun and forces the burglar to pretend to be the woman's husband. The comedy ensues when another man, who is owner’s wife’s boyfriend appears in the scene.

In all of this Bhola gets caught as everone in urge of saving one another blames Bhola for their situation. But in the end, Bhola and his wife were successful to escape from there.

With various twists and turns, the play managed to capture the attention of the audience. The play was well presented on stage.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---bhola----staged-at-shaheed-bhavan-auditorium.html
12,08-2-20,Mission to accelerate SDG implementation,"Taking advantage of the platform provided by Mission Indradhanush and the Intensified Mission Indradhanush, a local area development approach will promote integration and inclusion of the most vulnerable, as mandated for sustainable development

There are several laurels in the basket of public health that India has achieved recently. We eradicated polio in 2014 and were successful in maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination (MNTE) a year later, two monumental achievements in consecutive years. Also, in a relatively short span of time, India has witnessed introduction of four new vaccines: Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Rota Virus Vaccine, Inactivated Polio Vaccine and Measles-Rubella vaccine.

To further ensure that we go beyond the 65 per cent full immunisation coverage (FIC), as in 2013, which potentially left out as many as nine million children and pregnant women from the ambit of routine immunisation (RI), a focussed Mission Indradhanush was launched on December 25, 2014 to cover all neglected and partially immunised children and pregnant women.

These were largely the marginalised communities concentrated in deprived areas such as urban slums, unsettled populations, construction sites, riverbed mining sites, brick-kilns, forest and tribal populations, areas with low RI coverage and pockets with measles/vaccine preventable disease outbreaks. They were also the areas with vacant sub-centers (where primary health workers were not posted or were on long leave) and small villages, hamlets, remote villages/clusters that did not have independent RI sessions.

Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) followed in 2017 to give a further fillip and fill in the missing gaps. These focussed programmes with sturdy implementation and monitoring frameworks have indeed yielded a significant improvement in FIC of approximately five-six per cent annually, compared to one per cent yearly increase during the pre-2013 period. Currently, IMI 2.0 version is being rolled out in 272 districts of 29 States, besides 650 blocks in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from December 2, 2019 with four rounds planned till March 2020.

As Mission Indradhanush celebrated its fifth anniversary on December 25, maybe it is time to look at this strategy as a model of development which goes beyond an isolated strategy to improve maternal and child vaccination. When we analyse the areas of low immunisation coverage, we realise that these are typically the homes and communities which not only are excluded from the RI ambit but are also ridden with multi-dimensional developmental deprivations.

They would, in all probability, have poor hygiene and sanitation; lack of safe drinking water; safe housing; quality education; poor nutrition; a high disease burden and lack of access to quality healthcare, besides having very little access to employment opportunities. These would also be homes suffering from social-economic-cultural disabilities and, being on the margins of communities, they do not have easy access to various developmental and social security services. Such communities, with missed children and pregnant women from the vaccination ambit are now being used to provide the underlying blueprint for expanding the immunisation coverage.

However, the beneficiaries of Mission Indradhanush are also the proxy markers for providing a bouquet of multiple services, beyond vaccination and public health. In essence, we are moving from merely vaccines to public health onto a focussed point-of-care model of taking development to the doorstep of marginalised communities and deprived areas which probably deserve it the most.

Having earmarked such areas in each district by using the vaccination coverage as a proxy marker, we could saturate them with an expanded basket of services beyond public health. National and State Governments can roll out the schemes targetting multi-dimension poverty by creating an expanded basket of services from the schemes around agriculture, horticulture, rural development and employment-generation, skills development, social protection, financial inclusion, welfare services, nutrition, water and sanitation, education, healthcare, housing, rural roads, and so on, for the earmarked areas of multiple deprivations.

This convergent local area development approach, or a 3D model (expansion of-services, coverage, and finances/funds) as it were, could contribute effectively towards multisectoral and sustainable outcomes by bringing together different vertical ministries and departments on one platform. Taking a leaf from our successes in public health programmes, just as there has been focussed implementation and monitoring of national programmes such as eradication of polio, MNTE, Mission Indradhanush and so on, we even for the other developmental schemes, need to formulate local area micro-plans with an expanded basket of services for implementation under the direct supervision of District Magistrates/Collectors with close monitoring, using robust monitoring tools for improved outcomes.

What also rhymes across in this strategy is that health and well-being are placed almost as a fulcrum in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The health goal (SDG-3) is broad: “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”

In addition, health is also framed as a contributor to and beneficiary of sustainable development. However, what is also widely acknowledged is that SDG-3 being inter-linked with other goals, achieving its targets will also depend on the progress made in other SDGs related to poverty reduction; education; nutrition; gender equality; clean water and sanitation, sustainable energy and safer cities and housing.

Taking advantage of the platform provided by Mission Indradhanush and IMI, this local area development approach will not only promote integration and inclusion of the most vulnerable, as mandated for sustainable development, but will surely fast-track achieving SDGs by 2030.

13,08-2-20,Better rider makes a better driver,"Shah Rukh Khan has been the brand ambassador of Hyundai for 22 years, noting that he signed on for this role in the same year his son was born. And as usual, he visited the Hyundai stall at the Auto Expo 2020 amid much fanfare to unveil the all-new Hyundai Creta. He interacted with some journalists afterwards, including The Pioneer’s Kushan Mitra, and spoke about cars, the environment, technology and the future of films

Have you explored the possibility of getting yourself an electric car?

Well, there is the Hyundai Kona but, as of now, no. Electric cars also have some issues such as the disposability of the batteries and I’m sure when these cars are brought in, these issues will be dealt with and Hyundai, which has been concentrating on safety and the environment, will look at this problem. There is no doubt that electric is the future. I was recently in England and at one of the shows I saw that they are building roads where the cars will charge themselves as they drive (inductive charging).

What do you think about Greta Thunberg, the teenage environmental activist, and the message that she is trying to give to the world?

I think this message has been there for a long time, but it is nice that someone is saying this at such a young age. I’d like to clarify that young age is not a sign of maturity or immaturity; you have had young people before call out for peace and love. This is something that we need to take very seriously though. In our country, in particular, we need to take this message seriously. People might think that individually ‘hamare se nahin hoyega kuch’, but small things have a cumulative effect.

Have you used an electric car?

Well, a friend of mine got one a few years ago. I enjoyed the car but also disenjoyed it, because it was soundless, and you felt that instead of driving you were gliding. You have to get used to that and it was a hybrid.

If you look at films, what has been your favourite car chase sequence in one?

Ronin, that was very nice.

Why do you think Bollywood has never managed to do a really great car sequence?

Actually when we do a car chase, you need to attach many different kind of products to get the best shot. Lenses and cameras have to be very expendable in car chases, which are very expensive items. Overseas what they do is, if a camera breaks, it breaks. I remember for Ra-One I was ‘flying’ the cars and the fightmaster came and he put two cameras inside the car and when it landed, the camera broke. And all of us rushed and got worried but he did not because he said they break one in every 10-20 days (of shooting). So for them (Hollywood) equipment is very expendable, whereas we have to be very careful because it is very expensive.

But hasn’t equipment become cheaper and more accessible over the years?

True, but on a goPro you can’t bring it back to 4K or put it on IMAX, and to get the best cameras for chases, we are still in the system of hiring and renting equipment. There (Hollywood) what happens is that equipment is part of the budget and their budgets are $200 million or $300 million.

Since you have been around cars for years, are your kids also into them?

It is very unfortunate that my elder son does not want to learn how to drive while the younger one believes that he already knows how to drive (laughs). I have told my daughter that I am going to teach her how to drive when she comes back from college this summer. I also taught my son, but if you ask them now, they are more into this sharing concept and leasing cars from companies. I think the responsibility of owning a vehicle and looking after it is reducing among the younger generation. I believe mobility will mean not owning a car but having access to the best cars and not looking after them. Hyundai is also going down that route with some options that they have now.

How about yourself? Have you used any of the shared mobility options, maybe not in India but abroad?

I am very spoiled. When I meet my son and daughter in the US they often tell me “Let’s Uber it”, but no. So yeah...

Hyundai has a campaign called Be The Better Guy that talks about road safety. One of the more unfortunate factoids in India is that 400 people die on our roads everyday, 1.5 lakh people die every year. If you have a message for your fans to Be The Better Guy on the road, what would you tell them?

I think loss of life is the saddest thing and dying on the roads is a waste of a life. Day before yesterday, I sat with a friend and he pointed out that I should wear my seatbelt even when I am seated at the back and while I looked at him, he said, “just wear it”. And I find sense in that. A couple of times in our lives we have been in situations where the car has braked hard or swerved and the smallest of security and safety measures can go a long way. You just have to know that this is your life, and if you take care of your life you take care of other lives outside your life as well. I would just implore everyone to think of your family every time you sit in a car or get on a motorcycle. That they need you and you need them and other people’s families need them too. Life is very uncertain, and if you are getting into a vehicle, you need to take that one second and be safe. Do not overspeed, wear a helmet on a two-wheeler, you have some cool helmets nowadays which look nice as well. I tell my fans to always wear helmets. I think being the better guy ultimately is a selfish concept, that your family needs you. You have to think about yourself and your children, your spouse and your parents and if we all start thinking like that we will all be better drivers.

14,08-2-20,BJP govt spreading hatred: Akhilesh Slams law and order in UP,"Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party government was busy creating social and economic fault lines leading to spread of hatred in society.

He said the BJP government, with its divisive policies, had terrorised society and the ruling party was highly intolerant towards the opposition parties.

Yadav said here on Friday that it was futile to expect relief and change in the policies of the ruling party. He alleged that the people of UP were safe only as long as they were beyond the visual range of criminals. He said the police were helpless before the criminals as there was no let-up in the incidence of crime in Lucknow and other parts of the state.

“Even after the introduction of the police commissionerate system in Lucknow, no difference is visible on the ground and the people are living in a state off terror,” the SP chief said.

Yadav said that on Friday, as many as six cases of murder had been reported from different parts of the state. He said in Ghaziabad, a youth was beaten to death, while another youth was shot dead in Varanasi and a woman was shot dead in Azamgarh.

Yadav said the rising incidents of crime had reaffirmed the image of Uttar Pradesh as “hatya pradesh”.

The SP chief said no one took notice of the bloated claims on law and order made by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

“The people of the state have realised that the BJP leaders are in the habit of making tall claims and delivering nothing on the ground,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-govt-spreading-hatred--akhilesh-slams-law-and-order-in-up.html

26,08-2-20,Capt releases data of over 12 lakh jobs,"A day after the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) asked Punjab Chief Minister to prove his claim of providing 11 lakh jobs given to youth or apologize to them, Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday released the data on employment generation in the State since April 2017.

At the same time, he asked the Akali Dal to apologize for once again misleading the people with their “brazen, baseless and unfounded” lies.

“Sukhbir Badal and his bunch of ignorant party colleagues had absolutely no clue what is happening in Punjab,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that in their perpetual haste to react to every word uttered by the Chief Minister, “they have become habitual of putting their foot in their mouth at the drop of the hat, without checking the veracity of their comments”.

Actually, the figure for jobs generated since April 1, 2017, was even higher than the 11 lakh he had ‘mouthed’ (as Akalis termed it), while campaigning for Congress candidates in Delhi, said the Chief Minister, releasing the “actual figures”.

As per the official data available to him, the number of government jobs generated from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019, was 57,905, with 3,96,775 under private placement and another 7,61,289 facilitated by the State Government in the self-employment category, he said.

“And for the convenience of Sukhbir and company, let me tell them that these figures total up to 12,15,969, which was considerably higher than 11 lakhs he had earlier mentioned, off the cuff, during the Delhi campaign,” said the Chief Minister.

This, said Capt Amarinder, was in addition to the 20,21,568 households given employment under the MGNREGA scheme, which translated into a whopping 648.26 lakh mandays.

Challenging the Akalis to release the figures for employment in 10 years of their misrule, the Chief Minister said that Congress Government had already done more in three years than they had delivered in a decade, on every important parameter.

Instead of showing any signs of regret for failing the citizens of Punjab on every count during their regime, and instead of leveraging their presence in the Central Government for the past nearly six years for the benefit of the state, the SAD continued to indulge in pathetic theatrics, said Capt Amarinder.

Pointing out that Sukhbir and his party colleagues had, time and again, proved that they were totally ignorant of the ground realities in Punjab, and had no connect with the aspirations of the people, the Chief Minister said that this ignorance had cost them heavy in the last Assembly polls and would continue to spell their doom in the coming years.

SAD’s pathetic attempts to mislead the people of Punjab with their shameless lies would not succeed; in fact, they would only plunge the Akalis further into the abyss of political oblivion, he added.

It was time, said Capt Amarinder, that the Akalis stopped ‘mouthing’ such blatant falsehoods and started playing the role of a constructive opposition to part the Congress Government in the State in its efforts to bring Punjab back to its pristine glory.

His government, said the Chief Minister, was committed to ensuring jobs for all the eligible youth in the state, and to taking its flagship ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ scheme to its successful culmination.

“Neither the false claims of the Akalis nor the unsubstantiated allegations of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) can sway the people, who are intelligent enough to know where their welfare lies,” he declared.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-releases-data-of-over-12-lakh-jobs.html

They have started working after recently suspending their strike which lasted for about two months.

Talking to The Pioneer, the Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) Anju Badola informed that all the Anganwadi workers have returned to their work including those who were issued termination letters by the department. Few days ago, some protesting Anganwadi workers in the State were issued termination letters by the department and the District Programme Officer (DPO) Akhilesh Mishra said that only after the department gets their application with reason for their absence, the procedure of reinstating them will begin. Meanwhile, though the Anganwadi workers suspended their protest on Tuesday, the Take Home Ration (THR) has not been distributed in all Anganwadi centres on the due date as according to the Mishra it takes around 10 days to send the ration to each centre and due to the protest, it was not possible to send it beforehand as protesting Anganwadi workers had refused to distribute it.

Badola said on Friday that THR will be distributed in all the Anganwadi centres by next week. According to her, “The THR will probably be distributed by Monday or Tuesday because it is packed and sent by the women of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and that takes time. Most probably it will reach all the Anganwadi centres by next week."" While talking about paying the allowance of the two month period of the protest to Anganwadi workers, Badola said that till now no instructions regarding this have been given to her by department.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anganwadi-workers-resume-work-in-centres.html
36,08-2-20,Arya Samaj opposes alleged land grab conspiracy,"The dispute over the possession of the property of the Gurukul college appears to be gaining steam with religious personalities of the Arya Samaj from different areas of the country expressing their trust in Haridwra Rural MLA Swami Yatishwarananda.

Demanding a probe by CBI and other agencies in the matter, they said that they will soon meet the Union Home Minister, Defense Minister and the Chief Minister to inform them about the issue. If it is still not resolved then they will undertake Satyagraha but will not allow the college land to be grabbed.

Talking to media persons at the Press Club here on Friday, Yagi Muni, the head of the Universal Arya Samaj said that Gurukul College has a glorious history. The land of the college was donated to Swami Darshanananda. Alleging that attempts are being made to grab the college land, he said that the Arya Samaj will not allow even an inch of the college land to be grabbed.

He alleged, “Anil Goyal, an accused in a scam, who had fraudulently become an office bearer of the organisation, should have been behind bars but is roaming free. An impartial agency should investigate this case.”

Yatishwaranand accused cabinet minister Madan Kaushik of trying to seize the property of the college again. According to the Arya Samaj rules only a person who is associated with Arya Samaj can become a member or an office bearer. “Kaushik is unaware of any rules of the organisation but is occupying a post in the institution. The matter is under consideration of the court which has given orders to maintain the status quo. Such an attempted grab is contempt of court. The government should investigate this matter,” said the MLA.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/arya-samaj-opposes-alleged-land-grab-conspiracy.html

38,08-2-20,ABAP chief questions Ram Mandir trust composition,"The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) chief has expressed dissatisfaction at the composition of the Ram Mandir trust announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently.

The ABAP president Narendra Giri has also criticised the State government for the Central government making comparatively less budgetary allocation for the Kumbh Mela 2021. Giri questioned the composition of the Ram Mandir trust formed to facilitate construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya as per Supreme Court directions. He has demanded that a representative of the ABAP should also be given place in the trust. He further opined that the trust should consist either only of the ascetics or of householders.

In the trust that has been created, those who have been listed with the title of Shankaracharya had already been divested of it by the court, he said. The ABAP president further said that compared to the budget allocated for the Prayagraj Kumbh, the Centre had allocated less budget for the 2021 Kumbh Mela to be held in Haridwar.

Giri opined that the State government had delayed in seeking adequate budgetary allocation from the Centre for the Kumbh Mela to be held in Haridwar during 2021. However, he added that during his talks with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah, he had been assured by Shah that there will be no shortage of budget in the Kumbh Mela to be held during 2021. It is pertinent to mention here that the State Government had started series of meetings with the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and his cabinet colleagues also meeting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and various Union ministers seeking necessary budget and work approvals for the Kumbh Mela 2021.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/abap-chief-questions-ram-mandir-trust-composition.html
39,08-2-20,"Take exams with calm mind, says DC Bokaro","Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar has advised the students who are going to be appeared in the board exams (Class 10 and 12) to take the exam with a calm mind. “Do not be panic or giggle in the examination hall. Answer every question only after reading it well. Also, get plenty of sleep a day before the exam,” he added.

Board exams of Class 10 and 12 are scheduled between 11 to 28 February. Starting with the examinations ( of class 10 & 12th), tension arises among students along with their parents, especially with mothers each and every year. Students who suffer from exam fear or exam anxiety or exam phobia can see their marks suffer as a result of this stress. A balanced diet with adequate sleep is the success mantra to overcome the exam blue, said Kumar.

“To avoid such stress students should develop good study habits,” he added.

“Proper study habits and preparation are the keys to cutting out exam fear. Avoid last-minute ‘cramming’ for exams and actively listen while in class,” said DC.

Kumar said the district administration is committed to conduct the board examinations in a malpractice-free environment. Cooperation from all is expected. Please do not crowd around the centres on exam day. Do not sound the horn or make any noise when passing by the examination centre. “If any suspect, student, guardian, police officer or teacher will do any such act which seeks to break or violate the sovereignty of the examination process, stringent legal action will be taken against them,” added DC.

During period of examination, everybody gets worked up, especially parents, teachers, and students. Who amongst them is most affected is hard to say it differs, based on the mental make-up of each of them, said Poonam Sinah a teacher of Goddard Public School. “Preparing for exams is basically an exercise in repetition. The more we read, the more we absorb. The more we write, the stronger our memory.

Reading, writing, and memorising over and over again are the only means to perform better in exams,” she added.

Whether we like it or not, exams are here to stay and memory has tremendous value in exams. The only sensible option is to face them head-on, by studying well, and repeatedly, with a self-imposed punishing schedule, till every part of the syllabus is at our fingertips, she advised.

“Stress, up to a certain level acts as a motivation to study but undue stress can bog you down. There are cases of students who become too nervous during exams, said Dr Randhir (MBBS) a Physician. “They cut down on their sleep and food, and get into a desperate mode of study. These are likely to be dangerous. The human brain functions best when the mind is calm and the body is healthy. Giving up sleep and food in the run-up to the exam is a recipe for disaster,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/take-exams-with-calm-mind--says-dc-bokaro.html

A memorandum of understanding in this regard will be signed within one month.

Addressing a press meet on Friday GAIL Eastern India, Executive Director, KB Singh informed that a 180 tonne to 200 tonne capacity of waste management plant will be made at Jhiri so that through household’s wastes Bio-Gas could generate. “Through this plant not only Bio-Gas will produce but Organic Fertilizer will also be produced.

“Prime Minister, Narendra Modi firmly believes that if every citizen avoids using diesel or petrol driven transport medium, even for one day in a week, it would add up a great feat to the development of new India.

Inspired by PM Modi’s vision, PCRA has organized a month long awakening campaign through which walkathons across close to 624 districts will be organized by oil and gas PSU’s to draw mass attention and sensitize various groups of society on need and benefits of petroleum products conservation,” said Singh.

Emphasizing on the need of the campaign, the Executive Director said that the motive behind Saksham is to develop a mass awakening to adopt walking as a mechanism to not just save fuel but also safeguard the environment and its limited resources at large.

“Walking should also be looked at as a primary fitness activity, especially aimed at improvement of health. The objective of the campaign and the walkathon is to sensitize participants about the conservation of petroleum products, educate the masses on ways to mitigate pollution levels and save income by choosing to walk short distances and spending against the externalities of pollution.

This will promote a pollution free environment in Ranchi,” he added.

Singh further said that in this event, the participants may take part in a walk of approximately 3.5 Km starting from Sri Jagannath HEC Ground. The participants can register by logging on to www.townscript.com.

43,08-2-20,"Probe ordered, all banks across Punjab to be inspected","Taking serious note of the shocking neglect that led to infected blood being given to two patients and a mismatch blood transfusion to a teenager at the Blood Bank at Phagwara Civil Hospital, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday ordered a detailed inquiry into the incident. At the same time, the Chief Minister has also ordered the immediate inspection of all the blood banks across the State.

The order came in the wake of reports of two blood units infected with Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) and HbsAg (hepatitis B virus surface antigen) being issued to two patients in Phagwara.

The blood bank at Phagwara has since been shut down and the concerned Blood Transfusion Officer (BTO) Dr Hardeep Singh Sethi has been placed under suspension. The contract of Lab Technician (LT) Ravi Paul has also been suspended, said an official spokesperson.

Spokesperson added that the Senior Medical Officer (SMO) Dr Kamal Kishore had also been suspended, and Kapurthala Civil Surgeon has been asked to file a criminal complaint with the Police Department for getting an FIR registered for criminal negligence.

Expressing grave concern over the matter, the Chief Minister has directed the Health Department to immediately undertake a thorough check of all blood banks to ensure that most stringent parameters of management were being followed there.No laxity in this regard could be permitted, he made it clear.

On the Chief Minister’s directives, all blood banks in Kapurthala district will be inspected by the District Blood Transfusion Committee headed by the Civil Surgeons within the next three days.

Further, in addition to other periodic inspections, as a one-time measure, all Government blood banks will be inspected in the next 15 days and private Blood Bank will be inspected by March 31, by teams of Food and Drug Administration and Punjab Blood and Transfusion Council.

It has also been noticed that District Transfusion Committees are not inspecting the Blood Bank periodically.

Spokesperson said that the Civil Surgeons have now been instructed to ensure inspections of Blood Banks periodically so that standard operating procedures (SOPs) are followed and such lapses do not recur in the future. The Chief Minister has directed that monthly report should be sent to the Punjab State Blood Transfusion Council.

The incident at Phagwara came to light during a joint inspection of the blood bank by drug inspectors on January 30, said the spokesperson, adding that a medical board was immediately constituted by Civil Surgeon Kapurthala for inquiry and for verifying the facts.

During the inquiry, statements of SMO, Blood Transfusion Officer, or Lab Technician of Phagwara Civil Hospital, as well as scrutiny of the record, showed that the testing of the blood was done by ELISA and Rapid test.

The blood units vide bag no. 179, collected on January 24, 2020, and unit no. 2922, collected on October 15, 2019, were found reactive during the ELISA testing technique. Following this, the LT performed rapid test which came out to be non-reactive, thus violating the standard operating procedure where ELISA is done after Rapid Test, which is considered to be highly sensitive and mandatory for confirmation.

Even when the blood sample was found reactive as per ELISA and non-reactive by Rapid Test, the Blood Bank issued the blood to the patients, considering it to be non-reactive against all standard operating procedures.

It further came to notice during the inspection that a patient whose blood group is O-positive was transfused B positive blood, which was a life-threatening lapse. The condition of the patient, a teenager, has deteriorated.

As per the rules, it was the duty of the medical officer who was looking after the patient and that of the SMO to report the lapse immediately to the higher authorities.

The report pointed out that the SMO should have taken necessary action and should have taken steps to ensure that such a thing does not happen in the future. However, SMO Dr Kamal Kishore failed in the duty to do so, necessitating his suspension.

Meanwhile, Kapurthala Civil Surgeon has been instructed to make an alternate arrangement of staff in Phagwara Civil Hospital Blood Bank, and once the staff is in place, an inspection of the Blood Bank will be carried out by the Food and Drug Administration Department.

This is expected to be completed within a week and if everything is found in order the Blood Bank will be made operational, said the spokesperson.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/probe-ordered--all-banks-across-punjab-to-be-inspected.html

45,08-2-20,"SAD seeks disqualification, debarment of AAP MLAs","Every time with the convening of Punjab Vidhan Sabha’s session, the issue of disqualifying four legislators of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) comes back in focus.

Reiterating its demand to disqualify and debar these four MLAs, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday reminded the Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana KP Singh regarding a complaint demanding the same.

“A party delegation had met the Speaker personally and submitted a complaint demanding the disqualification of four legislators, including Nazar Singh Manshahia, who had resigned from the primary membership of AAP besides joining the Congress party and other political outfits,” said the SAD legislature party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon.

He said that it was shocking that the Speaker had stayed the disqualification proceedings against the former AAP MLA Naazar Singh Manshahia by stating that he had not submitted his resignation in the proper format and that no complaint had been submitted against him.

Similarly, action had also been deferred against Master Baldev Singh and Amarjit Singh Sandoa even as the proceedings under the anti-defection law against Sukhpal Singh Khaira were proceeding at a snail’s pace.

“SAD legislators had met the Speaker on September 11, 2019, and submitted a written complaint against the four legislators and not only demanded their disqualification for violating the ‘Representation of Peoples Act’ but also their debarment from contesting elections for the remaining term of the 15th Vidhan Sabha,” said Dhillon.

Stating that the issue was plain and simple, Dhillon said that the tenth schedule of the Constitution says that “a member of a House belonging to any political party shall be disqualified for being a member of the House if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such a political party”.

He said that since all four MLAs had resigned as primary members of AAP, the constitutional provision had being subverted.

Maintaining that the high office of the Speaker should remain above politics, Dhillon said that the delay in taking action against the four legislators as per constitutional norms was leading to all sorts of aspersions being case on the office of the Speaker. “I request you to take urgent steps to ensure the reputation of the august House is not besmirched,” he added.

Giving further details, Dhillon said that in Mansahia’s case, the MLA had joined the Congress party on April 25, 2019, and also announced that he had submitted his resignation in the proper format and released a copy of the same to the media.

He said that in Sandoa’s case, there were pictures of him standing with the Speaker and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh while announcing that he had joined the Congress party. “Both Sukhpal Khaira and Baldev Singh left their parent party and formed a new political outfit called Punjab Ekta Party (PEP) and even contested the Lok Sabha elections on the symbol of the new party. All this is part of public record,” he added.

Dhillon also pointed out that the State exchequer was being defrauded with the legislators drawing salaries and enjoying various facilities, including staff and personal security personnel entitled only to MLAs.

“This is against democratic norms and a cruel joke on the electorate which wanted all four seats to be declared vacant to facilitate fresh elections,” he said adding that the Speaker should take action against the four legislators to restore people’s faith in the democratic set up as well as constitutional bodies.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-seeks-disqualification--debarment-of-aap-mlas.html

The direction was given in a bid to control the rampant use of unauthorized vehicles in ferrying children to schools and back in the city, Kumar said.

“All School Management Committees (SMCs) should hold meetings with parents of children studying in their schools and convince them against the use of unauthorized vehicles for ferrying children to school,” said Kumar, adding that the school authorities must encourage the use of school buses by children for coming to school and going back home.

Kumar chaired a meeting with SMCs in Ranchi on Friday and asked them to spread awareness about the road safety norms among parents. “The lack of awareness among parents about the road safety norms and the risks involved in sending their children to school by unauthorized vehicles is at the root of all the problems,” he said.

“The school administration has to see if the bus driver and the conductor are mentally fit to do their duty. The buses have to follow the pollution norms and keep all the papers up to date,” Kumar said.

The schools have to also ensure that the buses have basic facilities such as first aid box, proper seats, medicines and fire extinguishers. Overloading of buses will also be punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act and will lead to a heavy fine on the school administration, sources present in the meeting said.

Most of the unauthorized vehicles used for ferrying children to schools are either three-wheelers or four-wheelers. Sources said that most of these vehicles, used as substitute for buses, do not have a commercial registration and other necessary documents for being eligible to ferry school students.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dto-bats-for-use-of-school-buses.html

This was informed by CPI(M) State leader Janardan Pati at Press meet here. He said the country is passing through a severe crisis due to rising unemployment and declining GDP and other factors.

Pati said Odisha’s interest in the Railway Budget has been grossly ignored as about Rs 1,600 crore less has been allocated to the State than previous year though a substantial amount of revenue the railway is earning from the State.

One hand, the poor are becoming poorer and on the other, the rich richer. The capitalists are flourishing under the current Central Government. The per-day profit of Ambani and Adani groups has reached Rs 188 crore and Rs 170 crore, resepectively, he said.

Pati said the Government couldn’t ensure a minimum Rs 21,000 per month for the labour class of the unorganised sectors. In the Union Budget, there is no mention or provision about the unemployed and labour class people.

The BJP-led Government is failing miserably to meet the expectations of the people while it is playing a divisive game to divert the attention of people from the core and urgent issues by moving and proposing CAA, NRC and NPR, etc., he alleged.

Bikers without helmets and triple riding were the target of traffic cops. The drive was simultaneously carried out at six strategic locations -- Jubilee Park ( both at the in and out gate), Mango chowk, near Jugsalai police station, near Tata Pigments gate on

Bistupur-Station Road and at Golmuri roundabout from 9.30 am onwards.

“Our objective is not to charge fines to fill up state coffers, but to make fines a deterrent to rash driving and other traffic violations.

We want to drive home the virtues of safe riding so that youngsters don’t put themselves and others at risk on road. I have directed officials at all the checking points to give priority to this exercise ,” said the official.

According to him, the drive would continue .

He added that the move would bring about a visible change in youngsters, who would learn to develop safe riding habits to avoid paying cash penalty.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-to-ensure-strict-vigil-for-valentine---s-day-week.html

72,08-2-20,"Understanding delayed execution, mercy plea","Adding another twist to the Nirbhaya episode, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Centre's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's verdict, which has dismissed the Centre’s plea against stay on the execution of the death row convicts.

The Centre has appraised the court that, convicts in the case are yet to be executed, despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.

The Delhi High Court had on last Wednesday directed that, the four convicts were to be executed together and not separately; however, it had set a week's deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies. It had further clarified that if the convicts chose not to make any type of petition within seven days from the date of the order, in that case the institutions/ authorities concerned would deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay.

But it had faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps in issuance of death warrants after the appeals of the convicts were rejected by the Supreme Court way back in 2017. The Centre has stated in the petition before the apex court that, the convicts can be hanged separately as one of them namely, Mukesh has exhausted all his remedies, including the mercy plea.

It is important to understand the intricacies of the whole exercise of presentation of mercy petition, its grant or rejection. The power of the President to grant pardons, to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases is provided under Article 72 of the Constitution. As per this constitutional provision, the sole authority to grant mercy petition in criminal cases is the President of India, but his decision shall be subject to the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Besides, under Article 161 of the Constitution, the Governor has the power to grant pardons, to suspend or remit or commute sentences of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to matter to which the executive power of the State extends. In Maru Ram v. Union of India, the apex court has held that, the powers under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India can be exercised by the Central and State Governments, not by the President and Governor on their own. So much so that, the advice of the appropriate Government binds the Head of the State. This was further reiterated by the apex court in the case of Dhana v. State of West Bengal.

In Kehar Singh and Anr. v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has held, “It is appropriate that in the matter of life and personal liberty another degree of protection should be extended by entrusting power further to some higher authority to consider the option of commutation. The power so entrusted is a power belonging to the people and lies with the highest dignitary of the State.”

It further added that, ""The power to pardon is a part of the constitutional scheme and it should be so treated also in the Indian Republic. It has been reposed by the people through the Constitution in the Head of the State, and enjoys high status. It is a constitutional responsibility of great significance, to be exercised when occasion arises in accordance with the discretion contemplated by the context.”

But such superior powers are also subject to judicial review and the convicts in Nirbhaya case have also resorted to such legal apparatus. The application of Judicial review over exercise of powers under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution are subject to certain limitations and have been well defined in Maru Ram v Union of India. It has been observed therein, that there cannot be an arbitrary or mala fide exercise of any public power including constitutional power. The constitution bench in this case emphasised that the “power being of the greatest moment, cannot be a law unto itself but it must be informed by the finer canons of constitutionalism.” It was further held, the court shall keep in mind while exercising judicial review that, where a power is vested in a very high authority, it must be presumed that the said authority would act properly and carefully after an objective consideration of all the aspects of the matter. The court remarked, “Higher the power, more cautious would be its exercise.”

Also in Epuru Sudhakar & Anr. v. Govt. of AP & Ors., the apex court held that, it is well settled that the exercise or non-exercise of the pardon power by the President or Governor as the case may be is not immune from judicial review. In, another interesting decision of 2014, the apex court has held in Shatrughnan Chauhan & Anr. v. UoI,. that the condemned prisoner's death sentence can be commuted to life imprisonment if there is inordinate delay in deciding the mercy plea.

The prescription of law as regards the various options of legal remedies available to the convicts, are a set of well meaning constitutional and legal provisions and judicial innovations which clearly intend to protect the rights of the convicts against the slightest contingency of injustice, be it owing to procedural lapses, or fault of any of the legal/ judicial or executive authority. But it becomes fatal to the cause of justice, when the convicts and their lawyers exploit the humane face of law by adopting dilatory tactics as evident in the Nirbhaya case. While the proactive role of the State is indispensable in following up with such sensitive cases, it also becomes expedient that we embark upon a legal system that puts an end to the monopolistic regime, prevalent as regards the time of approaching the courts with review and curative petitions and filing of mercy petitions and their disposal. It is meant to say that, such petitions should be subjected to strict law of limitation, otherwise it shall not be too long, when public sentiments shall mount on the authorities to adhere to extra-judicial killings like in the Hyderabad veterinarian’s rape and murder case. Besides, there is every fear that, loss of public faith in the outcome of judicial processes shall result in setting up of Kanagaroo courts and promotion of mob lynching. Therefore, ‘We the people’ (and our manifestations as the legislature, executive and judiciary) should now seriously think about it.https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif

74,08-2-20,Rourkela ex-Councillor hurt in bomb attack,"Police on Friday detained three suspects, including a businessman, on the charge of conspiring to kill former Councillor Ashesh Mohanty alias Bulu by hurling bombs at him at Basanti Colony of the steel city on Thursday night.

Police said Bulu was returning home in a two-wheeler at around 9 pm when two bike-borne miscreants hurled bombs at him and fled from the spot.

Bulu, who received critical injuries in the attack, was immediately rushed to the Ispat General Hospital (IGH).

Rourkela SP K Shiva Subramani rushed to the spot to initiate a probe into the incident. Later after preliminary investigation, police took three suspects including a reputed businessman of the city into custody.

Police along with a bomb disposal team conducted searches and seized a live bomb from the spot of attack on Friday morning. The explosive was later diffused by the bomb squad.

Subramani said, “The miscreants used bottle bomb, a low-explosive but improvised device in the explosion.”

“After preliminary investigation into the incident, we have apprehended three suspects and are also investigating the involvement of other persons in the attack. The attack is most probably because of the fallout of personal rivalry,” added the SP.

Sources said the detained businessman who is stated to be the mastermind behind the incident had reportedly given a contract of Rs 20 lakh contract to two supari killers to eliminate Bulu.

A few years ago, Bulu was arrested by the Crime Branch over his alleged links with the gangster Dhalasamanta brothers. He was also accused of being involved in many criminal cases such as attempt to murder, supplying arms to the Dhalasamant brothers, rioting, dacoity and criminal intimidation.

In 2010, Bulu had also suffered a similar attack over business enmity but he narrowly escaped, reports added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rourkela-ex-councillor-hurt-in-bomb-attack.html

76,08-2-20,‘Athagarh sanitation workers not regularised',"Members of the Athagarh Safei Karmachari Sangha have been on strike since January 25 demanding fulfilment of their seven -point charter of demands but it is a matter of pity that the local administration had not shown adequate inclination to solve it yet.

Among the demands, regularisation of service, provision of EPF, salary as per the Government declared daily wage rate were raised.

However, as per allegations of the workers, they had been deprived of minimum amenities. President of Athagarh Safei Karmachari Sangha Ram Narayana Mohanty said the agitation would continue till demands were met.

However, NAC Executive Officer Sudhanshu Sekhar Sao said regularisation of service of the workers were beyond the norms of the ULBs as declared by the Government.

77,08-2-20,Palamu admin asks NPU to vacate Pro VC quarter,"Nilamber Pitamber University is in utter quandary Palamu district administration has served two quick and hard hitting letters to the university’s registrar JN Shekhar to vacate the D 3 type quarter allotted to the Pro Vice Chancellor and in the event of university not vacating this quarter the administration has kept its option ready to get it vacated in presence of a magistrate which in legal parlance is called ‘eviction’.

Sources said way back in 2009 when NPU came into existence when under order of the Raj Bhavan Ranchi the then DC Palamu Amitabh Kaushal was directed to arrange suitable accommodation for NPU VC then and in that series the then administration had given a D 3 type quarter to Pro VC of this university as well.

VC’s quarter is E type while Pro VC’s is D type.

Sources said the district administration has taken this hard stand just because this quarter is locked since September 2019 following the quitting of the then Pro VC P K Poddar who left from here for Bihar.

Sources said the contention of the district administration is that since this quarter is not in occupancy over the last many months the university should have handed it over to the district administration, which it did not and so it must vacate now.

Sources said on one hand the district administration bats for its getting vacated and in its own letter given to registrar Shekhar it asks the university to apply for allotment of quarter.

This conflict of interest on the part of the administration is ambiguous.

Sources said the district administration has grossly overlooked a major fact that the university is up to date in rent payment even said its registrar J N Shekhar “ Rent of this quarter is paid up to March 2020.”

Sources said the district administration accuses university of violating quarter norms while the fact of the matter is that the university kept this quarter locked once its last occupant P K Poddar left the job in this university and the university did not put in any of its other official to live in this quarter in all these months and there is no plan either for any other to live here except the notified Pro VC on his/ her joining this university. It genuinely preferred to keep it locked.

It was never sub let or sub occupied by any official.

VC NPU S N Singh said, “The university has received two quick letters from deputy collector In charge General Section of Palamu Collectorate asking us to vacate this quarter meant for our Pro VC.

The district administration again also asks us to apply for allotment of quarter for the same officer.”

He added, “We urge the deputy commissioner Palamu to appreciate our difficulties as our university is working in a rented building of Palamu Zila Parishad since 2009 as we do not have our own building and now if this quarter is asked to be vacated then where the university will keep its assets which include articles of all sorts from drawing room, bed room, office room, kitchen ware Ac fittings, TV set, to toiletry etc.”

“We retained this quarter under lock and key and continued to pay rent well in advance like this rent paid up to March 2020. If we do not have any Pro VC right here we can’t help. We believe the government will soon send in Pro VC here,” he said.

DC Palamu Shantanu Kumar Agrahari said, “ This issue has been brought to my notice. I am taking updates on this issue. I have asked registrar of this university to meet me. I do not think there is any reason to be so worried or tense over it.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu-admin-asks-npu-to-vacate-pro-vc-quarter.html

The seizures include one light machine gun, three Insas rifles, three carbine sten guns, 1 SLR rifle, a .303 rifle, one pistol, 202 rounds of 5.6 mm ammunition, 59 rounds of 7.62 ammunition, 42 rounds of 9mm ammunition, 4 LMG magazines, eight INSAS magazines, two SLR magazines, six carbine magazines, one 303 magazine, two VHF set cum scanner, one optical sight and a tiffin bomb along with explosive.

This was one of the biggest counter-Leftwing extremist operations in the area that was underway to provide security cover for road construction in the region, which was opposed by the Maoists, informed DGP Abhay.

The DGP said an exchange of fire between a team comprising Special Operations Group and District Voluntary Force commandos of Odisha police and Maoists had taken place at Goiguda village on January 15.

On the basis of information recovered from Maoist documents and electronic devices seized following the exchange of fire, intense search and area domination exercises were launched that led to uncovering of the major Maoist hideouts and ammunition dumps in Swabhiman Anchal and adjoining areas.

It is suspected that the arms and ammunitions might have been looted from police in the past.

“We suspect that the arms and ammunitions were hidden by Maoists of the Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (ABSZC). Combing and area domination exercises have been intensified further in the region to recover more such Maoist hideouts, if any,” the DGP added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---biggest-arms-seizure----in-state-achieved.html

Chilly weather too will continue but there would not be further deepening of the mercury, said weatherman.

The foggy conditions will help in preventing minimum temperature to fall further. The fog blanket trapped the ground heat not allowing it to escape into the atmosphere.

Hence there was no decrease in the minimum temperature and the minimum mercury level recorded in the capital city of Raipur was 15.5 degrees Celsius on Friday, he added.

Light drizzle was recorded in many places in the state and Surguja, Raipur, Bilaspur, and Durg witnessed a chilly day on Friday.

86,08-2-20,Police drive out protestors from Tata iron mine,"The months’ long strike of villagers in front of the Tata Company’ s Katamati iron ore mine gate at Deojhar under Joda block in Keonjhar district came to an end as police removed the agitators forcibly from the spot two days back.

Sources said some locals, said to be close aides of former Champua MLA Sanatan Mahakud, had opposed the Gram Sabha held for the iron mines in 2016, demanding early assurances of employments and others facilities. However, they withdrew protests after the Tata Steel Management promised in written to provide employments, including transporting jobs, to local people and do peripheral developments.

But all hopes of locals, most of whom are tribals, were belied as leaders joined hands with the company to grab the transporting job.

Then betrayed people formed another group named 'Murga Baba Seva Samiti' and started agitation, demanding jobs. Due to agitation, transporting from the mines was stopped from February 5, 2020.

Alekh Barik who is spearheading the strike since December 23, 2019 has lodged a complaint in the local police station alleging that Gopinath Gope, husband of Panchayat Samiti member Subashini Gope of Joda block, had threatened to kill him if he doesn't withdraw the strike.

87,08-2-20,"Appellate authority grants relief to colleges, contradicts HC","In an order which would provide relief to the private Ayurveda colleges but would contradict the orders of the Uttarakhand High Court (HC), the appellate authority on fees has allowed three private colleges to charge increased fees from the students.

The appellate authority in its meeting held on January 31 has allowed Qwadra Institute of Ayurved and Hospital, Roorkee, Haridwar to charge enhanced fee of Rs 2.15 Lakh per annum (p a) from the years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18.

Similarly in another order it decided that the Doon Institute of Medical Sciences Sahaspur can charge fees of Rs 2.15 lakh per year for the year 2017-18. A similar order was passed for the Devbhoomi Medical College of Ayurveda and Hospital, Manduwala, Chakrata road, Dehradun.

Though the order of the appellate authority gave relief to the private colleges it contradicted the HC order which had quashed the government order (GO) on fee hike dated October 14, 2015 and directed the colleges to refund the excess fee charged by them to the students. The patron of Private Medical Universities Joint Forum of parents, Ravindra Jugran told The Pioneer that the order of HC is binding on all the parties and the order of the appellate authority allowing three colleges to charge increased fees retrospectively cannot be implemented.

He claimed that the private colleges are retorting to every trick to shuttle the order of HC and charge astronomical fees from the students retrospectively.

It is worth mentioning here that the students of the private Ayurveda colleges launched a massive agitation on demand of implementation of HC order on fee refund. On the assurance of the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat the agitation was withdrawn on November 22 last year.

The Issue

The Uttarakhand government in the year 2015 had released a Government Order (GO) for increase in fees of the private Ayurveda Colleges of the state.

This GO was issue without necessary recommendation of the fee fixation committee and was implemented from back date in gross violation of all norms. On the orders of Supreme Court (SC), a fee fixation committee decides on the fee structure of private colleges.

On July 2018, the HC cancelled the GO and directed that the increased fee should be refunded within 15 days. The private colleges challenged this order but on October 9, 2018, a bench of HC upheld the earlier decision of single bench.

In pursuance of the HC order, the state government passed the orders for fee refund but the administrators of these colleges are not following the order.

Interestingly the state administration had issued three orders dated November 2, 2018, March 22, 2019 and April 23, 2019 asking the private colleges to refund the fee as per the orders of the HC but the private colleges continued their defiance. On September 23, 2019 the HC issued orders to 13 private colleges on a contempt petition.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/appellate-authority-grants-relief-to-colleges--contradicts-hc.html

Tata Power has been successful in reducing AT and C losses to less than eight per cent in Delhi and less than nine per cent in Ajmer.

All employees of the Cesu would become part of the new formed company without any change in their service conditions.

Tariffs for consumers would be decided by the OERC. It is expected that the new company will be able to significantly reduce losses.

The Government would be involved in key decision making process to safeguard interest of the consumers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cesu-transformation-on-ppp-mode-soon.html

The idea of holding an Open Day and exhibition within the institute premises was first floated by IIT BBS Director Prof RV Rajakumar on the eve of 10th Foundation Day celebration to promote scientific talent and inspire students of the hinterland at an early stage.

The foundation day programme would be inaugurated by Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan.

Prof Kumar said this would be an “open for all” platform, where the institute would showcase its latest science and technology prowess to the visiting students through easy to understand, and interactive sessions.

The visiting students would also gain unique perspective of science and technology by being inquisitive and voluntarily participating in the live experiments, he added.

107,08-2-20,Extra vigil in ‘critical’ Shaheen,"Poll authorities have made elaborate arrangements for the smooth conduct of polling day on Friday. The poll watchdog has made tight security arrangements in and around sensitive and hyper-sensitive polling stations, especially in Shaheen Bagh area. All the five polling stations in the area, have been put under ""critical"" category.

Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Ranbir Singh, reiterated that the area is under ""tight vigil"" and ""there is no looming obstruction"" in areas where poll activities will be conducted. So, the voters will face no problems. He said 1,47,86,382 people are eligible to vote in the Delhi polls, and 2,32,815 are in the age group of 18-19.

Shaheen Bagh falls in the Okhla Assembly constituency. The area has become the epicenter of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the national Capital and the agitation has been thrust by political parties into a poll issue. Over 1.47 crore voters are eligible to exercise their franchise in the electoral battle for Delhi' s 70 assembly seats, which is largely being seen as a triangular contest among the ruling AAP, a spirited Congress and the opposition BJP which has campaigned very aggressively ahead of the election.

Voters in various categories include males (81, 05,236), females (66, 80,277), service voters (11,608), third gender voters (869), and senior citizens (aged 80 and above) voters (2, 04,830), officials said.

Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan, had earlier said 190 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will be deployed as part of the security measures. This is nearly four times the number of CAPF personnel deployed during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he added. There are 13,750 polling booths, besides one auxiliary booth, located at 2,689 locations across Delhi. ""As far as critical polling stations are concerned, there are 516 locations and 3,704 booths in that category,"" Singh said. Besides police security, polling stations falling in the ""critical category"" get paramilitary cover. Activities will be monitored through webcasting, he said. Police and election machinery are on ""extra vigil"" and assessing the situation all the time across the national capital, he added.

Security personnel kept guard at strong rooms storing EVMs. Election staff carried EVMs and other polling material to booths under tight supervision in all constituencies.

Poll authorities had met protesters recently and encouraged them to vote on the polling day. ""The 2020 Delhi polls will be tech-driven with greater use of technology elements like mobile apps, QR codes, social media interface, seeking to enhance the experience of all categories of voters, before polling or on the voting day. And we are trying to make the best use of it,"" he said.

Electors can carry smartphones at polling stations in 11 assembly constituencies for accessing QR codes from the voters' helpline app in case they have not brought the voters' slip to the booth.

Singh hoped that the twin-edged strategy of more thrust on use of technology complemented with massive campaigns in the run-up, will lead to a greater turnout than in 2015.

A mega, multi-domain outdoor campaign is being carried out by the Delhi CEO Office to bring large number of electorate to the polling booths, besides jingles on all major FM stations. The ruling AAP is going into the Delhi election with the hope to repeat its stellar performance in the last assembly polls, while the BJP, which bagged all seven seats here in the Lok Sabha election, will be aiming at expanding its vote share in the national Capital.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/extra-vigil-in----critical----shaheen.html
108,08-2-20,"2 Imrans, 3 Soms in poll fray","The list of candidates for the high-stakes Delhi polls is a heady mix with three namesakes fighting from the Sadar Bazar constituency, two Imran Khans fielded by a nondescript party from the neighbouring seats and a Nathu Ram trying their luck in the February 8 elections.

The two Khans — Imran Khan and Imran Matlub Khan — fighting the polls on tickets from the Tipu Sultan Party, are testing their fortunes from adjoining Karawal Nagar and Mustafad constituencies, respectively, the party symbol being a kettle.

A total of 672 candidates are in the fray for the Delhi polls, largely being seen as triangular contest among the ruling AAP, the Congress and the BJP banking on its aggressive campaigning and Modi star power.

But, little known parties and independents have added a flavour the elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly, with quirky and unusual names, and namesakes adding a dash of humour to it.

The AAP has renominated Som Dutt from the Sadar Bazar seat. But two independent candidates -- Som Dutt (symbol brush) and Somdutt (symbol ice cream) are also in the fray from the same seat.

Candidate Nathu Ram has been fielded by the CPI (M) from Wazirpur.

Other candidates include Vikas from Aapki Apni Party (Peoples) -- symbol battery torch -- from Model Town; and Iswar, an independent fighting on a bat symbol from Delhi Cantonment.

Then there is a woman candidate, who goes by the name of Vimla @Bimla from Sabse Badi Party (symbol matchbox), fighting from Shahdara.

One Akshay Kumar is trying his luck as an independent candidate (symbol whistle) from the Kondli seat, while Namaha is testing his fortune on an LJP ticket from Laxmi Nagar.

Among unusual party names, Mazdoor Ekta Party has fielded Surender Kumar from Matiala (symbol plate containing food); Aapki Apni Party (Peoples) has fielded Sonu Kaushik, and Peoples Party of India (Democratic) with basket containing fruits symbol, has given ticket to Hemraj in the Timarpur seat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-imrans--3-soms-in-poll-fray.html

111,08-2-20,Visas of foreigners from China cancelled,"The Centre on Friday said India has cancelled all visas issued to foreign nationals coming from China as it stepped up efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus after 150 passengers were identified with symptoms of the deadly virus and sent to isolation units.

Making a suo motu statement in the Rajya Sabha, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the Government has asked people not to travel to China, the epicentre of the deadly virus outbreak, and will mandatorily quarantine anyone returning from China.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar informed the Upper House that there are about 80 Indians who remained in Wuhan. Of them, 10 students who came to the airport were running fever and were not allowed to board the special Air India flight by the Chinese authorities. The remaining 70 have voluntarily stayed back.

Screening of passengers has been stepped up at 21 airports as well as 12 major seaports and all minor ports. Also, screening is being done at all integrated check posts on the Nepal border after the Himalayan nation reported a confirmed case.

When MPs asked if Pakistan has sought Indian help in evacuating its citizens from China, he said the offer was made to all neighbours and only Maldives choose to avail the offer.

While the Cabinet Secretary is taking daily reviews with all related ministries, a Group of Ministers comprising Cabinet Ministers for External Affairs and Civil Aviation Minister and Ministers of State for Home, Shipping and Health and Family Welfare has been constituted to monitor the situation.

“As of today, a total of 1,275 flights have been screened covering a total of 1,39,539 passengers, and 150 passengers identified with symptoms have been referred to isolation facilities,” the health minister said.

Detailing steps taken to check the spread of coronavirus, he said travel advisories have been issued. Besides “existing visas (including eVisa already issued) are no longer valid for any foreign national travelling from China,” he said. “People travelling to China henceforth will be quarantined on return.”

People having compelling reasons to visit India are asked to contact the Indian embassy in Beijing or consulate in Shanghai or Guangzhou, he said. Universal thermal screening has been made mandatory for all flights from Singapore and Thailand, besides Hong Kong and China. “All these flights will park at earmarked aero-bridges to facilitate screening,” he said.

The Minister said three positive cases have been reported so far in India, all from Kerala.

“All these cases have a travel history from Wuhan, China. They have been isolated and are reported to be clinically stable.” Besides screening incoming passengers, India evacuated 647 Indians and 7 Maldivian nationals from China.

“After the evacuation, the people are presently undergoing quarantine at special facilities created by the Indian Army in Manesar and by Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in Chawla Camp,” he said, adding 10 of the evacuees who showed symptoms of the virus have been shifted to isolation. All of them have tested negative and are stable, he said. Besides, 262 symptomatic travellers have been referred to isolation facilities and are being monitored.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/visas-of-foreigners-from-china-cancelled.html
112,08-2-20,One word expunged from PM’s speech in Parliament,"A word has been expunged from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Parliament on Thursday, when he took on the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha on the National Population Register (NPR). A word was also removed from comments made by Opposition leader Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress.

It is rare for a Prime Minister’s words to be deleted from parliamentary records but not unprecedented. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu expunged the word used by Modi on Thursday during his reply to the discussion on a motion thanking the President for his address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament at the start of the Budget Session.

“Chairman was pleased to direct expunction of a certain portion of the proceedings of Rajya Sabha dated February 6 at about 6.20 and 6.30 pm,” a statement issued by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat said.

Naidu routinely expunges any remark found unsuitable from Rajya Sabha’s records after going through the proceedings of the day. This has been done on several occasions but rarely was any remark of Modi expunged with this being the second of his in a year. In 2018, some words were dropped from Modi’s comments on Congress leader BK Hariprasad. He had used wordplay on Hariprasad’s initials, which was seen as derogatory.

Modi on Thursday had made the remark as he launched a strong defence of the NPR saying the country’s population register was being updated with demographic information for better targeting of Government’s welfare schemes. He had targeted the opposition Congress for making a U-turn, saying the party had brought the NPR in 2010 and was later updated in 2015 by adding photographs and some biometric information.

Naidu also expunged a word from Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s statement made after Modi had finished his speech. Azad had stated that the Congress was in favour of giving citizenship to persecuted migrants from Pakistan but was against framing of a law based on religion.

In 2013, some words were expunged from then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s comments in the Rajya Sabha during a heated argument with then Opposition leader Arun Jaitley. Some parts were removed from Jaitley’s remarks as well.

“Parliament has a large compilation of unparliamentary words. Every year, new words are added to the list. Recently, words like Pappu, behnoi (brother-in-law), daamad (son-in-law) were also added,” informed a source.

Godse, or Mahatma Gandhi’s killer Nathuram Godse, used to be an unparliamentary word. In 2015 then speaker Sumitra Mahajan removed it from the list of unparliamentary words. The term has been used extensively in sparring between the BJP and the Opposition over Gandhi. The ruling party has been accused of being soft on members who have glorified Godse, like Lok Sabha MP Pragya Thakur.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/one-word-expunged-from-pm---s-speech-in-parliament.html
113,08-2-20,Govt to find out reasons for farmers’ suicide,"With as many as 5,763 farmers committing suicide in 2018, of which Maharashtra accounted for close to 40 per cent of the deaths, the Government will initiate talks with representatives, farmers and other stakeholders to find out the reasons.

Replying to the Rajya Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said that as many as 5,763 farmers committed suicide in 2018 as per the records available with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

Karnataka with 1,365 suicides and Telangana with 900 were the other two major Indian States where farmers resorted to the drastic measure, Tomar said while answering a question from Samajwadi Party MP Ravi Prakash Verma in the Upper House.

In Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, 365 and 303 farmers ended their lives in the year.

Tomar said the government is taking a number of steps to reduce the indebtedness of farmers. Schemes such as PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, social security for small and marginal farmers and price support schemes such as PM-Ashaa to give remunerative prices to farmers are some of the measures taken by the Government to make farming viable.

His deputy Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Parshottam Rupala told the Upper House that the Government will initiate talks with representatives, farmers and other stakeholders to find out reasons behind Maharashtra reporting maximum 2,239 suicides by farmers.

“Maximum number of suicides has been committed by Maharashtra farmers. It is a matter of pain. There are several schemes by the Government of India and Maharashtra government and there is a system to monitor it. Maximum suicides are there despite efforts of both governments...We are trying to assess why such a situation is there...We will hold talks with representatives, farmers and stakeholders,” Rupala said.

Detailing efforts by the government to benefit farmers, he said the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojna was launched to directly benefit farmers and for the first time Rs 12,000 crore was directly deposited in accounts of 6.11 crore farmers.

The agriculture department has data of 8 crore farmers now for the first time, he said, adding a number of steps have been taken to empower farmers.

Through the new Prime Minister Crop Insurance policy, Rs 58,592 was paid to farmers and steps are on that insurance companies provide receipts to farmers on paying premium of insurance.

On natural calamities, he said, a Central team visits affected areas on state’s request and accordingly the Home Ministry recommends funds on the basis of assessment. He said so far there has been no information of funds not reaching farmers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-to-find-out-reasons-for-farmers----suicide.html
114,08-2-20,Modi doesn’t behave like PM: Rahul Gandhi,"Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “tubelight” barb, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the former does not behave like a Prime Minister. He also alleged that the ruckus in the Lok Sabha was “orchestrated” to prevent him from questioning the Government.

“Normally, a Prime Minister has a particular status, a Prime Minister has a particular way of behaving, a particular stature, our Prime Minister doesn’t have these. He does not behave in a prime ministerial way,” Rahul told reporters outside the Parliament when he was asked about Modi’s “tubelight” barb at him during his reply to the motion of thanks to the president’s address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

He also said “we are being stifled and we are not being allowed to speak in Parliament”. “They have suppressed our voices,” Rahul Gandhi said.

On Friday, there was uproar in the Lok Sabha over comments made by BJP MP and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan against Rahul. The House was adjourned for the day at 2 pm. The former Congress chief along with Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury later met Speaker Om Birla over the ruckus in the House.

“The orchestrated ruckus in Parliament was designed to prevent me from questioning the Government. The youth of India can clearly see that the PM has no clue about how to tackle the unemployment crisis. To protect him, the BJP will keep disrupting Parliament, preventing debate,” the Congress leader said on twitter later.

Rahul told reporters that he was seeking to raise an issue of the people of his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad not getting access to medical facilities in the absence of a medical college. “But I was prevented from doing so,” he said.

“Yesterday, the Prime Minister gave a long speech, I asked him what is happening about jobs and employment. The Prime Minister talked about Jawaharlal Nehru, he spoke about Pakistan and all sorts of things, the Congress party, but the prime minister is unable to answer what he is doing to give jobs to the youth of the country. He is unable to give an answer and jobs to the youth, and that is why this drama that you saw today,” he said.

The Opposition party alleged that BJP members prevented Rahul from exercising his right to ask questions.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-doesn---t-behave-like-pm--rahul-gandhi.html
115,08-2-20,"Loss of Rs 100 cr in Rajasthan, Gujarat","Locusts’ attack affected a whopping 1,68,55086 lakh hectares of crops in Rajasthan and Gujarat in 2019-20 even as the extent of damage in Punjab is yet to be ascertained. The swarms of locusts from Iran and Pakistan that have invaded farms in parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan since December has resulted in an estimated loss of Rs 100 crore and nearly 1-1.5 lakh farmers have been affected so far. The number of affected farmers could increase in the coming days.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has flagged the “threat” of hatching and band formation in Southern Iran, while breeding is expected to start in Southwest Pakistan in its latest forecast, posing a threat to the entire Southwest Asia including southern Pakistan and Western India. According to Ministry of Agriculture, the FAO alert is for the coming season, starting June 2020.

In a reply to the Rajya Sabha pertaining to damage of crops due to locust attack, Minister of State for Agriculture, Kailash Choudhury, Rajasthan government has reported 1,49, 821 hectare crops affected from locust attack in 2019-20. Of them, damaged crop area of 33 percent and more has reported on 1, 34,959 hectare. Gujarat has reported 18,737 hectare crop affected due to locust attack. Of them, 13,881 hectare reported damage to 33 percent and more in 2019-20. The issue of locust attack has been raised by BJP MPs in the Rajya Sabha during question hours and urged the centre to send teams to assess the damages in this regard. BJP MPs also demanded compensation to farmers whose crops have been damaged in locust attack.

The Rajasthan government has reported that the revenue department assessed the damage from locust attack and an allocation of Rs 90.20 crore has been made under State Disaster Response Fund for payment of compensation to farmers. Out of this, Rs 86.21 crore has been paid to 54,150 farmers.

“But the damages are more than it has expected as the Rajasthan government has urged the Centre to declare the locust attacks as a national calamity since 12 districts are affected.,” said officials of agriculture ministry.

Similarly, the Gujarat Government has disbursed Rs 32.76 crore to 11, 500 farmers so far. According to the Punjab Government, a small swarm of locusts was spotted in few patches and this has been adequately dealt with. Till date, no loss to any crop has been reported in this current rabi season. Haryana also reported some locust attacks in villages bordering Rajasthan and no crop damage so far.

The Locusts Warning Organisation (LWO) of the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that around 3.50-4 lakh hectare crops in various districts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been affected in 2019-20. The damage caused by locust attacks in 2019-20 is believed to be one of the worst in India. There are 4 locust species found in India, of which the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is the most important pest species. On average a small locust desert swarm “eats as much food in one day as about 10 elephants, 25 camels or 2500 people, the LWO says.

The FAO of the United Nations had said that adult groups and swarms of desert locusts were expected to arrive in southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran during the next few weeks. Up to that point, India had treated nearly 1 800 ha and Pakistan more than 20 000 ha of land area, it had said then.

Locust attacks are a seasonal phenomenon in Gujarat and Rajasthan. The current spell is not the first time it’s occurred in 2019. Since May this year, around 10 swarms have entered India from across the international border. However, the scale of the current episode is earning it the distinction of being the biggest locust attack in these two states since 1993-94. That year, the LWO says the total damage amounted to Rs 7.18 lakh. But that is far below the all-time record damage caused by locusts in India, between 1926 and 1931, which is estimated at Rs 10 crore.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/loss-of-rs-100-cr-in-rajasthan--gujarat.html
116,08-2-20,"Come back, celebrate life, Modi tells insurgents","Pitching for peace from the once hotbed of an armed movement for Bodoland, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged Kashmiri militants, banned outfits in the North-East and Naxalites to lay down their arms, join the national mainstream and ‘celebrate life’.

Addressing a massive public rally here to celebrate the January 27 tripartite accord amid a spectacle resplendent with Assam’s cultural opulence, he also attacked the previous non-BJP Governments for “procrastinating” resolution of vexed issues that alienated people and made them lose faith in democracy and the Constitution.

“The Bodo accord has heralded a new dawn of peace and development in Assam. With people’s support, it has paved the way for permanent peace.

“Those still with bombs, guns and bullets in Kashmir, other parts of North-East, and Naxalites...Come back...Join the mainstream. Wapas laut aiye aur jeevan ka jashn manaiye (come back and celebrate life,” he said.

Modi said he was confident that the accord signed by the Centre, Assam Government and Bodo groups, will bring permanent peace, unlike the previous accords inked with insurgents in 1993 and 2003.

“With the signing of the historic agreement, no demand has been left unfulfilled,” he said.

Modi, who was on a visit to Assam for the first time after enactment of the new citizenship law, which plunged large parts of the state into a welter of violence, also sought to assuage the concerns of people of the region on the issue.

“Canard is being spread that lakhs of settlers will come from other countries after the enactment of CAA. Nothing of that sort will happen,” he said.

The Prime Minister had cancelled his visits to Guwahati twice in December last year and this January—first for a summit meeting with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe and second to inaugurate the ‘Khelo India’ youth games at the height of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests.

Several districts of Lower Assam witnessed bloodshed and violence over many decades as Bodo militants of different groups launched an armed struggle for a separate state, locking horns with the state government, central security agencies, and other minorities inhabiting the area.

Bodos predominantly inhabit the northwestern part of Assam in districts like Kokrajhar, Udalguri, Chirang, Baksa, Darrang, Sonitpur, Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, and Dhubri.

The proponents of the Bodo movement had for decades claimed the Bodos, one of the Indo-Mongoloid tribal communities, are ethnically different from the rest of the people of Assam and entitled to a separate state.

Primarily Bengali Muslims, whose roots can be traced to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and tribal communities like Santhals and Koch-Rajbongshis bore the brunt of ethnic violence unleashed by Bodoland proponents. Hundreds of them were killed and several lakh forced to live in relief camps in the 1990s.

“Now development is our first and last priority. Trust me, I am yours. When you have decided to shun the path of bombs and guns, I will do everything to ensure that not even a thorn pricks you,” he said.

“There are no losers, everybody has won. But first, this is the victory of peace, of humanism,” he said of the accord and noted it will benefit both the Bodos and non-Bodos, who have often been in conflict.

The area under the Bodo Territorial Region governed by a council will be expanded, he said.

In an apparent effort to allay fears of non-Bodos, the prime minister said the Centre will work expeditiously to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord once the high-powered committee submits its report.

The clause envisaged that constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.

“I have complete faith that the Bodoland Territorial Council will create a development model based on inclusivity that will give economic progress a new dimension in consonance with ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas’,” he said.

Targeting the previous non-BJP Governments, Modi said they avoided trying to find solutions to intractable issues and let them fester.

“Nobody wanted to touch North-East with a bargepole. They thought there’s trouble, there’s violence. Quell it with force. This alienated people who lost their faith in democracy and the Constitution,” he said, adding for his Government North-East was a priority area.

Modi said he created a roster of his Ministers who would visit the region every 10-15 days, listen to the problems of people and resolve them.

Speaking about his Government’s attempts to tackle insurgency in the North-East, Modi said the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) was banned since 1997 and was using violent tactics for years.

The Government got in touch with the organisation through interlocutors and began talks with them in

2015.

“Last year, the Government signed a pact with them. They agreed to accept the Indian Constitution and returned to mainstream,” he said. The Bru-Reang crisis was also resolved a few days ago after another historic agreement. Thousands of families will now have homes and will live in peace after a conflict that festered for about two-and-a-half decades, he said.

The Prime Minister said that the combined central allocation to the eight states of the region went up to a staggering Rs 3 lakh crore under the 14th Finance Commission, after his Government was formed,from Rs 90,000 crore under the 13th Finance Commission.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/come-back--celebrate-life--modi-tells-insurgents.html
117,08-2-20,Plea for fresh death warrants dismissed,"A Delhi court on Friday dismissed Tihar jail authorities' plea seeking fresh date for execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear on February 11 the Centre's plea challenging the Delhi High Court's verdict that had dismissed its petition against the stay on execution of the four convicts.

In Delhi High Court, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana took note of the court's February 5 order permitting the convicts to exercise their legal remedies within one week.

""It is criminally sinful to execute the convicts when law permits them to live. The High Court on February 5 has permitted the convicts, in the interest of justice, to exercise their legal remedies within one week from same order,"" the court said.

""I concur with counsel for convicts that death warrants cannot be executed merely on basis of surmises and conjectures. The application is bereft of merit. Same is dismissed. State is liberty to move appropriate application as and when required,"" the judge said.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

In the application, the authorities said the President has already dismissed the mercy petitions of three convicts and that no application by any of the four is currently pending before any court.

Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition -- the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. Pawan also has the option of filing a mercy plea.

The authorities had also informed the court about Delhi High Court's February 5 order which directed the convicts to take steps within a week, if they wished, to avail any remedy available under the law.

""It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that, keeping in view a week's time given to the convicts by high court, the fresh dates for execution of death warrants...May kindly be fixed specifying the date and time for execution/ hanging of convicts Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh and Akshay in the interest of justice,"" the application had said.

The warrants, issued by the trial court on January 7, were later postponed ""sine die"" by it on January 31, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks.

The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Six people including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile -- were named as accused. The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013.

Ram Singh, the prime accused, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years.

The juvenile was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. He, when released, was 20 years old.

Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were sentenced to death in September 2013 by the trial court.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plea-for-fresh-death-warrants-dismissed.html

With this decision the SC has quashed the decision of Uttarakhand HC in Gyanchand case. The Uttarakhand government had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the SC against the HC order.

The SC had completed the hearing in the case on January 15 and had kept its decision reserved. The order of SC has now paved the way for promotions in government jobs of Uttarakhand. The SC ordered triggered a wave of celebration among the employees belonging to general and OBC categories.

On hearing about the order, large number of employees congratulated the President of the association of general, OBC employees association, Deepak Joshi and other office bearers for the victory. Expressing satisfaction on the order of SC, the general secretary of the Rajya Karmchari Sanyukt Parishad, Arun Pandey said that the SC has stamped its approval on the notion that benefit of reservation should be extended only once.

He said that during the process of recruitment, the benefit of reservation is extended as per the norms but reservation in promotions was also being given which was against the principle of equality and was creating discrepancies in the system.

The police have arrested the accused SDM Anil Sapkale and the Sagar divisional commissioner has suspended him with immediate effect. Five others including a BJP leader too has been arrested by police in connection to the fake assault on the SDM office days ago.

On Wednesday, Sapkale’s office and car were attacked by unidentified goons who had fired shots in the air. The Officer had escaped unhurt in the incident.

Police after finding vital proofs of the SDM being the mastermind of the incident arrested him on Friday and those among others arrested include Krishna University Chairman Pushpendra Singh Gautam, BJP minority cell office bearer Javed Akhtar and three others.

Gautam wanted to harm his rival and Khajuraho University’s Abhay Singh Bhadauria and hatched the conspiracy of attack with Sapkale.

Being a high profile and sensitive issue the police minutely probed the details and scanned all the available call detail records which suggested money deal between Sapkale and Gautam on phone, Superintendent of Police Tilak Singh Lodhi told.

124,08-2-20,"Vijayan: PM’s reference to protests in Kerala factually incorrect, condemnable","A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a reference to the Kerala Chief Minister’s statement on extremists infiltrating anti-CAA protests here, Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday hit back saying it was ‘factually incorrect’ and ‘condemnable’.

In a blistering attack on opposition parties on their attempt to ‘misguide and misinform’ the nation on the new citizenship law, Modi had said Vijayan was on one hand warning about extremist elements infiltrating anti-CAA protests and on the other his party was supporting them in Delhi.

Modi had made the statement during his debate on the motion to thank the President for his address to the joint sitting of both houses of Parliament on Monday.

The Kerala Chief Minister took exception to Modi’s statement and demanded that the PM ‘rectify’ his statement.

“The statement of the PM in Rajya Sabha with regard to Kerala was factually incorrect and condemnable,” Vijayan wrote in his Facebook post.

The CPI(M) veteran said Kerala was “not ready to give up the collective movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act” to those who have ‘sectarian and communal’ agenda. “We have warned and taken guard against those who try to infiltrate the people’s movement. The CAA, which is being implemented by the RSS with a communal objective, has to be dealt with power of secularism.”

“It is in this regard, the state has become a model to the country. The secular Kerala has the strength to stop the communal elements who are trying to infiltrate the people’s movement,” Vijayan said.

It was with ‘conviction’ that he had mentioned in the state Assembly about the infiltration of extremist organisations like Socialist Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in protests against the amended citizenship law.

“My mentioning of the involvement of extremist organisations like SDPI during some anti-CAA protests was with full conviction.”

“The state has faith in its secular fabric to deal with the communal agenda of the Sangh Parivar. We will fight those who attempt to communalise our protests. The Prime Minister must rectify his statement defaming the protest movement of Kerala,” Vijayan demanded.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/vijayan--pm---s-reference-to-protests-in-kerala-factually-incorrect--condemnable.html

“For thousands of years, outsiders ruled us and ensured that we remain weak... Now, the BJP wants to confer citizenship to outsiders through CAA and NRC. These people (BJP) want to destroy the Constitution to remain in power,” he said.

Chullyu, is a serene village located around 115 km from Itanagar and 30 km from Ziro, a popular tourist place. Chullyu is inhabited by environment conscious tribal population, mostly involved in organic farming of high quality fruits and vegetables etc.

Chairman KVIC, Shri VK Saxena said, “Aligned with the vision of our Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the KVIC seeks to reach out and empower those regions of the country which have never been approached before by earlier Governments. It is our endeavor to bring an actual change in the country by reviving the rural talents and giving rural citizens an equal opportunity. This is exactly what Bapu would have wanted KVIC to do.”

After a high level meetings by the Chairman KVIC with the Governor Shri B.D.Mishra, the Minister of Agriculture Shri Tage Taki and the Chief Secretary Shri Naresh Kumar, the KVIC is planning to create job opportunities on mission mode in Arunachal Pradesh.

Highlighting the untapped potential and a planned development of the region Saxena said, “The residents of Chullyu not only adorn Khadi as their daily wear, but also use environmental friendly skills for cooking and serving food in banana leaves, using bamboo made glasses and cups for drinking water and tea etc. in their day-to-day lives, which is quiet impressive. The villagers usually purchase their Khadi fabric from Assam, as there is no Khadi production unit in the state.”

“Chullyu, being located at the foothills of Himalayas has the potential of producing premium quality honey. The Khadi spinning and weaving center will fulfill the local needs of the villagers and also generate sustainable source of income at their doorsteps. Khadi Center will start with 25 Charkhas and 5 Looms, which will provide direct employment to 35 women. Bee Keeping activities in the village will start by providing 200 Bee Boxes to 20 farmers after training.

132,08-2-20,Nilgiri leopards on brink of extinction,"Leopard, one of the most widely seen wildlife animal in the forests in and around the Nilgiris, face the possibilities of extinction in the near future because of the reckless and ruthless driving by motorists using the scenic Coimbatore-Nilgiri road.

Last three years saw 12 beautiful and innocent leopards falling prey to the high speed vehicles during day and night. What makes the death of these animals tragic is the fact that they are the most soft natured and mild mannered of the wild animals seen along this stretch.

“There are no instances of the leopards attacking or threatening the human species at any point of time. Why they are seen outside the reserve forests is only because of their shrinking habitats due to human invasion,” said T Sadiq Ali, wild life conservationist based in Nilgiris.

He said the leopards, whose biological name is Prionailurus bengalensis, could be easily mistaken for leopard cubs with which the cats do not have any behavioural similarities. “They have the colour and features, especially the dots and stripes of leopards but they are only as big as domestic cats. The animals are mild mannered and its what make them so dear to wildlife enthusiasts,” said Sadiq Ali.

T Mukundan Menon, wild life enthusiast and a frequent traveler along the stretch was shocked to see the body of a leopard cat on Monday. “This is nothing but cold blooded murder. A little bit of attention and kindness could have saved the lives of the dead animal,” said Menon.

He said the Coonoor Range in the Nilgiris Forest Division is a major habitat of the leopard cats. “These are small animals weighing 3-4 kgs unlike the Leopards which weigh 20-30 kg. These small animals feed on small prey like rats, lizards, frogs, fish, birds and even grass. These cute creatures are frequently run-over by speeding automobiles,” said Menon who also said that even big Leopards are not safe from the speeding vehicles.

Both Menon and Ali were of the view that a major awareness programme should be launched at the earliest to make sure that no wild animals are killed by speeding automobiles. “Left to them, these animals including the leopards are harmless. But what we see is that even elephants are getting mowed down by trucks and trains,” said Menon. He ;pointed out that the fur of Leopard Cats command big premium in global markets.

The animals are a visual treat because of their features and the manner in which they run and move around. Whether it is day or night, the leopard cats moving along the highways is one of the main attractions in this stretch of the journey.

The decision by the forest department in Tamil Nadu to close the Gudalur-Bandipur road in the Nilgiris have paid rich dividends as the number of animals getting killed because of vehicles have come down drastically over the last two years, said forest officials.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nilgiri-leopards-on-brink-of-extinction.html
133,08-2-20,BJP leaders’ phones tapped under Fadnavis Govt: HM,"Four days after he ordered an investigation into the alleged tapping of phones of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress leaders by the previous Government, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday disclosed that the State Government had received new information that the phones of some BJP leaders were also being tapped by the Devendra Fadnavis dispensation and the matter was being probed.

Talking to mediapersons here, Deshmukh said: “We received several complaints about tapping of the phones of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress leaders in the run-up to the State Assembly polls. We have set up a two-member committee to probe the allegations. With the inquiry having begun, we have received more information that the phones of some BJP leaders too were being tapped. Hence, this will also be probed”.

Deshmukh also revealed that as per the new information, senior disgruntled BJP leader Eknath Khadse was among his party leaders whose phones were being tapped by the previous Devendra Fadnavis dispensation. “We have received a few letters in this regard. The allegations in these letters will also be investigated,” he said.

Though he has welcomed the probe ordered by the Uddhav Thackeray Government into the alleged phone tapping by the previous BJP Government, Khadse has said that he does not think that his phone was tapped during the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance Government.

Khadse — who was denied BJP ticket to contest the 2019 State Assembly polls from his home constituency of Muktainagar in Jalgaon district of north Maharashtra and whose daughter Rohini was defeated in the Assembly polls — has made over the past three years made no secret of his frustrations within the BJP.

Khadse has been in the doghouse ever since June 4, 2016, when he resigned from his post as the State Revenue Minister over irregularities in the purchase of a plot of land at Bhosari in Pune district. Later in May 2018, Maharashtra’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had reportedly given a clean chit to Khadse in the alleged Pune land scam case.

In the run-up to the Assembly polls, there was a considerable speculation that he might take stand against the BJP. There was likelihood of his phone having been tapped during this period.

Through a couple of tweets, Deshmukh had on Monday announced the setting up a two-member committee—comprising Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Shrikant Singh and Joint Commissioner of Intelligence Amitesh Kumar (IPS) — to probe the allegation of the tapping of the phones of senior political leaders like NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and some Congress leaders. He had said that the committee had been given six weeks’ deadline to complete the probe.

“Home Department has received many complaints from political parties & leaders about misuse of Phone Tapping by previous Governments. This abuse of power violates right to freedom & privacy as enshrined in the Constitution of India and is a National Security Threat,” Deshmukh had tweeted.

In his second tweet, the State Home Minister had said: “Hence a comprehensive inquiry will be conducted within 6 weeks by a 2 member committee of Shri Shrikant Singh (IAS) ACS Home & Shri Amitesh Kumar (IPS) Joint Commissioner of Intelligence”.

It may be recalled that after the allegations of phone tapping surfaced in the third week of January, Deshmukh had directed the Cyber cell of the State police to look into allegations of the phone tapping ordered by the previous BJP-headed saffron alliance Government ahead of the recent State Assembly.

On his part, Senior Congress leader and State PWD Minister Ashok Chavan had rooted for a comprehensive high-level inquiry into all aspects of the alleged phone tapping scam.

State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had said then: “Ahead of the recent State Assembly polls, the previous BJP-led government had ordered tapping the phones of senior NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena leaders to snoop into who they were talking to. The allegation is also that the BJP-led government had – using the government funds -- sent a team of officials to Israel to buy spyware which the BJP used it to tap and used the conversations on mobile phones of our leaders for political purposes. We have started investigations into the alleged phone-tapping”.

The ordering of an inquiry into the alleged tapping of phones of Pawar, Uddhav, Raut and others comes in the wake of a sensational allegation made by senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh that the Maharashtra government officials were involved in phone surveillance and that some state government officials had visited Israel and held talks with the Israeli firm NSO. NSO creates Pegasus, a spyware which WhatsApp recently revealed had been used extensively to extract private phone conversation data.

Reacting to the inquiry instituted by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government into the alleged phone tapping ordered allegedly by the previous government led by him, Fadnavis had said: “It is not Maharashtra’s culture to tap the phones of political opponents. (Referring to Digvijay Singh) the entire country knows about the person who has complained about the phone tapping. The State government is free to order an inquiry into the alleged phone by any agency. People of Maharashtra know the truth. At that time, Shiv Sena’s man was the Minister of State for Home”.

“My only request to this government is that it should conduct the inquiry into the alleged phone tapping forthwith and place the report before the people. If the government wants to send to someone Israel to conduct an inquiry, it can do so,” Fadnavis had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-leaders----phones-tapped-under-fadnavis-govt--hm.html
134,08-2-20,Govt to send notices to 58 AMU students for protests on campus,"District authorities here have asked the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) for the home addresses and other details of 58 students to serve them notices over the participation in anti-CAA agitation on the campus.

Police said the students had violated restrictions imposed under section 144 of the CrPC, which prevents gatherings of five or more people at a place.

Additional city Magistrate Ranjit Singh on Friday said, “Before issuing such notices, we need family details and hence, we want the university to send us the documents.”

The notices will be served under section 107 of the CrPC (security for keeping peace).

When contacted, an AMU spokesman said, “I am not aware of this matter and awaiting details.”

The varsity was closed early for winter vacations from December 16 last year, a day after students clashed with police during a protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on campus.

The university was to reopen on January 6 but the vacation was extended owing to persisting tension over the changes in the citizenship law.

Students have been boycotting classes seeking the withdrawal of “false cases” against those who took part in protests against the CAA on December 15.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-to-send-notices-to-58-amu-students--for-protests-on-campus.html
135,08-2-20,TMC relaxed as Governor reads speech ratified by Govt,"Political pundits heaved a sigh of relief for the first time in many months with Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar chooses to avoid controversy even as he read out the same speech ratified by the Mamata Banerjee Government with whom he has not been having a smooth relationship.

A day earlier making loaded statements that he would create ‘history’ while delivering his inaugural speech at the Budget Session, Dhankhar had said that like the State Government which had its own right to speak its mind he too preserved his rights to express his views.

While in the face of it all his sticking to the written speech averted any chance of a showdown with the Government, Opposition Congress and the Left Front promptly questioned the “timid surrender by the Chief Minister before the Governor who apparently forced the State Government to avoid mentioning the key issues including faulty economic policies pursued by the Centre, unemployment, moribund condition of tea industry etc.”

In the hour-long speech, which was not telecast live by the State Government the Governor said how intolerance, bigotry and hatred had become the ‘new norms in the country.’

He said “at present, our country is at a critical juncture. The basic values and principles of our Constitution are under challenge... Spreading misinformation is the order of the day and rejection of all forms of dissent is the new fashion in the name of patriotism,” adding how lives were lost following panic over the invoking of National Register for Citizens.

Though according to inside reports the Governor had wanted the statements to be altered he finally read out the State Government’s views saying, “there is a general air of intolerance, bigotry and hatred that is straining the variegated thread of unity tying together all the linguistic, religious and ethnic diversities in the country,” adding the State Government was “strongly against division of people in the name of steps like National Population Register (NPR), NRC or CAA.”

Soon after making the speech the Governor wrote on the Twitter that he “delivered the address in the high traditions of constitution. I do hope all will pay due obeisance to the constitution. This is the only way to serve the people and enhance democratic values. I urge those in authority to desist from methodology not sanctified by constitution.”

The political quarters had kept their fingers crossed after the Governor had on Thursday said that he would create history while reading out the speech expecting he might deviate from the Government version to add in his own rectifications.

In fact this was the reason why the State Government for the first time in many years did not allow direct telecast of the Governor’s speech, sources said. “This was also the reason why a number of legislators had come to the State Assembly donning clothes written anti-CAA, anti-NRC slogans on them.

The Governor had earlier suggested certain changes in the speech with the State refused to do and finally on the stand of the State Government on the issue was communicated to Raj Bhavan on the evening of February 6, 2020, his Press Secretary Manab Banerjee said.

Opposition Leader Abdul Mannan wondered why the speech did not mention the failed economic policies of the Centre.

“Why there was no reference to the failed economic policy which is the sources of all the problems today. Why is there no reference to the moribund tea industry, why there is no reference to the indiscriminate sale of public sector undertakings. Why is there no mention of the falling employment graph. This because there is a clear understanding between the two sides,” Mannan said.

The relationship between the Governor and Chief Minister had been anything but cordial ever since he ignored her advice and personally went to Jadavpur University to rescue Union Minister Babul Supriyo who was gheraoed by the students on September 19 last year.

Subsequently the Governor repeatedly accused the State Government and its top officials of non-cooperation while Banerjee alleged that the Central Government was trying to run a parallel Government through him in the State.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tmc-relaxed-as-governor-reads-speech-ratified-by-govt.html

Police said the rally was being held without permission, but the saffron party asserted that it has informed the authorities about it.

The Mamata Banerjee Government has started an ‘autocratic’ rule in West Bengal but the BJP cannot be intimidated, Vijayvargiya told reporters while being taken to a police vehicle at Talligunge Phari area.

“We were taking out a rally in support of the CAA which has received overwhelming support from all over the country. But the police of Mamata Banerjee is not allowing us to take out a peaceful, democratic rally,” said BJP’s West Bengal minder.

Vijayvargiya said they won’t resist being taken to the city police headquarters “as we believe in democratic protest.”

Police sources said the three, along with several supporters, were taken into custody as the party was organising the rally without permission.

137,08-2-20,"BJP Govt deadlier than coronovirus, says CPM leader","CPI(M) Tamil Nadu secretary K Balakrishnan on Friday described the BJP-led Government at the Centre as deadlier than the coronovirus.

With its 'anti-people' and 'pro-corporate' policies, a large section of the people was put to hardship and the Government has now become deadlier than the coronovirus, he told reporters here.

Stating that the Government has already given concession to the corporates, he said the recent budget proposals also favoured corporates, thus neglecting the common man. Besides, the allocation for health, education, rural development and MGNERA was drastically brought down, he said adding that the Government was trying to privatise public sectors like the LIC.

To protest against these policies, the Left parties would distribute pamphlets across the state from February 12 to 18, he said.

To a query on the raid on film actorVijay, Balakrishan said it was not wrong to conduct raids, but the way in which it was conducted was wrong.

To another question on super star Rajinikanth supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act, he said the BJP would not be able to gain foothold in Tamil Nadu and that the party was speaking through the actor.

“We will launch our statewide agitation against CAA from Saturday, because it is unconstitutional. The Act will bring disastrous effects on people, mainly those living in the north eastern region,” he told reporters here on Friday.

139,08-2-20,Radicalised youth played head and tail coin trick before placing grenade,"Before tossing a grenade to target security personnel in Partap Park area of Srinagar on February 2, a radicalised group of students had played a ‘head and tail coin trick’ before deciding the name of the grenade thrower.

These students had possibly taken a cue from a famous character of Jai, played by Amitabh Bacchan in yesteryear bollywood blockbuster, ‘Sholay’

Two CRPF jawans and six civilians had received injuries in the grenade attack.

According to police, all three arrested students were working at the behest of their handlers belonging to Pro-Pakistan Jaish-e- Mohammad terror outfit and were behind the grenade attack on security personnel in Partap Park area.

The JeM associates were identified as Naveed Ul Lateef, Shakeel Ahmad Band and Shamshad Manzoor. Two of them hailed from Pulwama and another from Shopian, police said.

Addressing a press conference after busting the JeM module in Srinagar, Senior Superintendent of Police, Srinagar Dr Haseeb Mughal told reporters, “before targeting security personnel two radicalised youth had even played a ‘coin trick’ before deciding who will target the security forces”.

Elaborating on their modus operandi, Dr Mughal told reporters “soon after the partial restrictions were lifted and mobile internet services were restored in Kashmir valley these three students got in touch with their handlers via VPN network and received orders from them to target security personnel”. SSP Srinagar said, “the motive behind was to disrupt peaceful life activities in Srinagar”.

Dr Hasseb Mughal told reporters, “before targeting CRPF personnel in Partap Park area, these youth had done comprehensive recee of the area”. He said, they targeted CRPF personnel when they were off duty and washing their hands after having food. He said all three youth behind the grenade attack were highly radicalised.

140,08-2-20,SC appoints retired Kerala HC judge for making inventory of ornaments at Sabarimala,"The Supreme Court on Friday appointed retired Kerala High Court judge CN Ramachandaran Nair to prepare an inventory and valuation report of ornaments of Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala temple that are claimed by different sects of the Pandalam Royal family.

The top court said he can take assistance of a jeweller for valuation of the sacred ornaments and should file its report in sealed cover. A Bench of Justices NV Ramana, Ajay Rastogi and V Ramasubra-manian said, “We are only worried about the safety and security of the sacred ornaments”.

The top court also requested Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Kerala Government, to use his “good office” in finding an amicable resolution to ongoing dispute between warring faction of the royal family.

It also asked Venugopal to make submission on next date of hearing of the matter about the safety and security of the ornaments. It granted four more weeks to the State Government to prepare a draft legislation regarding the administration of the historic Sabarimala temple.

At the outset, Venugopal said that similar issue arose in the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, where the apex court had constituted a committee to assess the jewellery after an inventory was prepared.

“The Government first needs to have the list of ornaments of Lord Ayyappa, which are kept in custody of Pandalam Raja. At present the list we have is very general in nature, which does not say how much carat gold is there or diamond is of how much carat. We also need to have a jeweller to do the inventory with each and every specification,” Venugopal said.

The Bench said the problem is the parties do not agree that the ornaments belong to Lord Ayyappa and they claim that they belongs to the royal family. The Attorney General responded, “This is what precisely happened in Padmanabhaswamy Temple case as there was dispute over the ownership of jewellery. No individual can claim that the jewellery is not of the deity”.

141,08-2-20,Coal scam: SC grants time to Centre to suggest names for special public prosecutor,"The Supreme Court on Friday gave the Centre time till February 10 to suggest names of lawyers for appointing a special public prosecutor to conduct trials for the Enforcement Directorate in money laundering cases related to the coal block scam.

A Bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justice Deepak Gupta was considering the plea of senior advocate RS Cheema, who wanted to be relieved as the prosecutor in money laundering cases.

The top court appointed Cheema Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) in coal block scam cases in 2014.

The Bench did not seem to be in agreement with the suggestion of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that former Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh be appointed the special prosecutor to conduct trial in ED cases pertaining to coal scam cases. “We need a trial court lawyer who has been conducting trials,” the Bench said, adding that “the other lawyer” suggested by Cheema seemed to be more appropriate. Sources told PTI that Cheema has suggested the name of lawyer Satish Tamta for the job.

“The other name seems to be more appropriate,” the bench said and gave the Centre time till February 10 to suggest names for this purpose. It said the Bench will not assemble for this purpose again.

Cheema had said that he would like to continue as CBI’s special prosecutor in the coal scam cases, but would not want to be the SPP in money laundering matters as there was shortage of law officers assisting him in such cases.

The top court had on December 9 asked the solicitor general and Cheema to give names of advocates who can be appointed the SPP for ED matters.

142,08-2-20,"52,000 farmers to receive damages for crop loss in Jammu","Over 52,500 farmers will receive compensation of Rs 34 crore for the loss of their crops due to unseasonal heavy rainfall, wind and hailstorm in Jammu district, an official spokesman said on Friday.

“As many as 52,691 beneficiaries will receive compensation for their crops and total amount of over Rs 34 crore will be disbursed directly to the accounts of these beneficiaries,” the spokesman said.

The paddy crop spread over five lakh kanals (25,292.85 hectares) has been damaged by unseasonal heavy rainfall, wind and hailstorms last year in four tehsils of RS Pura, Suchetgarh, Bishnah and Marh.

Jammu Deputy Commissioner Sushma Chauhan visited RS Pura sub-division and inspected the progress of disbursement of compensation among farmers for crop loss.

During the tour, she visited RS Pura SDM office and was briefed about the details of the total amount disbursed among the farmers so far in his area of jurisdiction, the spokesman said.

He said the field functionaries of Revenue and Agriculture Department have collected data of crop loss and the compensation amount would be credited through Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT).

Chauhan directed the officers concerned to speed up the process of disbursement of compensation amount.

She also directed the J&K Bank officials to strengthen the staff and complete the process of disbursement within three days, the spokesman said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/52-000-farmers-to-receive-damages-for-crop-loss-in-jammu.html
143,08-2-20,Sedition charges being dished out like prasad: Kanhaiya,"CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar on Friday rued that sedition charges were being “distributed freely like prasad” though a police officer arrested along with terrorists was not deemed fit to be booked for treason.

The former JNU student leader, who was booked for sedition four years ago, was referring to suspended Jammu & Kashmir DSP Devinder Singh.

“Sedition charges are being distributed freely like prasad. Social workers are being booked.... In Karnataka, school children have been booked for merely staging a play. And this is when a police official arrested along with terrorists is yet to be charged with the same,” he said while addressing a rally here as part of his state-wide “Jan Gan Man Yatra” against the CAA-NPR-NRC issue.

Kumar, who made an unsuccessful electoral debut in the Lok Sabha polls last year against BJP's Giriraj Singh, termed the saffron party as 'Godsewadi', followers of Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse.

“These Godsewadis, these rioters have placed guns in the hands of youths while (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah has secured the plum post of BCCI secretary for his son.

“The people in power send their children to Oxford, Cambridge and other elite institutions abroad while the ordinary young men and women in the country have to contend with an educational system wherein a three-year degree course takes five years to get completed,” he said.

A person who becomes a member of any legislative body for just one term is guaranteed a handsome pension for life, while Government employees get post-retirement benefits irregularly after a lifetime of service, Kanhaiya said and termed this “unfair”.

Charging the NDA government with adopting a “provoke and mislead” policy, he wondered why the need for a fresh amendment was felt by the Centre despite the citizenship law having been amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government.

Kanhaiya sought to defend the use of epithets like “takloo” (the bald one) and “tadipaar” for Shah (an allusion to the Supreme Court order whereby the BJP leader was asked to stay out of Gujarat a decade ago) by claiming “I do so to make things easier to understand. I do not wish to use foul language against anybody.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sedition-charges-being-dished-out-like-prasad--kanhaiya.html

The Centre stated this in their counter before the bench, comprising Justices R Subbiah and R Pongiappan when the Habeas Corpus Petition by Nalini Sriharan, contending that she was illegally detained in Vellore Prison from September 10, 2018 since the Tamil Nadu Governor has not acted on the cabinet decision of September 9, 2018 to release her under Article 161 of the Constitution, came up beore it.

The counter by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs said four of the seven life convicts, Nalini, Santhan, Murugan and Arivu, filed mercy petitions before the Governor under Article 161 (power of the Governor to grant pardons and to suspend, remit or commute sentences in certain cases).

The Governor, it said, commuted the death sentence of Nalini to life imprisonment and rejected the other three.

The counter said the Ministry received the mercy petitions of the other three on May 4,2000 and these were rejected by the President on August 3 2011.

The decision was communicated to the Tamil Nadu Government on August 12 2011.

The three then moved the Madras High Court challenging the rejection order and this was subsequently transferred to the Supreme Court, it said. The Apex Court on February 18 2014 commuted the death sentence of the three to life imprisonment.

Based on this order, the Tamil Nadu government on February 19 2014 proposed to remit the sentences of all these convicts and the Union Government was requested to convey their views within three days, the counter said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/governor-has-discretion-to-decide-on-mercy-petition.html

147,08-2-20,Citizens demand to drop sedition charges against 51 persons,"Nearly 1600 citizens from various walks of life, including academics, journalists, film personalities, lawyers, activists, students, professors, doctors and artists, on Friday demanded that the sedition charges slapped against 51 persons, including activist Urvashi Chudawala, for allegedly raised pro-Sharjeel Imam slogans at a rally held in Mumbai on February 1, be dropped.

After some videos of the group raising slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam at Saturday’s rally went viral, the police had on February 3 registered cases under section 124-A (Sedition) of the Indian Penal Code against 51 persons, including activist Chudawala.

At a rally organised by the Queer Azadi Mumbai (QAM), a collective of various LGBT groups at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai, some of the participants raised slogans in favour of Sharjeel Imam, who has been arrested on charges of sedition for provoking people to try to cut off north eastern states from rest of the country.

The group was allegedly carrying posters of Sharjeel's pictures and raised slogans promising to complete his unfulfilled task.

The filing of FIR had come in the wake of former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya lodging a complaint with the Azad Maidan police, demanding strong action against those involved in the anti-national activities at Azad

Maidan.

In a joint statement issued to the media on Friday, the citizens from various walks of life said: “The charges of sedition are baseless and deserve to be condemned. This FIR is an act of political vendetta by right-wing politicians who have tried to hijack Pride to suit their agenda in the run-up to the Delhi elections. The systematic targeting of a young trans student, Kris Chudawala (referred to by their dead name in the FIR), is malicious and unnecessary”.

“By distorting the intent and taking one slogan out of context, politicians are using the same strategy they tried to use at JNU, at the Gateway protests, and at Shaheen Bagh. By picking on one person, they have shown that this FIR is part of a continuous attack on student voices across the country,” the signatories to the statement said.

“We cannot fall for their propaganda. The Supreme Court of India has laid down strict guidelines about the definition of sedition. This FIR clearly violates those guidelines. As allies and members of a community that fought against a colonial law, Section 377, we cannot support the persecution of LGBTQIA+ individuals under sedition - another colonial law,” the signatories said.

“Pride has always been about protest and celebration. We will continue to stand up against the persecution of oppressed groups everywhere - because, as queer people, we know what oppression looks and feels like,” they said.

“As citizens of India, we demand that this FIR against Kris Chudawala and others be dropped immediately. Further, as queer individuals and allies, we ask that their dead name or photo not be used and that their right to privacy remain respected and protected, “ the signatories said.

The signatories included aademics like Uma Chakravarti and Gautam Bhan, journalists like Pamela Philipose and Geeta Seshu, those in the entertainment industry like Aditi Mittal, Anjum Rajabali and Onir, lawyers like Arvind Narrain and Vandita Morarka, activists like Teesta Setalvad, Kalyani Menon-Sen, Abha Bhaiya, Pawan Dhall, N Sarojini, Divya Kandukuri, L Ramakrishnan, and Bittu KR, students, professors, mental health professionals, doctors, & artists.

149,08-2-20,Yet another blatant illustration of Centre’s high-handedness: NC,"The National Conference on Friday condemned the slapping of the Public Safety Act (PSA) against party vice president Omar Abdullah, general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar and others, saying the ‘atrocious’ move is yet another blatant illustration of the Centre’s high-handedness.

Former Jammu & Kashmir Chief Ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were on Thursday night booked under the stringent PSA, barely hours before their six-month-long ‘preventive detention’ was to come to an end.

NC leader and former minister Sagar and PDP leader Sartaj Madani were also booked under the PSA by the J&K administration on Thursday.

“The measure debunks the claim of the BJP-led central government on restoration of normalcy in J and K. The present situation in J and K is far from normal,” NC leaders Muhammad Akbar lone, Hasnain Masoodi and Imran Nabi Dar said in a joint statement.

Jitendra Kumar and his brother Dheeraj, alias Brijmohan, alias Brij, alias Saddam, both residents of Sarangpur village of Rajgarh district in Madhya Pradesh, were held guilty under sections of the IPC and the POCSO Act, and sent to jail for the remainder of their natural lives on Thursday, special public prosecutor Vijay Kachawa said.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 56,000 on each of them. Their mother, Bhanwaribai, alias Muskan, who was accused of conspiring and cooperating in the crime, was, however, acquitted by the court, he added.

151,08-2-20,SC mulls to stop kids from stir sites,"The Supreme Court on Friday took cognisance on its own to “stop involvement of children and infants in demonstrations” following the death of an infant on January 30 at Shaheen Bagh here.

The apex court website showed that the issue would be taken up for hearing on February 10 by a Bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde.

The matter assumes importance as a letter was recently written by a 12-year-old National Bravery Award winner to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) seeking directions to prevent children from participating in demonstrations as it “amounts to cruelty”.

A 4-month-old baby had passed away in his sleep on the night of January 30 after returning from Shaheen Bagh where his parents had taken him during the anti-CAA protest.

Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, a recipient of the 2019 Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) National Bravery Award, said in the letter to the CJI’s office that the parents of the baby and the organisers of the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh had “failed” to protect the rights of the kid, resulting in his death.

Sadavarte, a student of Class 7 from Mumbai, has also alleged that the protesters at Shaheen Bagh include infants and children, who are exposed to conditions unfavourable to them, which is violation of their rights.

“The Shaheen Bagh protesters at New Delhi, include women, senior citizens, newborns and children, ignoring the fact that new born babies need a lot of attention and care as they cannot express their pains in particulars thereafter also ignoring the conditions unfavourable to the children, they are brought to the protest place which is violative of their child rights and natural justice,” the letter said.

It also alleged that the police failed in stopping children from participating in such agitations harmful to their health. It expressed surprise over the fact that even the death certificate of the 4-month-old does not mention the cause of death.

156,08-2-20,FinMin expects at least 80% of taxpayers to move to new tax regime,"The finance ministry expects at least 80 per cent of the taxpayers to move to the new income tax regime, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said on Friday. The Budget 2020-21 has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments.

""We feel at least 80 per cent of the people will come to the new scheme,"" Pandey said during an interaction with opinion makers in the financial capital.

He said the government did an analysis of 5.78 crore taxpayers before the budget and found that 69 per cent of them would save on tax payouts under the new system, while 11 per cent were found to be favouring the old regime.

Of the remaining 20 per cent taxpayers, there will be people who want to avoid the hassle of paperwork and may wish to switch over to the new regime, he said.

The Government was in a “catch-22” situation because it wanted to lower tax outgoes for the people and ensure that it eases the process of tax, but did not want to disturb the system due to which it made a beginning by giving people options, he said. He noted that corporates were also given similar option when the taxes were reduced in September, and that 90 per cent of corporates have embraced the exemption-free approach for lower tax rate now.

“A large majority of people will find the new regime advantageous,” Pandey said.

The government introduced new tax slabs with reduced rates for an annual income of up to Rs 15 lakh for those foregoing exemptions and deductions under a simplified tax regime. The new income tax system is optional and a taxpayer can choose to remain in the existing regime with exemptions and deductions.

Those earning up to Rs 5 lakh will not pay any tax either in the old regime or in the new regime.

""To provide significant relief to individual taxpayers and to simplify the income tax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo all the deductions and exemptions,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharmam said in the budget speech.

Under the new tax proposal, people with an annual income of up to Rs 2.5 lakh will not have to pay any tax. For income between Rs 2.5 lakh to 5 lakh, the tax rate (as earlier) is 5 per cent.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/finmin-expects-at-least-80--of-taxpayers-to-move-to-new-tax-regime.html

158,08-2-20,No windfall gains to pvt insurers under PMFBY: Govt,"The Centre on Friday told Parliament that private insurance companies have not made ""windfall gains"" under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) as the overall claim ratio between 2016-17 and 2018-19 was as high as 81 per cent.

Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, in his written reply to the Rajya Sabha, also made it clear that the difference between premium collected and claims paid is not the margin or profit for these firms. The reinsurance and administrative cost totalling 10 to 12 per cent of gross premium also has to be borne by the insurance companies.

The government is implementing two crop insurance schemes of the PMFBY and the Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).

According to provisions of the PMFBY and the RWBCIS, the minister said premium from farmers along with central and state government share in premium subsidy is paid to the concerned insurance company for acceptance of risk and payment of claims as per provision of scheme.

""Insurers save premium in good seasons/years and pay high claims, if any in bad years from the savings made in the good years,"" he said adding that crop is all about spreading the risk over the period and over the area.

In spite of overall good monsoon during first three years of the implementation of PMFBY, the claim ratio during 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 was about 77 per cent, 86 per cent and 80 per cent (provisional), respectively, he said.

Tomar further said that overall claim ratio for the three years combined (2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19) comes to about 81 per cent. ""But, the farmers in most affected areas/states received higher claims.""

""Hence, it is not correct to say that private insurance companies have made windfall gains under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY),"" the minister said.

In this regard, it is also informed that the difference between premium collected and claims paid is not the margin or profit for the insurance companies, he said.

The reinsurance and administrative cost totalling 10 to 12 per cent of gross premium also has to be borne by the insurance companies. Further, out of the total crop insurance business under the scheme, more than 50 per cent is shared by the 5 public sector insurance companies including Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd. (AIC), he added.

Placing the data before the Upper House, Tomar said the claim ratio was high at 209 per cent in Kerala, 136 per cent in Karnataka during kharif 2016, while the claim ratio was at 298 per cent in Tamil Nadu and 179 per cent in Andhra Pradesh during rabi 2016-17.

Similarly, during kharif 2017, the higher claim ratio was in the states of Chhattisgarh (452 per cent), Haryana (270 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (161 per cent) and Odisha (217 per cent). During the rabi 2017-18, high claim ratio states were Odisha (226 per cent), Tamil Nadu (148 per cent) and Chhattisgarh (109 per cent), he said.

Though complete data for the kharif 2018 season is not available, high claims ratio has been reported in states of Haryana (140 per cent), Uttarakhand (115 per cent) and Chhattisgarh (124 per cent), he added.

To a query if farmers are indifferent towards PMFBY, the minister replied in negative. ""No, sir.""

Due to the improved features of PMFBY, the minister said the coverage under the scheme has increased to 30 per cent of the gross cropped area from 23 per cent in 2015-16 under erstwhile schemes.

Participation of non-loanee farmers, for whom the scheme is voluntary, have also increased from 5 per cent under erstwhile schemes to 42 per cent (kharif 2019) under PMFBY showing the voluntary acceptability of the scheme, he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/no-windfall-gains-to-pvt-insurers-under-pmfby--govt.html

162,08-2-20,Budget 2020 provides ‘discreet and considered’ stimulus: FM,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the budget presented by her last week provides a “discreet and considered” stimulus.

Speaking to industry representatives in the financial capital, Sitharaman said the budget draws on experiences of all the past instances of a slowdown in growth where the government has had to provide for a booster.

It can be noted that some constituencies have expressed disappointment with the budget for not having any big announcements, especially at a time when growth has slipped to a decadal low.

“Based on the experiences that we had in the last round of government trying to provide stimulus, We’ve essentially made sure that we are doing it in a very discreet and considered manner,” Sitharaman said at the interaction.

“We kept the macroeconomic fundamentals in mind and made sure that the necessary stimulus which was the demand of the time, both for increasing consumption and also for ensuring investments in long-term asset building as a means to providing stimulus will be taken up,” she added.

Accompanied by all the secretaries in the ministry, Sitharaman said unlike the past instances of providing for a stimulus, the remedies that the budget have provided are “very focused, very clear that it is going in a well chalked out path with a clear intention of spending responsibly in building capital assets”.

She pointed out that the rural and farm sector had got attention through the 16-point agenda, startups have been given a fillip and infrastructure investments have also been taken up.

164,08-2-20,Tech firm Ericsson pulls out of big trade show due to virus,"Wireless equipment maker Ericsson is pulling out of the industry's top annual trade event due to the virus outbreak, while automakers are considering whether to reopen factory lines in China. Here is a look at the latest devlopments on how the virus is affecting global business:

Tech: Ericsson, one of the main suppliers of wireless networks and a rival to China's Huawei, is pulling out of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, this month.

The Swedish company said that because the show draws thousands of visitors, “even if the risk is low, the company cannot guarantee the health and safety of its employees and visitors.”

The organisers said Ericsson's decision will hurt the event but they do not plan to cancel it.

Huawei recently said this week it would still attend.

Automakers: Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co. Said Friday that sales in China in January by the company and its local partners fell 11.8 per cent from a year earlier to 118,143 vehicles due to the virus outbreak and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.

Nissan said earlier it was considering reopening most of its factories in China on Monday but would wait until at least February 14 for facilities in and around Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak.

Toyota said it was keeping its factories in China closed for an extra week, through February 16, and will decided then whether to resume production. Toyota Motor Corp. Has 12 plants in China, including four vehicle assembly plants.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/tech-firm-ericsson-pulls-out-of-big-trade-show-due-to-virus.html
165,08-2-20,Senators urge Trump Admin to ask India reduce hike in soda ash import duties,"A bipartisan group of six Senators has urged the Trump administration to work with the Indian Government to reduce its import tariff on US soda ash from 7.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.

In a letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the Senators said that thousands of US jobs relied on the soda ash industry and keeping tariffs low will help US workers and economy nationwide. The letter, dated February 3, was signed by Senators Mike Enzi, John Barrasso, Richard Blumenthal, David Perdue, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden. In October 2019, soda ash producers in India recommended doubling the tariff on soda ash imports from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent as part of the government's 'Make in India' policies.

""It is vital to fair trade that the GOI reject this blatant protectionism,"" the Senators wrote.

""A tariff reduction would principally benefit US exporters rather than other exporters such as those from China who produce more costly and environmentally-damaging synthetic soda ash. India's history of restricting US soda ash should no longer be tolerated,"" they said.

The Senators said natural US soda ash – which is a key component in glass, detergents and paper – is the most competitive and environmentally-friendly soda ash in the world.

About 58 per cent of US soda ash production is exported. According to the Senators, because of the global rise in environmentally conscious policies and the thousands of US jobs dependent on soda ash, the US has prudent interests in keeping tariffs low with India and other nations.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/senators-urge-trump-admin-to-ask-india-reduce-hike-in-soda-ash-import-duties.html

Rimi, 46, a deputy to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was placed on the United States' most-wanted terrorist list after taking over al-Qaeda's Yemen affiliate in 2015.

US Government had offered a USD 10 million reward for information on Rimi.

“His death further degrades al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the global al-Qaeda movement, and it brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security,” Trump said on Thursday. He said the major counterterrorism operation was carried at his direction.

“Rimi joined al-Qaeda in the 1990s, working in Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden.

171,08-2-20,US warns Venezuela of consequences if Opp leader Juan Guaido harmed,"The United States has warned Venezuela's rulers of consequences if Opposition leader Juan Guaido is not allowed to return safely from a visit to Washington, where he enjoyed pledges of robust support.

In one sign that some saw as retaliation, authorities in Caracas threw into jail six oil executives with joint US and Venezuelan nationality, two months after allowing them to shift to house arrest.

Elliott Abrams, the US envoy leading the drive to oust leftist leader Nicolas Maduro, warned that the United States was “prepared” with unspecified actions if Guaido faces trouble.

“We hope that the regime makes the calculation, particularly after this trip, that the support for Guaido is strong and that the counter-reaction to any move against him would make it a mistake for the regime,” Abrams told reporters on Thursday.

“We're very concerned about it and we hope that he will return safely,” he said.

Guaido, who is considered interim president by the United States and most other Western and Latin American nations, vowed to keep up his campaign. “We are going to mobilize in the coming days in Venezuela,” Guaido told reporters after meeting the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro.

“Yes, there are risks.” Guaido last week met Venezuelans in Miami and then appeared as a surprise guest Tuesday at President Donald Trump's State of the Union address before Congress.

172,08-2-20,South Korea's #MeToo initiator slams top court,"The woman who started South Korea's #MeToo movement on Friday slammed the nation's highest court for quashing her abuser's conviction last month, saying the ruling effectively silenced whistleblowers and victims of sexual violence.

Seo Ji-hyun said she was groped by her superior Ahn Tae-geun at a funeral in 2010, and that he had her transferred from Seoul to a provincial position after she filed an internal complaint, blighting her career as a prosecutor.

She suffered in silence for years until she went public in a 2018 television interview, a rare move in a still conservative society where female victims of sexual assault are often reluctant to come forward for fear of shaming. It triggered a flood of similar accusations against powerful men in fields ranging from art and literature to politics and religion that grew into a South Korean #MeToo movement.

Some top male South Korean figures including former presidential contender Ahn Hee-jung and once-celebrated theatre director Lee Yoon-taek have since been jailed.

But Seo's abuser, Ahn Tae-geun, walked free last month after his conviction for abuse of power was quashed by the country's top court, which ordered a retrial.

Ahn's release “practically paves the way for any companies or organisations to demote or fire internal whistle blowers as they please,” Seo told reporters in Seoul on Friday.

It could be used to “discourage any potential... Victims of workplace sexual assaults from coming forward and speaking truth”, she said.

Seo, who has been on leave since 2018, is to join the justice ministry this year.

“I'm still afraid of retaliation, because my abuser used to be the most powerful figure within the prosecution and those who follow him still remain” influential in the organisation, she said.

Ahn — who was separately fired for corruption in 2017 — could not be charged with sex abuse because the one-year statute of limitations had expired.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/south-korea-s--metoo-initiator-slams-top-court.html
173,08-2-20,Dutch euthanasia clinic sees jump in death requests,"The Netherlands' only euthanasia clinic said on Friday there had been a 22 percent jump in people wanting help to end their lives last year compared with 2018.

The Euthanasia Expertise Centre, which helps doctors to carry out assisted death, said the 3,122 requests it received last year was “far more than expected”. The Netherlands is one of a handful of countries where euthanasia is legal and by law all Dutch people older than 12 are entitled to ask for it -- but they first have to meet strict criteria.

“Every working day there are 13 people who come to us and say: 'I cannot go on any longer'. There is a great need,” said clinic manager Steven Pleiter. He said the number of requests remained stable in 2017 and 2018, but then accelerated last year.

Clinic spokeswoman Elke Swart told AFP one of the reasons for the spike could have been a court case against a doctor last year who euthanised a patient with severe dementia, “possibly scaring off doctors with similar requests who then referred their patients to our clinic”. The doctor was later acquitted on charges of having carried out the euthanasia without following strict guidelines.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/dutch-euthanasia-clinic-sees-jump-in-death-requests.html
174,08-2-20,"It’s a free, free world","Artist and LGBTQ+ activist Anwesh Sahoo says being a part of Pride Walks around the world made him acknowledge individual differences. By Team Viva

You have been a part of many pride movements... What has been the journey like so far?

I remember the first Pride Parade I went to was back in 2014. It was the Delhi Pride Parade and I had coloured my hair red. I was wearing the brightest colours. I remember walking into that space with a sense of fear and anxiety but a lot of excitement as well because it was the first time that I was going to meet my kind of people who would understand and resonate with my struggles. Walking into that space was so liberating for me and it was addictive. Hence, I have never missed a Pride Walk since.

I try to be a part of every walk that I can be throughout the country and I’ve been to around 10 different cities for Pride. Whenever you go to a different one, there are so many stories and different narratives to be a part of. It’s always such a powerful and liberating experience because this is a space where you not only get to know how to overcome your difficulties but also meet people who happen to be trans, intersex and listen to their stories too. A homosexual person’s journey is a little different from a transperson’s. So that’s where you get to know about it and also grow as a person.

What was your family’s response when you came out?

I came out to my parents through an article which I wrote in Pink Pages — the first LGBTQ magazine. When they read it, initially, there was an element of shock and they started questioning me about many things. ‘How did you get to know about being gay?’ ‘This must have been a Western influence.’ ‘This is not an Indian thing.’ My parents took some time, almost two to three years, to finally come to terms with my sexuality.

It’s been a journey for them and I understand that because it also took me very long as a person to accept my sexuality. When you grow up in a heteronormative system, you are constantly told that only a man and a woman can be together. It took so long for me to realise that even this was normal. I understood that it was going to take a lot longer for my parents who’d find it difficult to step out of their comfort zone and accept it. But I am grateful that over the years, my parents have evolved and they have really been willing to understand my point of view and story in general.

Who is that one person who has stood by you throughout your journey?

My sister. In fact, she was the first person I had come out to after I came out to myself. Even when she didn’t understand what homosexuality was, she stood by me and said, “It’s okay if you are different. I will stand by you, no matter what”. And she also took defended me in front of my parents. I’m glad that I always had her by my side.

What are the challenges you are facing even today?

Well, I think ignorance is probably the biggest. Not all people around me are always willing to understand or listen to such narratives and stories. There is so much happening around the LGBTQ+ community. There are films and series coming in where being gay is finally being talked about in a more encompassing way and is, in fact, being celebrated. There are no more narratives around how being gay is so difficult. Being queer is acceptable.

I still come across some people who, despite of so much information around them, choose to stay ignorant. Their attitude is like — “This is not about me so I don’t need to talk about it”. I think those are the kind of people who I want to reach out to and make them understand what exactly is the LGBTQ+ community all about; who do we stand for; who are we in general; and for that matter, even homosexual people don’t always understand what being trans or intersex is. There are different facets of the community, which even we, as its members, need to acknowledge, understand and educate other people about.

What is that one message you would like to give to people who have not come out of the closet?

Well, it’s always a better world on the other side of the closet. You are able to realise the fact that you are much more than your sexuality. For me, not just coming out but realising that I am so much more than my sexuality was huge. I think when you let go of that baggage, you can actually focus on more important issues in your life like having a proper job or having a partner or celebrating the more important events in your life than just being so low about the fact that nobody will think about you. It is important to get all those thoughts out of your mind and decide what you want from life.

How do you react to people who do not want to accept your sexual orientation?

Well, you have to listen. That is the only way you can do it. There is no way you can be angry about it. There are all kinds of people and sometimes we can just accept that all of us will have different opinions. You can’t expect others to think the same way as you do. There will always be a difference of viewpoints. You can only stand by what you believe in strongly and then assert it in every way possible.

I have seen so many people around me evolve over the years. My bullies have now become my friends. In fact, a lot of my bullies have come out as homosexuals, which is why they bullied me. It is of course a different narrative altogether but it’s good that my coming out has been able to change so many other people’s opinions about me and the community in general.

Tell us about the film Boy Erased. How do you connect with it?

I think what I would connect to the most is the central character, who is living with the fear of being outed and that was the point where I instantly connected with the character because I have lived with that feeling throughout my life, especially, teenage years.

There were some conversations happening when I was 16. I remember Neil Patrick Harris was outed that time and I was so scared that somewhere down the line, someone would out me as well or say that I was gay because even I was visibly ‘feminine’. I think that element was something that I could instantly recollect and over time I realised that there was nothing wrong in being homosexual. I realised that now is the time to acknowledge it, appreciate it, celebrate it and then take it forward in a very positive way in front of the people around me. That’s exactly the journey I associate myself with and with the central character of the film.

175,08-2-20,Musical Love Letters,"For some children, the legacy of their parents weighs heavy but Anoushka Shankar wears hers effortlessly. She accepts her father Pandit Ravi Shankar for who he was, both as an artist and a father. More importantly, the six-time Grammy Award-nominated sitarist, composer and producer has taken on the mantle of continuing his legacy and is celebrating his 100th birth anniversary with a worldwide tour of her latest EP. By Saimi Sattar

Deeply rooted in Indian music traditions, from the age of nine Anoushka studied exclusively under her father and guru, the late Ravi Shankar, and made her professional debut at 13. By 20, she had made three solo recordings and received her first Grammy® nomination, becoming the first Indian woman to be nominated for the award, and the youngest ever nominee in the World Music category.

She is the youngest and first female recipient of a British House of Commons Shield, been credited as an Asian Hero by TIME Magazine, has received two Eastern Eye Awards for Music and a Songlines Best Artist Award. Anoushka is the first Indian musician to perform live at the Grammy Awards. In an email conversation with Saimi Sattar, the artists talks about her father and the way music is changing in the digital age

What was the idea behind the birth centenary celebration?

A 100th birthday is something unique and special. At the time of my father’s passing, my mother and I were more focussed on our personal process of grieving and therefore did not arrange any big concerts for him. We knew from then that we would mark this centenary in a way that befits the legendary musician he was.

What will it consist of?

We are doing special concerts and events around the world. We kick off in London on what would’ve been my dad’s actual birthday with a gala concert, featuring many amazing musicians, and this will be the very first time my sister, Norah Jones and I perform together onstage. We then tour America. I’ll play more tribute concerts worldwide and multiple museums and cultural centres will feature exhibitions on my father. Ultimately, we will conclude the celebrations with special performances in India featuring special guests and some of my father’s incredible disciples.

Will there be any compositions of Pandit Ravi Shankar as well? Would you be approaching these by reinterpreting them?

Absolutely! We are showcasing many of his incredible compositions, both iconic and lesser-known.

Yes, we are making new arrangements to properly showcase all the incredible musicians who are taking part in the shows.

The albums, Loveable and Those Words came one after another as did Passages and Land of Gold. You seem to have bursts of creativity and are prolific...

Thanks! I do enjoy being involved in varied forms of music and performances. It keeps me learning and on my toes to switch between shows with orchestras like Passages or my father’s concertos, to big electronic shows like Land of Gold and then intimate experiences like Love Letters.

You performed live on the dias while the silent film Shiraz played at the back. It was unprecedented in the way that the performance and the film came together impeccably. How long did it take to put together? What attracted you to the project?

That was definitely the most challenging work I’ve ever done! Not just composing the music but preparing to be able to play it live, with thousands of very specific cues throughout the film that needed to be precisely hit by myself and all the musicians. It takes two hours of razor-sharp focus to play that show, but all the preparation in advance on notations and technical elements made a huge difference.

While writing the biography, Bapi..The Love of My Life did it give you better perspective from a distance?

There was no distance really. I was writing a biography on my living father though my eyes. It was a lovely thing to get to do though.

Panditji as a father and as a teacher. What is the difference?

He approached both roles with love, humility and humour.

Are your sons interested in music? Are they learning it?

My older son is learning piano, but it’s pretty casual at this point.

How have performing arts mutated in the digital age?

The last decade has seen a huge leap in performing standards. People expect impeccable sound and lighting across all genres now, whereas when I was a child feedback was such a common thing. Music, itself, has obviously changed hugely as well with all the tools at hand.

During international collaborations, what are the points of confluence of Indian classical with other forms that you find?

It depends what style and with whom I’m collaborating. And it also depends on my choices. There is an infinite gradient between one style and another, and whether to meet in the middle or closer to one’s roots is purely a matter of choice.

Sharing your story of abuse through One Billion Rising would have taken a lot of courage. What compelled you to speak out?

In the immediate aftermath of the horrific Delhi gang rape, I felt strongly that sharing my story of sexual abuse would be helpful to others and help push the dialogue around how prevalent sexual violence is even further. It was hard because there was no Me Too organisation at the time to feel a part of when speaking out. But it felt like the right thing to do.

176,08-2-20,Hollywood celebrates each other,"The Essence event affirms the power of Black women in the industry

Through laughs, tears and speeches that turned into sermons and affirmations, the overarching theme of this year’s star-studded Essence luncheon was that in an unforgiving industry that often overlooks, black women need no validation from Hollywood — or elsewhere — to appreciate their self-worth.

“No one in this room derived from luck. We are a powerful force field that derived from greatness,” said Captain Marvel actress Lashana Lynch at Essence Black Women in Hollywood event. “We work hard on our craft and our self-love, and have to remind ourselves daily that we deserve a seat at the table.”

Queen & Slim director Melina Matsoukas, another honouree, echoed Lynch’s sentiments when she received her award from Insecure actress and creator Issa Rae, who tapped Matsoukas to direct the hit HBO comedy series.

“It feels incredible to be seen, respected and have your work valued. It means more when that acknowledgement comes from your own community,” she said.

Matsoukas, who has also directed videos for A-listers including Beyonce’s Lemonade opus, added, “Recently, I’ve been battling my own rage. As I keep saying, the daily onslaught of white supremacy and colonisation is infuriating and also exhausting. I shared my sentiments with Ms (Ava) DuVernay the other night, and what she said went deep. It was simply, ‘Don’t let them steal your joy’. Since then, I’ve been thinking about how to reclaim my own joy,” she said to applause.

Attending the luncheon was certainly one way. The annual event is among the more festive and emotional of Oscars’ week, and always attracts the A-list crowd. This year’s attendees included DuVernay, Kerry Washington, Janelle Monae, Cynthia Erivo, Lena Waithe, Sharon Osbourne, Brittany Howard, Gabrielle Union and Alfre Woodard (who honoured Lynch).

Besides Lynch and Matsoukas, the director and cast of Pose and Emmy-nominee Niecy Nash were also honoured. Erivo, a best actress nominee at the Oscars, is the only actor of colour nominated, which has drawn renewed attention to the need for more diversity at the Academy Awards.

Before the luncheon, Washington spoke of the importance of the luncheon. “I love events like today because we actually get to be in a room and celebrate, encourage and remind each other that we’re doing the good work. Right, to not focus as much on the problem, but to look at each other as the solution together,” she said. “So I think as long as we just keep showing up for each other, doing this work, and encouraging each other, then we’ll get there.”

Eve was the host of the event, which began with a moment of silence for Kobe Bryant, along with whom his daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed in a helicopter crash late last month.

Also remembered was the late icon Diahann Carroll, who died last fall. Washington, a dear friend, remembered Carroll, the first black woman to star in her own TV series and one of the small circle of black women nominated for a best actress honour, as a trailblazer.

“Her presence in the upper tiers of excellence in this business makes her not just a hero but one of our founding mothers,” Washington said. “That I am here, that we are all here, working and thriving in Hollywood is because she did the work first.”

Lynch will star in the forthcoming James Bond film No Time to Die. The British actor talked about the importance of knowing many black girls will be validated seeing her on screen in the film. She credited the “extraordinary black women around me” for giving her the validation she needed, and paid special tribute to her mother, who was in the audience.

“If I can be half the woman you are, I know that I will have succeeded,” she said.

There was plenty of emotion at the event, particularly when the women of Pose were honoured. Cast mate and Emmy-winner Billy Porter’s voice broke when he spoke about the importance of black transgender women being honoured by Essence. Janet Mock, who directs the FX series about into the ballroom culture and the LBGTQ world of the 1980s and 90s, noted how black trans women are often victims of violence.

“The struggle for black people must include black trans and queer people, period. And this award reaffirms that our stories, our lives, our experiences matter,” she said, as Pose star Mj Rodriguez wiped away tears next to her along with Angelica Ross and Hailie Sahar.

“The world is facing a chronic shortage of personal protective equipment,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the WHO's executive board in Geneva.

He said he would be speaking to members of the supply chain network for protective gear to try and resolve “bottlenecks” in the production.

WHO earlier this week said it had started sending masks, gloves, respirators, protective isolation gowns and test kits to countries requiring assistance.

China's ruling Communist Party has sent a high-level investigation team to the epidemic-hit Wuhan city in Central Hubei province to probe Li Wenliang's death on Thursday.

Li, 34, was among eight Wuhan residents who were reprimanded by local police in early January for spreading “rumours” about the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the province.

The doctor died due to the very virus he desperately tried to highlight in December last year through social media and has become a national icon with millions of netizens expressing their grief and anger over the way he was treated.

His death is widely reported by the state-run media which had earlier shunned him.

A special team will head to Wuhan to investigate issues regarding Li, state-run People's Daily quoted China's top anti-corruption agency as saying on Friday.

Xi, in his first phone call with Trump since the coronavirus outbreak in December, told the Prez that China had launched a “people's war” against the epidemic that has been wreaking havoc in China and across the world.

People's war is an ideological concept developed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party founder Mao Zedong which meant a prolonged struggle with the support of people while fighting for a particular cause.

183,08-2-20,Pak Parl passes resolution demanding public hanging of child sexual abusers,"Pakistan parliament on Friday passed a resolution demanding public hanging of those convicted of sexually abusing and murdering children.

The resolution, which referred to the brutal killing of an 8-year-old girl after abuse in Nowshera area of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, was passed with majority votes as it was supported by all lawmakers except those belonging to Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of former premier Benazir Bhutto.

Former premier and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf said that pubic hanging was violation of UN rules and punishment cannot mitigate crimes. “Ramping up the severity of punishments does not result in a reduction in crime.”

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan presented the resolution in the House which strongly condemned the incidents of child sexual abuse.

“This house demands that to stop these shameful and brutal killings of children and give a strong deterrent effect, the killers and rapists should not only be given death penalty by hanging but they should be hanged publicly,” it read.

However, the resolution was condemned by two ministers who were not present in the house at the time voting.

“Strongly condemn this resolution this is just another grave act in line with brutal civilisation practices, societies act in a balanced way barberiaism is not answer to crimes...... This is another expression of extremism,” Minister for Science Fawad Chaudhry tweeted in reaction.

Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari also expressed anger.

“The resolution passed in NA (National Assembly) today on public hangings was across party lines and not a government-sponsored resolution but an individual act. Many of us oppose it - our MOHR (Ministry of Human Rights) strongly opposes this. Unfortunately I was in a meeting and wasn't able to go to NA,” she tweeted.

According to a report released by child rights organisation Sahil in September last year, 1,304 cases of sexual abuse of children were reported by the media in the country from January to June.

184,08-2-20,Aroma of Japan,"An evening with Japanese food and sake made it evident why the cuisine is becoming popular among Indian millennials, says Ayushi Sharma

A huge wooden cask bound with metal hoops lies in the centre amid a crowd of people at the Embassy of Japan. The barrel is about to be hit with a wooden hammer. I, then, get to know that it’s the traditional Kagami Biraki ceremony, which marks the start of something new in the country. The term literally translates as “opening the mirror” or “breaking of the mochi,” in which a cask of sake is opened. Thereby, the evening with ‘Japanese food and sake’ begins.

The enormous hall has 10 counters, five on each side. There are different varieties of food and flavours of sake, all from the land of the rising sun. The very first counter that attracts me is that of the Spinach paneer rice. Greens, proteins and carbohydrates, all in one. What else do we need for an easy mid-week dinner? It has fresh baby spinach leaves and unlike the Indian rice, the grains are too sticky and clumpy. One might think that it doesn’t match the authentic Indian taste but I wouldn’t question its claim to being a fusion — quite the perfect one.

I, then, take a sip from their signature series of sake, which include the Black, the Silver and the Gold. The Black is a pure style of sake with white mountain flowers, the scent of which seems to perfume the olfactory permanently. It has a soft, silky texture. I can sense the subtle fruitiness with hints of mango, peach and pineapple. The Silver is an aromatic Ginjo sake with honeysuckle on the nose and floral notes of cherry blossoms. It makes a good impact on the palate with notes of mango, Asian pear and honeydew melon. This, too, has a smooth finish. Last, the Gold is flagship of their core Enter.Sake line. It surely has notes of melon and peach. The sake connoisseurs share that the supple body of this one originates from the pure mountain water, filtered through the Japanese Alps. They say that while drinking sake one has to let the aroma sink in first. It has to touch your senses and exhilarate your tastebuds before you swallow it. Well, I try. But I can’t resist and sip it all in one go.

The very next moment, I find myself indulging into Veggie pepper rice — another offering which suddenly makes me realise that this isn’t the last dish I am tasting which has rice in it this evening. The dish has plump pearls of rice coated with their signature margarine, sauces, finely-ground pepper, crunchy corns and medley of capsicum, button mushroom, broccoli, onions and baby corns. I feel, nothing gives more flavour to the food than fresh ingredients. And here, I can actually experience the natural flavours of each and every ingredient of the dish.

Next up is Hatozaki, a Japanese blended whisky, aged up to 12 years in a barrel with a minimum malt whisky content of 40 per cent. This one has cereal notes, mild sweetness and is quite light in taste, which allows it to be used in both highball and straight pours.

Moving on to the next counter, there is Indian Masterchef Pankaj Bhadouria, who has prepared some dishes, too, inspired by the Japanese cuisine. She says that during her recent trips to Japan, she was introduced to all these new ingredients, which have inspired the menu. It consists of — Matcha tea phirni, Wasabi khandavi, Tamari-marinated shrimp appa, Apple slaw and Togarashi makhani sauce. She tells us, “The process is Indian and the ingredients are from Japan. Getting back from Japan and doing a bit of experiment led me to this epic fusion. I feel Japanese food is getting really popular among Indians because of the millennials, who are quite experimental in their approaches.” By the time I reach her counter, almost all the dishes are finished. I am sure it’s because they were too good to abstain from.

The last range of sakes — quirky and fresh — from Ozeki Corporation, Hana Awaka, are the best. There are three sparkling flavours — flower, peach and yuzu (lime). Well, the first certainly reminds one of that sweet, bubbly Italian white wine, Moscato d’Asti. It is floral, lightly sparkling and juicy. Second, the Sparkling peach, is infused with peach juice. It is something that surpasses ever other sparkling drink. Another jewel reminds me of the champagne. The sparking yuzu is a low-alcohol sake, infused with citrus fruit for a refreshing taste. The distinguished aroma of yuzu blends perfectly with the mouthful of fruitiness.

Certainly, such an evening made it quite evident why the Japanese culture and cuisine is becoming popular among Indian millennials.

185,08-2-20,Shaheen-led attack hunts Tigers,"Lanky paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi took four wickets to help Pakistan dismiss Bangladesh for a paltry 233 on the opening day of the first Test here on Friday.

Shaheen recorded figures of 4-53 in 21.5 overs and was ably assisted by fellow pacer Mohammad Abbas (2-19) and spinner Haris Sohail (2-11) to justify Pakistan’s decision to send Bangladesh in to bat on a greenish-yellow Rawalpindi stadium pitch.

Pakistan were due to bat for five overs but bad light forced umpires to call it a day.

Bangladesh could have been bowled out for inside 200 had it not been for a defiant display of batting from Mohammad Mithun who top-scored with 63.

Bangladesh were reeling against pace at 161-6 when Mithun added an invaluable 53 run stand for the seventh wicket with Taijul Islam who made a resolute 24.

It was Sohail who had Islam caught by Yasir Shah before Pakistan wiped off the tail with the second new ball’s resistance, getting him caught behind.

Earlier, the extended two-and-a-half hour first session due to Friday prayers truly belonged to Pakistan as they kept Bangladesh down to 95-3 by lunch.

Shaheen, 19, removed debutant Saif Hassan (nought) off the third ball of the match and then had skipper Mominul Haque (30) to get vital breakthroughs for Pakistan. Abbas trapped opener Tamim Iqbal with the 10th ball of the match for three to leave Bangladesh tottering at 3-2.

Haque and Najmul Hossain Shanto (44) revived the innings during their third wicket stand of 59.

While Mahmudullah, who was shaping well with four boundaries in his 25, played a rash shot off Shaheen and was caught brilliantly at gulley by a leaping Asad Shafiq.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shaheen-led-attack-hunts-tigers.html
186,08-2-20,Mumbai out of Ranji knock-outs,"Multiple-time champions Mumbai were knocked out of the ongoing Ranji Trophy after drawing against Saurashtra on the fourth and final day of their elite Group B match on Friday.

Saurashtra’s Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Kamlesh Makwana played patient knocks to deny Mumbai an outright win.

Saurashtra, thus, took three points from the drawn affair, courtesy their first-innings lead.

Mumbai, whose fight back was led with Surya Kumar Yadav’s ton, had to be content with a lone point.

Mumbai, the most successful team in the history of Ranji Trophy with 41 titles, still have a game left against Madhya Pradesh, but their campaign is over as they have only 14 points and even an outright win won’t help them to make the knock-outs.

Only top five teams from combined Group A and B make the quarter-finals.

Two teams go through from Group C, while one team moves ahead from the Plate Group.

On fourth and final day, Mumbai spinners Shams Mulani (3/47) and Shashank Attarde (3/45) ran through the Saurashtra top and middle order to leave the hosts reeling at 83 for 7 to raise hopes of a Mumbai win.

But then Jadeja, who came in at number nine and Makwana, who came in at eight, held both the ends up and batted together for almost 40 overs to deny Mumbai six points.

Makwana, who remained unbeaten on 31, consumed 116 balls, while Jadeja who remained unbeaten on 33 batted for 125 balls.

Saurahstra next play Tamil Nadu and still has a chance to make the quarters.

Meanwhile at Shimoga, Madhya Pradesh grabbed three points after their match ended in a draw against Karnataka.

Karnataka had posted huge 426 in their first innings, but Aditya Srivastava struck a gritty 192 to give Madhya Pradesh give the crucial first innings lead.

In Delhi, Railways took three points from their drawn game against Himachal Pradesh, courtesy the first-innings lead.

Delhi all but out

New Delhi: Gujarat virtually pushed a lacklustre Delhi out of the knockout race after grabbing three points from their group A match, which ended in a draw.

On the basis of their 42-run first innings lead, Gujarat grabbed three points from the contest to take their tally to 29 from seven outings.

They now sit atop the cross pool (group A and B) standings.

Delhi are now left with a home game against Rajasthan, starting from February 12, and they have to get seven points (including bonus) to have any chance left.

But even a total of 25 points may not suffice as Gujarat (29), Andhra (27), Bengal (26), Saurashtra (25) and Karnataka (25) are already in top five with a game left.

Maha beat Odisha

Pune: Maharashtra defeated Odisha comprehensively by 10 wickets on the fourth and final day of Group C match to pick up seven points from the encounter.

However, the win may not help Maharashtra’s cause as it lies in fifth spot with 28 points behind Jammu & Kashmir (39), Odisha (35), Services (33) and Haryana (30). Only the top two teams from the group will advance to the knockout stages.

Maharashtra, which had declared at a mammoth 543 for five in reply to Odisha’s first innings score of 293, dismissed the visitors for 289 in the second essay, setting themselves a target of 40 runs which they knocked off in 11 overs.

The loss was a setback for Odisha, which is now static at 35 points with a game in hand against Jharkhand.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mumbai-out-of-ranji-knock-outs.html
187,08-2-20,Eves lose again in triangular series,"The Indian women’s cricket team produced another listless batting performance to suffer a second successive loss in the T20 triangular series, going down to England by four wickets on Friday.

Sent in to bat, Indian batters failed to capitalise on their starts as they struggled to 123 for six in 20 overs with opener Smriti Mandhana emerging as the top-scorer with a 40-ball 45. Chasing the total, Natalie Sciver smashed a strokeful fifty as England romped home comfortably, scoring 124 for six with seven balls to spare.

Sciver’s 50 off 38 balls contained six hits to the fence and a six.

For India, Rajeshwari Gayakwad (3/23) was outstanding with the ball, while Radha Yadav (1/24) also took two wickets but the total on the board was just not enough.

India will next play against Australia today.

Brief Score: India women: 123 for 6 in 20 overs (Smriti Mandhana 45; Anya Shrubsole 3/31).

188,08-2-20,Labuschagne reminds Sachin about himself,"Indian cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar on Friday picked Australian Marnus Labuschagne as the player who most reminds him of himself, calling the fast-rising batsman a special talent with impeccable footwork.

Here to coach a side at Sunday’s charity fundraiser for the devastating bushfires in Australia, Tendulkar was asked to name the player who he thinks comes closest to resembling him at his prime.

“I happened to be watching the second Test match at Lord’s between England and Australia. When Steve Smith got injured, I saw Labuschagne’s second innings,” Tendulkar responded.

“I was sitting with my father-in-law. I saw Marnus get hit off the second ball from Jofra Archer and, post that, the 15 minutes he batted, I said, ‘This player looks special’,” he recalled.

“There is something about him. His footwork was precise. Footwork is not physical, it’s mental. If you’re not thinking positively in your mind, then your feet don’t move,” he added.

The 25-year-old Labuschagne became Test cricket’s leading scorer last year with 1,104 runs. He broke into the scene after coming in as a concussion substitute for Steve Smith during the Ashes last August.

Tendulkar said Labuschagne’s fine footwork is also a sign that he is a mentally strong player.

“...Because if you’re not, your feet will not move. His footwork was incredible,” he said.

Tendulkar, however, refused to be drawn into the debate on who among Virat Kohli and Steve Smith should be considered the better.

“I don’t like getting into comparisons. People have tried comparing me to a number of guys and I’ve said, ‘Just leave us alone’,” said Tendulkar.

“Let’s not get into comparisons and let us enjoy what both those individuals are doing.

They are entertaining the entire cricketing world and it’s a joy for us to watch,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/labuschagne-reminds-sachin-about-himself.html
189,08-2-20,We've to be bit more attacking against Indian spinners: Guptill,"New Zealand opener Martin Guptill on Friday said his team will look to pump up the aggression against Indian spinners during the second ODI in pursuit of an early series win against the fancied visitors.

The opener said the key to New Zealand’s victory was playing well against the spinners. Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja were taken to the cleaners in Hamilton by Kiwi batsmen and leaked 148 runs in all.

“It’s completely different conditions, isn’t it? You have to be a little bit more attacking here I guess and have the confidence that the ball will probably will not spin past your edge as much. You know the odd one might as it did the other night,” he said.

“I thought the way we handled the Indian spinners in Hamilton was some of the best we have done it in a long time. So we can take confidence from that going forward in the series.”

Guptill also warned his side against complacency, saying it cannot afford to take a world class team like India lightly.

“I don’t think you can count India out. They are a world-class side, they have got match winners batting and bowling. So, we still have to put up a very good performance tomorrow (Saturday) to be get another win under the belt and take the series,” he said.

“Come Saturday, hopefully we will play well and showcase our skills again.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-ve-to-be-bit-more-attacking-against-indian-spinners--guptill.html
190,08-2-20,‘Not bowling lot of overs is affecting Kuldeep’s rhythm’,"India fielding coach R Sridhar on Friday dismissed reports raising question marks over Kuldeep Yadav’s fitness, saying the spinner is fully fit but not playing regularly is probably having a negative impact on his bowling.

Yadav has been fairly inconsistent in his international outings of late and conceded 84 runs in his 10 overs and took two wickets in the first ODI. It was his first game of the tour after being left out of the eleven in the five T20Is.

The chinaman was also dropped from the Test squad earlier this week, 12 months after head coach Ravi Shastri called him India’s number one spinner in overseas conditions.

“He is fully fit and he is not carrying any injury. He is totally cleared to play all the games. He has played a lot of ODI cricket, played all three games against Australia. He didn’t play the T20s as Chahal was there. Maybe Kuldeep is the kind of guy who needs a lot of overs under his belt to get his rhythm.

“Typical leg-spinner thing, I would suppose with a lot of overs under the belt. On and off, he is playing the odd one-day game. I think he is a good bowler and he has got all his skills. I think the New Zealand batters played him really well,” said Sridhar ahead of the second ODI.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---not-bowling-lot-of-overs-is-affecting-kuldeep---s-rhythm---.html

Phillips smashed nine fours and a six in his 80-ball 65, while Dane Cleaver (46 not out off 115 balls) and skipper Hamish Rutherford (40 off 79 balls) also chipped in with useful contributions after the hosts won the toss and decided to bat.

For India, aedium pacers Mohammed Siraj (2/58) and Avesh Khan (2/57) took a couple of wickets each, while spinner Shahbaz Nadeem also snapped one scalp.

192,08-2-20,India's batting finally fires as team outplays Australia to stay alive in women's tri-series,"Smriti Mandhana struck a sublime half-century as India finally produced a good batting display to record a seven-wicket win over Australia here on Saturday, keeping their hopes alive for a place in the final of the women's T20 tri-series.

Australia posted 173 for 5 courtesy a 57-ball 93 from Ashleigh Gardner and Meg Lanning's 22-ball 37 after India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur elected to field at the Junction Oval.

India then overhauled the target in 19.4 overs, largely due to opener Shafali Verma's 49 off 28 balls and Mandhana's 55 off 48 balls.

With the win, India moved to the second position in the points table, behind England. The winner of the final league match between Australia and England on Sunday will decide the finalists for the title clash on February 12.

After two failures, sixteen-year-old Shafali gave India a flying start with her innings containing eight fours and a six. Her senior opening partner Mandhana on the other hand anchored the case with a solid knock comprising seven fours.

After Shafali was caught by Nicola Carey off Ellyse Perry's ball, Jemimah Rodrigues came into the crease and made a quickfire 19-ball 30, studded with five hits to the fence.

Her innings was cut short when she holed out to Alyssa Healy off Megan Schutt's delivery in the 13th over.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 not out off 20 balls) then joined Mandhana and added 42 to take India close to the target. Mandhana was trapped LBW by Carey in the 19th over. Harmanpreet and Deepti Sharma (11 not out off 4 balls) then took the team to a resounding win.

Earlier, Gardner sent the ball across the fence 11 times and blasted three sixes in her 57-ball innings to emerge as the top-scorer for Australia.

For India, Deepti Sharma (2/27) was the pick of the bowlers, snapping two wickets, while Rajeshwari Gayakwad (1/34), Radha Yadav (1/34) and Harleen Deol (1/21) took one wicket each.

Australia's Ellyse Perry (1/33), Megan Schutt (1/26) and Nicola Carey (1/27) accounted for a wicket each.

193,08-2-20,Basque in the glory,"Barcelona and Real Madrid both crashed out of the Copa del Rey on Thursday night as Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad pulled off a shock Basque double to reach the semi-finals.

Barca were beaten 1-0 by Bilbao at San Mames, where Inaki Williams headed in a dramatic 93rd-minute winner, after La Real had seen off Madrid 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Two sensational upsets added another layer of excitement to a competition that has been full of surprises this season, with Bilbao and Real Sociedad joining Granada and second division Mirandes in an unfamiliar line-up.

“There have been some surprise results,” said Williams. “Sometimes you just have to have faith and heart.”

For Barca, defeat was particularly painful, coming at the end of a turbulent week that saw Lionel Messi engage in a public spat with the club’s sporting director Eric Abidal and Ousmane Dembele ruled out, probably for the rest of the season, with another hamstring tear.

To make matters worse, Gerard Pique hobbled off with his own injury problem in the second half against Bilbao and looks doubtful to face Real Betis in La Liga tomorrow.

Defeat in the Copa del Rey, a distant third in Barca’s list of priorities this season, will not dictate Messi’s thinking but another setback certainly adds to the sense of a club currently in a state of crisis.

Quique Setien has lost two of his opening six games in charge, with a Champions League tie against Napoli fast-approaching. The fall-out from another failure in Europe would prove longer-lasting.

For a rotated Madrid side, who sit top of La Liga, the loss against Real Sociedad was perhaps less damaging, even if they conceded as many goals in 69 minutes as they had in their last 11 matches put together.

Martin Odegaard, on loan at la Real but allowed to face his parent club, found the opener before the superb Alexander Isak hit two to give Real Sociedad a remarkable 3-0 lead.

Marcelo and Rodrygo both scored late in the second half and while Mikel Merino added a fourth for the visitors, a Nacho Fernandez header set up a wild final three minutes, in which Andoni Gorosabel was also sent off.

197,08-2-20,Imp to make most use of every game in Olympic year: Rani,"Indian skipper Rani, who recently became the first-ever hockey player to win the World Games Athlete of the Year award returns to India on Friday morning with her team after playing five games in the New Zealand tour, last two of which they won against higher rank opponents Great Britain (1-0) and New Zealand (3-0) after losing second and third game by narrow margin.

Speaking about the team’s performance, the captain, who currently has more than 240 senior caps says, “It was a very important New Zealand tour because it’s not much time left for the Olympics now. So whenever you get the chance to play against the higher rank opponent it always becomes crucial to make the most use of it.”

“And since we have a very limited number of games to play this season, it was important to play with focus, so that it can help us prepare well for the Olympics,” she said.

“I am happy with the way the team played in New Zealand, where we won the last two games. And even though we lost two before that, it was not like that our performance was very poor. We just failed to finish the chances that we created. And if we would have done that, we could have won those games too,” Rani added.

The team has performed well in the international arena over the past couple of years producing good results against quality sides like Spain, Ireland, Japan, China, Korea besides securing 2020 Tokyo Olympics berth, where for the first time in the history they will make back to back appearances.

Speaking about the Tokyo games, where ninth-ranked India will face top-ranked the Netherlands and fourth-ranked Germany in pool games. Rani said the team needs to take one game at a time.

“As far as the Olympics are concerned our primary target is to do well in the pool matches first. We will take one game at a time and not think too far ahead from the start.”

“The focus will be to do good on a particular match day and see what’s coming next.”

“It becomes important to be consistent with the performance irrespective of the fact of how the other team is playing. So the immediate goal is to do clear the pool games and then from the quarterfinals entire new tournament starts and it becomes anyone’s game,” she said.

The Indian women’s team was scheduled to travel to China from March 14 to 25. However, due to the fast-spreading deadly Coronavirus disease, it has been cancelled, leaving the federation with the difficult task of finding an opponent to compete with as part of its preparation for the Olympics.

“We had to travel to China but that has been cancelled due to the virus. So a lot of teams are also not available to play with because they are participating in the Pro hockey league,” she said.

“Hockey India and our coaches are working out whom to play,” she added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/imp-to-make-most-use-of-every-game-in-olympic-year--rani.html
198,08-2-20,Confident India face Belgian test,"Indian men’s hockey team got off to a stupendous start in the FIH Hockey Pro League after defeating the Netherlands in both their matches last month. And the world No 5 team will now certainly look to continue that form when they face the world No1 Belgium in the first leg of second home fixture today at the Kalinga hockey stadium in Bhubaneswar.

Belgium are currently at the top of the league table with eleven points after winning all of their four matches, defeating Australia and New Zealand (two matches each), away from home.

However, India will gain confidence from the fact that they beat Belgium at their own backyard last year. India triumphed in all five matches (three against Belgium and two against Spain) during their Belgium tour in September 2019.

Speaking ahead of the match, Indian captain Manpreet Singh said that the team looks at Pro League as a good opportunity to become a better side.

“All the teams which are playing in the Pro League will play in the Olympics as well. So, we have a good opportunity to find out which areas we should work on during this tournament and get better as a team before the Olympics. The youngsters also have a good chance to showcase their skills in this competition,” said Manpreet.

Chief coach Graham Reid expressed that the side has carried out excellent preparations for the matches against World Champions.

“We are ready to go. We have been training for the last two weeks. So it’s been really good preparation for the matches against Belgium. What’s important for us is that we need to perform at our best. We will be going for the win. We are not going to focus much on our opponents but will focus on what we need to do. The players are very clear about what is required of them. We can’t change the way our opponents play, but we can change the way we play,” said Reid.

While Belgium skipper Thomas Briels said that the two matches against India are very crucial for them.

“We want to win the trophy and we have our eyes on the Olympic Games as well. We are the World No 1 side and every game counts. On the other hand, we want to develop as a team and try new tactics. We want to learn from other countries. But while doing it, we also want to win the matches. The FIH Hockey Pro League is a really nice tournament. We lost the final last year so we are really keen to win it this year. The two games this weekend are going to be crucial,” said Briels.

Belgium coach Shane McLeod expressed that the World Champions are looking forward to two top games against India.

“It’s been a very nice build-up to the games against India. We have played four games and learned from each of those experiences. After those four games, we took a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur to refresh mentally and so on and now we are looking forward to two top games against India, who also have been doing really well so far. I think the Indian team is on the rise at the moment. They have got a talented group of young players,” said McLeod.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/confident-india-face-belgian-test.html
199,08-2-20,Tight schedule not an excuse for average fielding: Sridhar,"India’s fielding hasn’t been particularly good in the ongoing series against New Zealand but coach R Sridhar refused to blame tight schedules for the “downward curve” despite conceding that hectic travelling is affecting the side’s practice plans.

Sridhar said India’s fielding has at best average in the last four months. He said fatigue could be a contributing factor to losses during this time period, including the one in the first ODI against New Zealand at Hamilton.

“...The West Indies series at home was somewhere we really dropped. We were average, to say the least. But definitely we have not lived to the standards as we did in the World Cup or even in the build-up to the World Cup in the last couple years,” said Sridhar.

India’s fielding regime has been impacted by the constant travelling on this tour. There was only one full session before the T20I series whereas the other three sessions have all been optional.

“That’s the nature of the current schedule, we have to take it. We have to play around it but we hardly had a session during the entire T20 schedule. There is not much we can put in in terms of technical work on the ground...,” he pointed out.

“Apart from that, we do have a look at the videos and see what led to an error. It need not always be a technical error every time there is a fumble or a dropped catch. We need to know whether it could be a tactical position error or the mind not being in the right place, so many things that can lead to it,” he explained.

“It is a tight schedule but it is not a complaint and it is not an excuse at all. We need to be better.”

Talking about the poor moments in the first ODI, the coach minced no words in his criticism of Kuldeep Yadav’s dropped catch of centurion Ross Taylor.

“...That catch should have been taken. Probably it was after his first over, maybe he was thinking about his previous over, could be anything. It could not be a technical aspect at all.

“We are trying to get better but we were average. There is no doubt about that. We can get better,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tight-schedule-not-an-excuse-for-average-fielding--sridhar.html

202,08-2-20,Modi holds talks with Sri Lankan PM Mahinda Rajapaksa,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held talks with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa covering the entire expanse of bilateral ties between the two countries including in areas of defence and security.

Mahinda Rajapaksa, elder brother of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, arrived here on Friday on a five-day visit, his first overseas tour after being appointed as prime minister of the island nation in November last year.

Officials said a range of key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, as well as defence and security figured in the talks between the two prime ministers.

Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called on the Sri Lankan prime minister.

Mahinda Rajapaksa served as the country's president from 2005-2015, becoming one of the longest-serving leaders in South Asia. He was also prime minister for a brief period in 2018.

His tenure as president saw China expanding its footprints in the Indian Ocean island nation, triggering concerns in India.

However, ties between the two countries have been on an upswing in the last four years.

President Gotabaya Rajpaksa visited India in November in his first official overseas trip after taking charge of the top office.

Both sides resolved to further deepen bilateral defence and security ties during the Sri Lankan president's visit.

After his official engagement in Delhi, Mahinda Rajapaksa will travel to Varanasi, Sarnath, Bodh Gaya and Tirupati.

203,08-2-20,Pak court defers verdict against Mumbai attack mastermind Saeed,"A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Saturday deferred its verdict against Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed in two terror financing cases on his ""request"" and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday.

Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta had last week reserved the verdict against the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief in the two terror financing cases for Saturday.

""The ATC judge on Saturday took up the application of Hafiz Saeed requesting the court to club all terror financing cases against him and announce the verdict after the trial is completed,"" a court official told PTI after the hearing on Saturday.

The official said the deputy prosecutor opposed to Saeed's plea, arguing that the trial in the two cases against him has already been completed and the court may announce the verdict under the law.

The ATC, however, adjourned the hearing till February 11, issuing notices to both prosecution and defence lawyers for arguments on Saeed's plea.

Saeed was produced before the ATC in high security.

The prosecution had produced some 20 witnesses in the ATC to testify against Saeed and his close aides for their alleged involvement in terror financing.

The ATC indicted Saeed and others on December 11 in terror financing cases in day to day hearing. He has already recorded his statement before the court in two terror financing cases against him in which he pleaded ""not guilty"".

The cases of terror financing have been registered against him in Lahore and Gujranwala cities on the application of Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police.

Cross examination of prosecution witnesses against Saeed and his three close aides by the defence counsel has already been concluded.

The CTD had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of Punjab province and arrested him on July 17. He is held at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.

Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.

The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force in October decided to keep Pakistan on its 'Grey' list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups LeT, JeM and others.

If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-court-defers-verdict-against-mumbai-attack-mastermind-saeed-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pak-court-defers-verdict-against-mumbai-attack-mastermind-saeed.html

206,08-2-20,Those shouting 'kagaz nahin dikhayenge' will be defeated in Delhi: Ram Lal,"Taking a swipe at those protesting against CAA-NRC, senior RSS functionary Ram Lal on Saturday said those shouting ""kagaz nahin dikhayenge"" would be defeated in the Delhi assembly election as he appealed to people to show documents while voting.

Talking to reporters after casting his vote at a polling booth in Nirman Bhawan, Lal asked voters to keep in mind who can make Delhi the best capital city in the world.

Hundreds of people, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in many areas across the country, often raise the slogan of ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (we will not show show documents.

""My message to the voters is 'aaj apna kagaz jaroor lekar jayen. Kagaz jaroor dikhayen' (Today, take your document along with you and show your document),"" Lal said.

In Delhi, there will be a government which can coordinate with the Centre, Lal, who was in the BJP till last year, said.

""Today, mentality of not showing documents will be defeated and (those ready to) show documents will win,"" he said.

Senior BJP leader Shyam Jaju said that voters will teach a lesson to those who allegedly funded the anti-CAA protest in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh and those who supported it.

""Aam Aadmi Party's Amanatullah Khan funded Shaheen Bagh and Delhi's Deputy CM supported it...They have done nothing to lift the blockade (at Shaheen Bagh),"" Jaju told reporters.

Responding to AAP supremo and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's allegation that no one in the BJP was worthy of becoming the CM, Jaju said, ""We have no dearth of chief ministerial candidates. We will declare our CM face at the right time.""

207,08-2-20,Stand up & rise,"Some of their bowling and fielding frailties were exposed in the series-opener but India will aim for quick course correction when they take on a resurgent New Zealand in the second ODI at Eden Park today.

Flying high after the 5-0 whitewash in the T20 series, India were brought to the ground after the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series with a four-wicket win in the first ODI.

The Black Caps chased down their highest-ever total in ODI cricket at Seddon Park and the toss will be crucial once again at the even shorter Eden Park where the side batting second will have a clear advantage.

India find themselves in a familiar situation after the loss in Hamilton. But the visitors have come from behind against the West Indies and Australia to win their last two ODI series and Virat Kohli’s men will look to do the same here.

In the first ODI, skipper Virat Kohli turned to Jasprit Bumrah every time he went searching for a wicket. This over-dependency is something India would want to address in their composition.

India’s fielding too will be under the scanner. The general fielding standards have gone down since the Bangladesh series and there is a need for a collective all-round effort from the visitors to bounce back.

Generally, high catches are tougher in the windy conditions in New Zealand, and the odd lights at Eden Park won’t help either.

At the nets, the Men in Blue on Friday had an optional training session.

Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur both didn’t just bowl, but also batted in the nets.

Thakur was expensive in his outings at Eden Park during the T20Is, and he didn’t impress in the first ODI either and India could think of replacing him with Saini.

The other contemplation will be about Kedar Jadhav’s role in the side. Selected primarily to bring balance to the playing eleven with his part-time spin, Kohli didn’t give him a single over in Hamilton.

Perhaps it was due to the short boundaries. In that light, bowling Jadhav at Eden Park makes even less sense. It could merit giving Shivam Dube a go here, or even playing a full-time batsman in Manish Pandey.

Rest of the batting line-up picks itself with the new opening pair of Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw settling in well in their first outing and the team management will hope the duo can add a few more runs than last time.

For New Zealand, a change in personnel has worked wonders after their T20 whitewash.

Stand-in skipper Tom Latham’s batting in the middle worked for them, and Henry Nicholls confirmed he will continue to open the innings with Martin Guptill.

Ross Taylor has been in rampaging form and he will look to continue the good work today.

Regular skipper Kane Williamson is still days away from fitness, while Scott Kuggeleijn is ruled out of the second ODI due to illness.

There were long queues outside some polling booths in areas dominated by minorities such as Jaffrabad, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur and Jamia Nagar.

Asked why was the voting percentage low in the morning, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said it usually picks up as the day progresses.

There were some complaints related to VVPAT slips.

Congress's New Delhi candidate Romesh Sabharwal said VVAPT slips did not show his name and photo.

""I gave a written complaint to poll authorities after which the machine was replaced,"" Sabharwal said, adding that polling was halted for sometime.

Former vice president Hamid Ansari and senior RSS functionary Ram Lal were among those who queued up outside the Nirman Bhavan polling station in the first hour of voting.

Minutes before polling began, Kejriwal tweeted, ""Please go to cast vote. A special appeal to all the women - as you shoulder the responsibility at home, likewise, the responsibility of the country and Delhi is on your shoulders.""

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who led a very aggressive campaign and covered 60 assembly seats, appealed to voters to ""free"" the national capital from lies and vote-bank politics.

""By giving Delhi clean air, clean drinking water and every poor house, only the best capital of the world can make it a government with far-sighted thinking and strong intentions.

""I appeal to the people of Delhi to vote to free Delhi from lies and vote bank politics,"" Shah tweeted.

BJP president J P Nadda also appealed to all the voters to vote in large numbers.

""Each vote of you is important for the unity and integrity of the country and holistic development of Delhi. Your vote only will be script the golden future of Delhi. 'Pehle Matdan, Phir Jalpan'. Jai Hind,"" Nadda tweeted.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's son Rehan and Kejriwal's son Pulkit were among first-time voters.

Pulkit said he felt good after voting for the first time.

He said whoever people choose will become the chief minister of Delhi when asked if his father will be the CM again.

Talking to reporters, Rehan said the public transport should be more affordable for students.

Taking a swipe at those protesting against CAA-NRC, senior RSS functionary Ram Lal said those shouting ""kagaz nahin dikhayenge"" would be defeated in the Delhi assembly election as he appealed to people to show documents while voting.

He asked voters to keep in mind who can make Delhi the best capital city in the world.

Hundreds of people, protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in many areas across the country, often raise the slogan of ""kagaz nahi dikhayenge"" (we will not show show documents.

""My message to the voters is 'aaj apna kagaz jaroor lekar jayen. Kagaz jaroor dikhayen' (Today, take your document along with you and show your document),"" Lal said.

Responding to AAP supremo and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's allegation that no one in the BJP was worthy of becoming the CM, senior BJP leader Shyam Jaju, ""We have no dearth of chief ministerial candidates. We will declare our CM face at the right time.""

AAP candidate from Chandni Chowk Prahalad Sahni said that vote is being cast on the development plank, asserting that the Shaheen Bagh issue has no impact in the Delhi assembly elections.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/battle-for-delhi--voting-begins-amid-tight-security-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-assembly-polls--14-75-pc-turn-in-first-three-hours.html

214,08-2-20,MPs trade blows as Min hits Rahul stick,"Ruckus in LS over Vardhan’s remarks

Congress MPs and members of the Treasury Benches on Friday virtually came to blows in the Lok Sabha after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan prefaced his response to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s health-related question by hitting out at him for his “outlandish” comment about beating “the PM with sticks” during a Delhi election rally.

The bedlam in the lower House happened a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself cited Congress leader’s comment and quipped that he was strengthening his back to take the blows of sticks.

During Question Hour, when Rahul asked a question related to establishment of medical colleges, Vardhan said before giving the answer, he would like to make a statement on the Congress leader’s recent comment on the Prime Minister.

Conventionally, questions are answered in the House by the Ministers without digressing from the main subject. Vardhan said he “condemns in no uncertain words” the “outlandish” remarks of the Congress leader.

“Sir, please excuse me. Before I begin answering this question of dear Shri Rahul Gandhiji. I want to condemn in no uncertain words the outlandish language that he has used against the Prime Minister of the country,” the Minister said.

Speaker Om Birla asked him to stick to his answer.

As Vardhan continued reading out the statement, Congress MPs came to the Well protesting against the Minister’s statement.

Manickam Tagore, one of the Congress members from Tamil Nadu, came to the Treasury Benches and attempted to aggressively reach Vardhan, who was sitting in the second row.

BJP member from Uttar Pradesh Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh held Tagore by his arm to prevent him from reaching the Union Minister. Congress MP from Kerala Hibi Eden tried to intervene. MPs from both sides and Union Ministers, including Smriti Irani, prevented them from coming to blows.

Even during the ruckus, Vardhan continued reading his statement.

“In a recent speech, he (Rahul) used words like 6 mahine baad, iss desh ke yuva, Narendra Modi ko dande maar maar kar desh se bahar karenge. (After six months, youth of the country would beat Modi with sticks and throw him out),” Vardhan said.

The Minister said Rahul’s father Rajiv Gandhi was a Prime Minister and even he was not targeted like this.

“I don’t think in the worst of cases our party leaders have made such outlandish personal remarks against him threatening to beat him with dandas (sticks) and throwing him out of the country,” Vardhan said.

“The entire House present here must in unequivocal terms condemn his remarks against our Prime Minister. We demand...,” he said. The Speaker immediately adjourned the House till 1 pm.

After the House was adjourned, several MPs of the ruling BJP demanded expulsion of Tagore from the House.

“Sadan se bahar karo. Mafi mango (Expel him from the House. Seek apology),” BJP members were heard saying.

Another member was heard saying, “Rahul Gandhi mafi mango (Rahul should tender apology)”.

As soon as the House reassembled at 1 pm, Kirit Solanki, who was in the chair, adjourned proceedings till 2 pm.

When the House again met at 2 pm, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi condemned the Congress member’s attempt to attack Vardhan.

“It is highly uncalled for. If anything is wrongly spoken then it is up to the Speaker to take a call but trying to attack the Minister is condemnable,” Joshi said. As Congress members too were on their feet, A Raja, who was in the chair adjourned it for the day.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister at an event in Assam’s Kokrajhar again recalled Rahul’s comment for the second time without naming him. “Mothers and sisters have come to bless me in such huge numbers. Sometimes people talk of beating me with sticks. Modi is protected by blessings of so many mothers and sisters that no stick can harm him.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mps-trade-blows-as-min-hits-rahul-stick-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/mps-trade-blows-as-min-hits-rahul-stick.html

216,08-2-20,Oldest woman voter in Delhi gets inked at 111,"Centenarian Kalitara Mandal, the oldest voter in Delhi, on Saturday cast her vote and urged people to take part in the democratic exercise.

Aged 111, she came to a polling station in CR Park along with her son, grandson and other family members. She flashed her inked wrinkled finger to photographers after voting.

""I am happy to vote in this election. I don't remember how many elections I have taken part in, but as a responsible citizen, we must vote. I urge other citizens to also come out and vote,"" Mandal told PTI.

Born in undivided India in Barisal (now in Bangladesh) in 1908, Mandal has seen the subcontinent go through turbulent phases many times, including two partitions, and lived ""twice as a refugee"" in India along with her family before finding a home in the national capital.

There are a total of 132 centenarian voters in Delhi -- 68 males and 64 females.

Mandal, who has seen and participated in nearly all elections in India in the last century, fondly recalled the time when ballot boxes were used to cast votes.

""Yes, I remember, they (polling officials) would take my thumb impression and then the ballot paper would be folded and put into boxes. I have voted with big machines (EVMs) too,"" she said.

She is the eldest of four generations of Mandals who live in C R Park area, a famous Bengali enclave set up in the national capital after the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War that led to the creation of Bangladesh.

The assistant returning officer who escorted Mandal from her home in K-Block, Harish Kumar, said, ""I feel blessed to have been given this job"".

""In this age, she came out and voted, it should be an inspiration for all of us Indians, to use our democratic right of voting,"" he said.

Kumar said, there is another centenarian in the Greater Kailash constituency.

Mandal has lost all her teeth but definitely not her appetite for fish and the will to participate in the election.

218,08-2-20,"Death toll rises to 723 in China coronavirus; US woman, Japanese man first foreigners to die","An American woman and a Japanese man became the first foreigners to have died from the new coronavirus in China as the death toll jumped to 723 in the country with the confirmed cases soaring to 34,598, health officials said on Saturday.

The American citizen died in Wuhan, the US embassy here said on Saturday, the first confirmed foreign death from the outbreak.

""We can confirm that a 60-year-old US citizen diagnosed with coronavirus died at Jinyintang hospital in Wuhan, China on February 6,"" a US embassy spokesman said.

""We offer sincerest condolences to the family for their loss,"" Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted the spokesman as saying.

The New York Times reported that the person was a woman and had underlying health conditions, citing two people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said earlier that 19 foreign nationals in China have been confirmed to have contracted the virus and undergoing treatment in hospitals.

Two of them were discharged after recovery, the ministry said without disclosing details. Earlier reports said that four Pakistanis and two Australians contracted the virus.

Though the US woman is officially stated to be the first foreigner to have died due to the coronavirus, a Japanese man hospitalised in Wuhan with pneumonia has also died, the Japan's foreign ministry announced in Tokyo.

The Ministry citing Chinese medical authorities said on Saturday the man in his 60s, was possibly infected with the coronavirus but due to difficulties in diagnosing the disease his death had been attributed to viral pneumonia.

His cause of death was given as viral pneumonia, it added. The man is potentially the first Japanese to have died from coronavirus, it said.

Eighty-six deaths were reported in mainland China with 3,399 fresh cases from 31 provincial-level regions, the country's National Health Commission said on Saturday.

State-run CGTN television network reported that the death toll has climbed to 723 while confirmed cases jumped to 34,598.

Among the deaths, 81 are in Hubei province and its provincial capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, two in Heilongjiang, as well as one in Beijing, Henan and Gansu, the commission said.

By the end of Friday, 26 confirmed cases, including one death, have been reported in Hong Kong. Macau reported 10 cases, while Taiwan reported 16 cases, it said.

A total of 4,214 new suspected cases were reported and 1,280 patients became seriously ill, and 510 people were discharged from hospital after recovery, according to the commission.

It added that 6,101 patients remained in severe condition, and 27,657 people were suspected of being infected with the virus. As many as 2,050 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery.

Meanwhile, a central government inspection group has arrived in Wuhan to thoroughly investigate issues related to Dr Li Wenliang, the whistleblower who was admonished by police last month when he flagged the coronavirus in his special media.

Li, 34, died on Thursday, plunging the whole of China into grief and anger over police highhandedness in stifling vital information which resulted in the coronavirus becoming a massive epidemic in China and the world.

The inspection team would probe the issues related to Li, an ophthalmologist with the Central Hospital of Wuhan, who passed away early Friday after being infected with the novel coronavirus, official media reported.

Also health authorities in Tibet said on Saturday that medical observation had been lifted for 32 close contacts of the region's only confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, with no symptoms reported.

The health commission of Tibet said the 32 people were discharged from their two-week isolated medical observation in cities of Lhasa, Shigatse, Shannan and Naqu. None of them reported fever or other symptoms.

Tibet reported its first confirmed case of the new coronavirus on January 30. The patient is now in a stable condition, state-run Xinhua news reported.

Pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus, as indicated by a study led by South China Agricultural University. Researchers found the metagenome sequence of the novel coronavirus strain separated from pangolins to be 99 per cent identical to that from infected people.

The commission said 3.45 lakh 'close contacts' have been traced, adding that among them, 26,702 were discharged from medical observation on Friday. Over 1.89 lakh others are still under medical observation.

The death toll of the coronavirus cases overseas went up 220 with Japan reporting 86 followed by 33 in Singapore.

Chinese health officials have sent more than 11,000 medics, including the country's best ICU staff, to the city of Wuhan.

Among them, over 3,000 doctors and nurses are intensive care specialists, Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission, told media here.

""We are fully aware of the urgent need for ICU professionals in Wuhan. The current medics have been working for quite a long time and are exhausted both physically and mentally,"" Guo said.

The World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said the world was running out of masks and other protective equipment against the novel coronavirus.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-toll-rises-to-723-in-china-coronavirus--us-woman--japanese-man-first-foreigners-to-die-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-rises-to-723-in-china-coronavirus--us-woman--japanese-man-first-foreigners-to-die.html
219,08-2-20,Thai soldier kills at least 17 in mass shooting,"A Thai soldier gunned down at least 17 people in an attack which he shared on Facebook, emergency services said Saturday, in an ongoing mass shooting which focused on a town centre mall.

The attack in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima began late in the afternoon at an army barracks, police told AFP.

Three people were killed -- among them at least one soldier -- when Sergeant-Major Jakrapanth Thomma opened fire.

""He stole an army vehicle and drove into the town centre,"" police Lieutenant-Colonel Mongkol Kuptasiri.

Local media reported the gunman seized weapons from the army arsenal before embarking on a shooting spree in the centre of the town.

In a fast-moving incident, authorities could not confirm local media reports the gunman had taken up to 16 hostages.

There were ""17 deaths, 14 wounded"" late Saturday, said an unnamed spokesperson from Bangkok's Erawan Center -- the dispatch centre for emergency services across the country.

Video and photos circulating online relayed panicked scenes on a main road in the city - which is better known as Korat.

People fled while at least one fire roared as what appeared to be the sound of automatic gunfire filled the air.

The gunman also posted photos of himself and wrote several posts on his Facebook page including ""should I surrender"" and ""no one can escape death"".

In one Facebook video -- since deleted -- the assailant, wearing an army helmet, filmed from an open jeep saying, ""I'm tired... I can't pull my finger anymore"" and making a trigger symbol with his hand.

There were also photos of a man in a ski mask holding up a pistol.

""The gunman used a machine gun and shot innocent victims resulting in many injured and dead,"" spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen told AFP, adding that the standing toll was ""more than 10."" The defence ministry said forces have sealed off the Terminal 21 shopping centre but have yet to capture the suspect. Thailand has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world but mass shootings by soldiers targeting civilians are rare.

Several shootings at courthouses late last year also renewed concern about gun violence in the Southeast Asia country.

In one high-profile case, a two-year-old boy was among three people killed in Thailand when a masked gunman robbed a jewellery shop last month.

Late last year two lawyers were shot dead by a clerk at a court in the east of the country during a hearing over a land dispute.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/thai-soldier-kills-at-least-17-in-mass-shooting-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/thai-soldier-kills-at-least-17-in-mass-shooting.html

222,08-2-20,CBI raids IAS officer to probe link to arrested OSD to Delhi Dy CM,"A day before the Delhi Assembly polls, the CBI on Friday carried out searches on the premises of IAS officer Udit Prakash Rai in connection with the arrest of Gopal Krishna Madhav, OSD to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, in a bribery case. Sources said the agency has not found Sisodia’s involvement in the case so far.

Reacting to the development, Sisodia tweeted, “I have come to know that the CBI has arrested a GST inspector while taking bribe. This officer was posted as OSD in my office. The CBI should ensure strictest punishment to him. I have got several such officers arrested during last five years.”

Sisodia refused to insinuate any motive behind the timing of the CBI action, saying, “We have a policy of zero tolerance towards corruption, and it does not matter when person is arrested in case of corruption.”

While CBI sources said there was no evidence to link Sisodia in the corruption case, BJP MP Parvesh Verma alleged Sisodia too received a portion of the bribe and used that money to send biryani to the Shaheen Bagh protesters. The “outrageous” charge provoked Sisodia to serve a legal notice on Verma.

The officials said Madhav, posted in the GST department of the Delhi Government since October 2019, was arrested on Thursday evening on the basis of information provided by a middleman nabbed on Wednesday, who allegedly collected bribes from transporters on his behalf.

During questioning, Madhav alleged the involvement of Rai, a 2007-batch IAS officer of Assam-Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories (AGMUT) cadre, following which the agency carried out searches on his premises,

The sensational incident had taken place at the busy Arcadia market in Sector-49 in Gurugram, when Mahipal, the PSO of the judge, opened fire on Kant’s wife Ritu (37) and son Dhruv (18).

“The court has awarded him capital punishment under section 302 of the IPC, and a fine of Rs 10,000. In addition, he has been sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and Rs 5,000 fine under Section 27 of the Arms Act,” Public Prosecutor Anurag Hooda said.

PSO Mahipal was terminated from service following the incident that was described as ""a cold-blooded act carried out in sudden provocation triggered by a minor verbal spat"".

In a hearing on Thursday, a Gurugram court declared him guilty after hearing the arguments of both the defence and prosecution lawyers. The quantum of punishment was fixed for Friday.

""The incident was a result of ""accidental firing"" and there was no motive behind the killing. Also, the judge's kin did not file any misbehaviour complaint against Mahipal. We will challenge the judgment in the high court soon,"" said defence counsel, PN Sharma.

Mahipal stated in his statement, ""I am a poor person. I have two minor daughters to look after. I have an old aged mother to look after. My wife is also a housewife and has no other source of income. There is no one else to look after them. I am the only bread earner for the family. I am not a previous convict. Give me an opportunity to reform to me and to survive society.""

""The convict is sentenced to capital punishment by hanging by the neck till he is dead,"" read the judgment.""Also, the court observes that the case squarely falls with the ambit of 'rare of rare cases,"" it added.

""The accused had planned the murder and he wanted to avenge some imaginary insult that he was subjected to by the victims. His act reeks of total meanness and depravity. The act amounted to a cold-blooded murder by one, whom the victims trusted for their safety. The killing of a helpless woman and her innocent child is a satanic crime of the highest order,"" said the judgment.

To establish the case, the police have presented circumstantial and forensic evidence, key among them being the gunpowder residue on Mahipal's hand and on the car's steering wheel, cellphone location of the accused and the victims, details of the phone call made by the accused to the judge and co-gunman after the incident and videos that went viral on social media, two eyewitness who had also shot the incident videos, dying declaration statement of Ritu, CCTV footage installed at the arcadia market, bullet cells of .38 revolver (weapon used in the crime) and bloodstains of the victim's collected from the PSO's uniform.

The wife of the judge succumbed to her injuries on October 13, while Dhruv was declared dead after ten days at a private hospital.

The entire incident recorded by bystanders shows the accused trying to haul Dhruv's body into the white Honda City. Later he was arrested one and a half hours from the Gurugram-Faridabad road.

The whole incident occurred in a span of 10 minutes and after committing the crime the SPO informed the judge about the crime.

The charge sheet in the case had been filed on December 26, 2018, and charges were framed on January 9 last year. During the hearing, Mahipal claimed he was not guilty and requested a trial.

The SIT had submitted a 300-page charge sheet before the court on December 26, listing 64 witnesses, two eyewitnesses including the judge, Krishan Kant, and a fellow additional session's judge.

The case was filed on the complaint of Additional Session's Judge Krishna Kant Sharma at Sector-50 police station.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pso-gets-death-for-killing-judge---s-wife--teen-son.html
225,08-2-20,Indian-American woman to run for US Congress from Virginia,"An Indian-American woman, who raised her voice against alleged discrimination in admission of Asians in IV League schools, has announced that she will run for US House of Representatives, saying she wants to be a “voice, not a noise” for the community particularly the Hindus in the US.

Andhra Pradesh-born Manga Anantatmula, who worked as a federal government contractor in defence acquisitions programme management, has already become a presumptive nominee of Republican party from the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, making her the first Indian origin candidate to run for the House of Representatives from there.

Said to be a Democratic strong bastion, the 11th Congressional District comprises mostly of the affluent Fairfax County on the outskirts of Washington DC, has about 17 per cent Asian population, including an estimated 7 per cent Indian Americans.

Asian Americans, including Indian-Americans normally support Democratic party candidates, but she hopes to turn the tide in the November Congressional elections by defeating six-term incumbent Congressman Gerry Connolly. Political pundits call it a tall order.

“This time a large number of Democratic party supporters are moving towards the Republican party because of the current political situation and due to the successful policies of President Donald Trump,” Anantatmula, who filed her nominations on January 26, told PTI.

Anantatmula, who will formally launch her Congressional Campaign on Saturday from Herndon, a Virginia suburb of Washington DC, is a great supporter of President Donald Trump. For campaign purposes, she has expanded her first name Manga as “Making Americans Great Again”.

Running her campaign on the platform of reducing taxes, equal rights for women, helping the growth of small and medium business and affordable healthcare, Anantatmula says if elected to the House of Representatives she will strive to strengthen India-US relationship.

Anantatmula, in her interview, said that she considers herself as one among a new generation of Indian American and Hindu American leaders who do not become pawns in a globalist ideological agenda that undermines their own integrity as well as the national interests of their adoptive homeland.

Slamming Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the first ever Indian American woman to be elected to House of Representatives, for tabling a resolution on Kashmir in the Congress, Anantatmula said such a move has caused ""dismay"" in the community.

“I will be your voice, not a noise,” Anantatmula says in her outreach to Indian American and Hindu community. In her recent tweets she has supported India's stand on Kashmir and recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act and building the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

“She (Jayapal) is anti-India. She has no compassion for Kashmiri Hindus,” she alleged.

“I will support a strategy to build a global alliance to defeat terrorism,” Anantatmula said, asserting that India and the US are natural partners in fight against terrorism.

She had recently joined the Indian American community when they held a demonstration outside the Pakistani Embassy here against Pakistan's support to terrorist activities in India.

“I am the only Indian American who continues to fight the discrimination in admission in IV League Schools,” she said, adding that her fight resulted in 25 per cent more admissions of Indian American students in 2019.

She has also been critical of recent stand of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom on India.

“Leaving behind an affluent life in India, my little boy and I accompanied my husband to the US in early 1990s in pursuit of his graduate and doctoral degrees, an American dream. We chose Northern Virginia as our new home for its school system and standard of living, and lived in Fairfax County,” she said.

Born in Andhra Pradesh, she did her schooling from Chennai and graduated from the Agra University before coming to the US as an immigrant.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-american-woman-to-run-for-us-congress-from-virginia-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/indian-american-woman-to-run-for-us-congress-from-virginia.html
226,08-2-20,US is India's preferred trade partner in journey to be USD 5 tn economy: envoy,"America is India's preferred trade and business partner in its journey to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024, the country's new envoy to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said.

Addressing a gathering of American business community at a reception hosted in his honour by US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum on Friday, Sandhu said that the potential for cooperation between the United States and India is limitless.

He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set the goal for India to grow from a USD 3 trillion economy today to a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024 and a USD 10 trillion economy by 2030.

""In this journey, Prime Minister Modi has made it clear that the US is a preferred partner for trade and business,"" said the country's new ambassador to the US.

""The relations between our governments has found a new momentum, getting its energy from the warm friendship between our leaders. US President (Donald Trump) and our Prime Minister (Modi) have met four times last year,"" he said.

Observing that people from the business community across both the countries contribute so much to this relationship, he said, adding that entrepreneurs, businessmen and women have been the key stakeholders of India-US ties.

More than 2,000 US companies have a presence in India. Over 200 Indian companies have invested USD 18 billion in the US, creating more than 100,000 direct jobs. Two-way investment between India and the US reached USD 60 billion in 2018, Sandhu said.

Bilateral trade is growing at 10 per cent on a year-to-year basis and reached USD 160 billion in 2019, he said.

""This makes me bullish about our relationship. The best is yet to come. When US capital and expertise meet the Indian market and Indian mind, we should aim for nothing less but the sky,"" Sandhu said in his address.

Referring to his first stint in Washington DC as a young Indian diplomat in 1997, Sandhu said he always sensed the potential of the US-India partnership and wondered how it could move forward.

""We are both vibrant democracies, open and multi-cultural societies based on the rule of law. Our partnership today is as natural as it is seamless, based on the strong people-to-people connections. We have become global strategic partners and our collaboration cuts across spheres of activity which was unimaginable two decades ago,"" said the top Indian diplomat.

Sandhu, a 1988-batch Indian Foreign Service official, has had two successful stints at the Indian Embassy in Washington DC - the last one being Deputy Ambassador from July 2013 to January 2017.

He succeeds Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who has been promoted as the Foreign Secretary.

228,08-2-20,"For decades, American politicians put special interests ahead of national interests: Trump","For decades, American politicians put their special interests ahead of the interest of the country, US President Donald Trump said Friday, asserting that he has done away with some of the ""disastrous"" trade deals of the past.

Launching a new nationwide campaign in North Carolina to revitalise underserved cities and towns all across America, Trump said the US is in the midst of the single greatest comeback that it has ever had. “This is a comeback. We were doing poorly,” he said.

“For decades, Washington politicians put special interests ahead of American interests. They enacted disastrous trade policies. Like, it's unimaginable, frankly. I looked at some of these deals; I said, 'Who the hell would have done this? Who would have done this? A child wouldn't have agreed to this stuff.' Unbelievable,” Trump said in his address at a business meeting.

""For years, I heard that China will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. I kept hearing that. I hated it because I said, 'If I run, 2019 is not so far away.' We are so far ahead. We are so far ahead now. We became a rocket ship, taking in billions and billions and billions in tariffs, giving a lot of it to our farmers and different people that were targeted,” he said.

“Now, we have a deal with China. I just spoke to (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) last night, and we're working on problem, the virus. It's a very tough situation. But I think he's going to handle it. I think he's handled it really well. We're helping wherever we can,” he said.

His administration, Trump said, has signed the Mexico deal and Canada deal: USMCA and has signed trade deals with Japan and South Korea.

“Our economy is now the envy of the entire world. You have to see when leaders come to my office -- this beautiful Oval Office. I've had people walk into the office -- it's beautiful -- but they have more beautiful, in many cases, I guess. But it's what it represents,” he added.

In an episode, while playacting the two housemates discussed baby names as number of contestents dwindled down to seven.

Shehnaaz told Shukla to play phone-phone, in which they tried to dramatise the situation as it would be once they leave the house.

As the palyacting continued from bedroom, to living room, to the portico outside -- sitting on the sofa on the lawn area, Shehnaz announced her son's Zorawar.

She said the name should have an impact ""khanjar ki tarah chubh na chahiye -- in all probability I want a soldier's name -- something like Zorawar"".

Hearing this, Sidharth poked fun at her. Their conversation left the fans way too excited. ""Zorawar Gill Shukla"" started trending on Twitter.

Shehnaaz and Sidharth's baby name banter ended with Sidharth teasing Shehnaaz about her boyfriends. He even suggested ""name him Khanjar"", but she as usual did not read the joke..

However, their fans picked up the prospective baby name and came up with hilarious situations for both of them in the future.

Fans created memes. A user wrote, ""Sid pissed off at Sana Bcoz she is teaching-- NURSERY RHYMES TO ZORO IN PUNJABI STYLE BAA BAA BALLE BALLEBLACK SHEEP BALLE BALLE#ZorawarGillShukla #SidNaaz.""

232,08-2-20,Boeing's Starliner spacecraft full of software bugs: NASA,"A NASA probe into Boeing's commercial space capsule called Starliner, that failed to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) in December, has revealed numerous software bugs that should have been found in internal testing and not during an unmanned space flight.

Investigators found ""fundamental"" problems with the company's software that could have led to a disastrous outcome more grievous than previously known, the US space agency said on Friday.

Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft is likely to be ready to carry humans to the International Space Station (ISS) later in 2020, along with Elon Musk-run SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft.

""Boeing's Starliner spacecraft launched on December 20, but was unable to dock with the International Space Station as planned because it ended up in the wrong orbit,"" reports Space.com.

According to NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, a newly disclosed timer error on the December 20 flight had the potential to lead to ""catastrophic"" failure.

The timer error on Starliner was discovered by ground controllers during the flight and corrected while the spacecraft was still aloft.

""While this anomaly was corrected in flight, if it had gone uncorrected, it would have led to erroneous thruster firings and uncontrolled motion during (service module) separation for deorbit, with the potential for a catastrophic spacecraft failure,"" NASA officials were quoted as saying.

The NASA panel has now recommended reviews of Boeing's software and testing processes as ""required input for a formal NASA review to determine flight readiness for either another uncrewed flight test, or proceeding directly to a crewed test flight"".

""Boeing is as committed as ever to safe flight, mission assurance and helping our customer meet its crew transportation needs,"" the company said in a statement.

""We accept and appreciate the recommendations of the jointly led NASA-Boeing Independent Review Team (IRT) as well as suggestions from the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel following Starliner's Orbital Flight Test (OFT),"" said the company.

Regarding the ""Mission Elapsed Timer"" anomaly, the IRT believes they found root cause and provided a number of recommendations and corrective actions.

""The IRT also investigated a valve mapping software issue, which was diagnosed and fixed in flight. That error in the software would have resulted in an incorrect thruster separation and disposal burn. What would have resulted from that is unclear,"" said Boeing, adding that they are working on many of the recommended fixes, including re-verifying flight software code.

Boeing said it can consider a second uncrewed Starliner test flight before its first flight with astronauts if NASA gives the approval.

Boeing's uncrewed Orbital Flight Test (OFT) is the second uncrewed test flight of NASA's Commercial Crew Programme, a partnership with the aerospace industry to launch astronauts on the US rockets and spacecraft from the US soil for the first time since 2011.

Earlier this year, SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule completed its historic unmanned flight test to the space station.

233,08-2-20,Galaxy S10 Lite: Samsung's affordable flagship is here,"Samsung has chosen a rather odd time to launch the Galaxy S10 Lite in India, which has been unveiled just ahead of the launch of its much-awaited flagship series -- the Galaxy S20 -- next week.

The Galaxy S10 Lite is a serious attempt by the South Korean tech giant to give users better speed and performance, while making them compromise a little bit on some specs, to lay their hands on this Galaxy S series device. It is more like an ""affordable flagship"" from the House of Samsung. The smartphone packs in a top tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and a big 4500mAh battery.

We reviewed the 8GB RAM and 128GB on board storage variant that costs Rs 39,999 for about a week and here's what we think of it.

The phone packs in a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that is crisp and pretty large. The company has, however, ditched the curved waterfall edges, which the pricier Galaxy S10+ and S10 has, for a flat screen on this one.

There's a punch-hole at the top which is the front-facing camera and is housed at the centre of the display.The handset maker seems to have worked on the improvement of the optical in-display fingerprint scanner as it was quick to identify and unlock the device.

The handset borrows a rectangular camera bump design from the upcoming S20 phones. However, the company has used a ""glastic"" instead of a glass for the body which is likely to disappoint.

The Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite houses three rear cameras: there's a Steady OIS Camera (48MP), Ultra-Wide (12MP) and Macro (5MP) sensor. The device also sports a 32MP selfie camera.

The main shooter sports Super Steady OIS technology which can essentially make the lens move around like a gimbal to stabilise your videos.

The lens can move upwards, downwards and to the left and right to offset device movements caused by the user. In simpler words, it's more or less like the OIS you get on flagship smartphone cameras.

The ample 8GB RAM and 128GB on-board storage was smooth enough for multi-tasking, watching videos, playing games, taking images and browsing the Internet simultaneously. A major high point of the device is the 4500mAh battery that is supported by 25W fast charging technology.

This one's battery outpaces the 4100mAh capacity battery of Galaxy S10+.

The handset uses pixel binning to combine four pixels into one and take images with a final resolution of 12MP. In daylight, the technology works to produce great quality images. The camera has a tendency to push up the exposure a bit much during low light conditions.Samsung's Galaxy S10 Lite runs Android 10 OS with its own One UI 2.0 out of the box.

This brings in features like the built-in screen recorder, edge screen, edge lighting, Bixby Voice, Bixby Routines and power key customisation as well.

Samsung has not provided any water or dust resistance for the phone, which could be a bummer too.

Conclusion: The S10 Lite is a great attempt by Samsung at bringing the S-series flagship specs to a wider audience by toning down the flashy elements.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/galaxy-s10-lite--samsung-s-affordable-flagship-is-here-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/galaxy-s10-lite--samsung-s-affordable-flagship-is-here.html

Put in to bat, Guptill scored a run-a-ball 79 and alongwith his opening partner Herny Nicholls (41) shared a 93-run partnership but the hosts suffered a collapse, losing five wickets for 26 runs to slip to 197 for 8 at one stage.

Yuzvendra Chahal (3/58) claimed three wickets, Shardul Thakur (2/60) took two wickets, while Ravindra Jadeja (1/35) snapped one and effected a run-out to put the hosts in a spot of bother in the middle but Ross Taylor's brilliance saw them post a good score.

Taylor, who had scored a century in the first ODI, played a unbeaten knock of 73 off 74 balls and added 76 runs with debutant Kyle Jamieson (25 not out) to take New Zealand across the 250-mark.

236,08-2-20,Middle-order flops as India lose ODI series to New Zealand,"New Zealand exorcised the ghost of a nightmarish T20 whitewash with a series-clinching 22-run victory against India in the second ODI on Saturday with the visitors paying price for some poor shot selection.

Revenge as they say is a dish best served cold and on a chilly Auckland night, New Zealand defended a total of 273 by restricting India to 251 in 48.3 overs taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

The victory also completed a hat-trick of ODI wins for the Black Caps starting from their World Cup semi-final win in Manchester last year.

The win was more creditable as regular skipper Kane Williamson along with top bowlers Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson were unavailable.

New Zealand's 6 foot 8 inch debutant Kyle Jamieson (2/42 and 25 off 24 balls) got the 'Player of the Match' award for his all-round show.

Ravindra Jadeja (55 off 73 balls) along with Navdeep Saini (45 off 49 balls) raised visions of pulling off an improbable win with a 76-run partnership which ended in vain.

Tim Southee despite running temperature (2/41 in 10 overs) was brilliant with the new ball as his incutter got rid of Virat Kohli but it was poor shot selection from a set Shreyas Iyer (52) and Kedar Jadhav (9) in the middle overs did cost India dearly after the inexperienced pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw had a second successive poor day.

Earlier, in-form Ross Taylor produced a rearguard act with an unbeaten half century to rescue New Zealand to a competitive 273 for eight in 50 overs.

Taylor scored 73 not out (74 balls, 6 fours, 2 sixes) -- his 51st half-century -- and put on 76 off 51 balls for the ninth wicket with Jamieson to lift the hosts from 197-8 to a competitive score.

Opener Martin Guptill smashed a run-a-ball 79 to give the Black Caps a good start but they lost seven wickets for 55 runs to look down the barrel at one stage.

Put in to bat, New Zealand got off to a positive start as Guptill (79) and Henry Nicholls (41) put on 93 runs for the first wicket.

Guptill's innings contained eight fours and three sixes, as their cautious start meant India were searching for wickets early on. The breakthrough came only in the 17th over as Yuzvendra Chahal trapped Nicholls LBW.

Chahal had earlier dropped Nicholls in the 15th over as India started nervously in the field again. But things came together after the first wicket with the visitors piling on the pressure.

Shardul Thakur (2-60) got rid of Tom Blundell (22) and then came the turning moment. Guptill set off for a suicidal run and was duly caught short of his crease by Thakur's throw.

The Kiwis were suddenly down to 157 for 3 and India made good use of the opening.

Ravindra Jadeja (1-35) got into the action, first dismissing Tom Latham (7) and then running out Jimmy Neesham (3).

Colin de Grandhomme (5) holed out off Thakur, with Chahal returning to gleefully accept a return catch from Mark Chapman (1).

New Zealand were in danger of not crossing 200 when Tim Southee (3) was caught off Chahal too. The leg spinner finished with 3-58.

However, Taylor had other ideas as he rebuilt the innings with clever batting. He found an able partner in Jamieson as they ran hard between the wickets to elevate the score before stepping on the gas later in the innings.

Taylor scored his half-century off 61 balls, while Jamieson threw his bat around to smack a four and two sixes to bring up their 50-partnership off 35 balls.

New Zealand scored 53 runs in the last five overs, crossing 250 in the 48th over.

Earlier, Virat Kohli won the toss for a first time on this tour and opted to bowl. India made two changes with Yuzvendra Chahal replacing Kuldeep Yadav, while Navdeep Saini came in for Mohammed Shami. The latter was rested keeping in mind the upcoming Test series.

The Black Caps have a 1-0 lead in the three-match series following their four-wicket win over India in the first ODI.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/middle-order-flops-as-india-lose-odi-series-to-new-zealand-2020-02-08.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/middle-order-flops-as-india-lose-odi-series-to-new-zealand.html
