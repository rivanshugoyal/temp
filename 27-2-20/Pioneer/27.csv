0,27-2-20,Set a budget for success,"The means to reach financial targets are through budgeting, the only weapon to control spending and improve saving

As we go through life, our aspirations increase and we set ourselves different goals to achieve those dreams. Of the many targets, financial objectives, mostly driven by needs and desires, are the most important ones and goals are set for saving and spending. The means to reach financial targets is through budgeting, which is the weapon to control spending and improve saving. Budgets are generally created on a monthly basis and record both expected incomes and expenses. The aim is not only to control expenses but to make payments more efficient. Budgeting is an effective tool for achieving financial goals as it keeps track of your income and spending patterns by planning the proportion of money that you either spend or save. Although making a monthly budget may not sound exciting, it is crucial to keep finances in check. Spending less in one area can help save money that can be used in several ways like funding a bigger purchase, saving for an emergency, college education of children or retirement. So collect as much information as possible regarding your spending pattern and create a budget to stay on top of financial goals.

Define your goals: It is beneficial for any household to live on a strict budget, since savers have much less financial worries as compared to spenders. So defining goals is a great way to start the budgeting process. Research shows that psychology plays a crucial role in money matters and there is a greater possibility of achieving financial goals if a budget is created.

Be as elaborate as possible: Gather as much information as possible about all sources of income and expenditure including spending and income, like bank statements, investment details, utility bills or expenditure on entertainment.

Calculate your income: This is a fairly simple thing to do if you have a job and a secure monthly income. If you are self-employed or have any outside sources of income, be sure to record these as well.

Make a list of current spending habits: This is important if you want to develop a realistic budget as you must have a clear idea about where your money is going. You must track your expenses for at least 30 days to get a clear idea of the spending pattern. Some of the ways of tracking spending habits is to capture them into spreadsheets, using an appropriate app or keeping a tab of credit card statements. Apart from some regular expenses, some overheads are irregular like birthdays and vacations. Your calendar and past credit card statements will help you make a list of all expenses that crop up throughout the year. It is a known fact that people who borrow to cover holiday costs take a long time to repay as compared to those who budget throughout the year. Budgeting makes sure that you don’t need to take a loan for vacations.

Fixed and variable expenses: Divide your expenses into regular monthly ones that are fixed in nature like home loan or rent, car installments, fuel, school fees, credit card payments and so on. Some expenses are variable in nature like groceries, eating out, entertainment and gifts.

Identify your long-term financial goals: Identifying long-term goals will help in aligning the budget as it helps in deciding how much you need to set aside. Generally it is known that setting objectives increases motivation and achievement. You should follow the SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-based) strategy to set goals. For example, be specific and have a target of saving Rs 5,00,000 for the down payment of the house instead of just “save for the house.” Also include deadlines: When do you want to buy that house or purchase a new car or retire or send your kids to college? Set a target date by which you’ll need to achieve your goal.

Use a strategy: One of the strategies that could be used is 50-30-20: Allocate 50 per cent of the income towards essentials like rent, food and so on, while 30 per cent should be assigned towards vacations and entertainment and the remaining 20 per cent should go towards savings.

Stay on track: It is highly recommended that you review your budget. Comparing the actual expenses versus the budgeted ones help you identify the gaps, make necessary improvements and stay on track.

So, you have now got a perfect budgeting process but can you get it right without making any mistakes? Generally, people get discouraged if they are not able to stick to their budgets. To save yourself from any frustration, it is important not to have unrealistic expectations and to realize that fixed expenses have a tendency to create havoc with your budget rather the variable ones. Although budgeting is an important aspect of financial planning, it might become overwhelming and quite challenging for people not used to financial discipline. With the steps discussed above everyone should be able to a create a budget and try and stick to it. You will be surprised to know that once you live on a budget, save money for the future and spend guilt-free, you will experience a much happier life.

1,27-2-20,US First Ladies leave their mark,"While the American First Lady’s role has evolved over the years, this is not the case in India. One just hopes that the spouses of future leaders of the country will come out from under the shadow of their husbands

The only visible programme arranged for the visiting US First Lady Melania Trump, apart from posing for photographs with the iconic Taj Mahal serving as a majestic backdrop and waving at the massive crowds lustily greeting the American First Couple in Ahmedabad, was a visit to a Delhi Government school on Tuesday. This was the first time that a US First Lady visited a school in India. The visit was arranged as Melania showed an interest in the “happiness curriculum” introduced by the Delhi Government as part of its innovative move to refine the education system. It was launched on July 2, 2018 in the presence of the Dalai Lama, to help students remain stress-free. The curriculum is being taught to an estimated 10 lakh students in over 1,000 schools. The daily 45-minute “happiness class” is usually the first period for students in classes I to VIII, while Kindergarten children have classes twice a week.

The “happiness curriculum” has become one of the showcase projects of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Government in the education sector. In October 2019 Dutch King Willem Alexander and Queen Maxima also witnessed a “happiness class.”

The US First Lady’s role is not restricted to being just decorative and has evolved significantly since the days of Martha Washington who played hostess to visiting dignitaries during George Washington’s presidency. They have always made use of their global visits in a positive manner.

Jacqueline Kennedy, who visited India in the ’60s made a terrific impression on the people.

Indians were also so enamoured by Rosalyn Carter and her husband Jimmy that the village of Chuma Kheragaon in Haryana was renamed Carterpuri in honour of their visit. Hillary Clinton was a household name in the country and she continued her interest in India even after she ceased being the First Lady. Similarly, Michelle Obama enchanted India during her two visits.

Melania’s visit also generated quite a bit of interest as she was one of the most glamorous First Ladies to visit the country and her carefully-chosen outfits created quite a stir, with the fashion police appreciating two and dissing the third. However, apart from her obvious glamour quotient, she has kept a somewhat low profile. The Guardian newspaper once described Melania as “seldom seen and even more seldom heard. The former model may not be as popular as her predecessor Michelle Obama, but she is far more popular than her husband.”

Incidentally, many First Ladies have supported some special cause close to their hearts using their celebrity status. While Jacqueline Kennedy promoted American arts, Eleanor Roosevelt took up progressive causes, including civil liberties, Hillary Clinton came up with a new health plan, Laura Bush promoted literacy, Michelle Obama a better diets for children and so on. Melania Trump, too, focusses on issues affecting children. In the past four years she has made multiple visits to schools — both in the US and abroad. From participating in a Viking huddle class, in Michigan, to taking the Queen of Jordan to Washington DC’s first public charter school for girls at Excel Academy, Melania showed her commitment to kids. During international trips, she has visited the American International School in Riyadh and took a calligraphy lesson with local children at a Kyobashi Tsukiji Elementary School with Akie Abe while visiting Japan. Melania is also involved in an initiative to help American children that she launched in May 2018. The awareness campaign, called “Be Best,” is dedicated to children’s well-being, cyberbullying and opioid abuse.

According to The New York Times, though President Trump tried to dissuade her from getting involved in the initiative, Melania stuck to the cause. The Palm Beach Atlantic University in Florida honoured her this month as its “2020 woman of distinction.” But Melania has faced criticism for not speaking out against her husband’s tweets and actions, like the controversial separation policy where children caught on the border were split up from their parents and kept at detention centres.

However, unlike the US, there have been few visible and active spouses of Indian presidents and prime ministers. Not much is known about the wives of Presidents Rajendra Prasad and S Radhakrishnan. Thankfully, VV Giri’s wife Saraswati Bai took up a more public role and Abida Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed became an MP twice. Pranab Mukherjee’s wife Suvra was unwell most of the time and Giani Zail Singh nominated his daughter as his hostess.

Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s wife Lalitha was more of a housewife and most of the others followed suit. However, Sonia Gandhi took interest in her role as the hostess and Manmohan Singh’s wife Gursharan Kaur was also more visible. PV Narasimha Rao declared his daughter as his hostess and the wives of IK Gujral and Deve Gowda kept a low profile.

Sadly, most of them did not utilise their position like the American First Ladies to promote any social cause or take active part in politics.

One just hopes that the spouses of future leaders of the country will come out from under the shadow of their husbands.

5,27-2-20,Free aplastic anaemia awareness seminar on March 03,"Ayush Medical Welfare Foundation is organising a one-day free aplastic anaemia awareness seminar on March 03, 2020. This seminar is to be held at the Soybean Processors Association of India campus. Three renowned doctors of the city will give awareness about the anaemia as well as its dangers, prevention and treatment.

The seminar is being organised in collaboration with the Medical, Health Magazine Sehat evam Surat and the Advanced Homoeopathic Medical Research and Welfare Society. Dr AK Dwivedi, who attended the seminar as an expert, said, anaemia is usually considered as a minor disease by people and does not take it seriously.

Awareness seminars are also not organised for this, while it is a disease that gives rise to many other diseases. Constant bleeding from teeth or gums, long-term menstrual problems and bleeding in the stool due to piles, any of these reasons can cause aplastic anaemia.

Many people take medicines for fever, joint pain or skin problem themselves for a long time, they are also more prone to aplastic anaemia.

Taking any medication for a long time without medical advice invites anaemia. There is also a risk of anaemia due to chemotherapy. We want to make people aware about such a serious disease. If people keep the amount of hemoglobin in the body and keep the hemoglobin checked regularly, then they can avoid many diseases including anaemia.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/free-aplastic-anaemia-awareness-seminar-on-march-03.html
6,27-2-20,Gwalior Collector hogs limelight again,"Gwalior Collector Anurag Chaudhary is once again in the limelight; this time regarding issuance of a bizarre order instructing the department heads to ensure the presence of suspended grade II and IV employees’ at headquarters.

These employees are required to be seated at one designated place which carries a nameplate ‘For Suspended Employees’.

The collector has sourced his order on the problems caused by suspended employees not reporting to headquarters which makes communication with them difficult and also processes pertaining to court cases.

Accordingly, the District Education Officer Gwalior had instructed the principals and other department staffers to implement the order for suspended teachers by making them sit at designated places in schools or offices.

However, as the clamour on the contentious provision grew, the officer rolled back his earlier order on February 25.

Bhopal-based social activist Ajay Dubey commenting on the said order claimed that suspension is not any punishment as the staffer could let off the hook after a departmental enquiry. If this has to be done, why not implement this for all the suspended senior officers as well, why this discrimination in governance, questioned Dubey.

Notably, the bureaucrats have been under the scanner for alleged high-handedness in MP for a while. The BJP had been critical of the officers calling them turncoats who switched loyalties after change of guard in the State. The opposition party turned extremely aggressive after the Rajgarh collector Nidhi Nivedita had slapped BJP workers during a pro-CAA rally recently.

In recent past, Kamal Nath ministers including Panchayat and Rural Development minister Kamleshwar Patel, Forest Minister Umang Singhar and others have expressed displeasure against the bureaucrats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gwalior-collector-hogs-limelight-again.html
7,27-2-20,The art of healing,"In times when the Government is talking about oppressed minorities in neighbouring nations, should we be harassing Tibetans who have sided with India even in difficult times?

India prides itself on its traditional systems of medicine that have now received the Government’s support, too. In a major push to the healthcare sector, a separate Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) was set up in November 2014 “to ensure the optimal development and propagation of AYUSH systems of healthcare.” It was earlier known as the department of Indian System of Medicine and Homeopathy (ISM&H). Its objective was to focus on the development of education and research in indigenous systems of medicine. Later, Sowa-Rigpa (the art of healing), a traditional Tibetan system of medicine practiced in the Himalayan belt, was added to it.

Men-Tsee-Khang, the Dalai Lama’s Tibetan Medical & Astro institute based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, is the main training and research center for Sowa-Rigpa. The institute recently prepared a “precious pill” called the Chulen Rilbu, which could allegedly prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including the dreaded Coronavirus (a concerned Dalai Lama had earlier given mantras for the purpose).

It is in this background that a shocking incident took place last week in Dharamsala. Dr GD Gupta, the local chief medical officer, decided to stop the distribution of Chulen Rilbu that was being sold for `5 to those interested. Local authorities cited reports of public disturbance and commotion created by the public demand for the pill. Though the Rimsung Rilbu is distributed in other centers all over the country, it is true that there were long queues at Dharamsala.

On February 16, the CMO visited the McLeod Ganj branch of Men-Tsee-Khang and verbally issued orders to stop the sale of the pill. He even threatened the Tibetan institute that non-compliance may result in fines up to `10 lakh and closure of clinics. This, obviously, was not in the CMO’s power as the Ministry of AYUSH and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are two separate Government entities. Further, the CMO does not have the capacity to judge the potency of the pill, which needs to be used as an amulet (the smell prevents the infection, according to Tibetan doctors). Did the CMO then possess special competence in law and order problems to act?

Under pressure of insensible local authorities, Men-Tsee-Khang’s director, Tashi Tsering, had no choice but to issue a public notice, saying that the pill would not be sold at Tibetan clinics in Kangra district (it is still being sold in Delhi and elsewhere).

According to The Tibet Sun, Tashi maintained that the institute had never made any claim regarding the pill having properties to prevent contagious diseases. He said, “The pill having prophylactic properties is prepared as per formulations given in the ancient Buddhist texts and has been around for centuries.”

Many believe that the CMO’s actions were only an act of jealousy. Men-Tsee-Khang is a reputed institution established in 1916 in Tibet. It was re-established in Dharamshala by the Dalai Lama in 1961 and its main objective is to preserve, promote and practice Sowa-Rigpa.

Tibetan doctors are no quack. Dr Yeshi Dhonden, who recently passed away at the age of 92, was awarded the Padma Shri award by the President of India in 2018 for his contributions to Sowa-Rigpa. For years, Dr Dhonden served as Men-Tsee-Khang’s director and from 1963 to 1980 as personal physician to the Dalai Lama.

Sowa-Rigpa is today famed across the world. According to the AYUSH Ministry’s website, it is “one of the oldest, living and well documented medical tradition popular in the world. It is an ancient Indian medical system which was enriched in the entire Trans-Himalayan region.”

The medical treatise, the Gyud-chi or four tantras, written in Sanskrit, was enlarged between the 8th and 12th Century by scholars with inputs from China, Turkestan, Persia and Greece.

The implications of the threats uttered by the CMO are multiple. First, Sowa-Rigpa is popular all over the Himalayan belt, particularly in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul, Spiti and Kinnaur), West Bengal (Darjeeling and Kalimpong), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. It is also practiced in countries like Bhutan, Mongolia and Russia. It is an insult to the beliefs of the populations of these areas.

The greatest irony is that China is extensively using this system in its fight against the dreaded Coronavirus. Xinhua, quoting an official in Qinghai province said: “Tibetan medicine has played an active role in the virus treatment.” The news agency said that the Chinese authorities are using Tibetan medicine “to help fight the Coronavirus in northwest China’s Qinghai province.”

Huang Licheng, an official with the provincial health commission, confirmed that “of Qinghai’s 18 confirmed cases, 17 have received treatment involving traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Tibetan medicine has played an active role in the treatment.”

The province has officially incorporated allopathic and TCM treatments since the outbreak: “TCM doctors heavily participated in rescue work, especially those practicing Tibetan medicine.”

Xinhua further reported: “The provincial hospital of Tibetan medicine produced a batch of anti-virus medications featuring Tibetan medicine, with 1,000 of them already sent to the front lines in Hubei Province.” It added that “local Tibetan medicine hospitals have also produced medications to prevent virus infection and distributed them to the public for free.”

There is another larger implication of the intolerant attitude of the authorities in Himachal Pradesh. One can understand that with this type of behaviour, more and more Tibetan refugees want to leave India. At a time when the Central Government is taking up the defence of the oppressed minorities in neighbouring countries, why harass the Tibetans, who since they left their country, have sided with India even in difficult times? Remember the Tibetan Special Frontiers Forces’ participation in the Liberation of Bangladesh in 1971?

The situation is already dismal. The Tibet Sun wrote: “The demographic landscape of the Tibetans in exile has drastically changed, with more than half the population shown by survey to have moved from India to Western countries.” At one point, more than 1,35,000 Tibetans lived in India. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) recently confirmed that the number of Tibetans in India has reduced drastically (to 72,000 according to some sources).

Is it in India’s interests to antagonise a population, which already feels let down? No, it is not. Let us just hope that the local authorities will understand that, even if they are unable to grasp the larger political scenario, with China trying hard to attract the Tibetans back to Tibet.

8,27-2-20,The court rap,"While the SC pulls up the police, the Delhi HC seeks action on FIRs against BJP leaders spewing hate rhetoric

This has now become quite the norm in this country, the judiciary not only becoming the voice of reason in our collective heads but telling the executive what it knows but chooses to forget all too conveniently according to political imperatives. First, it was the Supreme Court, which rapped the Delhi Police for its failure to control violence and allowing the situation in north-east Delhi, arising out of protests over the citizenship law, to drift. Second, the Delhi High Court, too, shamed it and cautioned the authorities to remain alert so that the carnage of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was not repeated. It further sought registration of FIRs in all cases related to hate speeches and pulled it up for not acting against BJP leader Kapil Mishra.

The top court came down hard on the police, lamenting its lack of professionalism and shaming it for waiting to take orders from the powers that be. No matter what, the court chided, it could not hide under the fig leaf of acting under the Government’s direction and not dispense its basic, clinical duty, that of maintaining law and order. Undoubtedly, Delhi police has a tough balancing act to do, considering the fact that unlike other forces in the country, which report directly to the respective State Governments, it has to take orders from the Ministry of Home Affairs. But is the mandate to toe its political master’s choice above its duty to keep the peace? One of the principles of good policing is that the forces should function without any fear and favour, which they haven’t. The failure of the top brass, too, in guiding junior colleagues and building their preparedness to face a riot-like scenario is all too apparent. With Amulya Patnaik’s tenure coming to an end this month, his successor SN Shrivastava, who will take charge as the Delhi Police chief early next month, has a grave challenge ahead: To neutralise the criticism, instill a sense of purpose and impartiality within the men in uniform and win back the trust of the community, which at this point of time is non-existent. The police has to appear to be above board and with images and videos in a digitally aware society, it has been seen as nothing but a wimp. Even in the latest bout of violence, the police failed to deploy its existing strengths optimally despite clear signs over the last three days that they would be needed in large numbers. Yet its active involvement in the violence speaks volumes about it being tardy and directionless in its approach. Excuses for the lack of preparedness would be far-fetched for in the present case, the BJP leader, whose provocative words were the turning point in protests becoming violent, issued an ultimatum right in front of a senior police officer. An armed man had the gumption to confront an unarmed police officer, intimidate him and force him back with his hands raised before he fired a few shots in the air. This acquiescence to a member of a Central ruling party seems shocking considering that the same force had barged into the premises of a hostel library, hunting down students with the use of lathis and tear gas, just because they represented dissent. It is this partisan conduct of the police that has sent the wrong message to lumpens who feel emboldened by the fact that they stand protected because of their ideology and the party they represent. Before the recent clashes, the Delhi police has been fairly consistent in its crackdowns, be it at Tees Hazari during the lawyer-police clashes, at the Jamia Millia Islamia University, Shaheen Bagh and the Jawaharlal Nehru University to name a few. So it cannot claim a defanged status now. Given the pathetic state of affairs in public administration and the feeble claims of the police, the top court’s anguish is understandable. Which is why it deferred hearing the plea for shifting the Shaheen Bagh protesters until March 23. In doing so, it has given the executive a chance at dialogue and resolving the situation by simmering down tensions. This brings into the picture the role of the Government in containing inflammable situations that cost human lives. No matter how many reforms are brought about in the police force or how much the overhaul, the executive must have the political will to steer the discourse amicably. A confrontationist approach works only when you are in the Opposition party and not when you are in governance. The BJP has lost Delhi for sure but it cannot cry over spilt milk. If indeed it wants to contain the damage done to its declared intent, then it must attempt a dispute resolution rather than passing on that agency to the courts. No citizen wants a Government which has to be sermonised. Every citizen expects a Government to be responsive, not abrasive.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-court-rap-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-court-rap.html
9,27-2-20,No gold rush,"Claims of the mineral’s deposit in Sonbhadra, UP, show us why we must not jump the gun or celebrate

Uttar Pradesh’s Sonbhadra district recently “struck gold” with the district mining officer KK Rai claiming that his team found deposits amounting to 3,000 tonnes. However, the euphoria around the “find” faded soon enough after the Geological Survey of India (GSI) stepped in to clarify that the estimated reserve was actually a paltry 160 kg. Though the GSI’s announcement was a disappointment for the country, it proved to be an even bigger blow to those who started celebrating and taking credit for the “big find.” It also was a lesson in circumspection for media houses, which pounced on the news the second the claims were made and did not bother to verify them. Consequently, quite a few of them were left red-faced when the GSI stepped in to clarify the truth. Had the news been true, the deposits would have been almost five times India’s current gold reserves of 626 tonnes and would have been worth an estimated Rs 12 lakh crore. It would be a lifeline for a cash-strapped Government.

The addition of 3,000 tonnes to the country’s gold reserves would have made us the nation with the world’s second largest stock after the US, which has the biggest gold stockpile in the world at 8,133 tonnes, upstaging Germany with 3,366 tonnes. A real discovery would have bolstered the economy of Sonbhadra district, encouraging mining and allied activities, which could have generated jobs. The find would have also cut imports significantly over the next five years, leading to immense foreign exchange savings, because despite India’s gold imports falling in 2019 to 646 tonnes, it still remains the largest importer of the yellow metal after China and imports 800-900 tonnes annually. Apart from that, had the quality of the gold been good enough, it could have been used as instant collateral for long-term loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), like it was done during the economic crisis of 1991. The only way to save the economy and Government from defaulting on the balance of payments at that time was to secure a loan of $2.2 billion from the IMF. India had then pledged 67 tonnes of its bullion. This helped the country raise $600 million (more than Rs 4,000 crore today) and by 1992-93 the economy started to improve. After 18 years, the Indian Government got back 200 tonnes of the yellow metal (almost three times of what was pawned) from the IMF. This ultimately led to our economy to be the force to be reckoned with it is today.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-gold-rush-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-gold-rush.html

In the last two decades, the gender landscape in rural India has been slowly greening and women are now on the cusp of a powerful social and political revolution. The harbinger of this change is a unique policy experiment in village-level governance that has brought transformative results for the weakest of the weak and the poorest of the poor: The village women. In 1993, India introduced the Panchayati Raj Act, mandating a three-tiered structure of local governance at the village, block and district levels with reservation of one-third of all posts in gram panchayats (village councils) at the bottom tier of India’s decentralised governance system, for women. The vision was that these women-headed councils would bring greater transparency and better governance in their villages. It revitalised an age-old system of rural local Government whose name “panchayat” is drawn from Sanskrit, meaning the council of five wise men.

This new law was a step towards the fruition of Mahatma Gandhi’s dreams of village-level self-governance with gender justice as a key pillar. Gandhi believed that, if implemented correctly, the Panchayati Raj system would alleviate the alienation of the common people from governance and also preclude the external intervention of higher-level civic officials, who might not be familiar with the concerns of local people. Earlier politics was considered a foul word and women were expected to keep a hygienic distance from it. However, development scientists and social activists now acknowledge that the modern development paradigm has a political salience and politics underpins all facets of development. It is politics which is the firing engine for all the cylinders of development. It is true that political power needs to be sanitised and has to be reinforced with ethical underpinnings in order to make it more benevolent. This can come about only when more educated and development-oriented individuals embrace politics as a critical arena for innovation and change. Politics is the fulcrum of governance and unless the quality of political timber is improved, governance will continue to limp.

Experience of this social and political experiment has shown that women are not just equal to the task but orientate public-good provision more towards the preferences of their gender, namely more water, health and roads. Though less politically-savvy and often only semi-illiterate, these women had an advantage in being actively mentored by the district bureaucracy. Several NGOs also designed programmes for skilling them in governance. Women face a host of difficulties handling political power: Cultural norms, social hierarchies and patriarchal practices — which together tend to favour and attract men and discourage the participation of women.

Several women who started their political careers as self-described “rubber stamp” officials are now asking questions about Budget allocations. They stride about in Government offices with polished informality sharing their concerns with officials in tones of supportiveness and also assertiveness. They are successfully challenging the traditional village male elite by defying petrified social codes of female bias and are now powerful aspirational symbols and role models. Women leaders today are more than just mouthpieces for their politically-savvy husbands. For most of them, reserved posts offer the only real opportunity to bring change to their communities. When these seats are coupled with new skills — from public speaking to development planning to budget management — they are better prepared to deliver development to their societies and negotiate within the political space that has opened for them. However, the path they have trodden after the initial euphoria of winning the elections has not been easy. There have been growing pains and many early entrants retreated, never to emerge again. The avalanche of social and cultural mores rained heavily on them. Although the resistance is whittling down, it is clear that achieving gender equality in leadership will require sustained policy actions that favour women over a long time.

The vision is truly not as romantic as many would like us to believe. But, as women have shown, they have all that is needed to ride out these storms. The men know this very well but they don’t want to concede that women possess the ability to be the better halves because they are afraid of losing their last refuge, politics.

In the long-term, the journey is going to be harder and tougher than policy wonks can imagine. The wait could potentially be eternal. But if bureaucrats can muster the will, they can succeed. They know from past lessons that they have the tools and they need to vigorously back reforms that can engender greater empowerment for women. For sustainable change to happen, women need to actively compete in the present political game. Legislation and policy pronouncements seldom penetrate the surface of social and political barriers. They are ultimately impotent against the grid of the established power structures inherent in most rural households and villages.

The great strength of democracy, according to Amartya Sen, lies in that, “it gives people in need a voice and, by so doing, plays a protective role against so many different forms of political and economic abuse”. The Panchayati Raj is just a beginning; it is only one step on the way, but it is the right step on the right ladder.

These women are reconfiguring gender and social dynamics and have started exploring their wider responsibilities as stakeholders as citizens of a polity. However, decentralisation is not easy. The skill levels in impoverished communities are very low. And, in a country where democracy has been established in a top-down manner, a feudal mindset may still prevail. The people may not be aware that the Government should be accountable to the people — not the other way around.

A lot of positive changes are coming in the better-governed villages. There are still large swathes where discriminatory traditions continue to dominate. Several factors constrain the effective participation of women leaders. Some of these relate to a patriarchal culture, which neither sees women as political entities nor allows them to develop their potential. The same cultural standards also prohibit women from envisioning themselves as political entities. Other related factors that constrain participation are a lack of basic familiarity of women with political governance and absence of legal literacy. Women need to be given adequate advocacy tools strengthening democratic engagement and gain control over local resources and influence over local governance. Village assemblies are a critical participatory institution in providing equal access to all members of the community to the deliberations and negotiations in local governance; but elite control of these bodies has prevented functional democracy from taking roots. It has been found that the average participants in such village assemblies are the less-poor households with the participation of the poor dwindling over the years. This is the reason why, in several remote and tribal pockets, Panchayat Raj has failed to enhance the social outcomes for most citizens.

The social pecking order of villages cannot be overturned easily and several challenges remain to fuller empowerment. Legitimately-elected women representatives remain vulnerable to manipulation and harassment and are often reduced to mere proxies, while the real decision-making authority remains with their husbands or power brokers from higher castes. There are also instances where a woman belonging to a Scheduled Caste or tribe has been elected as head of a panchayat but is at the mercy of her upper caste landlord in the village for her livelihood. In such cases, too, the reins of power and decision-making clearly lie elsewhere.

At the policy level, we must understand the structural impediments in the full evolution of Gram Panchayats as functional governance units remain. The Panchayati Raj Act created these bodies but did not endow them with various governance functions — like the financial authority on provision of education, health, sanitation and water. Instead the law simply enumerated the functions that could be transferred and left it to the State Legislature to devolve them. There has been very little devolution of authority and functions till now. Gram sabhas were expected to be the primary legislature of rural governance with responsibilities to catalyse local planning by conducting ‘needs assessment’ exercises and devising plans for development projects that would be aggregated at the panchayat level. When further aggregated and rationalised at the district level, these would become official inputs into the State Government’s annual budgeting process.

Gram sabhas did remain a pivotal institution in local planning; but had little real role in governance. Despite the noble intention, they have struggled to stay relevant. They continue to be plagued by low participation and frequent hijacking by influential interests and have not been able to mature into viable democratic units. The dip in popular participation and weak political will has had significant implications for the future of democratic decentralisation in India.

The heroic stories of tenacious women scripting tales of success are great signs of a brighter tomorrow. Women’s empowerment is a journey, not a fixed point that yields to simple policies.

12,27-2-20,Uproar on ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ slogan in House,"The Budget Session of Haryana Assembly on Wednesday saw an uproar on the slogan of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ raised by Congress MLA Geeta Bhukkal, who said the Manohar Lal Khattar government in the state only had this slogan.

During the Question Hour, when a question was being answered, BJP MLA from Ambala city Aseem Goyal claimed that Bhukkal took a dig and mocked the treasury benches by raising slogan of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'.

Members from the treasury bench interrupted the proceedings for mocking at the slogan and shouted slogan of Bharat Mata Ki Jai in the House. After slogan of BJP MLAs, Congress MLAs also raised slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai.

Pointing at Congress MLAs, Goyal said every Indian raises this slogan and accused them of being ashamed of raising it. As soon as he said this, Congress MLAs Rajendra Singh Joon, Rao Dan Singh and Aftab Ahmed stood up from their seats.

They said that no one has any problem when someone says Bharat Mata ki Jai. ""This slogan is not registered for any single party,"" they said. Goyal started shouting slogans of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' within the House. As Congress MLAs were furious at being dubbed Pakistanis, Speaker Gian Chand Gupta left his seat thrice to calm the rising temper.

Bhukkal and several other Congress MLAs also raised a demand for an apology from Aseem Goyal but it was submerged in the din of the House.

Expressing surprise over the statement of Goyal, senior Congress leader Kiran Choudhary too chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’.

There was a ruckus in the House for around five to ten minutes. Neither leader of the House chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar nor leader of the opposition and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was present during the commotion.

The controversy erupted again when minister Ranjit Singh Chautala was trying to calm down the members. Chautala said we should not do politics in the case of Bharat Mata Ki Jai. Home Minister Anil Vij said that Bharat Mata is our pride and self-respect, but the opposition legislators have ridiculed the issue.

15,27-2-20,Coronavirus delays supply of smartphones: Capt,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh diagnosed corona virus as a malady afflicting supply of smartphones in the State. Capt Amarinder, concluding the debate on the Governor’s Address on Wednesday, declared that smartphones are the out-of-coverage area for Punjab youth following the outbreak of coronavirus in China — drawing sharp criticism from the opposition.

The Chief Minister informed the House that providing smartphones was the topmost priority of the State Government, and it would surely be distributed. “However, the delay is due to coronavirus,” said the Chief Minister.

Taking a dig at Capt Amarinder’s statement, the Opposition refused to buy the Chief Minister’s reasons and lashed out at him for coming out with novel “excuses” every time for not fulfilling the pre-poll promises.

Notably, the Congress party, before coming to power, had declared in its election manifesto to distribute free mobile phones to the youth to “encourage and incentivize them to use digital technology in day-to-day lives” under Connect with Capt campaign.

Even, in its first budget, the state government had allotted Rs 10 crore budget for the ‘smartphones for youth’ for the first phase of the scheme. However, the phones were never distributed in the state government’s three-year tenure.

The opposition has, time and again, take on the ruling party for not fulfilling its promise to the state’s youth.

Clarifying the government’s stand on it, the Chief Minister said that the first set of smartphones, promised by the Government, would be distributed as soon as China is able to send them to Punjab.

“The phones have already been ordered from China, which unfortunately had to delay the release of the order due to the unprecedented coronavirus problem,” said the government press statement quoting the Chief Minister.

He said that the issue had been rightly raised by some of the members since the promise of smartphones was part of his government’s election manifesto. “The State Government has already notified the scheme and procurement of the phones has only been delayed due to the health emergency that had led to a shutdown in China, as a result of which the consignment of phones has not been received,” he added.

The phones will be provided as soon as we receive the consignment, Capt Amarinder said adding that the Congress president had, in fact, set up committees to ensure implementation of all promises in Congress-led states and the smartphones promise would definitely be fulfilled by his government at the earliest possible.

Notably, the State Cabinet in September 2019 had decided to accelerate the process of distribution of mobile phones besides approving various modalities for the choice of vendor and bidding process.

At that time, it was decided that the first set of mobile phones would be distributed from December 2019 to girl students studying in Class XI and XII in government schools, who do not already own a smartphone.

It was also decided that the vendor, who would implement the scheme, would be selected in a transparent manner by the Punjab Information Technology Corporation Limited, a government agency.

Following this, the Chief Minister, on December 2, 2019, tweeted that the first set of mobile phones would be distributed on the Republic Day. “This 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, we will start the 1st Phase of the smartphone distribution. 1st batch of 1.6 lakh smartphones will be given to girl students of Class 11 & 12. Hoping that these phones will help them in their studies & make them more tech-savvy,” tweeted the Chief Minister.

As the State Government once again dropped its plans to distribute the much-awaited smartphones on Republic Day, the state Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla announced another deadline, March 31, 2020, pointing that the mobile phones were being tested, and it was taking time.

Now, the Chief Minister on Wednesday said in the House that the phones will be provided as soon as the Government would receive the consignment, which has been delayed due to coronavirus.

Dubbing the excuse as “hilarious”, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Aman Arora underlined that the promise is older than the coronavirus. “Coronavirus came just a month back, but the government’s promise is three years old. Now they are saying that smartphones could not be distributed because of coronavirus,” said Arora.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-delays-supply-of-smartphones--capt.html
16,27-2-20,Punjab suffered losses of `3K cr due to illegal mining,"Digging deep into the losses incurred by the State, Punjab Mining and Water Resources Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria on Wednesday claimed that the State suffered a loss of Rs 3,000 crore due to illegal mining during the previous SAD-BJP Government.

Responding to the query raised by Congress Baba Bakala MLA Santokh Singh Bhalaipur, Sarkaria alleged that the revenue of Rs 3,000 crore, that could have been earned by the Government, was looted because of illegal mining during the 10-year of SAD-BJP regime.

“During the 10 years tenure of their government, the State earned Rs 35 to 40 crore from the mining auctions. We wanted to auction the sites after bringing new policy, but mafia stopped us by procuring stay from the High Court. After seven month fight, we have now conduct the auction of sites in July and earned Rs 306 crore,” said Sarkaria, adding that just to save their wrongdoings, Akalis are now blaming the ruling government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-suffered-losses-of--3k-cr-due-to-illegal-mining.html
17,27-2-20,Paddy issue refuses to die down,"Opposition staged a walk-out in the Assembly and forced an adjournment on Wednesday, the third day of Budget session.

They raised the issue of agitating farmers demanding that the state government should come up with statement to procure the paddy from those farmers having been issued token.

Raising the issue BJP leaders Brijmohan Agrawal, Ajay Chandrakar, Shivratan Sharma, Dharamjeet Singh and others said their only demand is that Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel should announce procurement of paddy from farmers who were issued token. Former chief minister Raman Singh said farmers are seeking permission for euthanasia, such had never happened during his tenure.

For last seven days and night braving rains, the farmers are continuing their agitation. To end it, government should come up with announcement, the Opposition demanded.

Speaker then adjourned the House for five minutes as din continued. After it resumed, Agriculture minister Ravindra Choubey came up with suomoto statement stating non-seasonal rains and hail storms had affected crops in districts of Koriya, Surguja, Surajpur, Balrampur, Jashpur, Bemetara, Kawardha, Durg, Rajnandgaon and Raipur affecting Rabi crops. Government has directed all collectors to provide compensation under RBC 6(4). Action for compensation is initiated for insured farmers, the minister said.

Not satisfied with the reply, the BJP and other opposition leaders then walked out of the House in protest.

After they returned, Brijmohan Agrawal raised objection stating already a call attention motion has been moved on the same issue and it is a violation of rules of the House, which was countered by Choubey stating it was suo moto statement in favour of farmers. Treasury benches said opposition is adopting escape route from discussion. Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik read the call attention motion, Revenue Minister Jaisingh Agrawal then gave reply to it stating, government has initiated action to provide compensation to farmers affected by natural calamity.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/paddy-issue-refuses-to-die-down.html

According to a press release from EOW, Aman Singh and his wife Yasmin Singh were booked under sections of Prevention of Corruption Act and 120 (B). The FIR was filed on the complaint of a Raipur-based RTI activist.

“Aman Singh and his wife had amassed disproportionate assets in different cities like Raipur, Bhopal, Delhi and also in foreign nations which we are investigating,” the press release mentioned.

The release further claimed that Singh has formed shell companies which were engaged in money laundering. “ It was found that shell companies –Vyas Mines and Minerals, Samay Multi Trade, Shrishti Natural Resources , YN Singh Memorial Foundation and Kargil India Limited – was made by them and crores of money laundering was done,” the release said adding that Singh was himself a promoter of YN Singh memorial foundation even though he was a government employee.

Meanwhile, reacting over the action, Aman Singh termed it ‘political witch-hunting’. In a statement he said “I have learnt that the state (Chhattisgarh) has lodged an FIR against me and my family. But I have applied for a copy but it has not been provided to me. Therefore, I am not aware of its contents. The FIR has clearly been done at the behest of the Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and only to harass my family and to subvert the judicial process in the midst of the High Court’s hearing on my petition in which I had challenged the mala fide and malicious EOW enquiry on a false and frivolous complaint.”

The least the state could have done was to wait for honourable High Court’s decision, he said.

“The present political dispensation is doing everything it can to falsely implicate me and my family, and I have petitioned the High Court to defend my fundamental rights,” said Singh, who served as principal secretary to erstwhile chief minister Raman Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/eow-registers-fir-against-aman---spouse.html

Thakur, who is also the Leader of the House, along with Opposition leader Mukesh Agnihotri took him to the Speaker's chair. Subsequently, Parmar took charge as the new Speaker of the state assembly.

The 55-year-old BJP leader was unanimously declared as the new Speaker as no other member of the legislative assembly filed a nomination. The opposition Congress with a strength of 21 members in the 68-member House did not file any nomination for the post.

23,27-2-20,"After UT's objection, MoEF rejects Punjab's ESZ proposal","Following the objections raised by the Chandigarh Administration, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has rejected Punjab Government’s proposal of only 100 meters of eco-sensitive area around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. A letter in this regard has been received by Punjab Government and Chandigarh Administration.

Confirming the development, Debendra Dalai, Chief Conservator of Forests, UT Chandigarh said, Punjab Government has been asked to submit a revised proposal for ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary after consulting the UT Administration.

He said that the Administration had objected to Punjab Government’s proposal and had written to the MoEF regarding this. The ESZ around the wildlife sanctuary is essential to act as a shock absorber. The Administration had stated that Punjab’s ESZ proposal would immensely damage the wildlife and have adverse impact of the health of Sukhna Lake, he added. Rejecting the Punjab Government’s proposal, the MoEF in its letter has stated, “The Administration has raised objection to Punjab Government’s proposal of 100 meters of ESZ area around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. It is recommended that the ESZ area should be one km. Consequently, Punjab Government is asked to revise its ESZ proposal and submit it again.”

The Ministry further stated, “Both the Governments of Punjab and Haryana should prepare their ESZ proposals in consultation with the UT Administration.” In 2017, Chandigarh had declared eco sensitive zone around the sanctuary in the area that falls within the boundary of union territory of Chandigarh. The width of this ESZ in Chandigarh ranges from 2 - 2.75 kms.

However, the area that falls under Punjab and Haryana is yet to be notified as ESZ. Punjab Government had last year sent a proposal to Government of India recommending only 100 meters width area as ESZ from the boundary of Sanctuary.

This is not the first time that Punjab Government has sent this proposal to the Union Ministry. In 2014 also, the neighboring Punjab Government had proposed just 100 meters area as ESZ around the Sanctuary. At that time also, after UT Administration’s objection, MoEF had asked Punjab Government to extend the ESZ area and submit a revised proposal to ensure protection of the wildlife sanctuary and Sukhna wetland. The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary spreads over an area of 26 sq km. According to the UT officials, the catchment area around the Sanctuary is around 36 running kilometers. Out of the total area of catchment, around 10 percent of the perimeter of Sanctuary abuts the city and the major part is along neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after-ut-s-objection--moef-rejects-punjab-s-esz-proposal.html
24,27-2-20,"Capt Amarinder presents report card of Govt, claims full marks","Three years after coming to power in Punjab, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday laid before the Vidhan Sabha its report card claiming full marks. At the same time, the Chief Minister shared the future blue print of fulfilling its “remaining” promises while making several announcements.

Sharing the government’s achievements point by point as per the ‘Nawen Naroye Punjab Layee Captain De Naun Nukte’ (nine points of Captain for rejuvenated Punjab) based on the party manifesto released during the 2017 assembly polls, Capt Amarinder announced that the next Pay Commission would start its work soon and it would be implemented in the coming year.

Claiming to have broken the backbone of drugs as promised by him by holding ‘Gutka Sahib’, Capt Amarinder said that the Government would soon bring the State Drug Control Legislation.

Capt Amarinder, clearing air on doubts regarding implementation of the reservation policy in Punjab after the Supreme Court’s ruling mandating states to decide on job quota to SCs/STs, made it clear that the Government reservation policy would continue in the government jobs and promotions in the State, and there was no question of revoking the same.

Underlining the State Government’s commitment to transparency in governance and accountability in public services, the Chief Minister announced that the new Lokpal Bill will soon be tabled in the Assembly covering all officials, right from the Chief Minister.

The Chief Minister also announced a new state Law University at Tarn Taran. He also announced a new policy, to be unveiled soon, for upgradation of schools in the State, besides further strengthening the Smart Schools network, operationalisation of five new colleges this year, intensification and expansion of ‘Parho Punjab Padhao Punjab’ programme in mission mode to scale up the education system, he said.

Expressing satisfaction over the state government’s performance, the Chief Minister said that they had achieved major success on all fronts, including elimination of drugs from the state, maintaining law and order, ensuring Ghar Ghar Rozgar, debt waiver scheme for farmers besides providing affordable Bijli, Paani and Safai Suraksha for trade, business and industry.

Apart from these, initiatives like reservation of 50 percent seats for women in punchayati raj institutions, and urban local bodies, free housing for homeless families belonging to Scheduled Castes and other weaker sections, enhanced reservation of 15 percent in educational institutions to economical weaker sections besides raising the eligibility income limit from Rs six to eight lakh and appointment of 4,300 Guardians of Governance (GoGs) from amongst ex-servicemen to oversee the execution of all socio-economic development programmes had been widely appreciated by one and all, said Capt Amarinder.

‘WILL GIVE LIFE RATHER THAN STATE’S WATER’

Capt Amarinder declared that he was ready to give up his life rather than give the state’s scare water resources to other states.

He declared that Punjab did not have surplus water and, in line with internationally accepted riparian principles, would not allow transfer of water from basin to non-basin areas. “The Government has made every possible effort to achieve this and shall continue to work in for protecting the water rights of Punjab, to ensure the livelihood of millions of Punjabi farmers and landless farm labourers,” he said pointing out that protecting the state’s water was a top priority for his government.

Regarding saving water, he said that apart from enactment of Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Act 2020, the Government had also piloted a unique project namely ‘Pani Bachao Paisa Kamao’, aimed at incentivizing farmers to save water and earn money by consuming lesser ground water.

“The project, under which agriculture consumers are given a fixed electricity entitlement for every month of the year and no bills are issued to the farmers, will be expanded under the Budget 2020-21,” he said.

ALL PARTY DELEGATION TO MEET PM ON MSP ISSUE

Urging the Central Government not to tinker with MSP-based procurement of food grains in any way as it will badly affect the livelihood of a large number of farmers and impair food security of the nation, Capt Amarinder said that an all-party delegation would meet the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue.

CAPT TRASHES AAP’S MUCH-HYPED DELHI DEVELOPMENT MODEL

Trashing AAP’s so-called Delhi model of development, Capt Amarinder said that his government had made bigger strides in Punjab on all counts, including the much-hyped education and power subsidies provided by the Arvind Kejriwal government in the national capital.

“Notwithstanding the limited resources, the government is providing total power subsidy of over Rs 12,000 crore this year, with around Rs 9000 crore to agriculture, 1500 crore to industry and 1900 crore to domestic consumers,” he said pointing that power rates for commercial establishments is Rs 7.75 per unit in Punjab as compared to Rs 10.90 per unit in Delhi.

Saying that the performance of Punjab Government’s schools was, in fact, better than Delhi, he cited the Class X results for 2019, which showed pass percentage at 72 percent in Delhi government schools against 88 percent in Punjab.

‘PSPCL, POWER DEPT EXPLORING OPTIONS TO REDUCE POWER RATES’

Responding to concerns of higher electricity tariff for the domestic consumers, he said that to bring down the same to more affordable levels, he has asked the State Power Department and the Punjab State Power Corporation to explore every possible option to make it comparable, if not less, with the neighbouring States.

The government will soon come out with a comprehensive policy on this, he added.

“The government remained unequivocally committed to supplying quality power to all domestic consumers at affordable prices and will do whatever possible to achieve this, even if it amounts to renegotiation of PPAs signed by the previous government with private power generating companies,” he said.

As promised, the government will also lay on the table of the House a white paper, clearly elaborating the power situation and issues of concerns to the people of Punjab, announced the Chief Minister.

AAP CAN VERIFY JOB FIGURES FROM DATA WITH SPEAKER

Referring to the success of ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ programme, the Chief Minister said that so far, 1714 placement camps had been organized wherein employment or jobs had been facilitated to 57,905 youth in the government sector, with 3,96,775 getting jobs in the private sector through these camps and another 7,61,289 being facilitated into self-employment.

As the AAP MLAs, including Aman Arora pointed at difference in figures given by Chief Minister and mentioned in the Governor’s address, the Chief Minister said that he had all the data to prove these numbers and would share the same with the Speaker, from whom they could verify.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-amarinder-presents-report-card-of-govt--claims-full-marks.html

28,27-2-20,More security for Ranchi’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’ after Delhi debacle,"In the wake of the violence in New Delhi the District Administration here has beefed up security around Ranchi’s ‘Shaheen Bagh’ – a peaceful protest by women of the Muslim community against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) outside the Haj House in Kadru.

Soon after reports of communal clashes in the national capital went viral, the district police deployed additional forces and ordered 24x7 patrolling of the spot on Tuesday. Even on Wednesday, Assistant Sub Inspector and Sub Inspector rank officials visited the spot outside Haj House several times and increased the number of armed policemen maintaining a vigil at and around the area.

The protestors outside the Haj House in Ranchi have been a part of the sit-in for a little over a month. While minor incidents of slogans raised against a particular community have been reported in the area in the recent past, no incident of clashes between two groups or communities came to light.

On Tuesday, there were rumours that a pro-CAA group was planning a procession that would cross the Haj House and alerts were sounded.

However, it turned out that no such procession was planned, and the rumours made their way to the protestors through social media, police said.

“We are maintaining 24x7 vigil outside Haj House. Our men are patrolling the area of two-wheelers throughout the day. Barring a few rumours and sloganeering, incidents of violence in any form have not been reported from the spot,” said Officer In-Charge of Argora Police Station, Binod Kumar.

The police have also strengthened the security outside important mosques and temples in the city as a precautionary measure.

Armed men were deployed outside the Hanuman Temple and Eqra Masjid on Mahatma Gandhi Road soon after violence in New Delhi was reported, police said.

The Administration in the National Capital clamped curfew in some parts of the city after over 20 people died in alleged communal clashes reported on Tuesday. Precautionary measures were taken in Ranchi immediately after the Delhi violence, police said. No incidents of clashes or tension were reported in Ranchi in the past 48 hours, police said.

Ladle Khan, a member of the Islamia Committee, said that some unsocial elements raise slogans against a particular community while crossing the area on motorcycles and cars. However, they do not confront the protestors directly. “Such incidents obviously cause panic as almost all the protestors here are women from different age groups. And we do not want any form of violence,” he said, adding that many members of other communities have also supported the Haj House protestors and the movement was not just about the rights of the Muslim community anymore.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/more-security-for-ranchi---s----shaheen-bagh----after-delhi-debacle.html
29,27-2-20,"JMM leaders, workers back Guruji for RS polls","Senior leaders and workers of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the largest party in the State Assembly, have expressed the desire to unanimously back party patriarch Shibu Soren as one of the candidates from the UPA fold for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand, JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said on Wednesday.

“Most of the party workers and many senior leaders of JMM want Guruji to contest the Rajya Sabha elections this time. A decision regarding this will be taken soon,” Bhattacharya told this newspaper. He added that JMM and Congress party may nominate one candidate each for the two Rajya Sabha seats.

While Shibu Soren is likely to be JMM’s candidate, Congress party will take a call on its candidate for the election after getting a nod from the party high command. “We will take a decision only after getting a nod from the high command.

After the high command gives us a go-ahead on the candidates, we will have a meeting with other UPA partners in Jharkhand and take a decision,” said Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) Spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo.

One of the veterans of Jharkhand Movement, senior Soren lost to Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Sunil Soren in Dumka – a JMM stronghold – during the Lok Sabha elections held last year.

The three-time Chief Minister is looked up to by all members of the political fraternity here irrespective of party lines and ideologies. However, the 76-year-old is battling health concerns due to ageing and has been frail lately, sources from the party said.

JMM has yet not pondered upon any other candidate for the elections, party sources said.

However, while JMM leaders are open to the idea of nominating only one candidate, insiders from the Congress party said that the latter might think of nominating two candidates from Jharkhand – a decision that may trigger differences between the two of the three partners in the coalition Government here.

JMM has 29 seats in the 81-member Assembly, while Congress party has 16 seats. The third partner, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has only one legislator in Jharkhand. BJP, the second largest party in the Assembly, has 25 legislators.

Elections will be held for two of six Rajya Sabha seats in Jharkhand, currently occupied by BJP’s Parimal Nathwani and RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, this year.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has on Tuesday announced that the elections for the two seats in Jharkhand will be held on March 26.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jmm-leaders--workers-back-guruji-for-rs-polls.html

39,27-2-20,Confusion over Leader of Opposition continues,"The confusion over Leader of Opposition’s post in State Assembly has intensified after the Speaker’s office invited senior BJP leader and Ranchi MLA Chandreshwar Prasad Singh from BJP for all party meeting ahead of budget session commencing on February 28. However, Singh has refused to attend the meeting as BJP delegation claiming that Babulal Marandi is party leader in the House.

Marandi, who merged his 14-year old party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha on February 17 was made the BJP legislative party leader on February 24. Sources said that like last three day special session of Assembly, which was convened from January 6, in which the Leader of Opposition chair was vacant, this time also the chair is likely to be vacant.

Sources said the Speaker’s office is not in a hurry to declare Marandi as Leader of Opposition as JVM’s two other legislators Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey have declared their outfit as real JVM before joining the Congress. Sources said that the Speaker’s office wants to clear the confusion and in this connection the speaker office is taking the consent of legal experts. Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto said, “The Speaker’s office before announcing the Leader of Opposition is taking the views of legal experts. As the issue is serious the final decision will be taken as per law and constitutional experts.”

The Speaker refused to divulge time frame when the decision on Leader of Opposition will be taken. In the fourth Jharkhand Assembly, then Speaker Dinesh Oraon took almost four years in upholding the merger of six JVM MLAs with the BJP. Challenging the merger, the JVM had filed the petition of demanding disqualification of MLAs under the 10th Schedule.

Sources said that the BJP too is in mood not to let the issue go easily, as CP Singh has refused to attend the all party meet called by Speaker. Singh said, “I will not attend the speaker meet as our leader is Babulal Marandi. The party legislators elected Marandi as their leader in the election process carried out in presence of observer.”

Former State Chief Minister Babulal Marandi was elected as BJP Legislative Party Leader on Monday. With the election of Marandi as BJP legislative party leader, who merged his 14-year-old party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) with the BJP on February 17, he is likely to become the Leader of Opposition in House.

After the elections, the BJP had not elected its Legislative party head as it was kept vacant for Marandi. The Assembly polls concluded in December 2019 and post of BJP Legislative party leader remained vacant for two months.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/confusion-over-leader-of-opposition-continues.html
40,27-2-20,ACB conducts raids at 4 Govt offices,"Teams of Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) raided several government offices in the State including Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC), Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), Ranchi Registry Office and Doranda Police Station on Wednesday.

Talking to the media persons on the matter, ACB ADG Neeraj Sinha said that the department can raid the places from where it gets complaints. It is written in ACB resolution, he added.

Sinha said that after receiving the complaint, the ACB team reaches the department and investigates the facts related to the complaint. ACB has the Government's permission to carry out raids, it is also written in the ACB’s resolution. During the raid, a nodal officer is also given by the administration, he added.

The ADG said that whatever error is found after the raid, it is sent to the department on behalf of ACB. “The concerned department decides where the error has happened, after which the department takes action from its level. On the matter which requires legal action, the department then writes to the ACB and the ACB takes legal action against them,” he added.

Ranchi Mayor Asha Lakra has expressed strong opposition to ACB action on RMC. She called the DSP rank officer of ACB at his office in the corporation and asked the reason for taking action.

Speaking on Lakra’s reactions Sinha said that at the Government level, he has received orders that the works of common people are being ignored in the corporation. Only after this, his team conducted raids in the corporation, he added.

The Mayor objected to this, saying that the corporation is an autonomous institution. “ACB cannot raid it without notice. If they have to take action, first they have to give information,” she added. On this, the DSP of ACB told the Mayor that surprise inspection of ACB takes place without any notice.

Later, talking to the media, Lakra said that the corporation was not informed about ACB’s action. “Actually, there is a well-planned conspiracy of Hemant Soren Government behind doing this,” she added.

The ACB team also raided DMC. The team is searching the files related to the development work of the past several years. The officers and employees of DMC have become conscious with this raid. A team of Anti-Corruption Bureau reached DMC office from Ranchi in the morning and was scrutinizing the files. On Wednesday morning, an ACB team led by DSP Mujibul Ansari reached the DMC office. The investigation team includes Ranchi ACB officials.

Reacting on the issue Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) Spokesperson, Rajiv Ranjan said that preventing ACB officials to conduct raids at RMC office by Ranchi Mayor is unfortunate and condemnable.

“The State Government of Grand Alliance is completely responsible towards people of the State. Former Government had devastated system in the State. The department should provide its services within stipulated time period,” said Ranjan. Meanwhile, State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo alleged that the ACB raided Dhanbad and Ranchi Municipal Corporation today on the behest of the State government was totally illegal.

Pratul said that before such raids, the head of the autonomous organisation, who is the Mayor, should have been informed, which was not given by the ACB. Apart from this, it is clearly written in section 18 that whenever there is an inspection of a bankers’ book, then it cannot be made below the rank of SP. While today the ACB team was headed by a DSP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/acb-conducts-raids-at-4-govt-offices.html

53,27-2-20,"UT Admn to revise PG policy, also set to decrease additional FAR charges","Following severe backlash from various quarters over its failure to regulate the mushrooming illegal paying guest (PG) accommodations in the city, the Chandigarh Administration is now all set to introduce stringent provisions in the existing PG policy besides giving relaxations to make provisions for construction of hostels in schools and colleges.

The decisions were taken during the meeting of senior officers of UT Administration held under Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Badnore here on Wednesday.

During the meeting, Badnore expressed concern on the loss of three innocent lives in the fire tragedy recently and asked the Administration to finalize the revised PG policy and present it to him at the earliest.

The Administration has decided that fire safety clearance and annual renewal of registration would be made mandatory for the PGs in the city.

The UT Administrator directed that the Police should also ensure regular inspections of the PGs.

It has also been decided to constitute an enforcement squad to conduct regular inspection of PGs across the city. Also, nodal officers would be appointed to keep check on unauthorized PG facilities in the city. Among various provisions of the existing PG policy, the Administration remains in a fix over the clause that makes it mandatory for the house owner to reside in the house. The Administration is likely to discuss this matter in the Administrator’s Advisory Council now.

UT Admn to approach Centre

With hostel facilities for students remaining almost non-existent in the city schools and colleges resulting in rampant growth of unauthorized PGs facilities, the UT Administration has decided to relax provisions for the construction of hostels in educational institutions here.

For this, the Administration will write to the Centre for decreasing the high charges for additional FAR in educational institutions

Under its policy, the Administration had allowed educational institutions to opt for an increase in FAR for additional construction on their premises. The policy allowed for the construction of hostels by availing an additional FAR from 0.5 to 0.75. The charges were notified and fixed at Rs 3,400 per square feet last year.

“The Administration will write to the Centre seeking permission to make changes in the FAR policy for educational institutions and to ensure nominal charges for increase in FAR. This would ensure construction of hostels in schools and colleges here,” said UT Adviser Manoj Parida while talking to The Pioneer.

He said that there is a growing demand for more hostels facilities here. Apart from this, the Administration has decided to revise the exiting PG policy. The final draft will be put forth the UT Administrator soon for approval, he said.

It has also been decided to constitute a dedicated enforcement squad to conduct inspections of PGs, he added.

47 more illegal PGs found

D e ongoing inspection drive, the UT Estate office has issued notices to 47 illegal PGs.

While notices have been issued to 47 more illegal PGs, 29 complaints were received at the helpline for reporting illegal PGs, said a senior UT officer.

The next indication is the fall in corporate profits. Most significantly, copper trading constitutes the barometer of economic health because of its extensive use in homebuilding and commercial construction.

When economic hiccups occur badly, gold prices soar. It has now become 20% higher since last May when the US and China escalated their tariff fight. Historically, gold trading is known as the safest haven in times of economic uncertainty.

Similarly, the global ‘Economic Policy Uncertainty' index tracks the amount of times media articles use buzzwords related to economic and political uncertainty. Additionally, it measures the number of tax laws set to expire and the spectrum of disagreement among economists: The more the dissent, the higher the index. Business spending too is critically important. Gross private domestic investment has been tumbling to alarmingly low levels in the recent times.

Cash-flush Indian corporates like ‘Maruti Suzuki', despite having flat raw material costs, have suffered heavily due to huge customer discounts and price cuts to boost sales. Maruti Suzuki’s operating margins, for instance, has contracted by over 5 percentage points. Other frontline companies such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland also saw operating margins shrink sharply by up to 3.5 percentage points in recent times. India’s economy hasn’t been this bad in 42 years. Pulling it back from the abyss will require honesty rather than imagination. This is the third year of unprecedented slowdown. Only Government spending hasn’t been so bad; and that’s probably the only silver lining to boast of. When Prime Minister Modi returned to power, he gave highly rosy projections of public finances which never happened as is evident from the latest budget presentation. Incidentally, State Governments have a deficit equal to 3% of GDP, higher than the budgeted 2.6%. No wonder, Indian corporate borrowers are making a beeline for overseas debt markets. Even borrowing abroad, which hit a new record of $22 billion last year, will become costlier should India’s sovereign rating fall into junk territory. S&P Global Ratings have warned last month that it might lower India’s ratings if the economic growth doesn’t recover. A shallow recovery will probably show up in the coming quarter. But if the current US-Iran tensions cause oil prices going up, which is very likely, the loss of discretionary consumer spending at home and abroad could hurt India further.

The Reserve Bank of India is of course ‘twisting’ its balance sheet by selling short-term Government bonds to banks and buying long-term securities from them only to keep a lid on the benchmark 10-year bond yield. But this support may not be enough for the Government’s five-year, $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan which will rely heavily on public funding. Proven financial gurus say the Indian central bank should purchase assets from the non-bank financial sector which will help shadow financiers deal with their large overhang of bad loans to open up the clogged funding arteries of the economy.

The GST has subsumed many of India’s indirect taxes, but it has several design flaws resulting in poor and expensive compliance for small firms.

Most shockingly, what many self-styled experts can’t see is the enormously disturbing challenge relating the environment. The Indian economy is particularly vulnerable to climate change with regard to air and water pollution and more. India is infamous today for being home to 22 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world. Chinese economic development, one generation ahead of India, is now rapidly reducing pollution with manifold techniques and approaches.

Most importantly, the menace of inequality in India keeps causing inordinate delay in turning the country a truly big economic power. The recent IMF projection of India as the fifth colossal world economy, based on bland GDP statistics, will never mean a thing. Rather, India will cease to get foreign aid that has been coming for more than half a century. The IMF does not talk of the unforgivable wealth differences between billionaires and paupers. Even the ‘regional difference' problems could become increasingly difficult to tackle. For example, India’s richest State, Goa, has similar living standards to a poor European country like Bulgaria. By contrast the poorest State, Bihar, ranks alongside Mali in sub-Saharan Africa in per capita GDP terms. Ingenious policy changes have to happen without delay. Or else, India may be looked upon as an economic superpower on record, but the people may have turned horribly uninspired and unskilled and unhappy without access to a dignified, equitable life. All this as India has not been inclusive enough. The big hype about the country’s fast-paced economic growth has not percolated down through the economy. Hopefully if only the analysis is perfect, by 2030, China will be number one, the US second, and India third by surpassing Germany and Japan.

Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee says the Indian economy is very close to a big and long recession if urgent corrective steps are not taken as private consumption, contributing nearly 60% to the GDP, has been the villain for the battered growth rate- currently growing at 4.5% against the previous year’s 8.1. Manufacturing is in a disturbingly bad shape registering a 15-year low at a 2% estimated growth, disturbingly low from 6% in the previous year. Similarly, the construction sector is lagging at 3.2% compared with 8.7 last year.

Business investment, a key driver of GDP, is estimated to grow at only the shameful 1% against 10% in the previous year, which means less job opportunities in the markets, and hence less money in people's pockets. They can't buy whatever is produced by the manufacturing sector. Most hurting, the agriculture is lower too than the previous year. The dangerous cyclic downfall continues to remain in motion even now.

The countries performing better on the Social Progress Index are managing to do so irrespective of their economic heft. With poorer economies than India, they have ranked higher. They have made it possible by ensuring broad-based public participation in economic expansion attempts by pursuing policies which promote extensive schooling, higher literacy, better healthcare, widespread land reforms and greater gender parity.

China was at the same economic level as India around 1980 when it undertook market reforms. But it made constant investments in improving its basic education and health standards. When China became an export-led economy, the products did not particularly require highly skilled labour but a highly schooled and inspired population. The production for the world markets are bound to ensure certain specifications and quality controls.

Basic education, good health and decent environment are not only valuable constituent elements of quality of life, but also they aid in driving economic successes. Economic recession is a reality in India, which has a lot to learn from China. Poorer countries are happier because of equity.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/imf-projections-meaningless--equitable-society-builds-nation.html

However these panic buttons were pressed for only 24 times by their users during an entire year and when the police contacted them, they responded that the buttons were pressed inadvertently.

The State Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Development, Rekha Arya had distributed these devices to 180 women belonging to Dehradun, Haridwar and Pauri districts. The objective of the exercise was to provide a safety cover to these women.

The small device can save up to 12 phone numbers including that of local police stations and close relatives of the women and when pressed the message is flashed on these numbers within 30 seconds.

93,27-2-20,‘State Budget focuses on inclusive growth’,"Finance Minister Niranja Pujai on Wednesday told the State Assembly that the Annual Budget 2020-21 envisages participation of citizens in the process of empowerment and governance under the 5T and Mo Sarkar initiatives.

Replying to a two-day discussion on the General Discussion of the Budget, the Minister refuted all charges of the Opposition and claimed that the Budget is meant for inclusive growth across all sectors.

“Focus has been given on health service, famers and farmers’ welfare, poverty eradication, food security, overall development and empowerment of farmers, workers, SC and ST people, women, children, youth and senior citizens,” said the Minister.

While the Government has been preparing “Women Budget” for the last eight years and “Child Budget” last year, r new budgets titled “Climate Budget” and “Nutrition Budget” were prepared this year. By presenting e-Budget, the State has saved 1,000 trees, he said.

Pujari said the Annual Budget has also priortised the irrigation sector. “It has been targeted to irrivate 1,84 lakh hectares of land during 2020-21,” he said.

Pujari said a Rs 1,000-crore project has been initiated to convert the SCB Medical College Hospital to a AIIMS plus and world-class health facility. A whopping amount of 22,631 crore has been provisioned for the education sector. To ensure supply of pipe water, Rs 8,000 crore would be spent in the coming year, the Minister informed.

“About Rs 2,000 crore has already been distributed to 40 lakh beneficiaries under the “Mamata” scheme. To make Odisha an international level tourism place, the budget provision has been doubled from Rs 194 crore to Rs 401 crore. The Government has planned to create 30 jobs for youths by 2025.

102,27-2-20,"Never saw such violence, not even in 84, 92: Survivor","The communal clashes in northeast Delhi were nothing like what septuagenarian Haseeb Ahmed, who has witnessed the 1984 and 1992 violence, had seen in his life. Ahmed, who worked as a furniture worker and has now been retired for almost 10 years, is settled at Maujpur area, one of the main pockets where rioters ran amok after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters on Sunday.

""I came to live here in 1981. It's been 39 years and there have been incidents in 1984, 1992, but nothing had happened here,"" the 70-year-old man said. ""But this is the first time that I have seen people from outside coming here, attacking homes and people, and vandalising and setting properties on fire.""

Ahmed lives at Vijay Park neighbourhood, home to both Hindus and Muslims, but tension prevailed in the area on Wednesday, with several locals recounting their horror stories of staying awake within their homes that were surrounded by mobs.

""This place has a mixed population of Hindus and Muslims, and has been exemplified as a model of unity and brotherhood,"" Ahmed told PTI.

""It's a really bad situation and I can't describe what the scene was like.... I have witnessed something like this for the first time,"" he said, hoping that normalcy is restored soon.

Ahmed, who has two sons and daughter-in-laws, said his family buy vegetables near the house from two Hindus, whom he described as brothers. ""We kept buying vegetables from them till their stocks lasts. Now, even they don't have any left to sell,"" he said.

""The situation is too risky to venture out for purchasing. There are mobs that are ready to attack anyone they find,"" the septuagenarian said, adding: ""We'll manage it someway, the Almighty will help.""

At least 24 were killed and over 200 injured in the violence that unfolded in Maujpur, Jafrabad, Babarpur, Yamuna Vihar, Shiv Vihar, Bhajanpura, Chand Bagh, Ghonda in northeast Delhi.

A brittle quiet settled over parts on Wednesday as police and paramilitary personnel in large numbers descended on the roads of the riot-hit areas, keeping mobs away. The Delhi Police said they had registered 18 FIRs and arrested 106 people for their alleged involvement in the violence.

Ahmed was satisfied with the fact that peace has prevailed among the locals in Vijay Park, but hoped the government would put a check on ""outsiders who disrupted the ambience"". ""There is peace, calm here. There is no fight within the neighbourhood. It's only outsiders who are causing trouble,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/never-saw-such-violence--not-even-in-84--92--survivor.html
103,27-2-20,"Gang rape-cum suicide of school girl: 2 held, one on run","Police have arrested two persons while the third one is on the run in connection to a gang rape and suicide of a school girl in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh.

After being gang raped couple of days ago the class VIII minor girl had attempted self-immolation by dousing self with kerosene and sustained 95% burn injuries. The girl was referred to Nagpur in Maharashtra where she breathed her last on Wednesday. The autopsy was performed on the body in Nagpur.

Three men have been charged with gang raping the minor girl after keeping her in unlawful confinement.

Two of them—Sandip Hasane and Neelesh Nagle, have been arrested by police while the third accused Ajay is still at large. Natives of village Kaldongri in Betul, all the three are daily wage labourers by profession.

The deceased girl was staying at her maternal uncle’s home for some days and soon after returning home on Tuesday, she set herself ablaze.

A suicide note found with the girl has the name of accused Sandip Hasane. In her dying statement, the girl had told the police that Sandip and two of his friends had raped her in a Betul office a month ago and also were threatening her so that she desists from filing any complaint with police.

The trio had befriended the girl while working in a catering group.

104,27-2-20,"Despite notice, Govt depts fail to pay property taxes","A number of Government departments and authorities in Dehradun have not paid property tax on their office buildings to the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD). The MCD had issued notices to about 92 such departments and bodies following which some of them have paid the property tax. However, major bodies including the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) have not yet paid the property tax to the corporation. According to officials, the delay in the submission of the tax by these institutions is posing hindrance to the MCD in meeting its target of collecting Rs 75 crore in property tax by the end of March.

Recently, the MCD also sent a notice to Dehradun Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) and Big Bazaar too regarding the property tax which is pending for more than two years. The total property tax of both properties including the penalty is about Rs 40 lakh and 50 lakh respectively. The Corporation also served a Rs 1.5 crore property tax bill to the Forest Research Institute (FRI) on Tuesday which is due for two years. Reportedly, MCD will also serve a notice to the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) soon.

Non-residential properties generate a lot more revenue than residential properties which contribute considerably to the overall collection of the property tax by the corporation. Property tax amounting to about Rs 8 crore is pending from governmental, semi governmental and aided institutions in the city. The MCD had issued notices to 92 such institutions including the Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation, Uttarakhand Transport Corporation, State Police Complaints Authority and many more, according to the sources. Property tax is one of the important revenue sources of the corporation and the amount of tax from these departments and authorities will strengthen the chances of the corporation achieving its target of collecting Rs 75 crore in property tax, an amount which is about three times more than the amount of property tax collected last year.

The mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ has extended the period of 20 per cent rebate on property tax four times this year so that residential as well as non-residential taxpayers are inclined to paying their property taxes on time. It appears that only the citizens of Dehradun are taking advantage of the rebate and paying their taxes while the Government departments are still waiting to clear their dues. So far, the MCD has collected more than Rs 40 crore and penalty will be imposed on the taxpayers who submit the tax after March.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/despite-notice--govt-depts-fail-to-pay-property-taxes.html

115,27-2-20,"SG, Govt counsel slug it out in HC","The Delhi High Court saw heated exchanges on Wednesday between a senior law officer of the Centre and standing counsel of the AAP Government on who would represent the police in two PILs related to the violence in the northeast district here over the new Citizenship law.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Talwant Singh that he has been instructed by the Lieutenant Governor to represent the police in the two matters.

However, the submission was objected to by Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra who said a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court has already decided on the powers of the Centre and the Delhi government.

Mehra said that in view of the apex court ruling, the LG's direction was of no consequence.Mehta contended that the Union of India is also a stakeholder in the matter which concerns law and order in the national capital.

""Don't create an ugly scene here. I am not addressing a rally. I am addressing the lordships here,"" he said, who was then allowed by the bench to advance arguments in the matter.

The SG also filed an application seeking to implead the Centre as a party in the petition filed by human rights activist Harsh Mander and activist Farah Naqvi, on the ground that it is an issue of law and order. The court issued notice to the petitioners on the application and listed it for hearing on Thursday.

Mander and Naqvi, in their joint plea, have sought lodging of FIRs against those who allegedly gave hate speeches and arresting those involved in the communal violence which has claimed 24 lives and injured around 200 people.

The other PIL, by one Rahul Roy, has sought safe passage to government hospitals and emergency treatment for those injured in the communal violence which erupted in northeast Delhi over the amended citizenship law. This matter is listed for hearing on February 28.

During the hearing, the SG and Mehra also differed on the aspect of lodging FIRs.

While the SG submitted that the court should wait for the response of authorities concerned on the issue of lodging FIRs against three BJP leaders -- Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra -- Mehra contended that there was no reason not to lodge the FIRs against them and it ought to be registered against everyone involved in the violence.

Mehta said he has spoken to the highest authority and any decision taken by the court now may aggravate the situation.

However, Mehra was of the view that FIR should be registered at this stage if a cognisable offence has been committed and later on if enough evidence is not found, the police can file a cancellation report.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sg--govt-counsel-slug-it-out-in-hc.html
116,27-2-20,"Azam, wife and son sent to 7-day judicial custody","In a major setback to Samajwadi Party, its MP from Rampur Azam Khan, his wife and SP legislator Tazeen Fatma, and son & former MLA Abdullah Azam were on Wednesday sent to seven-day judicial custody in connection with Abdullah’s fake birth certificate.

A Rampur court had declared the trio as ‘absconders’ and issued non-bailable warrants against them after they failed to appear before it. Over 85 cases were lodged against Azam Khan by the district administration of Rampur and other authorities ever since Samajwadi Party was voted out in March, 2017.

Khan and his family were earlier issued warrants after they ignored repeated summons by the courts in one of the cases lodged against them in July last year.

Earlier on Tuesday, a local MP-MLA court in Rampur had ordered attachment of properties of Azam Khan, Tazeen Fatma and Abdullah Azam after they failed to appear in court.

Left with no option, the trio surrendered before Rampur district court and the judge sent them to jail for seven days. The next hearing of the case will be on March 2.

Khan, his wife and son made several attempts to procure anticipatory bail which was denied by the court in three separate cases related to Abdullah’s date-of-birth certificates, PAN cards and passport.

Rampur SP Santosh Kumar Mishra said, “They have been sent to judicial custody till March 2 in connection with a case pertaining to a forged birth certificate of Azam Khan’s son Abdullah. The latter allegedly gave a wrong date of birth while filing his nomination papers for Assembly elections.”

Several cases have been filed again Azam Khan on various charges including, land-grabbing, encroachment, book theft, power theft, statue theft, buffalo & goat theft. The SP leader’s son was also booked for forgery in birth date documents last year.

Khan and his family have been charge-sheeted under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On its part, Samajwadi Party blamed the ruling BJP for cases against Khan and suggested that it was political vendetta.

“The SP doesn’t consider any action taken in revenge appropriate. Governments can’t run on bias,” the party tweeted in Hindi.

“The Samajwadi Party also trusts the judicial process. We have faith in court, we will get justice,” it added.

On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the development. “Azam Khan did politics for himself only. It was for exploitation of the poor. We welcome the court decision to send him to jail. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should give an explanation on the kind of people associated with him in politics,” BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan said.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took a dig at Khan without naming him in the Assembly on Wednesday.

“My cabinet colleague Balbir Singh Aulakh, who is from Rampur, asked me whether Rampur will get 24X7 power supply and I told him that Rampur mein bijli chamak rahi hai. Bijli ke chamak se faltu virus nahi paida hota hai (it’s lightening in Rampur, and it kills the unwanted virus).”

“We are clearing the mess left by previous Samajwadi Party regime and the dirt in any form must be cleaned quickly. The previous regime worked only for one particular village (read Sefai, native village of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav),’’ said Yogi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/azam--wife-and-son-sent-to-7-day-judicial-custody.html

You're not dead in the fire: Residents allege police apathy,"Residents of Chand Bagh in northeast Delhi shared horrific accounts of how their homes and shops were torched in the communal violence while they kept calling the police control room, where they were allegedly snubbed by officials.

Distraught and scared, Muslims gathered at Chand Bagh to talk about their innumerable calls to the Delhi Police.

The colonies of Bhajanpura and Chand Bagh, which are divided by just a main road, are now standing divided on views of each other after the violence in northeast Delhi over the past three days that has claimed over 20 lives so far.

Both groups, however, believe that the rioters came masked and in groups on vehicles.

""While I ran a chicken shop, my two brothers had fruit stalls. All our shops are completely gutted,"" Mohd Azad told PTI. ""I called the police control room several times and I was told, 'What is making you scared? You are not dead in the fire'.""

""When one person's call was rejected, more people called, but the police turned down the calls and said similar statements to them,"" Azad said.

When PTI contacted at least two senior police officials about the allegations, they did not respond.

According to the residents, Chand Bagh has 70 per cent of Muslim population, while Bhajanpura has 80 per cent of Hindu population.

The streets of Chand Bagh colony start with the dargah of Syed Chand Peer Baba, who is revered equally by Muslims and Hindus since last four decades. Interestingly, the same shrine is looked after by Hindu Chaudhary community.

""When the riots broke out, we couldn't save the shrine as that was the first spot of attack,"" said Salim Iqbal, a resident.

""However, when the mob approached further, we saved the temple in the area — hardly 50 metres from Baba's shrine — knowing that if this temple is vandalised, the clashes of northeast Delhi would have spread across the city,"" Iqbal said. ""We also sought the help of Hindus and convinced those men to stop and not attack the temple"".

Akash Singh grew up in Chand Bagh and has been staying here for the past 19 years.

""We have never had communal issues before. There are shops of Hindus here, Balaji Sweets, Jain Wholesale Market, Gupta Timber, Durga Tiles and many stores here since last 30-40 years.

""If Muslims from here went to torch homes of Hindus in Bhajanpura, then why didn't they torch these shops first?"" he asked.

123,27-2-20,Tourism sector has huge employment potential: Nitin Gadkari,"Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday spelled out his mantra to take the tourism sector in the country to newer heights. He suggested the stakeholders in the sector to adopt three basic formulas — the PPP model, immediate environment clearances and innovative ideas — that could, backed by a strong political will, go a long way in paying rich dividends.

Highlighting the work on 22 Green corridors, a dedicated Mumbai-Delhi Expressway and a direct road connectivity to Mansarovar which will help in the growth and generation of employment in the tourism sector, Gadkari said, India under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on the path of becoming a tourism giant.

Speaking at the Exotica Tourism Summit organized by The Pioneer, Gadkari said tourism has great employment potential and this is the way forward to eradicate poverty from the country. Gadkari said the country’s ‘ethno structure’ requires a great improvement if we need to augment tourism.

Known for dishing out numbers and statistics at will, the Union Minister said 22 projects comprising 7,500 km of Greenfield expressways and corridors, costing Rs 3.10 lakh crore, are planned to be completed by 2025 and all through different modes including PPP.

“We will complete the flagship Mumbai- Delhi Expressway in the next three years. This will be India’s longest expressway at 1,320 km and will reduce travel time between Delhi and Mumbai from 24 hours to 13 hours,” Gadkari said at the Summit sharing the dais with The Pioneer Editor Dr Chandan Mitra.

On his prime role as Road and Transport Minister, Gadkari said he has been continuously working to take the load off 80 per cent traffic on road by making a total of 1,80,000 network of highways as against the present norm of 40 percent traffic on only two percent of road infrastructure.

Talking about religious tourism, the Road Minister said his agenda for the current year is completing the about Rs 12,000-crore Char Dham project with weather connectivity roads to Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.

He also said efforts are on to complete a highway through Uttarakhand for making the Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra easy. “The work is about to be completed and will be commissioned anytime soon. Ppeople can visit Mansarovar through Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand,” he outlined.

“I have also taken a keen interest in developing our very own Auli (Uttarakhand) near Joshimath which can be a destination like Davos in Switzerland. I am in talks with Uttarakhand government on this project so that several world-level conferences can be brought to the small place which is more scenic than Switzerland,” said Gadkari, known to give the country’s first Tolled Expressway between Pune and Mumbai.

Gadkari also shared details of his inland waterway and ports projects which, according to him, have immense potential for the tourism sector besides the commercial aspects. He said very soon India will also become a destination for cruise tourism and pointed out that the present Varanasi to Haldia water project will be expanded till Bangladesh and further till Myanmar making it easier for freight movement right from Punjab till Myanmar which will be cost effective and above all less polluting.

On the occasion, Mitra, a former Rajya Sabha member, termed Gadkari as the most competent and popular minister in the Modi cabinet and exuded confidence that the ambitious projects lined up and talked about so passionately by the Minister will be completed within deadlines.

Gadkari, who is holding several portfolios including Shipping, received a huge round of applause from the audience as Dr Mitra praised this ambitious project.

124,27-2-20,Opposition parties sullying country’s image by stoking anti-CAA protests: Yogi,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday accused the Opposition parties of peddling lies and creating confusion across the country on the issue of CAA, proposed NPR and NRC to sully the image of the country by stoking protests.

Yogi said that anti-CAA protests were being intensified at a time when the country was progressing towards becoming a US $5-trillion economy. He was replying to the general debate on 2020-21 annual budget in the Assembly on Wednesday. The Assembly later passed the Finance Bill for the 2020-21 fiscal.

Underlining the ruling BJP ideology of ‘Nation First’, the Chief Minister issued a stern warning to anti-CAA protesters of serious consequences if they indulged in arson and violence, destroyed public property and targeted innocent civilians. Without naming any religion, Yogi said: “Qayamat (The Day of Judgment) is not coming and nobody can be permitted to hold the law to ransom. Let there be no confusion that somebody can hold the rule of law to ransom and carry out anti-national activities with impunity. We know how to deal with this kind of situation.’’

“What do Opposition parties achieve by sullying the image of the country on CAA and by targeting innocent people. We respect the wishes of the Opposition parties, but safety and security of 23 crore people of UP is also our responsibility,” Yogi said while referring to the Prime Minister’s assurance that the CAA would not take away citizenship of any Indian.

The CM added, “UP government is committed to implementing every law legislated by the Parliament of India as we are accountable to the sovereignty of the country, not to any family or individual.’’

Affirming his faith in the democratic process of dialogue with the people, Yogi said, “We have never tried to crack down on peaceful anti-CAA protesters. But the government will not allow arson, violence and destruction of public property under the garb of protests, and damages will be recovered from the culprits.”

The Chief Minister reiterated his government’s stand, saying, “The government believes in dialogue to resolve issues, and not in taking away democratic rights of people voicing dissent. However, the government cannot remain a mute spectator to 12-15 people brandishing swords and creating mayhem on the streets.’’

Maintaining that his government would not allow anyone to take law into their hands and create public disorder or disrupt law and order, Yogi warned that the state government would sternly deal with such situation.

The CM said that anti-CAA protests were taking a toll on development in the state as the administrative machinery was preoccupied in maintaining law and order instead of focusing their time and energy on development.

Yogi asked the Opposition parties to clarify their stand on the issue and explain their basis of opposing the CAA, which he claimed was legislated by Congress at the Centre in 1955, while only minor changes were effected in the recent amendment.

“The floor of the Assembly is the best forum for debate on all issues. The opposition keeps on raising CAA daily in Assembly and come to the Well of the House, but were wary of a debate,’’ he said.

Yogi said that there was a huge image makeover for UP as public perception about the state changed for the positive and this budget was not of the government but of people’s perception.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/opposition-parties-sullying--country---s-image-by-stoking--anti-caa-protests--yogi.html

SP members demonstrated inside the Well of the House raising anti-government slogans due to which the Question Hour was disrupted for about 50 minutes.

Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary raised the demand for caste-based census as the House assembled for the day. He said that members of Other Backward Community (OBC) were being denied their rights and hence the fresh census to start from April, should also include caste census.

Chaudhary said that the BJP government was denying the rights of OBCs and claiming themselves to be the champion of OBCs.

When Speaker Hriday Narain Dikshit refused to allow them to speak, SP members trooped in the Well of the House raising slogans.

State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said that neither the state government nor the Assembly had the power to order for a caste-based census. He claimed that SP members were in no mood to work and were hence trying to raise an issue, which had no relevance for the Assembly.

The Speaker also said that the Assembly had no power to order a caste-based census.

Later, as disturbance continued, Dikshit adjourned the House for 35 minutes, which was later increased by another 10 minutes.

In recent past, the SP has been raising the issue of caste-based census and demanding reservation for OBCs as per their population.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/house-adjourned--as-sp-demands--caste-based-census.html
127,27-2-20,SHO hangs self in Ambedkarnagar,"Growing cases of depression amongst men in khaki came to the fore once again when a police station incharge in Ambedkarnagar ended his life early Wednesday morning.

Senior officers rushed to the scene and after preliminary enquiry, sent the body for autospy. The police were trying to ascertain the reason behind the suicide.

As per reports, inspector Babbu Lal Mishra was posted as the station house officer (SHO) of Jaitpur police station in Ambedkarnagar.

On Wednesday, members of Special Operation Group (SOG) tried to contact Mishra over his phone to seek his assistance in trapping a hardened criminal, but the calls went unanswered.

The SOG members then reached his residence on the police station campus and found Mishra’s body hanging from the ceiling of a room. The deceased was a native of Akauli Umri Beg hamlet of Begumganj in Gonda.

SP, Ambedkarnagar, Alok Priyadarshi later said that the matter was being probed and they were trying to ascertain the reason behind the suicide.

In September last year, woman constable Anita Tewari had ended her life over a love affair in the same police station.

130,27-2-20,"No cognisable offence for FIR against Thakur, Verma: Court told","The Delhi Police told a court here on Wednesday that prima facie no cognisable offence was found for lodging FIR against Union Minister Anurag Thakur and his BJP colleague and MP Parvesh Verma for their alleged hate speech in relation to anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh.

The submissions were made in an action taken report (ATR), filed before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja, who was hearing a complaint by CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat seeking FIRs against Thakur and Verma. The court, which reserved order for March 2 on whether to direct the police to lodge FIRs, had on February 5 directed it to file an ATR.

In the ATR filed on Wednesday, the police said the legal opinion has been sought in the matter and requested the court grant more time to file the final report, the court sources said.

The report said that the word 'gaddar (traitor)', used in the rally by Thakur, ""does not point to any particular section of the society. Surmises and conjecture cannot be the basis for initiating any legal action"".

It said: ""In the referred speech, the speaker is pointing to a group of protesters and is not pointing to any particular community. ""He (Thakur) is not provoking the crowd to start any riot or taking any retaliatory action against the protesters.""

The report said the allegation that statements by Thakur and Verma had caused incitement which led to shooting in Jamia Milia Islamia was not found since the juvenile, who allegedly fired in the varsity, ""has not attributed his action either to the words of Thakur or Verma"". ""The complainant very clearly is making presumption which is legally not tenable,"" it said.

It further stated that ""the complainant has referred to incidents of violence and it has already been clarified that both are independent acts which did not have any connection to the speeches mentioned in the complaint.""

Karat has said in her complaint that ""Thakur and Verma had sought to incite people and as a result of which three incidents of firing took place at two different protest sites in Delhi.""

The complaint has sought lodging of FIRs under various sections, including 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.

It also sought action under other sections of the IPC, including 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation).

If convicted, the accused may get a maximum jail term for seven years. Karat approached the court after her written complaints to the Commissioner of Police and the SHO, Parliament Street, failed to elicit any response, she told the court.

She had written to the Commissioner on January 29 and subsequently on 31, while the letter to the SHO Parliament Street was sent on February 2, she said.

At the Rithala rally here, the Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs had on January 27 egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan — ""shoot the traitors"" — after lashing out at anti-CAA protesters.

132,27-2-20,India may cross border to take on terror: Rajnath,"India will not hesitate to cross the border in dealing terrorism, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Balakot air strikes. The IAF jets on this day bombed Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camp in Pakistan in retaliation against the killing of 40 Central Reserve Police Force(CRPF) men in a suicide attack in Pulwama on February 14.

In his tweet message to mark the anniversary, the defence minister said India's approach in dealing with terrorism has undergone a major change as its armed forces now do not hesitate to cross the border to protect the country against the menace.

""I thank the Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi for bringing change in India's approach against terrorism & our ways to counter terror. The Surgical Strikes of 2016 and Balakote Air Strikes of 2019 are testimony to this change. This is certainly a New and Confident India in making,"" Singh said in a series of tweets.

He also said ""India today celebrates the first anniversary of Balakote airstrikes.

It was a successful counter terror operation launched by the fearless @IAF_MCC air warriors,"" Singh tweeted.

He said the Modi government has adopted a new approach to combat terror reflecting a strong resolve to even carry out cross border strikes to protect India from the scourge of terrorism.

For his part, Air chief Marshal RKS Bhadoria flew a MIG 21 sortie of squadron 51 at Srinagar base. This squadron had taken part in the dog fight with Pak F 16s on Feb 27, a day after the Balakot strikes.

On September 29, 2016, the Army carried out surgical strikes on a number of terror launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir in retaliation to an attack on its base in Uri that month.

A fleet of Mirage jets on February 26 early morning last year carried out aerial strikes against the JeM terrorist camp in Balakot. The next day Pakistan Air Force retaliated by crossing the Line of Control(LOC) in Rajouri and Poonch to target military installations.

However, the IAF jets thwarted the attempt and in the ensuing aerial battle one F-16 was downed by a Mig-21 flown by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. During the aerial combat, his plane was hit by ground fire from Pakistan and he had to eject. The Pakistan Army captured him after his parachute landed across the LOC.

The IAF pilot returned to India three days later following diplomatic outreach by major powers and India's stern warning to Islamabad led to his release after two days, averting further escalation of the conflict.

It was the first time since the 1971 India-Pakistan war that the IAF jets crossed the LOC thereby signaling a doctrinal change in India's counter-terror approach as the strike was carried out deep inside Pakistan.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-may-cross-border-to-take-on-terror--rajnath.html

Irani said the bill proposes that only Indian couples, with both partners being of Indian origins, can opt for surrogacy in the country. She asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has led from the

front with a liberal view on the issues of reproductive rights of women, be it medical termination of pregnancy, the Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation Bill or the surrogacy bill.

139,27-2-20,Aim to double our domestic tourist footfall by 2025: Prahlad,"The Government aims to double the domestic tourist footfall in the next five years, Prahlad Patel, Minister of State (independent charge) for Culture and Tourism, said on Thursday but not before pointing out that all the stakeholders including the Centre and State Governments, hotels, media, tour operators and locals are equally responsible for the growth of tourism in the country.

“We all as stakeholders are responsible for the growth of the tourism sector and responsibility cannot be laid on one individual. All the sectors should come together for its growth,” he said speaking at the Exotica Tourism Summit organized by The Pioneer here on Thursday.

India’s domestic tourist footfall in 2018 was 1.85 billion.

Patel was of the view that tourism was never discussed minutely. Had it been, we would have witnessed tremendous progress in the North-east region where connectivity was never taken seriously. It was only during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s regime that some efforts were made but they were never taken up in a sustained manner after that, he said.

“More than monetary benefits, it is the correct and positive perception towards the tourism that matters. With our holistic approach, we aim to double our domestic tourist footfalls within the next five years,” he maintained.

Acknowledging that there was a lot yet to be done to put India on the global map, he said the stakeholders can take advantage of the tourism vacuum that has been created due to China getting affected by the deadly coronavirus. We can become an alternate to China as a tourist destination, he said.

Patel, who was the chief guest at the event, also spoke about relaxing norms in e-visa such as extending the facility from one year to five years, cutting down on e-visa fee and reducing GST for hotel rooms.

This apart, he said his ministry is also working extensively with the Ministry of External Affairs to shorten the e-visa format and drastically reduce the visa fees further which has been a concern for many foreign tourists.

The Pioneer Editor Dr Chandan Mitra, who made the welcome remarks, said India has an immense tourism potential and the inaugural Summit dedicated to the sector is a step towards harnessing it. He said the problems faced by foreign tourists should be removed.

Mitra later moderated a panel discussion with Ashwani Lohani, ex-CMD, Air India, Pronab Sarkar, Indian Association of Tour Operators ( IATO) President, Ritu Beri, Fashion Designer and Anil Chadha, COO ITC Hotels.

Lohani, who has headed various senior posts in the tourism departments like ITDC at the Centre and Madhya Pradesh, pitched for domestic tourism saying that there was a need to catalyse people within the State and inter-States as well. He suggested putting up signages all over in a large scale, improving connectivity through roads and trains besides slashing the travel cost as measures to boost tourism.

Sarkar felt that tourism in the country can flourish only with the joint cooperation of States and the Centre. “But unfortunately, we don’t even contribute 1 per cent share in the global tourism while small neighbouring countries are doing much better. We want to reach the magical figure of 20 million international tourists’ arrivals by 2020. For this, there is an urgent need to improve infrastructure, cut down GST rates further as tourism is not luxury but an economic activity that can create lots of jobs around a monument and a tourist spot,” he said.

For her part, Beri recalled how she showcased India’s culture through her work abroad. “We should be proud of our rich culture and we as Indians should first accept that we are above the rest of the world.”

Chadha outlined how the visiting US President Donald Trump and his family loved the Indian cuisine that ITC Maurya served to them during their stay there to stress the fact that India has many strengths up its sleeves that could strengthen its tourism sector in multifarious ways.

INSET

As a measure to woo foreigners and for their convenience, the monuments or tourists hotspots witnessing more than one lakh footfall, will have signage in the mother tongue of that country. For instance, in Sanchi Stupa, which is visited by more than a lakh Chinese have signboards in their mother tongue. “Also, we plan to make it possible for tourists to scan a QR code at a location to listen to information about that place in their own language, said Tourism Minister Prahlad Patel.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aim-to-double-our-domestic-tourist-footfall-by-2025--prahlad.html
140,27-2-20,"Soon, travel between Delhi to Shimla on single ticket: Goyal","Passengers may be able to travel between Delhi and Shimla on a single ticket in the days to come.

Welcoming a suggestion in this regard by a participant at the Exotica Tourism Summit organized by The Pioneer, a receptive Railways Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday said his Ministry will definitely work on the idea and will implement it soon.

Talking about efforts of Railways to promote tourism, the Minister said “We are running Ramayan Express which will connect sites associated with Lord Ram. Similarly, there is a train called Saamanta Express which will cover prominent places associated with Gautam Buddha and chief architect of the Constitution Dr BR Ambedkar.”

The idea is also to take the railways to Char Dham, he stressed during a Q&A session with The Pioneer Editor Dr Chandan Mitra.

The minister said that as a nation we all must act together to bring the excitement back for promoting India. In fact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself suggested each of us to plan a visit to 15 places within the country in next three years, he said.

“India has a huge potential and I am sure this initiative will go a long way in promoting tourism,” he added.

The Minister also talked about energy potential of India, saying that the country is the fastest renewable energy growing and efforts are being made to make it a power surplus country.

After Prime Minister Modi took office, he has been particularly focused on the North-east to the extent that every minister was trying to visit the region twice or thrice in a year and every month three to four cabinet minister would actually go to north east, he said.

“That is the level of engagement the Government had with the North-east. I am happy to share the investment which has significantly ramped up on the railways and road front. We believe connecting all the faith of North-east with the mainland,” he added.

Goyal further said that train services are very critical and essential for the development of North-east. “Only four out of eight states are currently left out of services due to local pressure and problem. There are lots of trains running in Tripura but Arunachal Pradesh is not connected,” he said.

“I am delighted that all the eight states of the north east are aligned to the vision of the Prime Minister for faster infrastructure development and in next two and half years, all these four states will be connected to the railway map of India. We will be able to take the railway to every parts of the region right to extreme end to Bangladesh,” he said.

“We are also looking to working with Bangladesh to connect some parts so that a long circuit is cut off and actually travel through Bangladesh to other parts of the region,” the minister said.

While responding to a question by Dr Mitra on privatisation of railways, Goyal asserted that India Railways is the property of the people of India and shall always remain.

The minister also received a great round of applause when he shared to the gathering that there has not been even a single passenger death on Indian railway network from April 1, last year till date.

141,27-2-20,"Sonia, NCP seek Shah's resignation for Delhi violence","The Opposition on Wednesday slammed the Centre over Delhi violence with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP demanding the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah and CPI(M) saying that the Delhi is a “chilling reminder” of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Opposition also sought time from President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the violence that has engulfed parts of northeast Delhi. CPI(M) general secretary Yechury has written a letter to the President seeking appointment for the group of leaders.

Calling for Amit Shah's resignation, Sonia held the Centre, the Home Minister and the Delhi Government responsible for the communal violence in the city. Senior Congress leaders including general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra participated in a party peace march from the AICC headquarters against the violence in Delhi and would submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday.

Sonia spoke to the media after chairing a Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, and alleged there was a ""well-planned"" conspiracy behind the violence, that has also led to injuries to more than 200 people over the past three days.

NCP MP Supriya Sule also demanded Amit Shah's resignation for the ""huge security lapse"" in connection with the violence in Delhi and also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to conduct a ""transparent"" probe into the alleged security lapse.

""The Centre should be held responsible for what has happened in Delhi. Union Home Minister Amit Shah must resignowning moral responsibility,"" Sule told reporters outside the Vidhan Bhavan (Legislature Complex) in Mumbai. ""It is a huge security lapse during US President Donald Trump''s visit. The home minister is responsible for it,"" she added.

""There should be an impartial probe into it...It is my humble request that the PM carries out a transparent inquiry into the security lapse,"" the NCP leader said.

Talking to reporters separately, former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said, ""TheGodhra model has been replicated in Delhi.""He was referring to the 2002 post-Godhra communal riots in Gujarat, in which over 1,000 people, mostly from the minority community, were killed.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday said the violence in Delhi is a ""chilling reminder"" of the 2002 Gujarat riots. He said there was no way to restore peace and normalcy in Delhi other than by calling in the Army.

""It's clear that the violence in Delhi has the sanction of police and that of the powers that govern them. Adequate compensation should be provided to the kin of the dead and those injured by the Centre and the state government,"" he said.

""I, along with the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, D Raja, President of the Loktanthrik Janata Dal, Sharad Yadav, President of the Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav and prominent leaders of political parties like the DMK, NCP and others wish to seek an appointment with you at the earliest, preferably the 28th of February, 2020,"" Yechury said in his the letter to President Kovind.

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution, demanding answers from both the governments, while also urging the people of Delhi to ""reject the politics of hate and do their best in healing the rifts caused by these shameful events"".

""After reviewing the situation, the CWC is of the firm opinion that what has happened in Delhi is a colossal failure of duty for which the entire responsibility must be borne by the Central Government and particularly the Home Minister and (the CWC) calls upon the Home Minister to tender his resignation immediately,"" said Gandhi, reading out the CWC resolution.

She went on to attack the AAP dispensation, saying Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his government are ""equally responsible for not activating the administration"" to reach out to the people to maintain peace and harmony. ""It is the collective failure of the two governments that has resulted in a great tragedy in the capital city which threatens to become worse by the day,"" she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sonia--ncp-seek-shah-s-resignation-for-delhi-violence.html
142,27-2-20,Ishrat case acquittal: Vanzara gets post-retirement promotion,"Former IPS officer DG Vanzara, who was accused in the alleged fake encounters of Ishrat Jahan and Sohrabuddin Sheikh and was later discharged in both the cases, has been given post-retirement promotion as the Inspector General of Police (IGP) by the Gujarat Government, six years after he retired from service.

As per the notification issued by the State Home Department, a copy of which Vanzara tweeted on Tuesday night, he has been promoted as the IGP with effect from September 29, 2007.

Additional secretary to the State Home Department, Nikhil Bhatt, on Wednesday confirmed that his department has issued a notification about Vanzara’s promotion.

Vanzara, a 1987-batch IPS officer, had retired as the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) on May 31, 2014.

He was suspended by the State Government in May 2007 after his arrest in connection with the alleged fake encounter case of Sohrabuddin Sheikh.

Later, he was also made an accused in the Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case.

The former IPS officer was subsequently discharged in both the cases by special CBI courts, first in August 2017 in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, and then in May last year in the Ishrat Jahan case.

“Consequent to clean chit received from Judiciary in all Encounter Cases vch (which) were concocted by Anti- National Forces agnst (against) me & Gujarat Police, I am given Post-Retirement Promotion of Inspector General of Police wef 29-09-2007. I am thankful to both Govt of India & Govt of Gujarat,” Vanzara tweeted along with the copy of the Government notification.

Vanzara was heading the Gujarat ATS when the alleged fake encounters took place.

After his arrest in March 2007 by the state CID, Vanzara remained in jail for around seven years. The Sohrabuddin case was transferred to Mumbai in September 2012. He was serving as Deputy Inspector General of Police of Border Range at the time of his arrest.

Vanzara, who had joined the police service as a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) in 1980, was promoted as an IPS officer in 1987.

He served as Deputy Commissioner of Police of Ahmedabad Crime Branch and was later promoted as DIG. He also worked as DIG of Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) in Ahmedabad. Sheikh was killed in an alleged fake encounter near Gandhinagar in November 2005, after which his wife disappeared. According to the CBI, she, too, was killed.

The central agency had claimed that Tulsiram Prajapati, Sheikh's aide and an eyewitness to the alleged encounter, was later killed by the police at Chapri village in Gujarat's Banaskantha district in December 2006.

Ishrat, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra near Mumbai, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar were killed by Gujarat police in an alleged fake encounter on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004.

143,27-2-20,"BJP rakes up ’84 pogrom, says Cong has Sikh blood on its hand","Responding to Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s demand for the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the Delhi violence, the BJP on Wednesday raked up anti-sikh riots of 1984 saying the party whose hands are soiled with the blood of innocent Sikhs is talking about controlling violence and indulging in ""dirty politics"".

Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that Shah was continuously working with the police to control the situation in the national capital and demanding his resignation was ""laughable"".

""The Home Minister is continuously working with the police, helping their morale and directing them. Such comments and politics from the Congress will not help the morale of the police. We appeal to them to not do politics on the issue,"" Javadekar told a press conference.

He further said Shah had called a meeting of all political parties including the Congress over the communal violence in Delhi -- which has, so far, left at least 22 dead -- and asserted it is the responsibility of all parties to help maintain peace.

Javadekar said all parties should cooperate and work for peace at a time when violence is abating, notwithstanding the ongoing investigation.

Earlier, at a press conference here Congress President had held Union Home Minister for failing to check violence and demanded that he should step down.

""Playing a blame-game at this time is wrong. Politicising such violence is a wrong way always used by the Congress,"" Javadekar said, while asserting that culprits will be identified and no one responsible will be spared.

""At such a time, attacking the government and politicising violence is a dirty politics,"" he said, adding that it also demoralizes police.

He also raked up the 1984 anti-Sikh riots when the Congress was in power to hit back at the opposition party.

""Those whose hands are tainted with the bloods of innocent sikhs in 1984 are now talking about checking the violence...They themselves had supported the violence,"" Javadekar alleged.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-rakes-up----84-pogrom--says-cong-has-sikh-blood-on-its-hand.html

Senior BJP leader and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said his party presidents were also not invited for similar banquets to honour US president George Bush and Barrack Obama when they had visited India when the Congress-led UPA was in power.

The BJP had not boycotted the events then, he said, noting that Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari were the party president in 2006 and 2010 respectively during the visits of US presidents.

145,27-2-20,"Azam Khan, wife, son sent to judicial custody","Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan, his legislator-wife Tazeen Fatma and MLA-son Abdullah Azam surrendered before a Rampur court on Wednesday and were sent to judicial custody over Abdullah’s allegedly fake birth certificate. Rampur Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Mishra told PTI that the three Khan family members have been remanded in custody till March 2.

The case relates to two birth certificates for Abdullah Azam, who allegedly also gave a wrong date of birth while filing his nomination papers for the Assembly elections in 2017.

Abdullah's election was set aside by the Allahabad High Court last December. He then approached the Supreme Court, which is still hearing the case.

Rampur's Additional District Judge Dhirendra Kumar on Monday rejected an anticipatory bail plea filed by the family and issued non-bailable warrants and a notice for attaching their property.

On Wednesday, the three family members surrendered before the court, which sent them to judicial custody.

In a tweet, the SP accused the ruling BJP of vendetta against the powerful politician.

A Rampur BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged an FIR at Gang police station on January 3, 2019 alleging fraud related to Abdullah Azam's two birth certificates. In April, police filed the charge sheet in court.

It alleged that Azam Khan's son also had two passports and two PAN cards.

In one birth certificate, issued by the Rampur municipality, Abdullah's birth date was mentioned as January 1, 1993. The other certificate said he was born in Lucknow on September 30, 1990, according to the charge against him.

A case was also registered against Azam Khan and his wife as they had submitted an affidavit testifying their son's second birth certificate.

Azam Khan represents Rampur in the Lok Sabha and his wife is an MLA from the Rampur assembly seat. Their son Abdullah won from the Suar assembly segment in 2017.

The Allahabad High Court set aside Abdullah's election last December on a plea by defeated BSP candidate Kazim Ali Khan that the SP candidate was under 25 when he filed his nomination papers in 2017. Abdullah Azam allegedly used fake documents to claim that he had reached the age to contest the polls.

In recent years, Azam Khan has also faced charges of encroachment of land around Rampur's Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, where he is the chancellor.

The SP indirectly blamed the ruling BJP for the case against the politician, suggesting that it was vendetta.

“The Samajwadi Party doesn't consider any action taken in revenge appropriate. Governments can't run on bias,” the party tweeted in Hindi.

""The Samajwadi Party also trusts the judicial process. We have faith in court, we will get justice, it added.

The Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the development.

""Azam Khan did politics for himself only. It is for the exploitation of the poor. We welcome the decision of the court to send him to the jail,” BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan said.

He said SP chief Akhilesh Yadav should give an explanation on the kind of people associated with him in politics.

The Supreme Court had on January 17 refused to stay the Allahabad High Court verdict annulling Abdullah's election to the UP Assembly.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had sought the response of the Election Commission and the defeated BSP candidate on the matter.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/azam-khan--wife--son-sent-to-judicial-custody.html
146,27-2-20,CBI to register FIR against PC family’s hotel grabbing,"There’s more trouble coming in former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s way. The CBI on Wednesday informed the Delhi High Court that it will register an FIR in the hotel grabbing case involving Chidambaram’s family members and bank officials. The CBI had in November 2017 registered a preliminary enquiry on a complaint by an industrialist Dr Kathirvel accusing Chidambaram’s wife Nalini and her sister Padmini for grabbing his hotel in Tirupur in Tamil Nadu by conniving with Indian Overseas Bank officials.

The CBI informed the High Court they will file the detailed probe report by next hearing scheduled on April 21. Arguing before Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar, advocate Yatinder Chaudhary pointed out that for the past three years, CBI’s delaying the case.

The CBI's counsel told the court that the agency has finished the probe and decided to register FIR on the hotel grabbing case and will file detailed probe findings by the next hearing.

According to Kathirvel's complaint, in 2008, his hotel Comfort Inn was grabbed by Padmini by conniving with IOB officials.

He said that his business were illegally declared by the Bank as NPA and conducted auction and granted the hotel to Padmini. Those days Chidambaram was Finance Minister. Kathirvel produced before the CBI and HC the letters from Chidambaram to him on the issue and Nalini's conversation records with him to settle the case. He also produced a cheque given by Nalini to the agencies and court.

Soon after the CBI registered the probe, Padmini passed away and CBI had questioned many senior bank officials involved in the illegal auction of Kathirvel's hotel facilitating auction, leading to ownership of the hotel to Padmini.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cbi-to-register-fir-against-pc-family---s-hotel-grabbing-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/cbi-to-register-fir-against-pc-family---s-hotel-grabbing.html
147,27-2-20,‘Masterstroke' of Nitish Kumar leaves Opp in disarray,"The unanimous resolution passed by the Bihar Assembly against the new format of NPR and NRC with more than 50 BJP MLAs in tow has thrown the Opposition Grand Alliance in disarray.

Jitan Ram Manjhi, a bete noire of Kumar, appeared bowled over by Kumar’s move as the former told reporters outside the Assembly on Wednesday, “He (Kumar) is most welcome to return to the Grand Alliance.. There will be no confusion over leadership if he comes back. He will be the obvious choice.”

The Bihar Assembly had on Tuesday passed a unanimous resolution categorically stating that there is no need of NRC in the State and that the National Population Register (NPR) exercise be done strictly according to the 2010 format.

The all-party resolution got the approval of the legislative Assembly in the post-lunch session following a debate on the adjournment motion moved by Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and others in the House.

Bihar is the first NDA-ruled State to categorically say no to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and stating that the National Population Register (NPR) exercise be done as per the 2010 format.

The sudden development also seems to have bewildered the BJP, which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, with some of its leaders asserting that the resolution will take the wind out of the sails of the opposition, which had been sharpening its attack against the government on the emotive issue.

Another section within the saffron party has been left wondering as to whether such a move was tantamount to a change in the party's stand.

Congress MLA Awadhesh Singh echoed the sentiments of Manjhi, saying, ""We know that Nitish Kumar is a secular leader who has his roots in the socialist movement. We would be happy if he leaves the NDA and comes back.""

The RJD, headed by its jailed founder Lalu Prasad Yadav, was, however, not impressed by showering of praises on Kumar.

Lalu's wife and RJD national vice president Rabri Devi, who is also the leader of the opposition in the legislative council said, ""We are not going to have any change of mind (about Nitish Kumar).""

Notably, a couple of hours before the resolution was passed, her son Tejashwi Yadav, who is the leader of the opposition in the state assembly, had a 20-minutes long meeting with the chief minister inside Kumar's chamber in the Vidhan Sabha premises.

The young RJD leader has been celebrating the resolution as a ""success"" of the opposition in Bihar in making the BJP retreat despite its central leadership's insistence on ""not yielding an inch"" on the NCR-NPR issue.

Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, who is also an AICC panelist, also took a sceptical view of Tuesday's development and said, ""Nitish Kumar should explain how come he can go on supporting the CAA while being opposed to NPR and NRC. All the three issues are connected.""

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was supported by the JD(U) in parliament. The chief minister has, however, remained steadfast in his opposition to a countrywide NRC.

Regarding the NPR, the JD(U) leader had agreed that additional clauses like places of birth of parents were causing anxieties among the people and got his MPs to request the Centre for dropping these besides writing on the issue himself, much before the resolution was passed. The alliance partner BJP, which has felt hamstrung under the shadow of the chief minister, has emerged a confused lot.

Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi wrote on Twitter that the resolution should ""silence the opposition trying to reap political benefits out of rumour-mongering on NRC and NPR"".

BJP MLC Sachchidanand Rai, one of the known detractors of Kumar, was visibly peeved when he told a news channel, ""I wonder if the party's central leadership was seized of the matter.""

State minister Vijay Kumar Sinha, who was in the House when the resolution was passed said, ""It would have been better had the members been informed about the resolution in advance.""

With the deft move, the chief minister also appears to have won back the respect of election strategist Prashant Kishor, a staunch opponent of CAA-NPR-NRC, who was recently sacked from the party and had accused Kumar of capitulation before the BJP for continuance in power in Bihar.

In a tweet, Kishor thanked Kumar for standing his ground on NPR and NRC, and expressed hope that he would rise to the many challenges that he might face as the chief minister of Bihar.

The JD(U) camp appeared in a state of quiet jubilation with its rank and file speaking in hushed tones that with assembly polls not more than nine months away, their leader, often called the ""Chanakya of Bihar politics"", will have the last laugh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---masterstroke--of-nitish-kumar-leaves-opp-in-disarray.html

Distraught and scared, Muslims gathered at Chand Bagh to talk about their innumerable calls to the Delhi Police.

The colonies of Bhajanpura and Chand Bagh, which are divided by just a main road, are now standing divided on views of each other after the violence in northeast Delhi over the past three days that has claimed over 20 lives so far.

Both groups, however, believe that the rioters came masked and in groups on vehicles.

""While I ran a chicken shop, my two brothers had fruit stalls. All our shops are completely gutted,"" Mohd Azad told PTI. ""I called the police control room several times and I was told, 'What is making you scared? You are not dead in the fire'.""

""When one person's call was rejected, more people called, but the police turned down the calls and said similar statements to them,"" Azad said.

When PTI contacted at least two senior police officials about the allegations, they did not respond.

According to the residents, Chand Bagh has 70 per cent of Muslim population, while Bhajanpura has 80 per cent of Hindu population.

The streets of Chand Bagh colony start with the dargah of Syed Chand Peer Baba, who is revered equally by Muslims and Hindus since last four decades. Interestingly, the same shrine is looked after by Hindu Chaudhary community.

""When the riots broke out, we couldn't save the shrine as that was the first spot of attack,"" said Salim Iqbal, a resident.

""However, when the mob approached further, we saved the temple in the area — hardly 50 metres from Baba's shrine — knowing that if this temple is vandalised, the clashes of northeast Delhi would have spread across the city,"" Iqbal said. ""We also sought the help of Hindus and convinced those men to stop and not attack the temple"".

Akash Singh grew up in Chand Bagh and has been staying here for the past 19 years.

""We have never had communal issues before. There are shops of Hindus here, Balaji Sweets, Jain Wholesale Market, Gupta Timber, Durga Tiles and many stores here since last 30-40 years.

Police said Meenu was shot by rivals from a close-range, leaving him seriously injured. The victim received three gunshot wounds — on his face, shoulder and his back.

According to the police, Meenu was the prime accused in the murder of another transgender which took place in November last year near the Kherki Daula toll plaza.

152,27-2-20,"No cognisable offence for FIR against Thakur, Verma: Court told","The Delhi Police told a court here on Wednesday that prima facie no cognisable offence was found for lodging FIR against Union Minister Anurag Thakur and his BJP colleague and MP Parvesh Verma for their alleged hate speech in relation to anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh.

The submissions were made in an action taken report (ATR), filed before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja, who was hearing a complaint by CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat seeking FIRs against Thakur and Verma. The court, which reserved order for March 2 on whether to direct the police to lodge FIRs, had on February 5 directed it to file an ATR.

In the ATR filed on Wednesday, the police said the legal opinion has been sought in the matter and requested the court grant more time to file the final report, the court sources said.

The report said that the word 'gaddar (traitor)', used in the rally by Thakur, ""does not point to any particular section of the society. Surmises and conjecture cannot be the basis for initiating any legal action"".

It said: ""In the referred speech, the speaker is pointing to a group of protesters and is not pointing to any particular community. ""He (Thakur) is not provoking the crowd to start any riot or taking any retaliatory action against the protesters.""

The report said the allegation that statements by Thakur and Verma had caused incitement which led to shooting in Jamia Milia Islamia was not found since the juvenile, who allegedly fired in the varsity, ""has not attributed his action either to the words of Thakur or Verma"". ""The complainant very clearly is making presumption which is legally not tenable,"" it said.

It further stated that ""the complainant has referred to incidents of violence and it has already been clarified that both are independent acts which did not have any connection to the speeches mentioned in the complaint.""

Karat has said in her complaint that ""Thakur and Verma had sought to incite people and as a result of which three incidents of firing took place at two different protest sites in Delhi.""

The complaint has sought lodging of FIRs under various sections, including 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.

It also sought action under other sections of the IPC, including 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation).

If convicted, the accused may get a maximum jail term for seven years. Karat approached the court after her written complaints to the Commissioner of Police and the SHO, Parliament Street, failed to elicit any response, she told the court.

In the meantime, India has also issued a fresh travel advisory to avoid non-essential travel to Korea, Iran and Italy due to incidences of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in those countries.

Sources said that an Indian Air Force special flight carrying around 15 tons of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment has departed for Wuhan. This assistance has been provided in the wake of the Corona virus outbreak in China and the request by the neighbouring country to provide medical supplies.

The Flight will bring back over 80 Indians and around 40 citizens from neighbouring countries on February 27, the sources said. Meanwhile, the ITBP officials said that quarantine facility is ready to receive the Indians and foreigners who are being evacuated from Wuhan.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to Chinese President Xi Jinping expressing the solidarity of India and also offered assistance to the affected country. The medical supplies will help augment China's efforts to control the outbreak of this infection which has been declared as a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organisation.

A few days back, India had flown back two batches of evacuees from China, comprising 640 Indians and seven Maldivian nationals. Most of them were students studying medicine there.

161,27-2-20,J&K shall forever remain India’s: Delhi to Pak,"Jammu&Kashmir ""was, is and shall forever"" remain an integral part of India, a top Indian diplomat asserted at the UN Human Rights Council's meeting here on Wednesday, a day after Pakistan sought the international community's intervention on the Kashmir issue.

Speaking at the 43rd session of the UN Human Rights Council which is being held here in Switzerland from February 24 to March 20, Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West), the Ministry of External Affairs, described Pakistan as the ""epicentre of global terrorism"".

He called for decisive action against those who direct, control, fund and shelter terrorists, in an obvious reference to Pakistan, which is accused by its neighbours of providing safe havens to terror groups.

""It is more than a little ironical that a nation that has become the world's leading exporter of terror and violence seeks to lecture others about human rights...

""Jammu&Kashmir was, is and shall forever remain an integral part of India,"" Swarup asserted a day after Pakistan's Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari alleged that India continues to violate the human rights of the

Kashmiri people and demanded the immediate repeal of all actions by India on August 5 last year.

India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5 and bifurcated it into two Union territories.

Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its ""internal matter"". New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.

Swarup said the transformative changes ""wrought by our Parliament last August were meant to strengthen the integration of the State... It was intended to ensure the extension of all progressive legislations passed for the entire country to cover this region, and to resume the pace of socio-economic development in the Union Territory of Jammu&Kashmir.""

Despite Pakistan's best efforts — over decades — to destabilise Jammu and Kashmir through externally-instigated terror and a campaign of canards and untruth, the situation on the ground is quite normal, he said.

""Most temporary restrictions — imposed solely to ensure safety of the people from Pakistani trained terrorist attacks — have already been removed, political processes have resumed, telecom facilities have been largely restored, developmental activities are being undertaken at a rapid pace and there is access for all to education and healthcare,"" Swarup added.

He said schools, colleges and universities have resumed and regular examinations are being held. Hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are well-stocked and staffing is at full capacity.

""These have been achieved despite Pakistan's frenetic attempts to promote both violence within our territory — with an 81 per cent increase in infiltration attempts since

last August — and disinformation outside. Yesterday's speech was a good example of the latter,"" Swarup said, referring to Pakistani minister's speech.

Addressing the delegation from Pakistan, Swarup said India is a nation where democracy, including the right to protest, is vibrantly and noisily celebrated every day and where dignity of every human is protected by a robust Constitutional framework.

""It is Pakistan that would do well to look to its own house and introspect about the condition of its people, especially its minorities,"" he added.

He said India is making every effort for full and effective enjoyment of all human rights by all its people.

On Pakistan's warnings about the situation within India, Swarup invoked poet Robert Burns to say that ""someone should give them the power to see themselves as others see them.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/j-k-shall-forever-remain-india---s--delhi-to-pak.html
162,27-2-20,Govt puts in place stringent disclosure norms for auditor reports of cos,"Auditors will have to provide detailed disclosures about loan defaults, amount of cash losses and immovable properties as well as other aspects about companies in their annual reports starting this financial year, with the government putting in place a stringent framework.

Amid instances of corporate misdoings wherein the role of auditors has also come under the regulatory scanner, the corporate affairs ministry has come out with the revised framework that seeks to bring in “greater transparency and faith in the financial affairs of the companies”.

The corporate affairs ministry has notified the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 (CARO, 2020). It would be applicable for audit of financial statements of eligible companies for the financial years commencing on or after April 1, 2019.

“CARO 2020 would necessitate enhanced due diligence and disclosures on the part of auditors of eligible companies, and has been designed to bring in greater transparency in the financial state of affairs of such companies,” the ministry said in a release on Wednesday.

A specific format has been prescribed for auditors to report the period and the amount of default by the company in repayment of loans or other borrowings or in the payment of interest thereon to any lender.

In a significant move, the ministry said auditors would have to provide details about a company’s investments and whether any guarantee or security has been extended to other entities during a financial year. This is to ensure that such actions are not “prejudicial to the interests of the company”.

“The amount of cash losses incurred in the financial year and in the immediately preceding financial year have to be reported,” the release said. As per the latest CARO, an auditor has to render opinion based on various aspects that “no material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report that company is capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date”. The ministry noted that the latest CARO is expected to significantly improve the overall quality of reporting by auditors on the financial statements of the companies.

This would lead to greater transparency and faith in the financial affairs of the companies. This is automatically expected to result in greater inflow of investment by and in Indian companies, it added. Further, an auditor has to consider whistle-blower complaints received during a year by the company in the audit as well as report whether the company has conducted any non-banking financial or housing finance activities without a valid certificate of registration from the Reserve Bank of India.

Any objections or concerns raised by outgoing auditors should also be taken to consideration by present auditors before forming an opinion. Among other requirements, an auditor has to report whether a company is a declared wilful defaulter and whether term loans were diverted for any purpose other than for which the amount was raised. There is also a format for reporting details of such immovable properties whose title deeds are not held in the name of the company but are disclosed in the financial statements, the release said. Details of proceedings against a company for holding benami property and whether the same have been disclosed in the financial statements also need to be disclosed in the CARO.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-puts-in-place-stringent-disclosure--norms-for-auditor-reports-of-cos.html

It has also identified 16,735 user IDs - through which tickets were booked illegally - for blacklisting besides blocking 27,948 tickets worth Rs 7.96 crore for upcoming journeys, said Arun Kumar, director-general of the RPF.

ANMS and MAC, the illegal softwares which the racketeers used for booking e-tickets fraudulently by getting around One Time Password (OTP) and CAPTCHA systems, were completely ""neutralized"" by RPF sleuths, he said.

""Tickets valued around Rs 30 crore, which were already used by passengers, were also seized,"" he said.

The racket existed since 2012 but became more active in the last two or three years, Kumar said.

As many as 79 persons have been arrested in connection with the rackets which were suspected to have links to terror financing, he added.

The arrests were made in various parts of the country and the accused included owners of the illegal software.

No agents have been arrested yet, he said.

RPF sleuths deactivated ANMS software on January 23 and MAC on February 8, he said. Similar softwares had been deactivated in the past, he said.

The illegal ANMS software had captured nearly 80 per cent of the ticket booking market, Kumar said.

The ""master"" or the owner having a password and ID for the software would sell ""layers"" of the software to agents for a specific time slot for booking tickets, the RPF DG said.

Some other illegal softwares are available in the market but they do not work, Kumar claimed.

""We are aware that some softwares are still there in the market. We are working on them and trying to neutralize them as well,"" said Kumar.

The president was accompanied by a high-powered delegation comprising senior Trump administration officials including NSA O'Brien during his maiden official visit to India from February 24 to 25. They visited Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi before leaving for Washington on Tuesday.

O'Brien, on his way back to the US, thanked the people of India for their support to President Trump, his wife and the American delegation.

""Thanks to all the people of India that came out to support President Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, and the US delegation, affirming their friendship and partnership far into the future,"" O'Brien said in a tweet.

""You have friends in the USA and in the White House,"" the NSA said.

Separately, the White House in a tweet thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for their incredible hospitality.

The White House tweet said President Trump and Prime Minister Modi talked at length about the India–Pakistan relationship.In a stern message to Pakistan, India and the US on Tuesday asked

Islamabad to ensure that no territory under its control is used to launch terror attacks and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms.

A joint statement said the two leaders called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.

The two leaders also called for concerted action against all terrorist groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network, D-Company, Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.

At a press conference, the US president also said that ways to deal with terrorism figured prominently in his talks with Prime Minister Modi who, Trump stressed, is determined to check the menace.

174,27-2-20,Sensex below 40K level as virus fears grow,"Indian equities remained in free fall for a fourth session in a row on Wednesday following a sustained global sell-off as the number of new coronavirus cases surged in new regions, putting the world economy at a bigger risk.

The BSE gauge Sensex settled the day with a loss of 392.24 points, or 0.97 per cent, at 39,888.96 — the lowest closing in over three weeks. Starting off on a weaker note, the index plunged over 521 points during the day.

Over the past four sessions, the Sensex has lost 1,281.16 points or 3.11 per cent. The broader NSE Nifty plummeted 119.40 points or 1.01 per cent to end at 11,678.50 — its worst level since February 3.

The NSE index has shed 402.35 points or 3.33 per cent in the last four days. On the Sensex chart, Sun Pharma was the top loser, followed by Maruti, L&T, Hero Motocorp, Infosys, ONGC and RIL. On the other hand, SBI, HUL, HCL Tech, Asian Paints, and Ultratech Cement ended with gains. Sectorally, BSE realty, auto and capital goods were among the top losers, dropping as much as 2.16 per cent.

Barring telecom, all sectoral indices closed in the red. In the broader market, BSE midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 1.34 per cent.

“Increasing concern regarding coronavirus in the world over is impacting global market. The economic impact is expected to be worse than thought earlier forcing investors to stay away from risky assets,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said. Further, analysts said, the domestic market is bracing for yet another subdued GDP growth, with a forecast of 4.6 to 4.7 per cent in Q3 compared to 4.5 per cent in Q2, which is adding to the fear. With a spread of the novel coronavirus in countries like France, Iran, South Korea and Italy, market participants are growing increasingly fearful about the impact on the global economy.

175,27-2-20,"‘Car sales to stabilise in 2020 on back of stimulus measures, discounts’","Car sales in India are expected to be relatively flat this year after plunging 11.8 per cent in 2019 amid slowing economic growth, as per Moody’s Investors Service. The rating agency also lowered its global sales forecast as the coronavirus outbreak reduces demand and disrupts automotive supply chains.

“We expect Indian auto sales to rise 0.5 per cent in 2020, supported by stimulus measures, discounts on new cars that do not comply with Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms, which will take effect in April,” the ratings agency said in a statement.

But weak consumer demand and tight liquidity will likely limit any improvement in car sales this year, it added. “In 2021, we expect Indian car sales to rise 2 per cent,” Moody’s Investors Service said.

Commenting on global auto sales, it said, “We expect global auto unit sales to decline 2.5 per cent in 2020, narrowing from a 4.6 per cent drop in 2019, but worsening from the 0.9 per cent decline that we had previously projected for this year.” The ratings agency expects sales to rebound only modestly in 2021 with growth of 1.5 per cent. “Our outlook on the sector remains negative,” Moody’s Investors Service said.

It further noted, “We would consider returning to a stable outlook if we were to expect global light vehicle sales growth to recover to at least 1 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months. A stable outlook would also require improving pricing and at least stable capacity utilisation.” Moody’s also predicted auto sales decline in China. “In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, we expect auto sales in China, which includes both passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, to fall 2.9 per cent this year, a meaningfully weaker performance than the 1 per cent growth we had previously projected,” Moody’s said. Elaborating on the market, it said that cautious consumers are steering clear of crowded areas, including auto dealerships, while corporate demand for vehicles is weakening as broader economic uncertainties cause companies to scale back capital spending.

“Work stoppages and lower production levels because of government-mandated business days off, the reduced flow of migrant workers across China and disruptions in auto-parts supply chains have lowered production levels,” it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---car-sales-to-stabilise-in-2020-on-back-of-stimulus-measures--discounts---.html
176,27-2-20,India's slowdown bottomed out: Niti Aayog’s Panagariya,"India's slowdown has bottomed out and now its economy needs to be opened up if the country wants to realise the ambition of a 10 per cent growth rate, former NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya has said.

In his keynote address at a discussion on India's Union Budget 2020, he said in the next fiscal year, India's GDP growth is expected to be 6 per cent and then it will get back to 7-8 per cent which has been the case in the last 15-16 year period.

""On the slowdown, my own assessment is that we have bottomed out,"" Panagariya, a Professor of Economics at the Columbia University, said at the discussion organised by India's Consulate General here in partnership with the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Tuesday.

""In the second half of the current fiscal year, which would be ending on March 31, we should see some bit of recovery, not a big one but certainly the second half (of the fiscal year) should look better than the first half,"" he said.

Panagariya noted that since about 2003, India has been growing at an average rate of about 7 per cent and the first five years of the Modi government was characterised by 7.5 per cent growth on an average.

Emphasising that the Indian economy ""can do a lot better no doubt"", he said that in his assessment, the main factor which led to the slowdown has to do with the financial markets and that translated into weakening of the balance sheets of both the banks as well as the corporates.

""I think you could criticise the government here for being a little slow in beginning the process of cleaning up of the bank Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). The problem was known actually by 2013…"" but this particular problem of NPAs never gets solved very quickly,"" he said. Sounding an optimistic note, he said as the clean up happens, ""we should see the growth returning"".

On the Budget, Panagariya welcomed positive steps taken by the government including on fiscal consolidation, fiscal deficit, corporate tax reduction, initiation of simplification for the personal income taxation as well as privatisation.

Pointing to a ""negative"" in the Budget, Panagariya said that one of the things that has been going on for the last 2-3 years is that India is turning more and more towards import substitution.

""Trade economists use a more aggressive term - protectionism. And I've been saying that this is something that should not only be stopped but has to be reversed.

""Unfortunately, this budget goes very far in the direction of raising duties and particularly disconcerting is the fact that a lot of the items on which the duties have been raised and that too quite a bit are all labour intensive products,"" he said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-s-slowdown-bottomed-out--niti-aayog---s-panagariya.html

At a contentious Democratic debate on Tuesday night in South Carolina, Sanders labeled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “reactionary racist” and said he’d consider reversing President Donald Trump’s historic move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem and return it to Tel Aviv.

In a daring foray into American domestic politics, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said there was a not a Jew in the world who “hasn’t dreamed of Jerusalem” and Sanders words were so severe that he had no choice but to retort.

“We don’t intervene in the internal American electoral process, which is splendid,” Katz told Israel’s Army Radio, before noting that Sanders had a long history of attacking Israel and the things most sacred to its identity and national security.

“Naturally, people who support Israel will not support someone who goes against these things,” he added. Sanders’ comments at the debate came after he recently announced he would skip an appearance before the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, which he called a “platform for bigotry.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/israeli-foreign-min-slams-sanders----horrifying-comment---.html

Sri Lanka co-sponsored the United Nations Human Rights Council’s 2015 resolution along with 11 other countries, including the US and Britain, calling for an investigation into alleged human rights violations during the island nation’s civil war, which ended in 2009 with the killing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran by the Lankan army.

The resolution 30/1 on promotion on reconciliation in Sri Lanka was co-sponsored by the Lankan government headed by then President Maithripala Sirisena.

Dinesh Gunawardena, Sri Lanka’s foreign minister, in his address to the 43rd session of the UNHRC in Geneva announced the withdrawal while accusing the previous government in erring with co-sponsoring the resolution.

181,27-2-20,"Malaysia’s Mahathir, Anwar in new showdown amid turmoil","Malaysia was plunged into a bitter power struggle on Wednesday as Mahathir Mohamad sought to form a unity government following his shock resignation, but old foe Anwar Ibrahim also pushed to become premier.

The developments deepened a crisis that began when the ruling coalition -- which included both men when it stormed to a historic poll victory in 2018 -- fell apart after a failed bid to establish a new government without Anwar.

Anwar was Mahathir’s designated successor, but he would likely have been pushed out and blocked from becoming leader if the weekend bid had succeeded.

Their notoriously stormy relationship has shaped Malaysian politics ever since Mahathir — during a first stint in office in the 1990s — sacked Anwar as his deputy, and he was jailed on dubious sodomy and corruption charges.

They reconciled ahead of the 2018 polls to oust a corruption-plagued coalition led by Najib Razak, but many were sceptical Mahathir — at 94, the world’s oldest leader — would stick to a vow to hand power to Anwar.

Mahathir quit on Monday as premier but it remains unclear whether he had a hand in the plot to topple the government, although analysts suspect he at least gave it his blessing. He has been named interim leader and initially appeared to have strong support to remain as premier.

But backing fell away early Wednesday and rumours swirled Anwar had garnered enough support from MPs for the top job, fuelling expectations that Mahathir might finally cede power.

The elderly leader, however, announced in a televised address to the nation that he wished to establish a unity government, and was willing to return as premier.

“Party politics must be put aside for now,” said Mahathir. “If allowed, I will try to form an inclusive government, not siding with any political parties.” “If I still have the support I will return. If not I will accept whoever is chosen,” he added.

Moments later at a press conference at his party headquarters, Anwar said he had received backing from three parties in the “Pact of Hope” coalition — the grouping in power until Mahathir quit — to become premier.

Anwar, 72, said the coalition had invited Mahathir to a meeting on Tuesday evening aimed at reviving the coalition, but after he failed to show they decided to put him forward as their candidate. “Since the attempt to topple the government last week we have remained steadfast in defending the mandate of the Malaysian people,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/malaysia---s-mahathir--anwar-in-new-showdown-amid-turmoil.html
182,27-2-20,Cases emerging faster outside China: WHO,"There are now more new cases of the coronavirus reported each day outside China than inside the hardest-hit country, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday.

“Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told diplomats in Geneva, according to a written version of his speech.

The UN health agency put the number of new cases in China at 411 on Tuesday and those registered outside the country stood at 427.

Governments worldwide are scrambling to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus after a surge of infections in Italy, Iran and South Korea.

Tedros said the “sudden increase of cases” in those countries was “deeply concerning”, adding that a WHO team would travel to Iran this weekend to evaluate the situation.

While new case numbers and deaths are dwindling at the disease epicentre in China, the country remains by far the hardest hit.

Tedros said that as of Wednesday morning, 78,190 cases of COVID-19 had been registered in China, including 2,718 deaths.

That compares with 2,790 cases and 44 deaths reported across 37 other countries.

But WHO has said the epidemic in China peaked and on February 2 and has been declining since.

Bruce Aylward, who headed a WHO-backed expert mission to China, hailed the drastic quarantine and containment measures taken by Beijing, saying the country had “changed the course” of the outbreak.

184,27-2-20,Monitoring virus impact on economy: Sitharaman,"The government is keeping a close watch on the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the Indian economy and various options are being gauged at various levels, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharman said on Wednesday.

The minister also said that the process of merger of public sector banks was underway as per the schedule. The government has announced to merge 10 state-run banks to create four big lenders.

The government is ""closely monitoring"" the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy, she said.

""We are very closely monitoring it. Secretary-level officials are engaging with their respective industries. I had informed you about various options we have including airlifting raw material for some specific sectors, resourcing from other countries.

""All these are being worked at the concerned department level. We will have quick review of all departments coming back with specific help that they may require. We will collate all these and come back to you,"" Sitharaman said.

Over 2,700 people have died due to novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) while the number of those infected is around 80,000. In the wake of the virus outbreak, whose epicentre is China, many airlines, including Indian carriers, have cancelled some of their overseas flights.

On bank mergers, Sitharaman said there is ""no uncertainty about bank merger"" and the process is on as per the schedule.

Last year in August, the government announced merging 10 public sector banks into four. United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce are to be merged with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB) from April 1 this year.

It was also decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, and Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

186,27-2-20,NCLAT sets asides insolvency proceedings against Flipkart,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has set aside the order of the NCLT to initiate insolvency proceedings against e-commerce major Flipkart.

A three-member bench of the NCLAT released Flipkart from the corporate insolvency resolution process and directed the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) appointed by NCLT to handover the records and assets of the company back to its promoter immediately.

Earlier, on October 24, 2019, the Bengaluru Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had admitted the insolvency plea filed by Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies, an operational creditor of Flipkart.

""We set aside the impugned order dated October 24, 2019 passed by the adjudicating authority (NCLT) and the application filed under Section 9 by the operational creditor Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies Pvt Ltd, company petition is rejected,"" said NCLAT.

It further said: ""The Flipkart India Pvt Ltd (corporate debtor) is released from the corporate insolvency resolution process.""

NCLAT order came over a petition filed by Neeraj Jain, Director of Flipkart India Private Ltd.

""Interim resolution professional will handover the records and assets of the corporate debtor to the promoter immediately, who will manage the corporate debtor,"" it added on its order passed on February 24.

Flipkart's operational creditor Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies, which used to supply the e-commerce major imported LED TVs, had filed a petition before NCLT contending that Flipkart defaulted for an amount of Rs 26.95 crore.

However, it was rejected by NCLAT saying that the demand notice delivered under Section 8(1) of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was ""not proper and was also incomplete"".

""The operational creditor failed to submit any documents to prove in existence of the operational debt and the amount in default,"" the appellate tribunal said observing that Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies also failed to submit the copy of invoices and copies of all the documents referred in the application.

Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies had contended that Flipkart contacted it in selling its product of LED TVs and entered into a supply agreement on December 29, 2016.

As per the agreement, it would receive the purchase order, after which it will import and procure the required quantities of LED TVs and deliver the same to Flipkart at its desired location.

According to the operational creditor, Flipkart received delivery of the first few batches but after that it avoided taking delivery of the LED TVs on the ground of lack of warehouse space.

It further submitted that later, Flipkart started delaying the collection of the LED TVs, and in some instances did not collect them at all.

In an attempt to gain more profit out of the goods ordered, Flipkart was putting pressure on Cloudwalker Streaming Technologies to offer the already imported and warehoused LED TVs, at a discounted price.

Later, the operational creditor demanded payment of the LED TVs procured and imported from October 11, 2017 to December 1, 2017, based on the import and the purchase order issued by Flipkart, which failed to collect more than 70 per cent of the stock as ordered by them till March 2018.

It issued a demand notice on June 8, 2019.

This was rejected by Flipkart, saying that there was no admitted debt or liability and an amount of Rs 85.57 crore was paid.

Challenging the order of NCLT, Flipkart contended that the order was passed without appreciating the fact that Cloudwalker Streaming has not produced any documentary evidence as purchase orders, acceptance letters, invoices and proof of any intimation of sale to the end customers or any post-delivery services with specific reference to the amounts.

Among the options likely to be deliberated tomorrow is allowing staggered payments for statutory dues for telecom industry.

Choksi, promoter and managing director of Gitanjali Gems, is the maternal uncle of Nirav Modi, who is also facing charges for defrauding state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) of over Rs 14,000 crore.

Both Choksi and Modi fled India after the PNB scam came to light in early 2018. While Choksi is said to be in Antigua, Modi is lodged in a British jail and has challenged India’s extradition request.

In its order, Sebi said it is imposing a fine totalling Rs 5 crore on Choksi, Gitanjali Gems and Dhanesh Sheth, the executive director of Gitanjali.

“... The default is grave and the gravity of this matter cannot be ignored,” Sebi said.

It quoted a communication from PNB that it had reported to the RBI total fraud of over Rs 11,394 crore in case of unauthorized issuance of LOUs, foreign letters of credit and inland letter of guarantees in the group accounts of Nirav Modi Group and Gitanjali Group and in the account of one Chandri Paper & Allied Products Pvt Ltd.

189,27-2-20,Bangladesh again postpones Rohingya refugee island relocation,"Bangladesh has yet again shelved a controversial plan to relocate some 100,000 Rohingya refugees to a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, a minister said Wednesday.

Authorities have long sought to relocate some of the country’s million-plus Rohingya population to Bhashan Char, despite warnings the silty strip of land was prone to violent and potentially deadly monsoon storms.

The move would take some pressure off the overcrowded border camps home to huge numbers of the persecuted and stateless Muslim minority, most of whom fled neighbouring Myanmar in 2017 after a brutal military crackdown.

But rights groups say that some refugees had been coerced into agreeing to relocation and the plan has been staunchly opposed by the Rohingya community at large.

Junior disaster management minister Enamur Rahman said Bangladesh would increase its focus on diplomatic talks aimed at returning the refugees home.

“The relocation plan has been postponed,” he told AFP, adding that there had been “much progress” in repatriation discussions with Myanmar with China acting as intermediary.

Bangladesh and Myanmar have already signed a repatriation deal to send back some Rohingya to their homeland — but safety fears mean very few have agreed to return.

AFP Islamabad: Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been declared an “absconder” by the government for violating the bail requirements by not presenting his medical report from his doctors in London, according to a media report on Wednesday.

Sharif, 70, left for London in November last for treatment after the Lahore High Court allowed him to go abroad on medical grounds for four weeks.

According to Sharif’s physician, the three-time prime minister is suffering from complex multi-vessel coronary artery disease and substantial ischemic and threatened myocardium for which he is due to undergo surgery.

The government on Tuesday decided not to extend the bail of Sharif and declared him an “absconder” for violating the bail requirements by not presenting his medical report before a board formed on the order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Dawn Newspaper reported.

The decisions were taken at a meeting of the federal Cabinet presided by Prime Minister Imran Khan.

“After Nawaz Sharif failed to submit his medical report of any hospital in London, the medical board rejected a medical certificate sent by him and (the government) declared him an absconder,” Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Firdous Ashiq Awan said at a post-Cabinet meeting press conference.

“From today Nawaz Sharif is an absconder according to the law of land and if he does not return to the country he will be declared a proclaimed offender,” Awan said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/sharif-declared----absconder----by-pak-for-violating-bail-terms--report.html

192,27-2-20,A NEW PARV,"Punjab Chief Minister CAPTAIN AMARINDER SINGH is personally looking into tourism not only as a growth driver but as an extension of Punjabi culture. His new policy is aimed at doubling tourist visits and establishing the State as a world class destination over the next five years and showcasing the grandeur of heritage. He talks about how his government is trying to usher in a change so that the State becomes a much sought-after destination

What initiatives have you taken to enhance the huge tourism potential of the State?

Punjab has many attractions which we are striving to promote through different initiatives. The Punjab State Tourism Policy, 2018, aims to strengthen the State’s potential and encompasses the fast-growing and organised sub-categories like rural, medical, historical, cultural and religious tourism. We are inviting the Punjabi diaspora to generate more international interest in the State.

Our focus is on conservation of important heritage buildings and infrastructure development for providing last-mile connectivity to tourist places. Development of eco-tourism in Harike, Ropar and Keshopur will go a long way in nurturing our ecological resources and promoting them as attractions.

The Patiala Heritage festival and the Sufi festival have emerged as big tourist draws. The unique Military Literature Festival, celebrated for the last three years, is an impressive platform for people from various walks of life to interact with historians, authors, poets, journalists and defence experts. I see these initiatives getting concretised further.

How are you ensuring last mile connectivity to each destination?

My government is strengthening and further improving the State’s road, rail and air connectivity to facilitate travel not just for our own people but also tourists. This was scaled up manifold ahead of the historic 550th Prakash Purb celebration of Sri Guru Nanak Devji when lakhs of people from around the world visited the State. Road connectivity from Dera Baba Nanak to Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan was developed as a part of these celebrations. At Sultanpur Lodhi, the road network has been upgraded/developed. Punjab got the Best Infrastructure Development Award by ICTCA in July 2017. In fact, the road and rail network is reaching the furthest end of the state. In addition, we also have a good air connectivity, with two international airports at Chandigarh and Amritsar, besides four domestic airports at Ludhiana, Adampur, Pathankot and Bathinda.

How are investments being facilitated in the hospitality and tourism sector?

We have declared tourism and hospitality as the “thrust sector” to facilitate investment. In fact, my government has provided liberal fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors in this sector, as part of the Industrial & Business Development Policy, 2017.

What are some of the amendments to the Punjab State Tourism Policy 2018 to make it more accessible for the differently-abled?

We have already approved amendment in the Punjab State Tourism Policy 2018 and Cultural Policy 2017 to make our sites accessible to the differently-abled, where a new section with special provisions has been included. Steps to implement these are being taken in right earnest and I have asked the Department to expedite the process. We need to bring places at par with international standards if we are to harness their full potential.

How do you plan to make people aware of Punjab’s rich history and encourage them to visit related sites while ensuring that they are maintained well?

We are well aware of the need to promote and market our tourism projects and are paying special attention to them. An agency has been hired for advertising, branding and marketing Punjab as a preferred tourist destination. We have a strategy in place to promote lesser known places of tourist interest. Reuse of most public sector heritage buildings being conserved has been defined along with their O&M. We’ve also constituted the Amritsar Cultural & Tourism Development Authority for maintenance and upkeep of important heritage buildings in Amritsar. As a result of these efforts, the Golden Temple, Amritsar, has been adjudged as the cleanest religious place. It received the Safaigiri Award in October 2017. The Golden Temple was also conferred an award for being the most visited place in the world at the Sixth International Tourism Conclave and Travel Awarded at Dehradun in October 2019.

What measures are being undertaken to preserve and bring lesser known folk forms to national and international fora?

The range of cultural art forms in Punjab is really wide and impressive. We are cognisant of the need to preserve them for our future generations and also to promote them on the domestic and global platforms. Punjab Sangeet Natak Akademi, an autonomous body under the aegis of the Cultural Affairs Department, is looking after all performing arts and folk forms like Dhadi, Kawishri and folk dance. The Ishmit Music Academy in Ludhiana is also promoting music, culture, art and folk forms through training programmes, for which we have sufficient trainers and teams in place. In order to promote the cultural art forms, heritage festivals have been revived and held at Patiala, Kapurthala and Amritsar. Punjab has been conferred with the “Best Cultural Destination in India” award for 2019 by a travel magazine.

nDo you think initiatives like the Kartarpur Corridor would pave the way for a better relationship between India and Pakistan?

I have always maintained that we need to exercise caution in our relations with Pakistan and counter any attempt at infiltration and disruption of peace from across the border. At the same time, people to people contact between the two nations is vital to improve relations. The Kartarpur Corridor is, in my opinion, a step in the right direction, though the possibility of it being used by Pakistan to promote its nefarious anti-India designs cannot be ruled out. It is a Catch-22 situation, but with adequate security measures, it will strengthen friendly relations between the two neighbours. For us, in the Sikh community, it has come as a much-awaited initiative that has helped us realise our aspiration and dream for khulle darshan didar of the historic Sri Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara.

What were the special activities to celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Dev?

The 550th Birth Anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji was a blessed and historic occasion for all of us in Punjab and we took every possible step to ensure that it was celebrated in a manner befitting the occasion. No expense was spared and arrangements were initiated a year prior to the actual event. Actually, the celebrations started a year prior to the main event.

The main celebrations were held in a specially erected pandal, having a capacity of 20,000 people, from November 5 to 12 (Prakash Purab) at Sultanpur Lodhi. Sehaj Path was also held in this pandal during the time. The Prakash Purab Utsav was celebrated at Dera Baba Nanak from November 8 to 11, 2019.

Keeping lakhs of pilgrims coming to these historic towns in mind, three tented cities were set up at Sultanpur Lodhi and one at Dera Baba Nanak for providing tented accommodation to 38,500 pilgrims. A free service of intra-city mini buses and e-rickshaws was provided for the convenience of pilgrims.

In addition to the main events, light and sound shows were held all across the State to spread Guru Nanak Devji’s universal message of brotherhood and compassion. A special Vidhan Sabha session dedicated to Sri Guru Nanak Devji was held on November 6. The inter-faith conclave held at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, in the presence of H E Dalai Lama, was another highlight of the celebrations. In addition, 550 Nanak Naam Leva (person who believes and follows teachings of in Guru Nanak irrespective of religion), prominent personalities from across the world, who have excelled in their respective fields were honoured to mark the occasion.

My government also launched gold and silver plated commemorative coins, besides a coffee table book Seone Ka Birkh and a Lonely Planet book, The Blessed Trail, on the life and times of Sri Guru Nanak Devji. Books were published by Punjabi University and Guru Nanak Dev University on the life, time and teachings of Sri Guru Nanak Dev’.

What infrastructure projects were initiated by the State Government?

Considering the importance of this occasion and the universal global following of Sri Guru Nanak Devji, three major infrastructural projects were launched with the help of the Central Government. These were the establishment of the National Institute of Inter-Faith Studies at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, a heritage museum called Pind Babe Nanak Da at Sultanpur Lodhi, in addition to inclusion of Sultanpur Lodhi in the smart city project and will be developed as a heritage city.

My Government undertook various projects for the overall benefit of the people. These included inauguration of Bebe Nanaki University College for Girls at Sultanpur Lodhi, Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Invention, Innovation, Incubation & Training Centre (CIIIT) at the main campus of Punjab Technical University at Kapurthala and Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji Auditorium at Punjab Technical University, Kapurthala.

Besides this, construction was undertaken of four high-level bridges, two foot over bridges, one rest house, 16 roads including VVIP routes, construction of eight temporary parkings, two temporary roads, two pontoon bridges and repair/widening of two roads, fagade improvement, signages and more. We also built a major bridge on the creek of river Beas, undertook lining, cleaning, fencing and strengthening a stretch of left and right banks of Kali Bein by providing boulder stone pitching, ensured overall development of 70 villages/MC graced by Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, set up a biodiversity park and planted 550 saplings in each village of the State.

What are the State Government’s plans to celebrate the 400th Parkash Purab of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur in the year 2021?

The State Government will celebrate the 400th birth anniversary of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadurji in 2021. A State level function will be organised and year-long activities would be kick-started on 399th Prakash Purab, which will be celebrated on April 12. The main function will be on April 18, 2021. We have requested the Prime Minister to constitute a national-level committee for observing this historic occasion. Besides, a permanent light and sound show, dedicated to Sri Guru Tegh Bahadurji and Sikh history, will be installed at Anandpur Sahib in the Virasat-e- Khalsa complex. The memorial of Bhai Jaitaji at Sri Anandpur Sahib will be completed on priority.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-new-parv-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-new-parv.html
193,27-2-20,Building a new Dantewada,"Dantewada district of Bastar division in Chhattisgarh has been a part of the national news one more time. Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was surprised to see the zeal for cricket in a polio-affected child, Maddaram, from one of the most backward regions of India. He shared the video of him and captioned it as: “Begin 2020 with this inspiring video.”

Once plagued by Naxal violence, today, Dantewada is touching new heights as there have been a drastic drop in Naxal incidents, decline in the number of malnutrition kids, women are defying the old age superstitions by joining the unconventional enterprise like production of sanitary napkins and the farmers have themselves become a brand in terms of organic products.

Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel said, “If we don’t provide plough in the hands, they will hold the gun. This is the only way to eliminate Naxalism. He emphasised on the need of eliminating problems like malnutrition and malaria because they are more dangerous than Naxalism.”

The district has been selected for the pilot project for the campaign to eradicate poverty from backward areas of Chhattisgarh. The campaign, Poonah Dantewada Madhakal, which means, “we will build a new Dantewada.”

The poverty percentage in the district is 70, which is way higher than the national average of 22 per cent. The Chhattisgarh government has kept a goal of liberating this district from the category of the most backward districts of the country and raise it as a developed one in the coming time. The new action plan prioritises the allocation of right prices and adequate income for the forest produce. This year, 22 minor forest produce will be purchased at minimum support price by the government. Due to this system of procurement, now a reasonable rate of forest produce will be obtained for `30 crore.

The processing hub is being established at Balod Gram Panchayat with a budget of `100 crore, which is estimated to provide income to 5,000 families. The annual income of `25,000 is estimated to be received by these activities.

Within the district, 9,534 people have the forest rights patented. It is being ensured that the fields of these people are being developed for the production of spices, kosa, drumsticks, coffee and vegetables. With this, each family is expected to generate an annual income of `30,000.

Arrangements are being made for the compilation of the ‘Biodiversity Register’, in which young men and women, who have passed 10th from 143 gram panchayats will be provided with a training of three months at district level and a sum of `6,500 per month. Almost 387 farmers generate an income of `40,000 per annum via vegetable and fruit cultivation. Women self help groups are producing dry mango powder and pickles. Fifty families are receiving an annual income of `30,000 with two dairy. Four more units of dairy are under process.

According to the district’s 2002 statistics, they are approximately 20,857 women employed in self help groups. Approximately, 262 self-help groups provide warm food for malnourished women and children as a part of the Suposhan Abhiyan. Eight women self-help groups generate an income of `11,93,000 by production of sanitary napkins.

This is just the beginning. Like Maddaram, Dantewada is also working with passion and zeal to rise up and build its future ahead.

194,27-2-20,KIIT organises Khelo India University Games,"KIIT university is hosting the first Khelo India University Games (KIUG) 2020. It is another milestone for the university to host the most prestigious university-level sports meet under the Government of India’s flagship Khelo India Programme. KIUG, an annual sporting event under the aegis of Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Association of Indian Universities (AIU), aims to revive the sports culture in India.

Since it was going to be hosted in Odisha, a ‘go-ahead’ from the state government was needed. Talks were held and the dates were finalised. The Odisha government under the aegis of the Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was set to host the first-ever Khelo India University Games.

We were no strangers to sports. KIIT and KISS have accorded high importance to sports since their inception besides top notch academics. The two institutions have together produced more than 5,000 sports talents. The students of KISS have participated in Olympics, South Asian Federation Games, Asian Games and many more. In fact, KISS has played an important role in popularising Rugby in India.

Dutee Chand, Olympic athlete, who has won gold in the World University Games 2019 and two silvers in Asian Games 2019, is a student of KIIT. Juana Murmu, who is fondly referred to as the Hurdles Queen and Purnima Hembram, who has won Bronze in Heptathlon at 2015 and 2017 Asian Championships are students of KISS. The most recent achievement being Sumitra Nayak’s penalty scored in the dying minutes of the game to clinch the bronze medal for India, in a team consisting of five players from KISS, at the Asia Women’s Div-1 Rugby 15-s championship. In fact, numerous policymakers have predicted the presence of KISS students in the forthcoming 2024 Olympics.

KIIT has also been hosting top-level sporting tournaments for many years. However, playing hosts to India’s sporting event at the youth level was always going to be a challenge. It was a different ball game altogether. “We had to ensure every minute detail was taken care of. Arguably, the most challenging bit was to accommodate around 5,000 people in twin capacity, air-conditioned rooms in the middle of the academic year when we already had 30,000 students residing on-campus. Our priority had to be expediting the construction of several hostel blocks and sporting arenas that were in-progress and scheduled to be completed by the end of the calendar year. The pace had to be doubled and a collective effort was required. The entire staff of KIIT and KISS got involved with the utmost dedication. I was involved in the monitoring of entire turn of events,” said professor Achyuta Samanta, founder of KIIT & KISS.

“We paid attention to every detail. Officials from Khelo India had been monitoring the progress and inspecting all the locations. It is fair to say that they seemed content with all the arrangements, so much so that all 17 events of KIUG can be conducted at the KIIT campus itself,” added he.

“Only a few days were left for the start of the competition and players started to arrive. The madness had officially begun. A gripping sense of anticipation surrounded the entire university. The first flick of the racket against the backdrop of the beautiful KIIT campus — I was overjoyed with a sense of satisfaction. It was finally time for kick-off. And I was reminded of my childhood. Memories of my childhood makes me happy and sad at the same time,” Samanta said.

Growing up, he barely got two meals a day let alone having the privilege to go out and play. Neither had Samanta played sports or had situations conducive to even think about playing. Circumstances were difficult and he has worked hard to fight his way out of poverty. By god’s grace, today, he feels lucky enough to be contributing towards the development of so many young sports stars and the sporting infrastructure. His happiness knows no bounds now.

He said that there were a few nerves initially. He always felt confident and knew they would be able to pull it off. Samanta said, “After all, we had to live up to the tag of the ‘Sports Capital of India’, one that Bhubaneswar has earned having hosted numerous international competitions, one after the other. Here, I would like to thank the Government of India and Odisha for encouraging and supporting us to conduct such an event. And we want to go beyond. We are determined to become the sports capital of the world. And tournaments such as this will go a long way in helping us achieve that dream.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kiit-organises-khelo-india-university-games-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/kiit-organises-khelo-india-university-games.html
195,27-2-20,Faf out of SA ODI squad,"Former captain Faf du Plessis will not play for South Africa in a three-match one-day international series against Australia but remains part of the country’s future plans, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Wednesday.

Du Plessis, who stepped down from the captaincy in all forms of the game earlier this month, is being rested along with recent regular players in Rassie van der Dussen and Dwaine Pretorius.

The first match in the series will be in Paarl on Saturday, following the conclusion of a T20 series.

Test left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj has been rewarded for good form in a domestic one-day tournament with his first one-day international call-up since 2018.

Coach Mark Boucher said the squad was picked with an eye to the future with the next World Cup still three years away.

“We always saw the series against England and Australia as an opportunity to play some fresh talent,” said Boucher. “If we feel that we need to rest players, we will, as we have done in the recent past. Faf (du Plessis) has been fantastic for us in white-ball cricket and remains very much in our ODI plans and we will manage his workload for the near future diligently.”

The squad includes batsman Janneman Malan and wicketkeeper-batsman Kyle Verreynne, who were both included in the squad for a recent series against England but did not play. Malan has previously been capped at T20 level while Verreynne is uncapped.

Richardson in Aus team

Sydney: Pace bowler Jhye Richardson was added to the Australia ODI squad for three clashes in South Africa.

Selectors also named an unchanged line-up for the one-day series against New Zealand at home next month. Richardson dislocated his shoulder ahead of last year’s World Cup in England but was recalled for T20 series against South Africa and will remain with the team for the one-dayers.

“He has slotted back into the T20 squad in South Africa and is pushing for a place in that side,” national selector Trevor Hohns said of Richardson.

“Keeping him in South Africa with the one-day squad gives us another exceptional fast bowler who is ready to go.”

We have got to keep Test cricket alive and moving forward and positive and people coming to the game. And to me, the way to that is Day-Night Test cricket. I am big fan of it . I’m not a big fan of four-day Test cricket. I’m very much a traditionalist — five days — that’s Test cricket to me,” elaborated McGrath.

“But if we can bring something new that keeps people coming to the game, then that’s brilliant. Day Night cricket it that, it brings different challenges. When you bowl, you bat it can make a big difference. Different tactics, so it just brings a different awareness and different things you have to do,” he elaborated.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/d-n-tests-is-way-forward.html
197,27-2-20,Indian bowling is still world class: McGrath,"Australian pace legend Glenn McGrath on Wednesday said India’s bowling attack remains a “world class” one despite the recent debacles against New Zealand and blamed the under-whelming performance on factors such as injury layoffs and toss.

While Ishant Sharma returned with a five-wicket haul, his pace colleagues Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami managed just one wicket each as New Zealand posted a match-deciding first innings score of 348 despite being 216 for six at one stage in first Test.

“I still have total faith in the Indian (bowling) lineup. They had a few injuries of late. Sharma is coming back and he did get five wickets. Bumrah had a couple of injuries and he is coming back,” McGrath told reporters.

“So, yeah, I think the Indian bowling attack is world class and there is no doubt about that,” he added.

“I don’t have any issues with the bowling attack, you don’t lose form overnight. It was just one of those things where the toss made a huge difference. (in the first test in New Zealand), but you still got to get and score runs.”

198,27-2-20,Jamieson wants to establish as all-rounder,"A specialist batsman during his formative years before shifting to fast bowling, New Zealand’s imposing pacer Kyle Jamieson wants to transform into an all-rounder going forward.

The 25-year-old, who made a dream debut against India in the first Test, played as a batsman in his younger days, and it wasn’t until he met the then New Zealand U-19 coach Dayle Hadlee that he was asked to seriously consider focusing on fast bowling as a primary skill.

“I was pretty much a batter all through high school and then made the New Zealand U-19s, and Dayle Hadlee got a hold of me and told me to run in, which kind of shifted me towards becoming more of a bowler,” Jamieson told ICC.

“I always liked batting, it was probably what I grew up admiring the most — whilst I did bowl, I did not think of that as my career option growing up. Now I’m a bowler who can bat, trying to get to the all-rounder stage, that’s where I ideally want to be,” the 6-ft-8-inch tall fast bowler said.

Jamieson impressed with his bounce and ability to extract movement in the first innings of the Wellington Test, where he picked up four wickets. He also scored 44 off just 45 balls in New Zealand’s reply.

‘tough to counter’

Indian batsmen will get a liberal dose of ""chin music"" in the second Test at the seamer-friendly Hagley Oval, senior New Zealand pacer Neil Wagner declared, harping on the visitors' struggles when faced with pace and bounce.

With India troubled by short balls bowled from round the wicket, the 33-year-old Wagner promised that they will employ the same strategy during the second match starting Saturday.

""It's obviously tough for them to come here and play where there is obviously a bit more bounce and pace,"" said Wagner.

""Obviously, playing in India where there is not that much bounce and pace around and so it is something new for them to adapt to,"" he added.

Wagner, just like his coach Gary Stead, believes that Indians will be better but he expects the home side to be relentless in its endeavour to compound the agony for the visitors.

""Hopefully, we can keep the squeeze on and bowl the way the boys bowled in Wellington and if we can keep piling the pressure on, we will make the job a lot easier for ourselves,"" he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jamieson-wants-to-establish-as-all-rounder.html

201,27-2-20,"S Korean virus cases jump again, 1st US soldier infected","South Korean virus cases jumped again on Wednesday and the US military confirmed its first case among American soldiers based in the Asian country, with his case and many others connected to a southeastern city with a growing illness cluster.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 216 of the 284 new cases were in Daegu, where the government has been mobilizing public health tools to contain the spread of the outbreak, and in neighbouring towns.

The US military said the 23-year-old soldier was in self-quarantine at his off-base residence. He had been based in Camp Carroll in a town near Daegu, and visited both Carroll and nearby Camp Walker in recent days, according to the statement.

South Korean authorities and US military health professionals were tracing his contacts to determine if other people may have been exposed.

About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea. United States Forces Korea previously said a widowed dependent had the virus, the first case involving a USFK-related individual. South Korea’s 600,000-member military has reported 18 cases and quarantined thousands of soldiers as a precaution.

Bowling alleys, movie theatres and a golf course at four US bases were closed after the soldier’s case was confirmed, Colonel Edward Ballanco, commander of the US Army Garrison Daegu, said.

All restaurants at the bases, and at Camp George in Daegu, could now provide only takeout meals with soldiers and family members prohibited from dining there, he said.

“This is a setback, it’s true, there’s no getting around that, but it’s not the end of the war,” he said on a video message posted on Facebook.

“We are very well equipped to fight this thing off. I am certain that, that soldier that has tested positive, he’s on his way up to Camp Humphreys today, is going to get better medical care than anyone else in Korea who has the coronavirus.”

South Korea now has 1,261 confirmed infections of the virus and 11 fatalities from the COVID-19 illness it causes. The national government has been channelling medical personnel, protective suits and other supplies to Daegu, and there are concerns the local hospitals are being overwhelmed and fatigued doctors are becoming vulnerable to infections.

“This week will be critical in the fight to combat the illness,” Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu City Hall to discuss quarantine efforts.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/s-korean-virus-cases-jump-again--1st-us-soldier-infected.html
202,27-2-20,From the archives,"While actor Zeenat Aman was inspired to play Kasturba Gandhi in Dear Bapu, Love Kasturba, the director Saif Hyder Hasan wanted to explore what it was like to be married to India’s biggest icon. By Sakshi Sharma

In one scene, Gandhi and Kasturba are on opposite sides of the stage, both on an elevated platform. In another, Bapu sits by Kasturba’s slowly disintegrating funeral pyre and when asked to leave, he says, “Saath (60) saal ke liye saath rahe the, saath (60) minute toh baithne do.” These scenes from Dear Bapu, Love Kasturba will certainly transport you to various phases of history, exploring their relationship.

The play opens with the drama of the Quit India Movement. Gandhi is arrested and sent to the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. Kasturba leads in his absence. She, too, is arrested and sent to the Arthur Road Jail in Bombay. Due to poor health, she is sent to be with Gandhi. A few years later, she passed away. Now, her soul writes letters to Gandhi. These letters evaluate their relationship of 60 years. From marriage to death, the letters leave nothing — politics, marriage, family, children, companionship.

How was it to recreate and understand Kasturba Gandhi as nothing much has been written about her in the past?

Saif Hyder Hasan: We have usually seen various biopics centred around Mahatma Gandhi. Kasturba is just seen standing behind him as a supporting character. She is never seen leading the narrative. I wanted to keep the play very different. So this explores their relationship and personal equation from Kasturba’s perspective. That’s where the difference lies.

What made you go for this role, especially after such a long gap?

Zeenat Aman: It was my director’s thought and amazing screenplay that pushed me to go for this role. The fact that I had to play the protagonist just added to my excitement. Let me underline this that though there are mixed reviews but you can not imagine the love, claps and appreciation I received in all the cities we performed.

How did you conceptualise it? Were there any reference points?

Saif: The whole concept is the result of one line — ‘what was it like to be married to India’s biggest icon?’ I interrogated further and that laid the foundation for this. There are a couple of books and diaries of Kasturba’s grandchildren, which helped me develop the plot of the story. To understand any character you need to read a lot of books. I made sure that I don’t stick to one book, otherwise it would look like an adaptation. Though I had read many books on her, it was only two years ago that I decided to do a play on Kasturba. While making a play or a film, it is very important to dig deeply into the characters and not rely on the internet completely. Books are the best source of information. That’s where the whole secret lies.

A lot of research has also gone behind deciding the attire. I saw some of Kasturba’s pictures. In most or rather all of them she was wearing white. There were a few of them in colourful saris too. They were mostly of her early phases of life.

What was your understanding of Kasturba?

Zeenat: My director had already done a very thorough research about her. He read almost all the books based on her. And I followed up with his research and added my bit to it as I had very less time to do my own groundwork.

While I was going through that process, I found that Kasturba was a powerful woman. She had an amazing journey with Mahatma. Even though she didn’t agree with him on various subjects, she was always there for him. When Kasturba was in jail, she supported the wives of the men, who were jailed with Gandhi. She participated in the Harijan Movement and was even sent to prison for it. It was quite intriguing and inspirational to learn about her. However, it was quite challenging. I had the material in front of me, I just had to project it at a glance.

Did you feel the pressure of putting Kasturba in the right light as it would lead to various fresh perspectives?

Saif: No. I didn’t feel any kind of pressure. I just tried to portray her as she was. You just have to be honest. I would only say, Kuch to log kahenge, logo ko kaam hai kehna.

How do you find modern relationships different than the old school ones?

Zeenat: I feel that you cannot compare any relationship because each of them is very different. They have their own space and energies. Their history, emotional baggage and everything they bring to the table is way different. In fact, you can not compare any relationship. Even if you see the child-parent dynamic, there relationship is very distinct. We deal with different individuals who bring in a certain dynamics. So I feel there can never be any comparisons.

How was it exploring yourself through theatre?

Zeenat: It’s been encouraging, exciting and interesting. And the best part is that during the play, each city reacted differently. People in Mumbai are different from the ones in Delhi and Hyderabad. They cheer, laugh and cry at different timings. Maybe, the performance also gets different as it evolves over time.

204,27-2-20,A notch higher,"Raf Simons joins Prada to form a creative collaboration

Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons — two of the fashion world’s biggest creative names — will collaborate on Prada collections from Spring/Summer 2021 going forward indefinitely, the designers announced at a news conference on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week.

Prada, who has been the creative force behind one of luxury’s most successful brands for 30 years, said the new partnership didn’t signal an eventual succession. “Don’t make me older than I am,” the 70-year-old designer quipped.

Simons, 52, is considered one of the fashion world’s biggest talents, whose future has been the subject of intense speculation since he left Calvin Klein in 2018. He previously was creative director of Jil Sander and Dior, and also has his own eponymous label, which he said would continue.

Their first collaboration will appear on the September runway for Spring/Summer 2021. “The contract in theory is forever,” Prada said. “Maybe this is the first time in fashion history that two expert designers who had their own successes in this sector will work together,” said Patrizio Bertelli, the co-CEO of the Prada Group with his wife, Miuccia Prada.

The announcement came on a day when the new coronavirus was a growing concern around the fashion capital. Giorgio Armani took the unusual step to show his collection behind closed doors to an empty theater, streaming for the fashion public, as a precaution. The rest of the scheduled fashion shows continued as planned. Later, the number of confirmed cases in Italy rose to at least 152 and officials halted the Venice Carnival to try to stop the spread of the virus.

Prada said they went ahead with the announcement despite the growing emergency in Italy — where more cases of the COVID-19 virus have been confirmed than in Hong Kong. She said that the globalised world is becoming ever more complex “and we need to work, also if these ugly and difficult things are happening.”

The designers said that the collaboration was born out of long mutual respect dating from 2005 when Simons took over as creative director of Jil Sander, which was at the time part of the Prada Group.

They both said that the collaboration was also meant as a bulwark against a tendency in the fashion world for creativity to be squelched by business priorities. “I think a lot of creatives in a lot of positions dealing with independent brands and creative directorships feel troubled, feel like the fashion industry is moving more and more toward an industry that might end up excluding creatives,” Simons said. He specified that in the fashion world there are examples of financial success without a strong creative direction.

“It is definitely something we question, and we do believe that a collaboration between creatives could re-position that aspect of the whole business,” he said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-notch-higher-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-notch-higher.html
205,27-2-20,Blessed to act for social causes: Ayushmann,"Ayushmann Khurrana has proved himself time and again by portraying characters not many have tried before, and he feels blessed to be an actor at a time where he can stand up and root for social causes on screen.

On his new film Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, Ayushmann feels the film has been successfully made, released and accepted is because even before same-sex relationship became legal in India, many actors stuck their neck out and given the audience some brilliant work on the subject. He says he has all those actors and films to credit first.

“The fact that Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is a success today is because the path was made for it by others. Many before me have toiled hard to make the path smoother. We have to realise and acknowledge the monumental work that was done by some of the finest actors of Indian cinema much before me,” he said.

He added: “Before Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, our industry has also made some of the most soul-touching films on the subject. I don’t think we can ever forget Shabana Azmi ji’s incredible performance and Nandita Das’s heart-wrenching acting in Fire’, Sanjay Suri and Purab Kohli’s vulnerability in My Brother Nikhil, Manoj Bajpayee’s brilliance in Aligarh and Kalki Koechlin’s strength in Margarita With A Straw.’”

Ayushmann also mentioned films that brilliantly took on the stereotype faced by the LGBTQ+ community. “Films like Kapoor And Sons, Karan Johar’s Bombay Talkies and Sonam Kapoor’s Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga have all depicted and handled same-sex relationships with profound thought, dignity, and sensitivity,” he noted.

“Today, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is being celebrated the world over and I have to share this moment with all the actors and directors who had taken it on themselves to promote inclusivity in our country. This is a very special moment in my life and I’m cherishing all the love that my film and my performance is receiving and I feel blessed to be acting at a time where I can stand up, back and root for a social cause like this,"" he declared.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/blessed-to-act-for-social-causes--ayushmann-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/blessed-to-act-for-social-causes--ayushmann.html

Kohli, who has 906 points, slipped to the second position in the list which also features Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Mayank Agarwl at the eighth, ninth and 10th place respectively.

While India vice-captain Rahane, who scored 75 in the opening Test, gained a spot and Mayank returned to a career-best 10th position after amassing 92 runs, which included a second-innings half-century, Pujara dropped two places after returning with identical scores of 11 in the two innings.

Kohli’s slump meant Australia’s Steve Smith was back on top of the list for the eighth time after first occupying the top position in June 2015. The last batsman apart from Smith and Kohli to be number one is New Zealand’s Kane Williamson, for an eight-day period in December 2015.

207,27-2-20,"Goodbye, tennis: Sharapova announces retirement","Five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova, one of the world’s most recognisable sportswomen, on Wednesday announced her retirement at the age of 32.

“Tennis — I’m saying goodbye,” Sharapova said in an article for Vogue and Vanity Fair magazines.

“After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I’m ready to scale another mountain — to compete on a different type of terrain.”

Sharapova burst onto the scene as a supremely gifted teenager and won her Grand Slams before serving a 15-month ban for failing a drugs test at the 2016 Australian Open.

The Russian former world number one’s ranking is currently 373rd.

Sharapova has hardly played in the past year because of long-standing shoulder problems.

When she did play she lost as many matches as she won and was dumped out in the first rounds at Wimbledon, the US Open and, most recently, the Australian Open in Melbourne.

Sharapova shot to fame as a giggly 17-year-old Wimbledon winner in 2004, the third-youngest player to conquer the All England Club’s hallowed grass courts.

She became world number one in 2005 and won the US Open the next year.

“One of the keys to my success was that I never looked back and I never looked forward,” Sharapova said on Wednesday.

“I believed that if I kept grinding and grinding, I could push myself to an incredible place.”

She would win the 2008 Australian Open and in 2012, the Siberian-born captured the French Open to become the 10th woman to complete a career Grand Slam. She added Olympic Silver to her resume that year.

Her 2014 French Open title was another high after a dispiriting injury low.

“In giving my life to tennis, tennis gave me a life,” Sharapova said in her retirement missive.

“I’ll miss it everyday. I’ll miss the training and my daily routine: Waking up at dawn, lacing my left shoe before my right, and closing the court’s gate before I hit my first ball of the day.

“I’ll miss my team, my coaches. I’ll miss the moments sitting with my father on the practice court bench.

The handshakes — win or lose — and the athletes, whether they knew it or not, who pushed me to be my best.

“Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain. My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/goodbye--tennis--sharapova-announces-retirement.html

209,27-2-20,Man City appeal against Euro ban,"Manchester City’s appeal against their two-year European ban for breaches of financial regulations has been officially registered by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS announced on Wednesday.

The Premier League club, who were also fined 30 million euros ($32.5 million) by European football’s governing body UEFA earlier this month, had immediately contested the “flawed” process and stated their intention to appeal.

CAS said in a statement on Wednesday: “The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered an appeal filed by Manchester City football club against the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).

“The appeal is directed against the decision of the adjudicatory chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) dated 14 February 2020 in which Manchester City was deemed to have contravened UEFA’s Club Licensing and Financial Fair Play Regulations.”

CAS said it was not possible to say when the matter would be resolved but it is expected to take several months.

The adjudicatory chamber said on February 14 City had broken the rules by “overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016.”

Pep Guardiola’s City face losing hundreds of millions of pounds in prize money, TV revenue, gate receipts and sponsorship income should their appeal fail.

Last week, City Football Group CEO Ferran Soriano said the club hoped to have their appeal heard by CAS before the start of next season’s Champions League.

Asked to re-appear in trials after not-so-strong performance at the Rome Ranking series event and the recently-concluded Asian Championships, the 18-year-old Sonam tore apart the challenge of established seniors in the 62kg competition.

She first got past Radhika and then caring little for reputations, Sonam beat the Asian Championship 59kg Gold medallist Sarita Mor (3-1) in the semifinals before winning by fall against Rio Olympics Bronze medallist Sakshi in the final.

She pinned Sakshi in the second period when she was trailing 1-2 and one minute left in the bout.

Nine wrestlers appeared in the 62kg trials, including 2018 World Championship Bronze medallist Pooja Dhanda and a few from upper weight categories.

“There was no nervousness before the bouts. I was determined to compete hard. I have fought against them before and I knew I had to battle it out. So I was prepared,” Sonam said.

Sonam said she needs to hone her style before the Bishkek Qualifiers.

“I will try my best. I need to work on my leg defence and ground attack before the Bishkek Qualifiers.”

Meanwhile, Kiran won the trial in 76kg.

With the Olympic qualification cut-off set to end on April 26, the $ 400,000 event will see a galaxy of stars descending at the Indian capital, making the upcoming edition of the Super 500 event one of the best ever.

Yufei will be leading eight of the world’s top 10 women’s singles shuttlers with the others being Akane Yamaguchi, He Bingjiao, Carolina Marin, An Se Young, Michelle Li, three-time champion Ratchanok Intanon and India’s very own world champion PV Sindhu, besides former World No 1 Saina Nehwal.

Among the men, while Axelsen will be gunning for his third title, he will have to contend with fellow top-10 players, Sai Praneeth and 2018 winner Shi Yuqi. 2012 champion and former World No 1 Son Wan Ho will be another of the star shuttlers vying for the title. Three-time world junior champion Kunlavut Vitidsarn, who reached the Barcelona Spain Masters final this month, will be one of the young guns capable of causing an upset.

For India’s 2015 champions Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth, the tournament will be crucial as they look to bag some valuable ranking points and materialize their Tokyo Olympic dreams. 2014 Commonwealth Games Gold medallist Parupalli Kashyap, HS Prannoy, Sourabh Verma, Sameer Verma and Lakshya Sen are the other Indian shuttlers who will be showing their fireworks in the singles main draw.

For the 2017 champion Sindhu, the tournament will be the perfect battleground to test herself against the world’s best in her quest for the Olympic Gold she missed at Rio the last time. With the draw having the planet’s best shuttler, Chen Yufei, who began the season with the Malaysia Masters title, Sindhu is expected to put up a flawless show in front of the home audience.

The tournament will also give the biggest stars a chance to improve their ranking and, in turn, better their seeding at Tokyo — something the likes of Yamaguchi, Intanon, Marin will be hoping to do.

In doubles, all eyes will be on Thailand Open champions Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, who are currently ranked 10th and are almost certain of making the trip to Tokyo. The heavily-stacked draw has seven men’s doubles pairs from the world’s top 10, led by World No 4 Takeshi Kamura and Keigo Sonoda.

The Indian pairs of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Ashwini Ponnappa and Pranaav Jerry Chopra-Sikki Reddy need to show their best form in a mixed doubles field that sees the World No 1 combine of Zheng Si Wei and Huang Ya Qiong leading 9 top-10 teams.

“In the end it’s a draw that is a good result considering that we have another home game,” said Barcelona coach Quique Setien, with his side in a strong position ahead of the second leg at the Camp Nou on March 18.

The clash was the first between the two teams and also a CL debut for both Setien and Napoli counterpart Gennaro Gattuso, who took over after the group stage.

“They didn’t hurt us, they tickled us,” said Gattuso. “It went wrong in one moment and they punished us.” Napoli captain Lorenzo Insigne added: “We could have won, so we’re a bit disappointed. It was emotional to face players like (Lionel) Messi.”

Messi failed to score on his first appearance at the Stadio San Paolo, where Napoli legend Diego Maradona reigned supreme three decades ago.

The 32-year-old Messi scored four goals at the weekend in Barcelona’s 5-0 win over Eibar that put the Spaniards back top of La Liga, but could not add to his 114 Champions League goals.

“If Barca didn’t do today what they did three days ago (against Eibar) it’s to Napoli’s credit,” said Gattuso.

“I hope that no one thinks it’s over. We know it will be very hard but nothing is finished yet.

Messi fired over on nine minutes after combining well with Frenkie de Jong but Gattuso’s side piled the pressure on the Catalans.

Their pressing paid off on the half-hour mark, with Piotr Zielinski breaking free down the right before finding Mertens, who curled a magnificent finish past Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

He equalled Hamsik’s record and is now six goals clear of Maradona, but was forced off early in the second half after a Sergio Busquets tackle for which the Spaniard will be suspended for the second leg.

Barcelona did not waste much time in getting on level terms, as Messi and Busquets combined to send Semedo into the box in the 57th minute.

The Portuguese full-back crossed low for Griezmann to power home right-footed.

“At first we found it hard to find space, or create space or get shots on goal,” said Griezmann.

“But the more we saw that they were tiring, the more we were able to push forward and make chances.”

Vidal was sent off after a sliding tackle on Rui before appearing to headbutt the Napoli defender.

The Chilean will also miss the return leg in Spain, with defender Gerard Pique a doubt after going off late on with an ankle injury.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/griezmann-rescues-barca-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/griezmann-rescues-barca.html
213,27-2-20,"Women's T20 World Cup: India post below-par 133-8 against New Zealand, despite Shafali's 46","Young opener Shafali Verma smashed a 34-ball 46 but India frittered away a solid start to post a below-par 133 for eight against New Zealand in their crucial group A match of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

Invited to bat, 16-year-old Shafali once again provided the fireworks as India scored 49 for one in the powerplay overs. But they lost six wickets for 43 runs to squander the good start.

Smriti Mandhana (11), who returned to the playing XI after missing the last match due to illness, departed early when he dragged a Lea Tahuhu delivery on to the stumps in the third over.

However, Shafali and Taniya (23) kept the scoreboard ticking, adding 51 runs for the second wicket.

In the 10th over, Taniya departed after being caught by Amelia Kerr at backward point.

Jemimah Rodrigues (10) then joined Shafali as India reached 75-2 in the first 10 overs.

But Rodrigues was caught by Kerr in the 12th over when she was trying to work a ball down the leg side as India slipped to 80 for 3.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur's (1) poor form continued as she was soon back to the hut after being caught and bowled by Leigh Kasperek.

Shafali, who was dropped at long-on in the 8th over and at mid-wicket in the 10th over, then ran out of luck as she holed out to Hayley Jensen at deep extra cover off Kerr.

The 16-year-old opener had four hits to the fence and three maximum shots in her innings.

Left-handed batter Deepti Sharma (8) and Veda Krishnamurthy (6) brought up the 100 in the 15th over but the latter was trapped infront of wicket by Kerr in the next over as India slumped to 104 for 6.

Deepti too perished in the 18th over as India's slump continued.

Radha Yadav then blasted 14 off nine balls, which included a six in the final over, to give some respectability to the total.

214,27-2-20,‘Shaw natural stroke-player & knows how to get runs’,"Trent Boult and Tim Southee have exposed the chinks in Prithvi Shaw’s armour but India skipper Virat Kohli is ready to wait and watch before any corrective analysis as he does not see a pattern in the young opener’s dismissals so far.

There are a few shortcomings that experts have noticed in Shaw’s batting after the 20-year-old right-handed batsman scored just 16 and 14 in the two innings of the first Test against New Zealand.

“I think we can sit down and analyse, maybe after 8 or 10 similar dismissals. I don’t think (it’s fair to the guy), who is playing away from home for the first time and is probably experiencing different kind of bowling attack at international level compared to playing at home,” Kohli had said, when asked about Shaw’s dismissals.

“I don’t think at this stage, we need to sit down and discuss what’s going wrong because I don’t see anything wrong. It’s the execution of things which was not there.”

International cricket is about finding one’s own straps and Shaw also will work out what is best for him, feels the captain who has 70 hundreds to his credit in all formats.

“He (Shaw) will figure out. He will find ways to score runs because he is a natural stroke-player and he scores runs. It is not that he gets small runs (when he gets them). He gets big runs and knows how to get runs.”

The reason why Shaw faltered could be due to the lack of understanding of the pace of the Basin Reserve track but the former U-19 World Cup-winning skipper was not alone as some of the team’s other big names also failed to gauge the nature of the pitch.

“It is just a matter of understanding the pace of the wicket and conditions as soon as possible. Again, when he is in a clear frame of mind, he is very, very destructive,” Kohli said, hopeful that Shaw will learn quickly.

Clarity of mind is paramount at the highest level and once Shaw has that, there would be no stopping him.

“I think whenever we have done well overseas, the opening partnership has been with a lot of clarity and positivity even clearing the in-field, taking bowlers on so that you put them under pressure. He is that kind of a player,” Kohli said.

“Once he feels that he can do it, I think it will be a different ball game. The mindset can shift very quickly.”

While Kohli’s Test squad has had horses for courses policy, it seems that the skipper wants to stick with Shaw in the second Test even though Shubman Gill can’t be completely ruled out of reckoning. “Prithvi obviously wants to perform and no doubt about it, every batsman wants to. We need to give him that time to get used to the conditions a little bit and once he starts scoring, he will feel more confident about it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---shaw-natural-stroke-player---knows-how-to-get-runs---.html

216,27-2-20,Knight takes Eng to record win,"Captain Heather Knight’s maiden T20I century helped England notch up a record-breaking 98-run victory over debutants Thailand on Wednesday.

Knight blasted a majestic 108 not out from 66 balls to become the fourth batter to make a hundred at the event and send records tumbling.

England’s total of 176 for two, after being sent in to bat, was their highest T20I total and Knight’s unbeaten third-wicket stand of 169 with Nat Sciver (59 not out) was the highest partnership for any wicket in Women’s T20 World Cup history.

Thailand managed 78 for seven from their 20 overs, with England’s victory by 98 runs the largest winning margin at the tournament.

All this was scarcely conceivable after a remarkable start to the game when the 2009 winners were reduced to seven for two. Bot England openers were dismissed for ducks for just the second time in T20Is.

Knight has a remarkable record at Manuka Oval, with all four of her T20I 50+ scores coming in Australia’s capital, the most of any woman at a single venue in the format. Natthakan Chantham top-scored with a 53-ball 32 in the Thailand’s unsuccessful run chase.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/knight-takes-eng-to-record-win.html
217,27-2-20,Shafali takes pressure off me: Smriti,"She has been the backbone of Indian women’s cricket team’s batting but swashbuckling India opener Smriti Mandhana is delighted that teen prodigy Shafali Verma is stealing her thunder at the ongoing tournament as it takes the pressure off her.

The 23-year-old Mandhana, who has been a key player for the Indian team in the last two-three years, said Verma is showing she is capable of filling her boots.

“I used to score a lot of our runs in the last two of three years, especially in the Powerplay, but now with Shafali coming in, she’s getting the runs in the way I do. It makes the team more balanced,” Mandhana said.

“Shafali has been a huge positive coming into the T20 side. The way she’s going about her batting, it’s so easy to bat alongside her,” she said on the eve of India’s group match against New Zealand.

Verma has already announced her emergence on the global stage. The 16-year-old has scored 68 runs across two games in this World Cup, including five sixes and seven fours, at an impressive strike rate of 212.

Smriti said Verma’s best attribute is the “routine she likes to follow and no one has gone in and told her she has to change that”.

Talking about New Zealand match, Mandhana said, “I don’t think we will be going into the game thinking about a total, but we will continue playing the way that is working for all of our batters.”

Seasoned New Zealand pacer Lea Tahuhu said she is looking forward to bowling at Verma.

“Personally, I love the thought of facing Verma. It makes me fire up a little bit more and I’m really looking forward to playing her,” said Tahuhu.

“I actually played her in the T20 Challenge in India last year and I know she’s not going to take a step back,” she said, referring to India’s IPL style T20 tournament played in Jaipur.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shafali-takes-pressure-off-me--smriti.html
218,27-2-20,Semis berth in sight for India,"On a high after two easy victories on the trot, including one against defending champion Australia, the Indian women’s cricket team will aim to inch closer to a semifinal berth when it takes on New Zealand in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup here today.

The Indians have hardly broke a sweat in their 17-run and 18-run wins over hosts Australia and Bangladesh in their previous two matches, and they are perched at the top of five-team Group A standings with four points from two matches.

A win against New Zealand today will take the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side on the threshold of a knock-out stage spot, to be competed among top two teams from Group A and B.

In the two matches so far, the Indian team has been impressive both in batting and bowling.

The 16-year-old sensation Shafali Verma has been the standout batter with a whirlwind 17-ball 39 against Bangladesh, following her 29 against Australia.

One-down Jemmiah Rodrigues has also been among the runs with 26 and 34 in the two matches so far.

Only captain Harmanpreet, among the top order batters, has not scored big and she is due a big innings.

India is also likely to be bolstered by the return of star opener Smriti Mandhana who missed the match against Bangladesh due to fever.

The middle-order has also done its bit with Deepti Sharma playing a major role against Australia with an unbeaten 49 while Veda Krishnamurthy hit a match-defining 11-ball 20 not out for a late flourish against Bangladesh.

The bowling department has been led admirably by seasoned leg-spinner Poonam Yadav — seven wickets in the first two matches — with pacer Shikha Pandey ably supporting her with five scalps so far.

New Zealand, though, have a better head-to-head record against India in recent years, having won the last three matches between the two sides.

Exactly a year back, they had beaten the Indian team 3-0 in a three-match T20I home series.

India will, however, remember their massive 34-run win against New Zealand in the previous edition in 2018. Harmanpreet had struck a memorable 103 to lead her side to victory.

New Zealand have some top class players in their ranks in the form of captain and all-rounder Sophie Devine and top-order batswoman Suzie Bates while pacer Lea Tahuhu and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr will lead the bowling department.

They will go into this match on a high after an easy seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Saturday.

Devine had led her side from the front with an unbeaten 75 off 55 balls at the top of the order in that win.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/semis-berth-in-sight-for-india.html
219,27-2-20,Train in India: NRAI tells shooters,"India’s national shooting federation on Wednesday said it will not allow its shooters to travel abroad for training due to the novel coronavirus threat and won’t hesitate in pulling out of a Tokyo Olympics Test event in April if it becomes a health risk.

Indian shooters are scheduled to travel to Tokyo to participate in the Olympic Test event slated to take place from April 16 to 26 in the Japanese capital, which will host the main event in July-August this year.

“We have chosen our test event team but we are yet to decide (on travelling there). I’m not going to risk any of those kids. If we receive any advice from the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) or the international federation, our own mission in Tokyo or even our own assessment we feel there’s a threat, it isn’t worth the risk,” National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh said.

“We are also not allowing our shooters to travel overseas to train as well due to the virus,” Singh said.

“If a shooter is infected in the test event then we are subjecting him or her to the gravest of dangers and then that shooter won’t be able to participate in the Olympics, hampering our chances of winning a medal,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/train-in-india--nrai-tells-shooters.html

The ISSF World Cup is slated to be held from March 15 to 26 at the Karni Singh Shooting Range.

“There were some countries which were coming but because of the Coronavirus outbreak, their national policies dictate that they can’t come,” NRAI President Raninder Singh told reporters.

“China have taken a wise decision on their own as a nation. They don’t want to infect others and hence won’t travel. Taiwan, which has locked down their entire island, Hong Kong, Macau, North Korea and Turkmenistan have also backed out because of national policies,” he added, referring to the domestic travel restrictions imposed by the governments of these countries.

The NRAI chief also informed that Pakistan will also not be competing at the event as the country’s shooters are busy familiarising themselves with a new coach.

“Don’t connect last time to this time. Pakistan were never coming. They have two athletes who have qualified for pistol events for the Tokyo Olympics,” he said referring to the denial of visas to Pakistani shooters in last year’s World Cup.

“My colleague Mr Javed Lodhi (Pakistan shooting federation’s executive vice president) has informed me that ‘our coach in Germany is only available during that time and our shooters would much rather train with him for the Olympic events than participate in the World Cup’,” Singh added.

Last year, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had suspended all Indian applications to host international events after two Pakistani shooters were denied visas to compete in the World Cup held here.

The sanction was later lifted after assurances from the Sports Ministry that political issues will not come in the way of granting visas to participating athletes.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coronavirus--six-countries--including-china--pull-out-of-shooting-wc-in-delhi.html

""The three reached Sitapur jail on Thursday morning. They are expected to be here till March 2,"" a jail official said.

Asked about the number of cases lodged against him, Khan said, ""Entire country knows what is happening to me and my family.""

On being shifted to Sitapur Jail, he said it was the government's decision.

Khan and his family surrendered before a Rampur court on Wednesday and were sent to judicial custody till March 2 over Abdullah's allegedly fake birth certificate.

The case relates to two birth certificates for Abdullah Azam, who allegedly also gave a wrong date of birth while filing his nomination papers for the assembly elections in 2017.

Abdullah's election was set aside by the Allahabad High Court last December.

A Rampur BJP leader, Akash Saxena, had lodged an FIR at Gang police station on January 3, 2019, alleging fraud related to Abdullah Azam's two birth certificates. In April, police filed the charge sheet in court.

It alleged that Azam Khan's son also had two passports and two PAN cards.

In one birth certificate, issued by the Rampur municipality, Abdullah's birth date was mentioned as January 1, 1993. The other certificate said he was born in Lucknow on September 30, 1990, according to the charge against him.

A case was also registered against Azam Khan and his wife as they had submitted an affidavit testifying their son's second birth certificate.

Azam Khan represents Rampur in the Lok Sabha and his wife is an MLA from the Rampur assembly seat. Their son Abdullah won from the Suar assembly segment in 2017.

223,27-2-20,BJP using Savarkar as shield for neo-nationalism politics:Sena,"The Shiv Sena on Thursday accused The BJP of using Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar as a ""shield"" to play the politics of neo-nationalism.

Terming the BJP's love for Savarkar as ""fake"", the Sena said that instead of targeting the Maharashtra government, the state BJP leaders should ask why the party- ruled Centre has failed to honour the freedom fighter so far.

It also said that if the BJP thought that it could corner the Sena over the issue of Savarkar, then it was mistaken.

""The BJP leaders in Maharashtra declared that they would target the (state) government on the issue of Veer Savarkar. This makes it clear that Savarkar is not a subject of respect or faith for the BJP, but just a political issue,"" the Sena said in its editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.

""Veer Savarkar is not merely a subject of discussion, but he should be practised in life. Savarkar's life symbolised sacrifice, principles, radiance and struggle,"" it added.

""Everyone paid respects to Savarkar on his death anniversary (observed on Wednesday). But those who pretend to remember Savarkar, have they really understood him? BJP says it will corner the government on the issue of Savarkar. But those who themselves are cornered, should not talk about cornering others,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

Instead of targeting the Maharashtra government, whether the BJP-ruled Centre has honoured Savarkar is the question that the BJP leaders in the state should ask, it added.

""Why didn't the Centre confer Bharat Ratna on Savarkar on the Republic Day? Will the neo-fans of Savarkar throw some light on it? Demand for passing a resolution in Maharashtra Assembly in honour of Savarkar if fine.

""But what happened to the letters sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in which he sought Bharat Ratna for Savarkar? The Centre did not even take note of the letters. This is an insult of Maharashtra and Veer Savarkar,"" the Sena said.

After his release from Andaman (Cellular Jail), Savarkar devoted his life to social work in Ratnagiri.

""Political leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi and RSS founder Hedgewar, met him. Gandhiji sought his cooperation for eradication of untouchability and propagation of Swadeshi,"" it added.

""Savarkar had a huge contribution in the freedom struggle. But where was the BJP or the then 'Sangh Parivar' during that movement? The RSS did not even recognise the national flag. Those who insult the national flag are called traitors,"" the saffron party said.

""Sardar Patel had imposed a ban on RSS twice. While lifting the ban both the times Patel set the condition that it has to accept the tricolour as a national flag. Golwalkar Guruji (of RSS) accepted this condition, but ""records"" say that the Sangh did not keep its word till 2002.

""The organisations which call themselves nationalist, were not ready to hoist the tricolour till 2002. Saffron flag is also the symbol of Shiv Sena, but along with that flag, the tricolour is also hoisted. This is our nationalism,"" the party added.

""The BJP is playing the politics of neo-nationalism by using Swatantryaveer Savarkar as a 'shield'. If they think the Shiv Sena will be caught in a tight spot, then they are mistaken. Sena won't be caught in a dilemma. Instead, those who are pretending will be hit. Their love for Savarkar is all fake,"" it said.

BJP's demand for a state government resolution honouring Savarkar for his contribution to the Independence struggle did not find support in both Houses of the Maharashtra Legislature on Wednesday.

While Assembly Speaker Nana Patole rejected the BJP's demand, triggering protest from its leaders, in the Legislative Council, Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe refused to entertain the saffron party's move as she adjourned the House when a BJP leader stood up to speak about it.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp-using-savarkar-as-shield-for-neo-nationalism-politics-sena-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bjp-using-savarkar-as-shield-for-neo-nationalism-politics-sena.html

238,27-2-20,India has tremendous tourism potential: Gadkari,"Prahlad Patel, Piyush Goyal too showcase India as dream tourist destination at Pioneer Exotica summit

A wonder of the yore and a land of contemporary fascination, India holds enormous potential for both domestic and foreign tourists who have little explored its incredible diversity for want of promotion and infrastructure. This was the focal point of a day-long conference — The Pioneer Exotica Tourism Summit — where speakers, including Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari, Prahlad Patel and Piyush Goyal on Wednesday showcased India as a dream tourist destination.

Besides Punjab Cabinet Minister for Tourism & Cultural Affairs Charanjit Singh Channi, filmmaker Bharat Bala, fashion designer Ritu Beri, IATO president Pronab Sarkar, Air India ex-CMD Ashwini Lohani, Harkrit Ahluwalia of Citrus Country Foundation; Seema Bhat, vice president of the Ecotourism Society of India; Anil Chadha of ITC Hotel; Abu Sufiya of Delhi Tourism; Mandip Singh Soin, founder ibex expedition; Subhash Goyal, tourism policy expert; Raveen Singh Ahluwalia, Patiala Foundation Chief; Amar Nath of Neemrana Hotels; Sumitra Sernapathy, CEO women on Wanderlust; Samil Malhotra, Turin Marketing were other participants at the summit.

The conference was divided in five different panels, the first being ‘Dekho apna desh’. This was moderated by The Pioneer Editor-in-Chief Dr Chandan Mitra and addressed by Tourism Minister and chief guest Prahlad Patel.

Union Minister for Road, Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari was guest of honour at another panel discussion titled “Highway to heaven”. Dr Mitra was the moderator.

Minister of Railways Piyush Goyal spoke on the theme “Deep into India’s heart” in conversation with Dr Mitra.

In a speech heard with rapt attention, Prahlad Patel, Minister of State (independent charge) for Culture and Tourism, talked about involvement of all the stakeholders, including the Centre and State Governments, hotels, tour operators and locals, for the growth of tourism in the country. He said that by next five years, the Government aims to double the domestic tourist footfall.

“We all are responsible for the growth of the tourism sector and an individual cannot individually promote it. All the sectors should come together for its growth,” he said while speaking at the Pioneer Exotica Tourism Summit 2020 here on Thursday.

Patel was of the view that the tourism has never been given its due importance in the past. “Had it been, we would have witnessed tremendous progress in the North-East region where connectivity was never taken seriously. More than monetary benefits, it is the positive perception towards the tourism that matters. With our holistic approach, we aim to double our domestic tourist footfall within next five years,” he added.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari suggested the stakeholders in the sector to adopt three basic formulas — the PPP model, fast environment clearances, and innovative ideas, besides a strong political will.

Gadkari said his Ministry is working on 22 green corridors, a dedicated Mumbai-Delhi Expressway, and direct road connectivity to Mansarovar. These will help in growth and generation of employment in the tourism sector, Gadkari said, adding India under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on the path of being a “Tourism Giant.”

Gadkari said tourism has great employment potential and this is the way forward to eradicate poverty from the country.

Gadkari said the country’s ethno structure requires a great improvement if we need to augment tourism.

Gadkari said the Centre in coordination with Delhi and neighboring States is working on a war footing level to contain the pollution in the national Capital.

Stating that pollution and bad air environment have been a deterrent to tourists in visiting Delhi, Gadkari said project worth Rs 55,000 crore are on anvil and 150 black spots have been identified to reduce the pollution.

Talking about efforts of Railways to promote tourism, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said, “We are running Ramayan Express which will connect sites associated with Lord Ram. Similarly there is a train called Saamanta Express which will cover prominent places associated with Gautam Buddha and chief architect of the Constitution Dr BR Ambedkar,” The idea is also to take the railway to Char Dham, he added.

The Minister said that as a nation we all must act together to bring the excitement back of promoting India. In fact Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself suggested each of us to plan a visit of 15 places within the country in next three years.

“India has a huge potential and I am sure this initiative will go a long way in promoting tourism,” he added.

Former Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani underlined the need for promoting tourism by innovative means and greater connectivity. He also stressed the need for installing proper signages and create a literature bank of tourist spots of the country.

Acclaimed filmmaker Bharat Bata displayed a short film on Punjab tourism and the highlighted the importance of presenting tourism potential in short story format through audio-video presentation.

Fashion designer Ritu Beri talked about the need to promote domestic tourism and handicraft and said India offered a great potential to emerge as a mega tourist hot spot in the world.

In his interaction with the Ministers, Dr Mitra appreciated the vision of Tourism Minister Prahlad Patel in promoting tourism and said this will go a long way in tackling India’s unemployment problem.

Dr Mitra called Gadkari a visionary and said he is a Minister known to achieve whatever he sets out to do. He referred to tremendous work done by Gadkari in changing the face of Nagpur and pointed out that the Minister’s effort at infrastructure building will go a long way in tourism promotion.

Dr Mitra highlighted Piyush Goyal’s efforts for reviving the age-old romance of Indian railways and said that ever since he took over as boss of the Ministry, Indian Railways has made big strides in infrastructure building. Dr Mitra also talked about Railway’s importance in uniting the country and tourism promotion.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-has-tremendous-tourism-potential--gadkari-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-has-tremendous-tourism-potential--gadkari.html
239,27-2-20,SC slams Delhi Police for failing to curb bloodshed,"Take ‘conscious’ call on FIRs against 3 BJP netas after verifying hate videos, asks HC

The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Delhi Police for failing to act “professionally” and check “unfortunate incidents” of violence in north-east Delhi even as the Delhi High Court directed the police to take “conscious decision” with respect to lodging of FIRs against alleged hate speeches by three BJP leaders in connection with the CAA violence.

The three BJP leaders are — Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma.

A High Court Bench of Justices S Muralidhar and Anup J Bhambhani took on record the assurance by Special Commissioner Praveer Ranjan that he will sit with the Police Commissioner on Wednesday itself and view all video clips of their alleged hate speeches and take a conscious decision on lodging of FIRs.

The high court also issued notices to the parties concerned on the plea filed by the Centre seeking to be impleaded in the case. The matter will be heard further on Thursday.

Earlier, when the High Court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to advice the Police Commissioner on lodging of FIRs against alleged hate speeches by the three BJP leaders, the SG pleaded that the court should wait for the response of the authorities concerned on the issue of lodging FIRs against alleged hate speeches by the BJP leaders.

The HC was hearing a plea seeking lodging of FIRs and arrests of those involved in the ongoing communal violence in parts of north-east Delhi over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The hearing will continue at 2.30 pm.

During the hearing, the court asked Mehta and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo if they had seen the video clip of BJP leader Kapil Mishra making alleged hate speeches.

While the solicitor general maintained that he does not watch television and has not seen those clips, Deo said he has watched the video of BJP leaders Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma but has not seen that of Mishra.

On the submission made by the police officer, Justice Muralidhar remarked, “I am really amazed at the state of affairs of the Delhi Police and asked the court staff to play Mishra’s video clip in the courtroom.”

When the gathering in the jam-packed courtroom started hooting, the Bench asked them to maintain decorum or else it will hold an in-camera proceedings.

At the outset, the hearing witnessed heated arguments between Solicitor General Mehta and Delhi Government counsel Rahul Mehra, who raised objection over the appearance of the law officer on behalf of the Police Commissioner.

Mehra said the issue has been settled by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on the powers of the Centre and the Delhi Government and everyone should respect the Rule of Law of the country. Mehta contended that the Union of India is also a stakeholder in the matter and he has been instructed by the LG to appear.

“Don’t create an ugly scene here. I am not addressing a rally. I am addressing the lordships here,” he said, who was then allowed to advance arguments in the matter.

The SG urged the court to implead the Centre as a party in the petition as the issue involves law and order and requested that the matter be heard on Thursday. He also said the statements by BJP leaders Verma and Thakur were made several days back and it was not urgent to be heard today.

The court observed, “Does that not make it even more urgent. When the Commissioner was made aware of such statements, does he need someone to approach him to take action. As a law officer you answer whether this prayer (for lodging FIRs against three BJP leaders) is not urgent.”

Mehta replied, “I am not saying it is not urgent, but it can wait till tomorrow.”

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court chastised the Delhi Police for failing to act “professionally” and check “unfortunate incidents” of violence in north-east Delhi. The apex court lashed out at the law enforcing agencies for allowing the “instigators of violence” to get away and said they should act “independently” as per law without waiting for somebody’s nod.

“If somebody makes an inflammatory remark, police has to take action,” it said.

Though the top court did not look into the applications on the violence, it said there was a need for “conducive environment” to go into the matters related to Shaheen Bagh protests.

A Bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph said it will not expand the scope of petitions filed in connection with Shaheen Bagh protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), by looking into the pleas on violence.

“We will not go beyond the scope of the petition before us. Several unfortunate incidents have taken place. The question before us is that whether the people aggrieved can sit at a place called Shaheen Bagh. We will hear only this issue,” the Bench said.

“We are not going into the applications related to the issue of violence. It is for the high court to look into the matter,” it said.

The Bench stated, however, that it is not precluding anyone from availing any remedy as per law.

Tushar Mehta informed the apex court that the Delhi High Court has heard pleas connected with the violence in the national Capital and had listed them for further hearing in the afternoon.

After the applications were disposed of, there was a sharp exchange of words between the Bench and the Solicitor General, when Justice Joseph said he wanted to say something on the issue of violence.

Mehta urged the Bench not to make any adverse observations relating to the violence as it will demoralise the police force.

Justice Joseph said, “I will make the remarks as my loyalty is to the institution. I will fail in my duty towards the institution and as a judge, if I don’t speak up my mind on the issue”.

He added, “There was lack of independence and professionalism on part of the police. Unless you allow the police to act. Look at how police acts in the UK and the USA. Do they require somebody’s nod to act as per law. If somebody makes an inflammatory remark, police has to take action. The guidelines in the Prakash Singh judgment needs to be followed.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-slams-delhi-police-for-failing-to-curb-bloodshed-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc-slams-delhi-police-for-failing-to-curb-bloodshed.html

The officer identified as Ankit Sharma, a resident of the area, was working as an IB security assistant.

Sharma’s father Devendra, who also works with the IB, said Ankit returned home around 5.30 pm on Tuesday and soon left home to assess the situation outside. “When he didn’t return, we started looking for him. We also went to the GTB and LNJP hospitals... We kept searching him till 3 am on Wednesday. Around 10 am, we got information that his body was lying in the Chand Bagh drain,” said Sharma’s father.

Ankit’s brother Ankur said some women from their colony informed them that they saw people throwing his brother in the drain. “When the killers saw the women, they threatened them with dire consequences if they revealed about it. He sustained several stab wounds before being dumped into the drain,” Ankur claimed.

241,27-2-20,CBSE XII exams put off in violence-hit areas,"The CBSE Class XII English exam on Thursday has been postponed in North-east district and parts of East Delhi in view of the turbulent situation due to violence, according to officials. Earlier the Delhi High Court raised doubt if board exams can be held in North-east Delhi, and asked CBSE to come up with a plan to re-schedule them or change the affected centres.

“Considering request of the Delhi Government and to avoid inconvenience to students, staff and parents, the board has decided to postpone the exam for Class XII in North-east part of Delhi,” Central Board of Secondary Education Secretary Anurag Tripathi said.

The exam has been postponed at 73 centres in Northeast Delhi and seven centres in the eastern part. “However, the exam in rest parts of Delhi shall be conducted as per scheduled. The next date of exam for affected students will be notified shortly,” the official said.

Taking note of the “worsening situation” in violence-hit areas, the Delhi High Court said it was doubtful that board exams could be held there and directed the CBSE to come up with a plan to reschedule them or change the affected centres.

For students who live in northeast Delhi, but have their exam centres in other parts, the CBSE officials have asked the students to approach their school principals. “The board is in regular touch with school principals and, in a case such as this, the principals can send details of students. Board will assess and take appropriate action,” an official said.

The CBSE had also postponed Class X exam in North-east Delhi on Wednesday.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cbse-xii-exams-put-off-in-violence-hit-areas-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cbse-xii-exams-put-off-in-violence-hit-areas.html
242,27-2-20,"USCIRF condemns violence in New Delhi, calls for swift action","Expressing concern over the violence in New Delhi, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom urged the Government of India to take swift action for the safety of its citizens.

Expressing ""grave concern"" over it, the USCIRF said the Indian government should provide protection to people regardless of their faith amid reports of attack on Muslims.

""We urge the Indian government to make serious efforts to protect Muslims and others targeted by mob violence,"" USCIRF Chair Tony Perkins said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon.

At least 27 people have been killed and over 200 injured in the violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act in the Indian capital.

""The ongoing violence we are witnessing in Delhi and the reported attacks against Muslims, their homes and shops, and their houses of worship are greatly disturbing. One of the essential duties of any responsible government is to provide protection and physical security for its citizens, regardless of faith,"" Tony Perkins said.

USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava too said the ""brutal and unchecked violence"" across Delhi cannot continue.

""The Indian government must take swift action to ensure the safety of its citizens,"" she said, adding that reports are mounting that the ""Delhi Police have not intervened in violent attacks against Muslims, and the government is failing in its duty to protect its citizens"".

""These incidents are even more concerning in the context of efforts within India to target and potentially disenfranchise Muslims across the country, in clear violation of international human rights standards,"" Bhargava said.

In its 2019 report, the USCIRF had classified India as a ""Tier 2"" country for engaging in or tolerating religious freedom violations that meet at least one of the elements of the ""systematic, ongoing, egregious standard for designations as a country of particular concern"" under the International Religious Freedom Act.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uscirf-condemns-violence-in-new-delhi--calls-for-swift-action-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/uscirf-condemns-violence-in-new-delhi--calls-for-swift-action.html
243,27-2-20,Running marathons may up heart attack risk,"While aerobic exercise generally benefits health, extreme endurance exercise -- like marathon and triathlon -- can raise a person's risk for sudden cardiac arrest and atrial fribrillation, according to a new study.

After reviewing more than 300 scientific studies, the research team found that physically active people, such as regular walkers, have up to a 50 per cent lower risk of heart attack and sudden cardiac death.

However, the team also identified potential risks with intense exercise training, according to the study published in the journal Circulation.

""Exercise is medicine, and there is no question that moderate to vigorous physical activity is beneficial to overall cardiovascular health. However, like medicine, it is possible to underdose and overdose on exercise -- more is not always better and can lead to cardiac events, particularly when performed by inactive, unfit individuals with known or undiagnosed heart disease,"" said Barry A Franklin, Professor at Oakland University in the US.

""More people are running marathons, participating in triathlons and doing high-intensity interval training. The purpose of this statement is to put the benefits and risks of these vigorous exercise programmes in perspective,"" Franklin added.

The research group also reviewed a small study that concluded that the risk of sudden cardiac death or heart attack is low among people participating in high-intensity exercise such as marathons and triathlons.

However, over time, the risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death among male marathon participants has risen, suggesting that these events are attracting higher risk participants (those who may have an underlying or undiagnosed cardiovascular condition such as heart rhythm abnormalities or a prior heart attack).

For women, who comprised only 15 per cent of the study's population, the occurrence of sudden cardiac death was 3.5 fold less than in men.

Among participants in triathlons, almost 40 per cent of cardiac events occurred in first-time participants, indicating that inadequate training or underlying heart problems may be involved.

The research team also found that half of cardiac events occur in the last mile of a marathon or half-marathon, so maintaining a steady pace rather than sprinting is advised.

The risk of cardiac events is greater at high altitudes, but can be decreased by spending at least one day acclimating to the elevation prior to strenuous activity, the study said.

For people who want to become more active, the researchers suggested that most people can start a light programme of exercise and build up slowly to a moderate to vigorous exercise regimen.

The death toll in the violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in areas in northeast Delhi increased to 34 on Thursday, and over 200 people are injured.

""BJP is responsible for the riots. It's their Gujarat model, which is nothing but spreading hatred,"" Yadav said when asked about the violence in Delhi.

""When the US President was here and lakhs of policemen were deployed, how can a riot happen? Had the government and police wanted, the riots could not have happened. It's their failure that they even could not control riots in Delhi,"" he said.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister attacked the BJP, saying they do politics ""by threatening and spreading hatred"" and divide society and play the Hindu-Muslim card.

""They are damaging brotherhood to divert attention. When there is a riot no will ask about roads, development, employment, investment and black money"", Yadav said

248,27-2-20,TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu taken into preventive custody at Visakhapatnam airport amid protests by YSRC,"Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu was on Thursday taken into preventive custody at the airport here for his 'safety' as the ruling YSR Congress workers staged a protest opposing his visit, police said.

Tension prevailed near the airport with the TDP workers repulsing the YSRC activists who tried to block Naidu's convoy.

A notice under Section 151 CrPC was served on Naidu and he was taken into preventive custody ""because of his safety and security"", Visakhapatnam city Commissioner of Police Rajiv Kumar Meena told PTI.

The Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly was sent back into the VIP lounge inside the airport here.

""He has cooperated with us and agreed to go to the VIP lounge at the airport. Though we initially tried to allow him to go ahead with his planned programme, there were too many numberof protestors and so we decided to take him into preventive custody for his safety,"" Meena said.

The TDP chief arrived here on Thursday afternoon from Vijayawada en route to Vizianagaram as part of his state-wide Praja Chaitanya yatra.

He was supposed to visit Gopalapatnam and other areas near Visakhapatnam but the YSRC organised a protest opposing his visit.

Calling him ""Uttarandhra Drohi"" (deceiver of north- coastal Andhra), the ruling party members tried to block the former chief minister's convoy at the airport and squatted on the road.

The TDP workers sought to counter their YSRC counterparts, leading to tension in the area.

The Police Commissioner said there were ""no clashes"" between workers of the two parties.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tdp-chief-chandrababu-naidu-taken-into-preventive-custody-at-visakhapatnam-airport-amid-protests-by-ysrc-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/tdp-chief-chandrababu-naidu-taken-into-preventive-custody-at-visakhapatnam-airport-amid-protests-by-ysrc.html

250,27-2-20,Delhi riots toll climbs to 38 as violence ebbs but doesn't subside,"The death toll in Delhi's worst riots in more than three decades climbed to 38 on Thursday as the violence ebbed but did not subside completely and thousands of people began picking up the pieces of their shattered lives and livelihoods.

Four days after communal clashes that began in northeast Delhi over the amended citizenship law and spiralled into bloodshed, arson and looting, the body of a man was found in a drain in Johri Enclave and there were scattered incidents of vehicles and shops being set on fire in Maujpur, Bhajanpura and other areas.

While there was no precise figure for the number of arrests, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Delhi High Court that 48 FIRs were lodged in relation to the violence.

Delhi Police transferred the riots probe to the Crime Branch and formed two Special Investigation Teams.

The GTB Hospital in Dilshad Garden, where many of the 200 injured in the riots that broke out on Monday are being treated and where scores of people lined up outside the mortuary to claim the bodies of their loved ones, recorded five more deaths.

Eleven more deaths were reported on Thursday, taking the total death toll to 38, a senior Delhi Health Department official told PTI.

The opposition Congress took the issue to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Accusing Home Minister Amit Shah of ""abdication of duty"", a Congress delegation led by party chief Sonia Gandhi urged President Ram Nath Kovind to call for his resignation and remind the Centre of its ""raj dharma"".

""The situation is returning to normal. We are here to reassure people that we are with them,"" newly appointed Special Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who visited the affected areas, told reporters.

Battle scarred and desolate with scorched, blackened walls, the ashen remains of vehicles, glass shards and bricks, several fires still burnt in the mostly mixed neighbourhoods of the national capital's northeastern edge.

Shops, pharmacies and other establishments were closed and people stayed indoors unless it was imperative to step out. Several families were seen leaving with whatever they could salvage from their vandalised homes.

As they tried to come to terms with the losses to their shops, workshops and in some cases fruit and vegetable carts, residents recounted the violence of the night before.

In Yamuna Vihar, three to four rioters came around 4 am on Thursday to burn vehicles.

""One of them was holding a bucket in his hand. He started pouring some liquid on three vehicles. One of the cars caught fire. We raised an alarm after which they fled,"" a local told PTI, saying groups of people in the neighbourhood stay up all night to keep watch.

A few kilometres away, a charred board at a private school in Brijpuri read, ""Welcome to a very happy school"".

The 52-year-old Arun Modern Senior Secondary School looks no less than a cemetery, said an official, looking around at the damage which he estimated to be over Rs 70 lakh.

The GTB Hospital also presented a picture of despair with some sobbing uncontrollably and others maintaining a stoic silence with barely held back tears as they waited at the hospital to receive the bodies of those killed in the communal mayhem.

Among those who lost their lives was 22-year-old Ashfaq Hussain, an electrician who got married only 10 days ago and was shot while he was returning home in Gokalpuri after attending to a complaint.

Still trying to wrap his head around what had happened, his relative held up a smiling photograph of his bride Tasneem Fatima.

Relatives of 35-year-old Mudassir Khan from Kardampuri said they have been coming to the mortuary for two days to claim his body.

""Today, we have been waiting here since 8 am and the post-mortem is finally underway,"" said Arbaaz Khan.

Mudassir, who worked in scrap manufacturing unit, was outside his house on Monday when he was attacked by a mob, his family said. He sustained a bullet injury on his head and was declared brought dead by doctors at GTB hospital.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced his government will give Rs 10 lakh to the families of those who lost their lives and those seriously injured will get Rs 2 lakh.

He also said the government will bear the cost of the treatment of those injured in the violence and admitted to private hospitals.

Asked about the alleged involvement of his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in the riots, Kejriwal said, ""If those involved in the riots are found to be from the AAP, give them double punishment.""

Hussain has denied any involvement in the riots or the killing of an Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma whose family accused him of being behind the murder, saying they are ""baseless accusations"".

Police later registered an FIR against Hussain on a complaint by Sharma's father.

Meanwhile, the government hit back at comments on the violence by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and by ""few individuals"" as well as by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

""We have seen comments made by USCIRF, sections of the media and a few individuals regarding recent incidents of violence in Delhi. These are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to be aimed at politicising the issue,"" MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

""The statements which have come out of OIC are factually inaccurate, they are selective, they are misleading. There is an effort on the ground, to restore normalcy, to create confidence,"" Kumar said.

251,27-2-20,Pak PM Imran to visit Qatar ahead of signing of US-Taliban peace deal,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit Qatar on Thursday, just two days prior to the signing of a landmark peace deal between the US and the Taliban in Doha to end more than 18-year-long Afghan war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.

The US is set to sign a peace deal with the Taliban on Saturday provided that a week-long reduction in violence across Afghanistan holds, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a recent statement. The Taliban also released a statement confirming the plan to sign a peace deal that day.

During his day-long visit, Prime Minister Khan will meet Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and the two leaders will discuss matters related to the bilateral ties and regional development, according to an official statement.

""During the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to Qatar, the focus will be on strengthening bilateral cooperation and exchanging views on regional developments,"" the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement.

This would be the second visit of Prime Minister Khan to Qatar after taking office in 2018.

The Emir of Qatar visited Pakistan in June 2019 and the visit resulted in strengthening the bilateral economic collaboration in diverse areas, the statement said.

Qatar has invited Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to attend the peace deal signing ceremony in Doha.

President Donald Trump said on Monday in India that the landmark Afghan peace deal had received ""tremendous support"".

Trump's remarks came after the US and the Afghan Taliban started a seven-day partial truce ahead of the possible peace deal to end more than 18-year-long war.

The longstanding war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Some 2.5 million Afghans are registered as refugees abroad and another two million are displaced within their country.

The agreement struck during talks between the US and the Taliban, if maintained, may secure a peace deal that would lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.

The US currently has less than 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, but military officials would not confirm the exact number.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-pm-imran-to-visit-qatar-ahead-of-signing-of-us-taliban-peace-deal-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/pak-pm-imran-to-visit-qatar-ahead-of-signing-of-us-taliban-peace-deal.html
252,27-2-20,UK govt to unveil post-Brexit trade talks goals,"The UK government is set to publish its strategy for post-Brexit trade talks on Thursday, as it prepares for formal negotiations with the European Union (EU).

The government's strategy will be put online and presented in Parliament, said the BBC in a report.

The UK strategy was agreed on Monday by the EU Exit Strategy (XS) committee, which includes new Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, senior cabinet minister Michael Gove and new Attorney General Suella Braverman.

All members of the committee supported Brexit during the 2016 referendum.

The UK officially left the EU on January 31, but is continuing to abide by many of the bloc's rules while talks on a permanent trading relationship take place.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to get a deal with the EU by the end of the transition period - December 31, 2020 - and has said he was not prepared to extend that deadline.

Negotiations are due to begin in Brussels on March 2.

The UK's team will be led by Johnson's Europe adviser David Frost. The chief negotiator of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Michel Barnier, will head up the EU's delegation.

Both Frost and Johnson have said in recent weeks they want to seek a Canada-style agreement with zero tariffs from the EU, the BBC reported.

Barnier has rejected such a deal, saying the UK is not like Canada, and its geographical proximity would threaten competition between EU states.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-govt-to-unveil-post-brexit-trade-talks-goals-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-govt-to-unveil-post-brexit-trade-talks-goals.html
253,27-2-20,"CAA riots toll rises to 27, NE Delhi tense","Doval visits violence-hit areas, assures people of complete peace

Two days after the clashes in North-east Delhi, which claimed 27 lives, including a Delhi Police Head Constable, the situation remained tense but under control with heavy presence of the security forces in the riots-affected areas.

A few incidents of violence were reported in some other places, including Joharpuri area in northeastern part of Delhi bordering Uttar Pradesh, with shops set ablaze and the body of an IB staffer found in a drain near Maujpur with multiple stab wounds on his body. As police conducted flag marches and security personnel spread out across the northeastern edge of national Capital in a bid to quell the violence raging since Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his first reaction to the event appealed for peace and brotherhood.

More than 200 people have been reported to be injured in riots between the pro and anti-Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) groups, which took place in Maujpur, Gokulpuri, Gautampuri, Jafrabad, Shiv Vihar, Bhajanpura, Seelampur, Kardampuri and Chand Bagh areas in North-east Delhi.

Asserting that it was important that calm was restored at the earliest, Modi wrote on Twitter, “Had an extensive review on the situation prevailing in various parts of Delhi. Police and other agencies are working on the ground to ensure peace and normalcy.”

The task of bringing the situation under control was given to National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. “What has happened has happened. Inshallah, there will be complete peace here,” Doval said as he walked through the mostly mixed neighbourhoods of North-east Delhi and met locals.

On Tuesday, he undertook a late night tour with Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and newly-appointed Special Commissioner (Law and Order) SN Shrivastava.

Shrivastava is believed to have been handpicked by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) after current police chief Patnaik faced flak for failing to curb the spiraling violence against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s visit, sources said.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court scolded the Delhi Police on Wednesday for failing to act professionally and to check incidents of violence in northeast Delhi. The apex court lashed out at the law enforcing agencies for allowing the instigators of violence to get away and said they should act independently as per law without waiting for somebody’s nod.

“If somebody makes an inflammatory remark, police has to take action,” it said.

On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court also directed the Delhi Police to take conscious decision with respect to lodging of First Information Reports (FIR) against alleged hate speeches by three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in connection with the CAA violence and convey by Thursday. The three BJP leaders are — Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma.

On day three of the trouble, the death toll rose from 13 on Tuesday to 24 on Wednesday. “The death toll has risen to 27,” GTB Hospital Medical Superintendent Sunil Kumar said.

Calling the situation in North-east Delhi alarming, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Army should be called in as police is “unable” to establish control.

Shops and schools were closed and many streets deserted with police making announcements that none should venture out of their homes. There was heavy deployment of force in Chand Bagh with security personnel not allowing anyone to come out. The blackened walls of a mazaar in the locality spoke volumes of the violence the day before.

After two days of mobs marauding the streets, looting shops and setting property on fire, there was uneasy quiet in the locality on Wednesday.

However, in Gokulpuri, smoke darkened the skies with rioters setting on fire shops. Their livelihoods lost with their shops looted and their children in a state of panic after witnessing the bloodshed, many people were seen leaving their homes. Among them was a family that promised to be back, but said they did not know when.

“Of the 24 killed since Monday, four were brought to the hospital from the LNJP Hospital,” a senior GTB Hospital official said.

Asked if the victims have been identified, he said, “Many people have been identified, some are yet to be. The gush of injured patients had reduced to a trickle.”

“Patients have several kinds of injuries, including from gunshots, stones and other weapons and many were hurt while jumping from rooftops to escape the rioters,” hospital authorities said.

Holding the Centre and the Delhi Government responsible for the violence -- perhaps the first time since 1984 that the city has seen such scenes of communal mayhem -- Congress president Sonia Gandhi called for the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah.

“The conspiracy was witnessed during Delhi polls and BJP leaders gave hate speeches creating atmosphere of fear and hatred,” she said.

Shah must take responsibility for the violence in Delhi and resign, she said.

The slugfest continued with the BJP, in turn, accusing Gandhi of politicising the violence.

“Violence is ending. Investigation is on to find out the truth and identify culprits... At such a time, attacking Government and politicising violence is dirty politics,” said Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, adding that it also demoralises police.

In a midnight hearing, the Delhi High Court directed police to ensure safe passage to Government hospitals and emergency treatment for those injured in the communal violence erupted in northeast Delhi over the amended citizenship law.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police have arrested 106 people for their alleged involvement in the northeast Delhi violence and registered 18 FIRs.

According to Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the Additional Commissioner of Police, Crime, no untoward incident was reported on Wednesday and PCR calls from northeast Delhi have reduced.

Police also released two helpline numbers -- 011-22829334, 22829335 -- for people to reach out during distress.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/caa-riots-toll-rises-to-27--ne-delhi-tense-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/caa-riots-toll-rises-to-27--ne-delhi-tense.html
254,27-2-20,Kamal Haasan was in control: Production house on 'Indian 2' mishap,"Lyca, the production company backing Kamal Haasan's ""Indian 2"", have said the veteran actor was always in total control, hinting that the veteran actor should accept part of the blame for the recent accident on the set, which claimed three lives.

Last week's accident on the set of ""Indian 2"" that killed three crew members caused a stir in the Tamil film industry for lack of safety measures during the shoot. Soon after the incident, Kamal Haasan wrote a public statement to Lyca questioning the steps taken to ensure the safety of cast and crew members, and questioned if an insurance was taken. He also stated that the film industry, which he has been a part of for decades, is yet to take safety standards seriously.

In a response to the actor, Lyca has now stated that they did the needful and have an insurance policy in place, adding that Kamal Haasan should accept collective responsibility.

Their statement read: ""As you are surely aware, incidents of this nature need to be dealt with in the spirit of collective responsibility and rectification. Given the involvement of an eminent artiste and technician of your calibre and experience, and a veteran director of Mr Shankar's stature being the captain of the ship, we were doubly confident that our own safety measures would have been amplified by your on-the-spot judgement. It hardly needs reminding that the entire shoot was also under the control and supervision of yourself and the director.""

Director of Lyca Productions, Neelkant Narayanpur, who addressed the letter also wrote: ""We were in constant touch with your office all through and arrived at the mortuary just 15 minutes after you. At that very point, Mr Subaskaran announced financial assistance to the tune of Rs 2 crores to the family members of the deceased, and those who suffered injuries and also undertook to take care of their treatment. All these measures were taken before the receipt of your letter, and it is unfortunate that this did not come to your attention before the 22nd of February.""

259,27-2-20,"China coronavirus: Death toll climbs to 2,744 amidst decline in cases","The virulence of the novel coronavirus continues to show a declining trend in China which reported 29 new fatalities, the lowest in weeks, taking the death toll to 2,744 while the confirmed cases climbed to 78,497, officials said on Thursday.

The country's National Health Commission (NHC) said it received reports 433 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection and 29 deaths on Wednesday from 31 provincial-level regions on the mainland.

Among the deaths, 26 were from the epicentre of the virus Hubei province and its capital Wuhan and one each from Beijing, Heilongjiang and Henan, it said.

In Hubei province alone 2,641 people died due to the virus since it erupted in December last year including 2,104 fatalities in Wuhan.

The province, which is under lockdown, reported 409 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, taking the total confirmed cases to 65,596, local health commission said.

Wuhan reported 383 new confirmed cases and 19 new deaths on Wednesday. In total, the city has registered 47,824 confirmed cases.

In all 34,978 people were hospitalised in Hubei province of which 6,581 were still in severe condition and 1,403 others in critical condition.

The commission also said Hubei reported 403 suspected cases, taking the total to 2,019 cases. Capital Beijing reported 10 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 400.

All over China, a total of 2,358 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

A total of 32,495 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery including 23,200 in Hubei province.

By the end of Wednesday, 91 confirmed cases including two deaths had been reported from Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 32 in Taiwan including one death.

Bruce Aylward, an epidemiologist who led an advance team from the World Health Organisation (WHO), told the media in Geneva on Tuesday that China has changed the course of COVID-19 outbreak, noting that the rapidly escalating outbreak has plateaued and come down faster than the previously expected.

Aylward said the unanimous assessment of the 25-member team which conducted a nine-day field study trip to Beijing, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei is that besides adopting a science-driven agile response, China followed a pragmatic approach which is ""technology-powered and science-driven"".

""They are using big data, artificial intelligence (AI) in places,"" Aylward said, adding that China has managed massive amounts of data in finding each COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts.

However, President Xi Jinping, who presided over a high power meeting on Wednesday said while the positive trend in preventing and controlling the epidemic is expanding and economic and social development is rapidly recovering, the situation in Hubei and Wuhan remains ""complex and grim as the risk of a rebound of the epidemic in other regions cannot be overlooked"".

Xi said at this moment it is important to make unremitting epidemic containment efforts and accelerate all aspects of work in economic and social development.

He told the ruling Communist Party committees and governments at all levels to accurately grasp the epidemic as well as economic and social development situations to ensure winning the people's war against the epidemic and achieving the goals of building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects and poverty alleviation, Xinhua reported.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-coronavirus--death-toll-climbs-to-2-744-amidst-decline-in-cases-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-coronavirus--death-toll-climbs-to-2-744-amidst-decline-in-cases.html
260,27-2-20,"Malaysian king summons Mahathir, who's trying to be PM again","Malaysia's king summoned Mahathir Mohamad to the palace Thursday, fueling talks he may have majority support to return as the next prime minister after his abrupt resignation and the collapse of his ruling coalition this week.

Mahathir didn't speak to reporters as he was driven into the palace grounds. The meeting came after the king interviewed lawmakers to determine who they support as prime minister and if they want fresh elections.

A comeback as prime minister for a third time will be a remarkable feat for Mahathir, the world's oldest leader at 94, after nail-biting twists, turns and machinations in the political drama that unraveled over the weekend.

A failed bid by Mahathir's supporters to form a new government without his named successor Anwar Ibrahim plunged the country into a political limbo.

A total of 37 lawmakers, led by Mahathir's Bersatu party, left the ruling alliance, depriving it of majority support and sparking a crisis less than two years after it ousted a corrupt-tainted coalition that had ruled for 61 years.

The king dissolved the Cabinet but reappointed Mahathir as interim leader. The result was a renewed battle between Mahathir and Anwar, whose political feud has stretched more than two decades. Mahathir said Wednesday he had quit to show he wasn't power crazy and because he doesn't want to work with the former corrupt regime that he had ousted in 2018 polls.

Despite a preelection pact to handover power to Anwar, he said Parliament should pick the next leader and that he would form a nonpartisan government if he is chosen again to helm the government.

“I just want to do what is best for the country. … I believe, rightly or wrongly, politics and political parties must be set aside for now. If allowed, I will form an administration that does not side with any party. Only national interest will be prioritized,"" Mahathir said in a televised message.

His unity government plan was rejected by Anwar's camp, which said it would only create a “Mahathir government” that is not accountable to the people and unsustainable.

Anwar said lawmakers from the three remaining parties in his alliance have nominated him as the prime minister after Mahathir rejected their offer to restore their former government.

He has said they will wait for the king's decision. His camp still controls 41% of parliamentary seats but could be the largest bloc after two key Malay opposition parties withdrew their support for Mahathir.

Anwar was Mahathir's deputy during Mahathir's first stint in office in the 1990s, but he was sacked following a power struggle and later jailed on sodomy and corruption charges that he said were trumped up.

Anwar led a reform movement that helped built a fledgling opposition but was jailed a second time for sodomy in 2014 in a move he said was aimed at killing his political career.

Mahathir, who retired in 2003 after 22 years in power, made a comeback in 2016 spurred by anger over a massive graft scandal involving a state investment fund. Mahathir and Anwar reconciled and forged an alliance that won a historic vote in 2018 that ushered in the first change of government since independence from Britain in 1957.

But their relationship remained uneasy as Mahathir refused to set a time frame to hand over power to Anwar.

261,27-2-20,Trump faces credibility test as he plays down virus threat,"President Donald Trump faces a critical personal challenge in grappling with the new coronavirus outbreak: Asking Americans to believe him after he and some of his top advisers have contradicted federal scientists in playing down the threat.

Keenly aware of the stakes not just for public health but also his credibility, Trump conducted a lengthy press conference Wednesday evening aimed at reassuring everyone that he has the crisis well in hand.

Trump surrounded himself with his administration's top health experts. And he encouraged Americans to be prepared for the virus' potential spread.

But he continued to minimize the risk, saying the outbreak “may get a little bigger; it may not get bigger at all.” And he continued to distance himself from the stated opinion of public health officials that it's inevitable the virus will spread within the United States.

As businesses, schools and people in general think about preparing, the X-factor may be an unpredictable president who has clashed repeatedly with scientists in his own administration and tends to see any crisis through the lens of his own reelection chances.

“I don't think it's inevitable,” Trump said at the news conference, where he announced Vice President Mike Pence would lead the administration's response to the outbreak.

“I think it has a chance that it could get worse. There is a chance you can get fairly substantially worse. But nothing's inevitable.” He also said he had recently learned that thousands die from the flu each year, contrasting that to the coronavirus.

After two days of the stock market tumbling, Trump took to Twitter Wednesday morning to blame the media and Democrats for causing undue alarm and harming American financial markets.

He singled out MSNBC and CNN for “doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible,” and added that ”incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action.”

He blamed part of this week's stock market slide on people's reaction to Tuesday night's Democratic debate and the possibility one of those candidates might replace him.

And Trump acknowledged that the outbreak could “have an impact on GDP” but insisted that the US economy is still “doing great.”

The setting for Trump's evening press conference — the White House press briefing room — was meant to offer a sense of calm and assurance by the president.

It was only the second time in his presidency that Trump had spoken from the podium in that room, and aides acknowledged he was trying to underscore that he has the situation under control and understands the gravity.

In advance, Trump played down the mortality rate for a pathogen that has been confirmed to have killed 2,700 people globally. His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, echoed Trump's outlook, saying Tuesday that the US had “contained” the threat of a domestic outbreak.

Trump's and Kudlow's comments were at odds with warnings from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials who said American communities need to prepare now for when the disease starts spreading domestically. So far, there have been just 60 confirmed cases in the U.S.

“The messaging by the White House is unhelpful,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “What the White House is doing is conveying a sense of overconfidence. ... Of course, we do want to maintain calm with the public, but it flies in the face of facts."" Trump's public efforts to project calm masked a behind-the-scenes focus.

During his 36-hour visit to India, Trump received briefings from staff and periodically checked the impact on Wall Street, tweeting at all hours to try to reassure Americans and the markets about the spread of the virus.

Trump expressed deep concern to aides about the effect on the markets, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing.

Trump has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than any of his recent predecessors and has made a strong economy his No. 1 argument for reelection.

As the media coverage of the virus has increased, Trump has grown concerned that even fears of an outbreak would stagger Wall Street, leading him to wonder aloud if Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was the right person to lead the administration's response, the officials said.

Since the start of the crisis, Trump has been reluctant to blame China, where the virus originated, for fear of upsetting President Xi Jinping or damaging ongoing trade talks.

But he is also fearful he could be accused of being unresponsive to the crisis.

At the urging of a number of his internal and outside advisers, he directed the White House to adopt a more public presence, leading to a briefing by officials and emails to the press stressing the administration's response.

“Americans want to see their president taking charge and showing leadership, and that is exactly what President Trump is doing,"" said Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany.

Privately, aides said concerns have spiked in recent days inside the Trump reelection campaign. Republicans close to the White House are keenly aware of the political implications of a pandemic scare.

In 2014, the GOP aggressively criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola epidemic, which it later credited with helping the party seize back the majority in the Senate.

The most pressing concern, aides said, is not the possibility of widespread outbreak in the U.S. — Trump's aides do believe existing monitoring and restrictions are working — but the downstream effects of the virus on the global economy and public sentiment.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-faces-credibility-test-as-he-plays-down-virus-threat-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-faces-credibility-test-as-he-plays-down-virus-threat.html
262,27-2-20,Apple's iPhone XR dominated 2019 smartphone market,"Omdia's Smartphone Model Market Tracker report has claimed that Apple's iPhone XR dominated the global smartphone market in 2019.

Apple shipped an estimated 46.3 million iPhone XR units across 2019, while the iPhone 11, the new Apple mid-ranger, managed 37.3 million shipments in 2019.

""Apple has consistently owned the first and second positions in the global smartphone model shipment ranking, with the company maintaining this dominant position for more than five years running,"" Jusy Hong, smartphone research and analysis director at Omdia said in a statement.

""By limiting the number of models it offers compared to its top competitors, Apple has been able to concentrate its sales on a few smartphones that have broad appeal, like the iPhone XR,"" Hong added.

While Apple accounted for first place and second place, Samsung rounded out the top 5 with the Galaxy A10, Galaxy A50 and Galaxy A20 attaining shipments of 30.3 million, 24.2 million and 23.1 million units respectively.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max was the sixth most popular smartphone with 17.6 million shipments, followed by the iPhone 8 at 17.4 million.

263,27-2-20,Britney Spears shares video of her breaking her foot,"Singer Britney Spears has just put out a video that captured the exact moment when she broke her foot.

She took to Instagram to share the clip, in what seemed to be a studio. The ""Baby One More Time"" hitmaker rocked in an yellow sports bra and a pair of black shorts. She danced to the beat, jumped around, and did multiple spins as well as some hair flipping.

Near the end of the video, however, a crack sound could be heard echoing in the studio, and the singer fell to the floor holding her foot, reports aceshowbiz.com.

Introducing the video, the singer captioned: ""I haven't danced in six months so I was full throttle at this spot!!!! And yes …. I know I'm barefoot …. don't laugh but I grip the floor better that way !!!!"" She added, ""PS you can hear where I broke my foot here ….. sorry it's kind of loud !!!!!""

Spears posted the Instagram footage a little over one week after she was spotted sporting a medical boot while visiting a tanning salon in Los Angeles.

265,27-2-20,"Vexed by how to contain virus, countries take tough steps","Saudi Arabia cut travel to Islam's holiest sites, South Korea toughened penalties for those breaking quarantines and airports across Latin America looked for signs of sick passengers on Thursday as a new virus troubled a mushrooming swath of the globe.

With the illness pushing its way into a sixth continent and the number of sick and dead rising, the crisis gave way to political and diplomatic rows, concern that bordered on panic in some quarters, and a sense that no part of the world was immune to the disease's spread.

""Viruses don't know borders and they don't stop at them,"" said Roberto Speranza, the health minister in Italy, where northern towns were on army-guarded lockdowns and supermarket shelves were bare.

Schools throughout Japan were being closed for weeks to try to stop new transmissions.

As growing parts of Europe and the Middle East saw infections and a first case was found in South America, air routes were halted and border control toughened. But for an illness transmitted so easily, with its tentacles reaching into so many parts of the world, leaders puzzled over how to keep the virus from proliferating seemed willing to try anything to keep their people — and economies — safe.

In South Korea, the hardest-hit country outside China, four Busan markets known for colourful silks and a dizzying array of other wares were shuttered while the country's military sent hundreds of its doctors and soldiers to aid in treatment and quarantines.

In Iran, the front line of Mideast infections, officials loosened rules barring the import of many foreign-made items to allow in sanitisers, face masks and other necessities, and removed overhead handles on Tehran's subways to eliminate another source of germs.

Peru put specialists on round-the-clock shifts at its biggest airport, Argentina took the temperature of some new arrivals and El Salvador added bans for travellers from Italy and South Korea.

The holy city of Mecca, which able-bodied Muslims are called to visit at least once in their lives, and the Prophet Muhammad's mosque in Medina were cut off to potentially millions of pilgrims, with Saudi Arabia making the extraordinary decision to stop the spread of the virus.

With the monarchy offering no firm date for the lifting of the restrictions, it posed the possibility of affecting those planning to make their hajj, a ritual beginning at the end of July this year.

""We ask God Almighty to spare all humanity from all harm,"" the country said in announcing the decision.

Disease has been a constant concern surrounding the hajj, with cholera outbreaks in the 19th century killing tens of thousands making the trip. More recently, another coronavirus that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, prompted increased public health measures, but no outbreak resulted.

COVID-19's westward creep — including a case in California in the United States that does not appear linked to overseas travel — had some countries warning their people to obey measures intended to keep a single case from blossoming into a cluster that could paralyse a community.

A man originally from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the global outbreak, who contracted the virus was charged alongside his wife in Singapore for allegedly lying about their whereabouts as officials tried to stem further infections.

In Colombia, which has yet to report any cases, officials reminded residents they could be jailed for up to eight years if they violate containment measures. And in South Korea, the National Assembly passed a law strengthening the punishment for those violating self-isolation, more than tripling the fine and adding the possibility of a year in prison.

""It came later than it should have,"" said Lee Hae-shik, spokesman for the ruling Democratic Party, calling for further non-partisan cooperation to address the outbreak.

Countries' efforts to contain the virus opened up diplomatic scuffles. South Korea fought prohibitions keeping its citizens out of 40 countries, calling them excessive and unnecessary. China warned Russia to stop discriminatory measures against its people, including monitoring on public transit.

Iran used the crisis to rail against the US, which it accused of “a conspiracy” that was sowing fear.

The global count of those sickened by the virus hovered around 81,000, with 433 new cases reported Thursday in China and another 505 in South Korea, where the military called off joint drills planned with American troops.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vexed-by-how-to-contain-virus--countries-take-tough-steps-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/vexed-by-how-to-contain-virus--countries-take-tough-steps.html

Rahman has turned writer-producer with the film ""99 Songs"".

""I feel like I have been reborn since the time I decided to turn a producer. It's an entirely new feeling,"" Rahman said.

Opening up about the challenges of making a film, he said: ""It's like being born again as a new man. When I started as a film music composer, I already had ten years of experience. But as a producer, it felt so new and seemed like I was starting all over again and I wanted to leave no stone unturned in giving it my best. Also, since I was working with other debutants – the director and the actor - I was reminded that I have a completely new team and we had a modest budget. I didn't want to spare any effort in presenting it well and try to make our own epic.""

Asked if he was a regular on sets during the shoot, he said: ""I knew that if some important scenes needed to be expanded, I ensured I would be present on set. Our executive producer would tell me that we have time constraints and will have to wrap the scene in a day while I was keen on four because those are the scenes that need love and complete justice. It's an art to balance between creative and commercial. However, if you get too creative then you may have to sell your property.""

""It is a first attempt and I hope we have done our best. My wife and daughters have been a great support,"" he added.

The movie is directed by debutant director Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy and will release in three languages, including Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ""99 Songs"" will also introduce Ehan Bhat.

267,27-2-20,Microsoft to miss sales forecast due to COVID-19 outbreak,"After Apple, Microsoft has revised its revenue guidelines for its January-March quarter owing to Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, saying the supply-chain has been slowed down which will impact its Windows and Surface businesses.

In a statement, the company said although it sees strong Windows demand in line with its expectations, ""the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call"".

""As a result, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated. All other components of our Q3 guidance remain unchanged, the company said late Wednesday.

On January 29, Microsoft issued quarterly revenue guidance for its 'More Personal Computing' segment between $10.75 and $11.15 billion, which included a wider than usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.

""As the conditions evolve, Microsoft will act to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners during this difficult period,"" said the company, adding that it would continue to partner with local and global health authorities to provide additional assistance.

In its second quarter (October-December period), Microsoft reported revenue of $36.9 billion and a profit of $11.6 billion. Surface revenue for the quarter was up 6 per cent (year over year) to $1.9 billion.

Apple last week warned that coronavirus outbreak will affect its business in the January-March quarter as worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained.

""Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors,"" the company said in a statement.

Apple's exclusive online store is expected to start functioning in the third quarter this year. The Cupertino-based tech giant is currently selling its devices in India via third-party offline retailers and e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.in.

Welcoming the government's decision to ease the 30 per cent local sourcing norm in single-brand retail (SBRT), Apple said last year: ""We appreciate the support and hard work by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team to make this possible and we look forward to one day welcoming customers to India's first Apple retail store.""

According to Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India, Apple is known for its retail stores, the experience they provide in terms of purchase, staff knowledge and other services.

""Considering the importance of offline as a channel in a diverse country like India, where consumers love to touch, feel and experience the products, the stores are a very important touch-point for any consumer company,"" Singh told IANS.

The plan for opening owned stores will certainly help Apple in giving a controlled experience of its devices and services as it intends and designed them to be.

""In a third-party retail environment, many such things cannot be controlled by the brand. This will only add to the strong premium positioning Apple enjoys in the country,"" Singh added.

Apple reached a record 75.6 per cent market share in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India owing to the stellar performance of iPhone 11 and price drop on previous generation models.

According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), in the premium ($500 or Rs 36,000 and above) segment, Apple reached a record 75.6 per cent market share.

Apple registered double-digit growth in India for iPhones in the holiday quarter (October-December period), Cook announced in January. Apple also registered a good growth in wearables in India.

The iPad 2018 model also helped Apple register strong growth in India in 2019.

Going forward, thrust on manufacturing high-end iPhones locally along with the first-ever flagship retail store would give Apple a booster in the price-sensitive smartphone market in 2020, according to industry experts.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/apple-to-open-1st-india-flagship-store-in-2021--tim-cook-2020-02-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/apple-to-open-1st-india-flagship-store-in-2021--tim-cook.html
