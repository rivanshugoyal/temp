0,26-3-20,Tibet gets back to work,"It’s perplexing that when China is still in lockdown, work has resumed on infrastructure projects in Tibet. India must watch these developments carefully and take necessary measures

A Tibetan man became the first victim of Coronavirus but not in Tibet but in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. According to The Tibet Sun, Tenzin Choephel, a 69-year-old man from McLeod Ganj (where the Dalai Lama lives), died of Coronavirus after returning from a trip to the US on March 15. It said, “After staying in Delhi for a few days, Choephel returned to McLeod Ganj by a taxi on March 21. On the morning of March 23, he complained of respiratory problems. He was then taken to the Tanda Government hospital where he died.” Meanwhile, in Tibet, the situation is surprisingly “normal.”

Contrary to other provinces in China, the mountainous region had only one infected patient of the Novel Coronavirus. The patient was a 34-year-old man, who came from the city of Suizhou, the hardest-hit province amid the ongoing outbreak. He was discharged from hospital on February 12. Xinhua reported, “He travelled from the city of Wuhan to Lhasa by train from January 22 to 24. On the evening of January 25, he developed symptoms of cough and fever and was hospitalised.” He was confirmed to be positive on January 29 and after an 18-day treatment he was let out.

It’s difficult to say if this is propaganda or truth. Nevertheless, the high plateau appears to have been less affected than the rest of the Middle Kingdom. If facts are correct, scientists will have to undertake a detailed study of the Tibetan case when the outbreak of the virus recedes.

One reason why Tibet managed to keep cases low is because the authorities over there used Tibetan medicine extensively to fight the disease. For example, when the Tibetan-inhabited area in north-west China’s Qinghai province reported 18 confirmed cases of the infection last month, 17 of them received a treatment involving Tibetan medicine (TM) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the two independent traditional medical systems.

Huang Licheng, an official with the provincial Health Commission, was quoted by Xinhua as saying, “The Tibetan medicine played an active role in the treatment.” He further said, “The provincial hospital of Tibetan medicine produced a batch of anti-virus medications featuring Tibetan medicine; 1,000 of them have already been sent to the front lines in Hubei Province, the centre of the virus outbreak.”

This aspect, too, needs to be analysed. At the same time, these harrowing times have shown Beijing’s priorities in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), the first region in China to restart normal activities and that, too, on a war-footing. Guess what started first? Infrastructure projects close to the border with India.

On February 20, China Tibet Online asserted: “Work continues on infrastructure projects in Tibet.” It gave the example of the 11.5-km long Mainling tunnel on the Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway. It is located just north of Arunachal Pradesh: “It (Lhasa-Nyingchi Railway) currently has the most complicated geological conditions and is the most difficult project in China’s construction of a railway on the plateau,” noted the website.

The Mainling tunnel is scheduled to be completed by the end of March: “In order to ensure constructing process, currently, the construction workers are digging the last 60m of the tunnel. About 1,881 workers in Tibet are doing their best to construct the Lhasa-Nyingchi railway. With a designed speed of 160 km/h, it will be the first electrified railway in Tibet.”

But why so much hurry at a time when the rest of China is still under clampdown? Beijing has already invested $3.9 billion in this project and the railway line will be operational by next year. “Workers have completed 44 tunnels out of 47 and 119 bridges out of 120 along the route.”

Yet another development that should worry India is the Dagu Hydropower Station (HPS) project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra in Assam). Located in Sangri County in Lhoka, the Dagu HPS has a capacity of 660 MW. Two billion dollars have already been invested: “It is a major project supported by the Central Government for Tibet’s economic and social development.” The dam is one of the three cascade dams under construction not far from the Indian border.

It is said that even during the Spring Festival, more than 300 workers remained on duty near the site. Later, they were said to “have successfully returned to construction. The construction site in the valley is busy; a large hydropower station is beginning to take shape.”

Another project is in Sakya county, near Shigatse, the second largest town in Tibet. A mega water project restarted around February 20, a few days before Losar, the sacred Tibetan New Year. “With the biggest investment ever in Tibet’s water project history, the project will help with irrigation, supply water, generate power and prevent flooding,” explained a Chinese website. It further said, “Tibet has arranged 179 projects for this year…Work has resumed on some of these projects.”

On March 3, charter flights were being arranged to bring workers back from the Mainland to Tibet “to resume the construction of major projects in the region.” Tibet Online, another official website of China, mentioned that on that day, TV6031 flight operated by Tibet Airlines landed at the airport of Nyingchi City. It said, “The 105 power workers onboard, from Zhejiang Province, will be assigned to the power grid projects in the region’s most impoverished areas.” Other such charter flights landed in Lhasa, Shigatse and Chamdo.

Quoting a Tibetan power company, China Tibet News said on February 29 that more than 2,800 workers had resumed the construction of 338 projects, accounting for 75 per cent of the total. It included the Ngari Power Grid Interconnection Project, not far from the Uttarakhand and Ladakh border.

The resumption of construction projects at a time when the rest of China was under lockdown is perplexing. Why this frenzy? It’s difficult to answer. A few weeks ago, an intrusion by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was reported in Naku-la, south of the watershed in northern Sikkim, an area supposed to be a “settled” undisputed area. This was not a good sign.

With the “victory” of Wuhan, triumphantly announced by the Chinese propaganda, the PLA, which played a decisive role, is bound to come out reinforced from the crisis. Can Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is in an extremely weak position today both internally and externally (despite the disinformation war going on a full swing), keep his control over the PLA in the months to come?

Only time will tell. But the speed at which it has resumed the construction of infrastructure projects in Tibet is certainly ominous. A Chinese website published a photo feature. Its caption read: “Multiple rocket launch systems attached to an artillery brigade under the PLA Xizang Military Command fire anti-aircraft rockets simultaneously during a live-fire operation at the elevation of 4,500 metres in Southwest China’s Xizang Autonomous Region on March 11, 2020.”

China will argue that it is only a routine exercise but India needs to watch carefully and take necessary measures to be ready for a new outbreak à la Doklam.

1,26-3-20,Total lockdown,"It may have come a bit late but only operational efficiencies will prove if we can win this battle against COVID-19

Maybe it came a little too late in the day, considering it was the world’s biggest social experiment with war-time precision and a huge gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but India is now in a three-week nationwide lockdown to save its 1.3 billion people. A sombre-looking Modi announced a total lockdown as the days ahead were “crucial to break the cycle of transmission” of COVID-19. Many experts have suggested that a tidal wave of the quickly invasive virus was coming but this protocol would halt it in its tracks and limit the spread by a high percentage. Hopefully enough so as not to overwhelm our frail health infrastructure, which, by the PM’s own admission, was nothing comparable to the West. Hence, using the magnetism of his persona, he made an emphatic and convincing plea to not cross the lakshman rekha of our homes. Modi also allocated about $2 billion for additional healthcare measures. Though, it is by far the most far-reaching decision undertaken by any Government in the world, it is still too little. With testing still low, India should have placed itself under lockdown in February itself when it became apparent that the Coronavirus was spreading like wildfire and that people were not taking the self-reporting, quarantine or other compliances too seriously. The Government is just beginning to ramp up testing facilities and the number of quarantine centres. This should have been done on a war footing right from the beginning. We could have taken a page from Kerala’s playbook which has had experience in fighting the Nipah virus and had done a tremendous job of detecting, tracking and quarantining patients and their contacts. Now, we have reached a crisis point and we are firefighting because till now, we were on a path where cases doubled every six days. However, this week’s spike in cases means the country is now veering towards the Italy and US scenario, where cases are doubling every three days. If that happens, our hospitals will be overwhelmed by the end of May or even sooner considering that the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in India is only 0.7, compared to 11.5 in South Korea. Further, some States will reach the point where they don’t have enough hospital beds to treat critical Covid-19 patients much sooner than others, notably Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. Plus, we have an acute shortage of medical professionals in rural areas. We may have achieved the WHO-recommended ratio of 1 doctor per 1,000 patients but estimates from studies indicate that there are about four times as many allopathic doctors per 10,000 people in urban areas as compared to the rural areas. So given that over 70 per cent of our population is rural, how will we effectively cope with a contagion that no one knows much about and which springs new surprises almost on a daily basis?

The fact remains that the Centre was either overconfident or did not take it too seriously. That the latter seems to be the case can be gauged from the fact that a Congress leader critiqued the Government’s response to the outbreak in February. When he said that the Centre assuring the nation that the virus was under control was akin to the “captain of the Titanic telling his passengers not to panic as his ship was unsinkable,” the Health Minister had countered robustly, saying that it was not the time for comparisons. We were misled by WHO, too, which is now extremely worried. Lessons learnt? We simply should not reference ourselves against any estimates and rely on our own resources and research expertise. We should finally prioritise a budget for health as a key and not just a social sector. And for all the heroism of ensuring a civil lockdown, we must ensure operational efficiencies first. Or food riots could be a subsidiary crisis.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/total-lockdown-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/total-lockdown.html
2,26-3-20,Virus of racism,"We are downright bankrupt as humans if we ostracise those who are manning our frontline relief and healing efforts

They say a crisis brings out the best and worst in us. And the worst is easier to become simply because in a rudderless and hopeless scenario, such as that brought about by COVID-19, everybody is desperate to lay the blame at somebody’s door. But when it impacts altruistic people, who risk their lives and everything else, to save us, then it is a defeat of all the surge of humanity that we may claim the crisis has drawn out of each of us. Therefore, it is utterly incomprehensible and condemnable that doctors and frontline healthcare staff, who are braving risks and attending to COVID-19 cases, are being ostracised in their communities. It represents a moral bankruptcy that we thought Indians were never capable of. Or that pilots and cabin crew of rescue flight missions are being treated like untouchables when they get back home. What everyone forgets is that hundreds of families wouldn’t have got back their members had these saviours not stepped out of their selfish concerns. That they had a choice to refuse but chose to accept a challenge. What was absolutely uncouth was the hate mail sent to the family of a deceased patient in Maharashtra, as if they had invited the virus home. Troublingly, this has sparked off a new wave of resentment against the Chinese in general and “Chinese-looking” people from the North-east and a total condemnation of their food choices. Did anybody ask fruit-lovers what went wrong when the Nipah virus came from mangoes chewed upon by bats? The worst name-calling and racist-tagging happened with singer Meiyang Chang, who was called “Corona” while out on a jog before the lockdown, and had to clarify that he was Indian, though of Chinese descent. Part of this stereotyping has been done by the Western world for quite some time. US President Donald Trump, who has made a virtue of political incorrectness, legitimised the label of “Chinese virus,” setting off a diplomatic pow-wow with China. In fact, given that the geographic origins of most viruses, be it of bird and swine flu, have been Asia, it has become fairly normative to club all viruses as “Asian.” UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet may have called on member-states to stop discrimination triggered by the virus but in multi-cultural US, too, intolerance has reached manic levels of absurdity. People have been spraying air-fresheners and disinfectant cans on people of Asian origin, never mind that they are bonafide US citizens. A Vietnamese art curator was dropped by an exhibitor at a UK art fair who claimed her participation would be seen as “carrying the virus.”

We live in a globalised world, where people and societies are constantly colliding and merging with each other, travelling everywhere and, therefore, will always be at a risk of exposing themselves to every kind of contagion, biological, social and economic. It is not that the Chinese set out on a nihilistic mission to destroy the world and dominate crumbling economies, risking the huge loss of lives of their own. Or anybody else’s for that matter. The West, though multi-cultural, has often found a scapegoat for its ills in “otherising” the so-called Brown races. Post-Corona, there is a real danger of insularity dictating the course of protectionist politics already at play. But what of Indians turing on fellow Indians? Soon, we might all become vectors. Does that mean we abandon each other? This crisis will only be won by the united spirit to heal, not training guns at each other.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-of-racism-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/virus-of-racism.html
3,26-3-20,Is India a gardening State?,"The CAA, by choosing some and excluding the other has performed the role of ‘gardening’ within the contours of Indian citizenship

Home Minister Amit Shah assured the Upper House that no existing citizen will be tagged “D” or doubtful during the course of collection of information under the National Population Register (NPR). The provisions of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 allow for marking a doubtful citizen, verification of documents and even striking off someone’s name from the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), if found doubtful by officials vested with discretionary powers at local, State and national levels. Though Shah has also assured that no such verification on the data provided will be undertaken, yet letters of law create some confusion in the larger public. In almost a similar vein, the Union Government kept assuring the country’s Muslim minority populace that no one would lose their citizenship under the newly-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The fact that such assurances have to be given demonstrates the anomalies and inconsistencies of such laws like the NPR-NRC-CAA. While Shah assured a certain application of mind, it leaves wide open the discretionary powers granted in laws pertaining to the NPR-NRC-CAA.

In a recent article countering the critics of CAA, noted legal luminary Harish Salve argued that with the passage of CAA, Muslim illegal immigrants remain liable to be deported to their country of origin. Salve argued that the criterion of “intelligible differentia” makes CAA rational as it includes only the “six” religiously-persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. This is how CAA, according to Salve, fulfils its objective of granting citizenship to those religiously-persecuted refugees who are forced to come to India, leaving behind their homes. In effect, the CAA draws a line between those who are to be naturalised and those who are liable to be deported. It opens up Indian citizenship to a rationally-classified set of people, while it closes it to a set of people who do not fit into this classification. Salve emphasised on this methodological distinction that CAA draws and justified it on heuristic grounds of profiling the “illegal immigrants” on the basis of their religious identity.

What connects Shah’s commitment of non-victimisation in the NPR and Salve’s justification of the deployment of “intelligible differentia” in the CAA is the common idea of taking the next step without stopping to think about what is going to be the next course of action in case anyone is affected. Salve does not deny the fact that Muslim illegal immigrants remain liable to be deported as CAA would not include them. Many commentators including Mukul Kesavan pointed out that the criterion of differentiation that CAA uses is not self-consistent, as it excluded worst religious persecuted such as Ahmadiyyas, Shiyas, Rohingiyas, Tamils and Tibetan Buddhists from its purview. Further, as per Kesavan, within the intelligible criterion, CAA creates a sub-class of only three neighbouring countries and then a further sub-class of “select” religiously-persecuted minorities.

Salve’s advocacy misses the forest for the trees and trees for the forest. It misses the general point of India’s commitment to those who come to it due to fear of civil or any other kind of disturbances, as stated in Section 19 (4) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947. Premised on such a consequential follow-up of India’s independence, the Nehru-Liaquat pact guaranteed settlement of the displaced minority in their respective country of choice until the last day of 1950. Recognition of “minority rights” irrespective of religion has been the very bane of this early legislation and bilateral pact. The same spirit is reflected in the Immigrants’ (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950, that excluded any person displaced due to fear of civil disturbances from the definition of “illegal immigrant.” Subsequently with the passage of the Citizenship Act, 1955, Section 5 and 6 of the Act provided for naturalisation of immigrants from erstwhile territories of undivided India. Therefore, it is argued that the CAA does not do anything extra that cannot be taken care of by the existing Citizenship Act, 1955, with respect to any class of immigrants. Or rather, the classification and sub-classes drawn up with the CAA can all be given due coverage and even their citizenship could be fast-tracked, depending on the urgency. A case in point is singer Adnan Sami’s citizenship did not require CAA, or many other cases of erstwhile Pakistani or Bangladeshi citizens naturalised by due process prescribed under the Citizenship Act, 1955.

As CAA does not serve any special purpose except naming some religious groups as persecuted and eligible to apply for Indian citizenship, it is intriguing to note that Salve justifies it on the ground that demographic distortions caused by Bangladeshi immigrants could be restored by it. This, to state the obvious, links CAA with a procedure of determination of citizenship by NRIC and NPR that can create a sub-class of doubtful citizens by suspending their nationality and by treating them as a class of illegals. Indeed most critics of CAA are worried about this plight of being subjected to undue suspicion on a section of Indian citizens as Bangladeshis, based on ethno-racial profiling and dual filtering through NPR-NRC. The affidavit submitted by the Centre in the Supreme Court in the cases filed against CAA makes it further clear that the power of exclusion of immigrants arises from “sovereign” power of the Indian State by which it is entitled to have its own immigration policy. This power of exclusion of certain class of immigrants in CAA, as per the affidavit, is the domain of the Parliament, in terms of its direct linkages with the State security and foreign policy. The affidavit further states that neither such matters of national security and immigration policy can wholly be subjected to judicial review, nor could these matters be interpreted even within the ambit of fundamental rights. As a first, the affidavit also separates “fundamental rights” from the scope of interpretations allowed by international covenants and protocols.

Reading together Salve’s justification for only a sub-class of immigrants as eligible to be covered in CAA and what the affidavit of the Centre stated, it is a matter of concern whether such stipulated sub-classes of inclusion go against the letter and spirit of part-III of the Constitution. It is a matter of due consideration before the Supreme Court that the constitutional foundation of unity and equality between all classes of citizens of India, as stated in part-III, can be abridged and violated by identifying a special class and granting it certain rights. Assumption of the power of exclusion to discriminate between classes who are affected by the legislation is also a grave concern. If the power of exclusion by the Parliament further leads to abridgment of fundamental rights to equality and right to life of a certain excluded class, constitutional morality prohibits such exclusion. Indeed CAA legalises the prohibited categories of religion under Article 15 and makes it a basis for consideration for citizenship for a special class of non-citizens hailing from foreign countries.

As India is not yet a signatory to the Refugee Convention and Protocol, does this entitle it to draw a distinction between classes of asylum seekers and refugees? This is a grey area in which the current formulation of the CAA excludes Muslims. Salve justifies it by saying that as there is a settled political boundary between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, so Muslim immigrants from these countries, other than India, cannot claim citizenship and they are liable to be deported if they entered India illegally without valid papers. In contrast to immigrants from six religiously-persecuted groups, a Muslim immigrant from these countries would now become immediately illegal, because of his/her religion. This difference of entitlement in India, for the first time, sows seeds of selective preference. This runs contrary to the Citizenship Act, 1955 that keeps the process of naturalisation open to people originating from undivided India. As stated by the affidavit, it is true that the Citizenship Act, 1955 allows the State to decide who should be admitted to naturalized citizenship but religion has not been made a reason for anyone’s rejection. With CAA, religion could be taken as a factor for rejection of an applicant’s citizenship, as CAA gives a power of exclusion of a special sub-class to the State, as per the affidavit. Of course, the State will have an application of mind in not victimising someone as assured by the Home Minister in the case of NPR.

Couldn’t framing of such important laws related to immigration be more coherent and non-discriminatory? What stops the State from framing religiously un-biased laws that rise above religiosity and champion India’s pluralism, even in case of non-Indian citizens? As stated by political philosopher Charles Mills’ book Racial Liberalism, sacrificing constitutional impartiality in dealing with different races would result in supremacy of dominant races. Defending such dominance is what Mills called “racial liberalism.” CAA, as a consequence, might allow for such “racial liberalism” towards some classes, while excluding certain other classes of immigrants.

Even better is the description given by sociologist Zygmut Bauman, who considered modern Statecraft of choosing certain people over the other on certain consideration as a “gardening State.” The CAA, by choosing some and excluding the other has performed the role of “gardening” within the contours of Indian citizenship.

4,26-3-20,Every dark cloud has a silver lining,"Covid-19 is certainly not going to change the world forever but it is going to change quite a few things and for the better in some cases

They teach you in journalism school never to use the phrase “...X has changed the world forever.” Or at least they should. Covid-19 is certainly not going to change the world forever but it is going to change quite a few things, in some cases for a long time. Here are a few of them, in no particular order. First, the clean air over China’s cities in the past month, thanks to an almost total shutdown of the big sources of pollution, has saved 20 times as many Chinese lives as the Coronavirus has taken as air pollution kills about 1.1 million people in China every year. People will remember this when the filthy air comes back and want something done about it. India too, would see the same changes in its air and I am certain that there, too, the citizens will want some things to change on the ground.

Next on the list is online shopping which was already slowly killing the retail shops. The lockdown will force tens of millions who rarely or never shop online to do it all the time. (Yes, a lot of the websites have crashed or booked until mid-April now but there will be lots of time to scale them up to meet the demand.) Once customers get used to shopping online, most of them won’t go back to brick and mortar stores, so retail jobs will be disappearing twice as fast.

There won’t be such a radical change with restaurants but basically it will be the same story: More takeaways and home deliveries, fewer people on the seats. Habits will change and a lot of people won’t come back afterwards. Food sold out the door generates much less cash flow than food served at the table and half of the waiters’ jobs will be gone. There will be a severe cull of restaurants across the world, resulting in more job losses.

Once it becomes clear that working from home is actually possible in most jobs, it will start to seem normal for people not to go in to work most days. So a steep drop in commuting, lower greenhouse-gas emissions and eventually a lot of empty office space in city centres is what the future after the Coronavirus will be like.

There will be a recession, of course but it probably won’t be as bad or as long as the one after the financial crash of 2008. It isn’t a collapse of “the market” that has cost people their jobs this time. It was a virus that made them stop working and governments are doing far more than ever before to sustain working people through what will probably be a long siege as the world tries to beat this deadly Coronavirus. When the virus is finally tamed, as it will be eventually, and they can go back to work, the work (in most cases) will still be there. Although there will also be a few trillion dollars of extra debt.

Don’t worry about the debt. Banks have always created as much money as the Government requires. Put too much money into the economy and you’ll cause inflation, which is bad, but just replacing what people would ordinarily be earning so that the economy doesn’t seize up, is good. So President Macron can tell the French that no business, however small, will be allowed to go bankrupt. Prime Minister Johnson can tell the British that the Government will pay them 80 per cent of their normal income, up to a limit of £2,500 ($3,000) a month, if their work has vanished. And President Trump can talk about sprinkling “helicopter money” on the grateful masses.

What is being revealed here is a deeper truth. “Austerity” — cutting back on the welfare state to “balance the budget” — is a political and ideological choice, not an economic necessity. What Governments are moving into, willy-nilly, is a basic income guaranteed by the State. Just for the duration of the crisis, they say and it’s not quite a Universal Basic Income but that idea is now firmly on the table. However, whether the Governments of South Asian countries, which have a much-higher population density, can follow the Western example in this, is anybody’s guess.

Another good thing to come out of the outbreak is that collective action and Government protection for the old and the poor will no longer be viewed as dangerous radicalism, even in the US. Welfare States were built all over the developed world after the Second World War. They will be expanded after the Coronavirus ends. Indeed, if Joe Biden were to drop out of the presidential race tomorrow for health reasons, Bernie Sanders would stand a fair chance of beating Trump in November.

Decisive action on the climate crisis will become possible (although not guaranteed), because we will have learned that “business as usual” is not sacred. If we have to change the way we do business, we can. So it’s an ill wind that blows no good (a saying that was already old when John Heywood first catalogued it in 1546). Some of the anticipated changes are definitely good but we are going to pay an enormous price in lives and in loss for these benefits. It could have been dealt with a lot better. And the West should learn a little humility. Taiwan, South Korea and China (after the early fumble) have handled this crisis far better than Europe and North America. These are already more dead in Italy than in China, and America, Britain, France and Germany will certainly follow suit.

5,26-3-20,Respect environment and invest in it,"Large-scale casualties due to the Coronavirus must serve as a wake-up call to help understand the reality that the abuse of the environment has now reached catastrophic levels and must stop at all costs

COVID-19 has a vice-like grip over India and the rest of the world. According to the WorldoMeter, there have been over 19,607 casualties across the globe; the number of people infected stands at 4,35,002 and is growing by the hour. In India, too, the situation is grim as the number of casualties stands at 10 whereas the number of infected people stands at 562.

India has now taken the unprecedented step of imposing a 21-day-long curfew and locking down the nation, with nearly all States and Union Territories observing the diktat of the Central Government or imposing curfew-like conditions.

Nationally and globally, the impact on economies has been disastrous, with the global stock markets plummeting due to a sell-off amounting to $6 trillion in value, triggered by the Coronavirus within a short span of six days. The US is already comparing the current economic conditions with the Great Depression of 1930.

However, the fact remains that while the world economy is in the doldrums only now, the environmental conditions across the globe have not been good for decades as is evident by the threat of climate change that is looming large. In February, the Antarctica experienced one of its major meltdowns amid record-high temperatures, causing some of the major glaciers to melt. The environment and ecological biodiversity have been in a free fall for long and in the process this has been eroding the centuries of resilience developed by Mother Nature to withstand the degeneration brought on by mankind. But now it seems that nature is responding definitively and punishingly. Nature’s repositories such as tropical forests around the world with their teeming exotic animals were earlier considered the source of viruses and pathogens that caused diseases such as Ebola and HIV. But new research under the discipline of planetary science is showing that humanity’s destruction of biodiversity is in fact causing the creation of new strains of virus pathogens that are moving from animals to humans at an alarming rate. The ongoing COVID-19 is the latest example of this.

There is an urgent need to change the narrative here from exploitation of nature to investment in it. Mankind has, for decades, exploited nature’s hotspots by building roads, cutting down forests and commercialising animal life contained therein. Once these biodiversity hotspots were destroyed by mankind, the animals and the virus strains existing therein, needed new hosts and humans became unwitting hosts to them. This aspect was recently confirmed by the United States Centre for Disease Control as well. The exploitative activities of humans have become a highway of sorts, using which virulent pathogens are crossing from the animal kingdom to mankind. The tragedy is that despite earlier experiences with such viruses as the Nipah, Ebola and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, we are yet to learn any lessons.

This indiscriminate and unthinking exploitation of nature has the potential of ending mankind and hence it is time to start investing in the environment for the greater good of humanity. As a first step, nations where wet markets thrive and sell live animals for consumption purposes, must ban this forthwith. When the buying stops, so will the exploitation and in turn the transmission of any harmful pathogens. Many of these wet markets in South-East Asia feed a huge number of populations but in the larger interest of humankind, these markets must be forced to close down and Governments must provide alternative source of nutrition for the dependent population. In the aftermath of COVID-19, China has already shut down many wet markets, albeit a delayed move but nevertheless a welcome one. Many other busy wet markets such as those in Lagos must also be shut down if more virus transmissions are to be averted from these locations.

Awareness needs to be made a tool of investment in nature. The stakeholders must be made aware of the risks involved to them and to their family members. This will for instance dissuade a logging company employee from venturing into the tropical forests to cut trees. Similarly those dealing in live animals for commercial purposes will think twice before laying hands on the animals due to the fear of contracting fatal viruses. If one examines the past, it is clear that the viruses have kept plaguing humanity and possibly will continue to do so unless mankind disconnects itself from the concept of pillaging the environment for material gains and instead focusses on co-existence with nature so that it is given ample space of its own.

Large-scale human casualties due to the Coronavirus must serve as a wake-up call to help understand the reality that the abuse of the environment has now reached catastrophic levels and unless nature is given the respect it deserves, it will eventually reclaim the same and on its own terms.

15,26-3-20,Hoarding rumours fuel panic buying,"Despite warning against hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities amid rumours regarding the imminent shutdown of ration and food/vegetable shops following the coronavirus scare, the city traders are selling products at much higher rates.

Moreover, notwithstanding administration assurance of supply of essential goods including vegetables, food grains and grocery stores, people resorted to panic buying in several areas of the city.

“We are forced to buy products at much higher rates. There is a panic in society that stocks would run out as transport of essential goods including vegetables and food grains would be affected due to lockdown in most of the neighbouring states including Odisha, Bihar and Bengal. We are forced to buy commodities at higher rates. I think the administration must act against such traders,” said a resident of Jugsalai. Shopkeepers shared their own problems. “We have choice but to sell at high price. We rely on distributors and they have said that stock of essential commodities is very less. They have already increased prices of essential commodities. We already have scarce supply of Amul milk and dairy products and only rely on Sudha and Medha Dairy products. Administration should ensure that food items are available in proper number,’ said Naresh Kumar, a shopkeeper in Sakchi.

Reports of similar panic buying in different parts of the city, prompted East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla to issue an order directing leading retail chain outlets of Reliance Fresh and Big Bazaar to stay open. “ We reiterate that people should not resort to panic.

We would like to inform the masses not to indulge in panic buying as all the grocery stores, vegetable shops and those selling essential commodities like milk would remain open during the lockdown period in addition to fuel pumps, medicine shops, banks and ATMs,” said an official.

21,26-3-20,"Ranchites obey lockdown, violators punished","As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 21-day lockdown on Tuesday evening to prevent infection from coronavirus, its impact was visible in Ranchi. On the first day of lockdown, there was rush of people at vegetable markets and grocery stores for purchasing vegetables, fruits and other eatable items.

However, the relaxation was only for few hours as after police administration enforcing strictness people went back to their homes. Roads were deserted as people were asked to stay at home.

At the same time, traffic police have been instructed to impose fine immediately on the rule violators. The police strictness was visible on roads within few hours as people movement on roads started reducing drastically. Youngsters moving on roads on bikes without any work were asked to give the reasons for coming out on roads and many were asked to return home. Some were even asked to make sit ups for defying the government directives.

At Albert Ekka roundabout, some youngsters moving on bikes on roads were asked to make sit-down as they failed to give reasonable reason behind coming out of roads. In the usual days, the Kanta Toli Chowk, which witnessed huge traffic jam, was completely deserted. Traffic police personnel posted there, forcibly sent commuters home.

However, the police personnel who were on duty were furious on people not following lockdown rules. A traffic constable deputed on duty near Ratu Road roundabout said, “It is high time that people should follow rules.

We are witnessing many people who are roaming on road without any valid reason.” However, at vegetable markets the scene was different. In morning people throng fruit and vegetable markets. People who went for shopping bought vegetables for 10 days, not a day or two. Ramdeo Prasad, a resident of Upper Bazaar who was spotted at Naga Baba vegetable market said, “We welcome the Prime Minister Narendra Modi decision on 21 day lockdown till April 14. We have come here to buy vegetables and fruits.” Echoing the views of Prasad, Anjali a housewife said, “I have purchased the vegetables and fruits for ten days as we don’t know when the Government will issue other directive extending the lockdown for another 15 days if the situation doesn’t improve.”

Due to lockdown it was observed that many shopkeepers and vegetable sellers sold their goods at higher price. Onions priced at Rs 20 to 22/kg sold was available at Rs 30 and potatoes sold for Rs 18 to 25 were available at Rs 35 to 40.India's 1.3 billion people went on ""total lockdown"" from Tuesday midnight for three weeks to fight the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday. “Forget about leaving home in the next 21 days... If you cross the Lakshman Rekha, you will invite the virus home,"" PM Modi said in his second address to the nation in a week.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchites-obey-lockdown--violators-punished.html
22,26-3-20,Do we have enough clean water to wash away corona scare?,"Doctors and experts suggest hand washing and social distancing as effective ways of preventing the transmission of coronavirus, but the question remains whether Indians, particularly the poor, have access to adequate clean water for washing.

“At a time when the entire world is fighting with its back to the wall against coronavirus, it is appropriate to ask a pertinent question. Do we have enough access to clean and safe water, considering the fact that hand washing has emerged as one of the most effective ways of controlling the virus spread?” asked Centre for Science and Environment Director General Sunita Narain.

A 2014 WHO report, ‘Preventing diarrhoea through better water, sanitation and hygiene’, said that around 1.9 billion people across the world used non-potable or faecally-contaminated water for drinking, cleaning and other activities. As per Indian government’s own submission in the Lok Sabha in 2018, diarrhoea is the leading killer among water-borne diseases, accounting for about 60 per cent of all deaths.

Manish Mishra, who had launched a campaign Right To Water (RTW), said that India had been lucky so far that the virus had not spread to rural areas.

“If coronavirus reaches villages, it would be catastrophic. They (villagers) do not have access to clean water. They drink contaminated water and wash hands with the same. Their level of hygiene is no secret. The situation in water scarce area like Bundelkhand could be more pathetic,” he said.

Convenor of Jal Jan Jodo Abhiyan, Orai, Dr Sanjay Singh said that on an average, a person used 70-75 litres of water in urban areas and the demand could go up to 125 litres.

“We have carried out a survey in Jal Nigams and Jal Sansthans of Jhansi, Kanpur, Banda, Fatehpur, Prayagraj, Agra, Bareilly and Lucknow and found that demand for water has gone up in these areas,” he said.

Senior Director of Water and Wastewater Management, Suresh Rohilla, said, “Going by the WHO’s prescribed measures, to get a germ-free hand, a person takes 30-40 seconds and uses approximately four litres of water with a flowing tap and two litres when the tap is closed. Assuming each person in these days needs to wash hands at least 10 times a day, a family of five would need 100-200 litres water every day just to wash hands!”

Sunita Narain added, “There is another concern – the increased use of water will naturally lead to generation of more waste water. Keeping in mind that 85-90 per cent of water used in a household gets discharged as waste water, the more water we use, the more sewage we discharge. And bulk of waste water is not intercepted or treated or cleaned. We are adding to the pollution challenge of our waterbodies. It will mean higher cost to clean water for drinking.”

Narain pointed out that coronavirus spread had taught that humans were as weak as the weakest link in the chain. “The contagion needs us to ensure that everybody has access to public health so that nobody is left out and nobody can be the virus carrier. Providing access to clean water is the biggest preventive health measure we can take,” she said.

Experts like Dr Sanjay Singh said that 70 per cent of water was used in agriculture, 15 per cent in industry and 12-15 percent was put to domestic use.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/do-we-have-enough-clean-water-to-wash-away-corona-scare-.html

At a pan-India level, the power demand has already fallen by more than 20 per cent to 1,21,937 megawatt from 1,54,045 MW.

All-India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) chairmen Shailendra Dubey said the energy demand had fallen considerably in the country, and this posed a serious challenge to the commercial viability of these discoms, most of which are state owned and operated.

“We have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union energy minister and sought moratorium on the payment under the power purchase agreements (PPA) signed with the power generating companies during the entire lockdown period, since the energy requirement has gone down significantly and these payments are elements of a fixed cost for the discoms,” Dubey said here on Wednesday.

“If the relief is not extended to the power distribution companies urgently, they would not be able to pay salaries to their staff since the power consumers, especially those belonging to the lower strata, have not being paying their electricity bills due to the lockdown,” he added.

Following the gradual lockdown announced across different states, the energy demand has fallen due to the total shutdown of high power consuming industrial and commercial sectors and railways operations, thus affecting the major source of discoms’ revenues.

According to the Northern Region Load Dispatch Centre (NRLDC) website, the power demand in the region has drastically fallen by more than 11,000 MW— from 41,253 MW to 30,563 MW — in five days. The power supply on Tuesday stood at 6,950 lakh units compared to 8,660 lakh units on March 20.

“In Punjab, power demand came down to 2,900 MW on Tuesday from 5,000 MW last Friday, with the power supply getting reduced to 700 lakh units from 1,050 lakh units. There is a sharp dip of 350 lakh units per day consumed by Railways, industry and commercial establishments as well and the daily revenue loss is estimated at Rs 20 crore a day for Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL),” Dubey said.

Similarly in Haryana, power supply on Tuesday stood at 850 lakh units against 1,175 lakh units on March 20. The power demand fell to 3,800 MW from 5,800 MW over the past five days with the state discom witnessing revenue loss of nearly Rs 18 crore a day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/declining-power-demand-hits-uppcl-revenue.html
35,26-3-20,Pvt sugar mills offer to produce hand sanitisers to meet demand,"With sharp rise in the demand for hand sanitisers owing to spread of coronavirus, private sugar mills in the state have sought drug licence to manufacture the product at their captive distilleries.

All major private sugar companies like Balrampur Chini, Birla, Dalmia and Dhampur have already applied for the licence while several others are in the process of following suit.

The sugar companies have already proposed to manufacture more than 15,000 litres of hand sanitisers a day in their distilleries across UP. Of these, Dhampur and Birla would produce an estimated 5,000 litres and 4,000 litres respectively, whereas Balrampur, Uttam and

Daurala groups have proposed to produce 2,000 litres each of hand sanitiser.

“The process of granting licences to these units has been expedited owing to the contingency due to coronavirus outbreak. The movement of goods — hand sanitiser raw material and finished goods — has been exempted from restrictions imposed due to lockdown,” a senior UP Sugarcane department official said.

Secretary of UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), Deepak Guptara, said that of the 94 private sugar mills, about 40 had captive distilleries both in big groups and standalone mills.

Meanwhile, some sugar companies have proposed to produce only hand sanitisers in bulk and supply it to other firms for bottling and marketing. Besides, sugar mills have firmed up contracts to supply ethanol/ethyl alcohol/extra neutral alcohol (ENA) to external sanitiser units inside and outside the state.

Last week, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had written to the Centre assuring it that the domestic sugar industry would supply adequate quantity of ethanol or extra neutral alcohol (ENA) as per requirement for use in the manufacture of hand sanitisers.

Recently, local drug manufacturers had claimed that isopropyl alcohol (IPA) used in hand sanitisers was being blackmarketed in the state and thus inhibiting their plans to increase production.

UP Drug Manufacturers Association (UPDMA) president Prashant Bhatiya said that IPA was being sold for Rs 360 per litre in the black market in UP against its normal price of Rs 95 per litre.

Hand sanitisers could also be effectively manufactured with ethanol/ethyl alcohol/ENA as advised by World Health Organisation (WHO). Bhatiya alleged there were bottlenecks in the supply of ethanol from state distilleries as well.

The UPDMA has already written to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to facilitate availability of raw materials in the state and pledged to manufacture hand sanitisers on a ‘war footing’ to meet the growing demand.

The UP government has urged surgical mask and hand sanitiser production units operating in the state to augment production by working in three shifts a day even as new units were promised speedier approvals.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pvt-sugar-mills-offer-to-produce-hand-sanitisers-to-meet-demand.html
36,26-3-20,PB ISSUES NEW ORDERS TO FACILITATE SUPPLY OF ESSENTIALS,"Amidst reports of disrupted supply of essential commodities and violation of curfew orders on the first day of 21-day nationwide lockdown, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday came out with new commandments to streamline the curfew management and facilitate supply of essentials.

Besides issuing a fresh set of directives to the police and civil administration including detailed instructions for issuance of passes to maintain critical systems and services in order to ensure that people are not inconvenienced in these difficult times, the Chief Minister has also constituted a Committee, under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Industry and Commerce), to oversee the procurement processes for all CoViD-19 related items.

As per the revised curfew management guidelines, government offices that have been designated in Government of India’s order will be allowed to remain open with skeletal staff.

In order to ensure supply of other essential services, specific State Government offices may also be required to remain open with minimal functional staff. Such employees of the State Government and those employees of Government of India that have been allowed to report on duty as per Government of India’s order will be allowed to travel from home to office on their institutional Identity Card, and specific curfew passes will not be necessary, the revised guidelines states.

It is specifically provided in the guidelines that for employees of Governments including PSUs and SPUs, of Haryana, Punjab and UT of Chandigarh who are residing in Mohali district (especially Mohali and Zirakpur) and are facing acute problems in reaching their offices, located in Chandigarh and Panchkula, it has been decided that they may be allowed to commute to their offices for official duty (not with their families or in groups) by showing their official or institutional photo ID cards and they would not be required to obtain special curfew passes.

At the same time, it was clarified that all other Government employees will be directed to work from home and remain available on call should any such need arise.

It was also clarified that there would be no general relaxation in curfew. In case, it is decided by the District Administration in due course to relax it in a selected area, due care must be taken to avoid overcrowding and to observe prescribed social distancing,” stated the fresh guidelines.

Taking cognizance of the need to ensure timely supply of critical materials and equipment, including PPE kits, masks, medicines etc, to government hospitals, primary and community health centres (PHCs and CHCs), the Deputy Commissioners have been asked to contact Punjab State Health and Family Welfare Department and Punjab Health System Corporation (PHSC) managing director with the facility of sending advance indents to facilitate early procurements.

At the same time, Capt Amarinder has ordered that requisite protocol issued by the Health Department for testing of suspected cases should be followed meticulously. Further, compliance of protocol issued by the Health Department, dated March 22, 2020, should be strictly ensured.

Continuing with its earlier curfew orders, the State Government will take all possible steps to avoid any undue inconvenience to the providers of essential services and general public, the Chief Minister assured the people.

He has directed the police and administrative officials to ensure that door-to-door delivery of essential services is maintained for the desired or prescribed period and it may, as far as possible, be further streamlined with the assistance of e-commerce companies or service providers.

Volunteers may also be engaged, if necessary, for ensuring prompt door-to-door delivery of essential services and commodities, said the Chief Minister, adding that providers of essential services whether individuals (hawkers or delivery boys) or institutions should be allowed to operate for fixed duration but on specific permissions and after observing required health safeguards.

The Chief Minister also ordered sanitization of affected or vulnerable areas, etc for which guidelines have been issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department to be undertaken in both concerned towns and villages.

On directives of the Chief Minister, Secretary Arun Sekhri on Wednesday issued revised curfew management guidelines to all Divisional Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners, Commissioners of Police or SSPs, as well as other senior officials concerned with managing the situation.

The DCs have been asked to ensure strict compliance of the guidelines.

With the civil administration and police working in close coordinate, DGP Dinkar Gupta also issued clear instructions to his officers to ensure efficient delivery mechanisms and processes in the light of curfew with no relaxations already in place in the State, and the subsequent national lockdown announcement by the Prime Minister.

He emphasized arrangements for door-to-door delivery of essential goods and services as the only option in the given situation and asked the CPs and SSPs to ensure that functioning of delivery boys, rehris, small motorized vehicles etc is facilitated to ensure smooth supplies.

For individual emergencies, DCs have been asked to continue following up and facilitating the common man through helplines already established in the districts. The number of helplines and persons attending on such lines may be increased and properly publicized, the guidelines state.

For procurement of wheat, ACS (Development) and PSFS would issue a comprehensive mandi-wise plan in due course.

Likewise, for harvesting of potatoes, ACS (Development) would issue necessary guidelines by Friday, March 27, 2020.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pb-issues-new-orders-to-facilitate-supply-of-essentials.html

Capt Amarinder described the attack as extremely “tragic and unfortunate”, requesting the Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani to find out about the perpetrators and look after the people of India.

Heavily armed gunmen and suicide bombers stormed a Sikh gurdwara in the heart of Afghanistan's capital of Kabul on Wednesday, killing at least 11 worshippers and wounding as many, in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority community in the country, according to a media report.

“Horrific news coming from Kabul where a barbaric terror attack happened in the Gurudwara Guru Har Rai. It's extremely tragic and unfortunate. Request (Afghanistan) President @Ashraf Ghani Ji to find out the perpetrators and look after our people,” Capt Amarinder tweeted.

Condemning the ghastly attack, the Union Minister and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal said that she has requested the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to issue immediate instructions to the Indian High Commission to ensure the safety of the Sikhs.

“Shocked to learn about a ghastly terror attack at Gurdwara Sahib in #Kabul. I request EAM @DrS Jaishankar Ji to issue imm instructions to the Indian High Comm in Afghanistan to ensure the safety of our Sikh brethren trapped there..,” she tweeted.

Meanwhile, SAD chief Sukhbir Badal also condemned the barbaric attack and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the issue of safety of the Sikh community with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani urgently.

He said that it was unfortunate that Sikhs in Afghanistan had been “victims of forced marriages and conversions and killings for more than two decades now but no concrete steps had been taken to ensure their safety”.

“Sikhs are being systematically decimated in Afghanistan due to which thousands had fled the country to seek refuge in India…Now only around 300 Sikh families live in Afghanistan in the vicinity of Gurdwaras but even they are not safe with even gurdwaras being targeted as has happened today morning,” he added.

Sukhbir said that Sikhs, who had been displaced by the wave of violence against them by fanatics, should be rehabilitated.

He said that similarly, all Sikh places of worship in Afghanistan should be given due protection by the State.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-leaders-condemn-attack-on-kabul-gurudwara.html

However, Dr Joshi stated that all the sanitation workers have been given all the necessary equipment like masks, gloves and sanitisers for their safety with instructions to regularly wash their hands properly after their work is done. Furthermore, Birla also averred that the MCD has deployed sanitation workers for spraying disinfectant in the city without any training which is causing them skin and other health problems.

He said, ""The sanitation workers have no knowledge about the use of hypochlorite solution as a disinfectant. Several workers are having breathing and skin problems because of it as they do not know about the proper concentration of chemical in the water to use it. The workers have burnt and peeled skin on their back after carrying the small spray tanks on their backs. The MCD is putting the life of workers at risk."" Alleging that the MCD has deployed sanitation workers from Bijnor (Uttar Pradesh), he said that the said workers are being kept in different Rain Basera buildings where more than 30 workers are kept in the same room. ""While the government has prohibited more than five people on the roads, MCD is keeping sanitation workers like animals in a single room. Without any safety precautions or social distance, these workers can be the carriers of the coronavirus in the city,"" averred Birla.

Rebutting all the claims, Dr Joshi said that all the workers are given beds which are at least one metre apart from each other. Talking about the burned and peeled off skin of the sanitation workers due to disinfectant tanks, he said that the workers are provided with equipment like raincoats so that the chemical does not come in contact with their skin. He stated that MCD has provided all the safety equipments to workers and it is up to them to use them properly while they work.

Meanwhile, Birla said that he has written letters to chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and cabinet minister Madan Kaushik about the safety of sanitation workers but so far no response has been received.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-risking-health-of-sanitation-workers--alleges-absms.html

On a day when Maharashtra celebrated its traditional new year day “Gudi Padwa” in a low-key manner, the State witnessed an alarming jump in the total number of people testing positive for coronavirus, a jump from the earlier 107 cases to 122 cases.

In what came as a relief, the first two patients -- who had earlier tested positive for Covid-19 -- were discharged from Pune's Naidu Hospital after they recovered fully. The two, who are a married couple from Pune, tested negative twice during the follow-up period. The two were presented flowers by the in-charge doctors when they were discharged from the hospital on Tuesday.

Of the fresh Covid-19 positive cases reported on Tuesday, Mumbai accounted for a maximum seven positive cases, while five persons from a same family from Islampur town in Sangli district in Western Maharashtra. There was one case each from Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai and Panvel.

The Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, which is the nodal hospital dealing with Covid-19, reported four infected cases in the morning, while five more persons tested positive for pandemic in the afternoon. Three of the four infected reported from Kasturba Hospital in the morning were that of persons with history of international travel, while one person contracted the pandemic through “a close contact”.

In what came as a cause of concern for the authorities, all the five members of a family who have been diagnosed positive for Covid-19 had contracted Coronavirus through contacts. “…In Sangli 5 people from one family are identified as positive due to contacts,” State Health Minister Rajesh Tope tweeted. In another tweet, Tope said that fourteen patients had recovered from the illness and were in the process of being discharged from the hospitals.

Significantly enough, the total number of infected cases has nearly doubled during the last five days from 64 and 122.

Currently,as many as 14,502 people are in home quarantine, while 932 people are in institutional quarantine in the state.

There have so far been four Covid-19 deaths in the state. On Monday evening, a 65-year-old COVID-19 patient died at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai on Monday evening.

Addressing the people across the state through social media, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray all Maharashtrians a traditional Marathi new year on the occasion of “Gudi Padwa”.

Likening the ongoing spread of Coronavirus to the world war, Uddhav said: “This is a World War. During war you do not get out of your safe zone which in this case is your home. We literally do not know where the enemy (CoronaVirus) is going to attack us from. I hope people have now started understanding the gravity of the situation”.

Making appeal to the citizens not to indulge in panic buying, the chief minister said: “We have enough stock of essential commodities and food grains, do not worry. In any case, shops selling essential goods & services will not be shut. So, I appeal to you to not panic”.

“The positive that we can take out of the current situation is we have more time to spend with our family which we all agree that we had lost on our way. This feeling of togetherness & spending time with parents, children, grandparents, grand children is inexplicable,” Uddhav said.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, state Congress President and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat, Health Minister Rajesh Tope appealed to people to celebrate Gudi Padva indoors exercising all precautions in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unlike in the past, the Maharashtrians celebrated the festival by hoisting the auspicious ‘gudi’ in the confines of homes with only family members in attendance.

Meanwhile, State Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan said that as precautionary measure, his ministry had readied 22,118 beds to accommodate Coronavirus patients and it could increase the bed capacity to 55,707.

As part of the exercise, the Public Works Department (PWD) has made available 22,118 beds in hundreds of our buildings. They include rest houses, hostels and new built government buildings which are not being used currently”

“The places where we have made bed arrangements have drinking water and electricity facilities. These places can be used as centres to quarantine patients with Coronavirus symptoms.

84,26-3-20,Kerala may opt for online distribution of spirits,"Whatever the court disposes, the Government proposes is the new dictum in the State of Kerala. Last week saw the Kerala High Court dismissing a petition filed by a private citizen who had pleaded with the court to direct the Government to ensure the availability of liquor through online platforms so that tipplers need not stand in long queues for hours to get their daily quota of spirits.

Jyothish, a Cochin-based youth had approached the judiciary in the backdrop of the coronavirus and the medical directives regarding the social distancing.

His contention was that if the Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), as the stuff is known in this Southern State, is sold through in-line platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, the tipplers need not stand in the queues in front of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (BEVCO for short) counters, the State monopoly in liquor business, exposing themselves to potential attack by coronavirus. He also pointed out that if liquor is sold through the online platforms, the State need not surrender or sacrifice the revenue accrued through the sector.

But the judge who heard the petition came down heavily on Jyothish by giving him a sermon on the responsibilities of the ourt, Government and the citizen. To express the displeasure of the court towards the petitioner for filing such pleas, the judge ordered him to pay Rs 50,000 as fine which would be credited into the Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund. The State Cabinet which met on Wednesday morning decided to shut down all the BEVCO outlets in view of the national lock out declared by the Centre on Tuesday night. This has dampened the spirits of millions of tipplers across the State, which has a reputation as the largest guzzler of liquor in the country.

But sources in the Department of Excise said the Government was studying the possibilities of making liquor available through on line platforms. Officials pointed out that the Excise Minister T P Ramakrishnan had launched a project of on-line booking of liquor to help the tipplers from the hassles of standing in serpentine queues in front of BEVCO.

Consumerfed, the apex body of all consumer cooperatives in the State too had made elaborate arrangements for the on line booking of spirits through on line agencies. A final declaration about the new bventure may be out shortly as the unprecedented closure of ‘watering holes’ has dampened the spirits of veteran tipplers.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-may-opt-for-online-distribution-of-spirits.html

Till Tuesday, 13 people had tested positive for Covid-19 here.

102,26-3-20,Fresh push to strengthen rural banking,"To strengthen the rural banking in the wake of the corona pandemic, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday, approved the continuation of the process of recapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) by providing minimum regulatory capital to them for the next financial year 2020-21.

The RRBs were facing problem to maintain minimum capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9%, as per the regulatory norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India and this decision will help to overcome the minimum capital keeping crisis.

As per this decision, the Centre will pay Rs.670 crore (50%), subject to the condition that the release of Central Government’s share will be contingent upon the release of the proportionate share by the sponsor banks, said Union Minister Prakash Javadekar detailing the package. This scheme will make the RRBs financially stronger and will enable them to meet the credit requirement in the rural areas, he added.

“As per RBI guidelines, the RRBs have to provide 75% of their total credit under PSL (Priority Sector Lending). RRBs are primarily catering to the credit and banking requirements of agriculture sector and rural areas with focus on small and marginal farmers, micro & small enterprises, rural artisans and weaker sections of the society. In addition, RRBs also provide lending to micro/small enterprises and small entrepreneurs in rural areas. With the recapitalization support to augment CRAR, RRBs would be able to continue their lending to these categories of borrowers under their PSL target, and thus, continue to support rural livelihoods,” said the statement issued by Government.

The Cabinet also approved the taking up of construction of Aligarh-Harduaganj flyover by Ministry of Railways. The total length of the railway flyover will be 22 kilometer. The project is expected to be completed by 2024-25 at a cost of over Rs 1,285 crore. “At Aligarh Junction Station a branch line Bareilly-Aligarh terminates. The trains coming from Howrah side and going to Harduaganj/Bareilly cross Howrah-New Delhi main route, which is busiest section of Indian Railways. Due to heavy traffic there is no path available for surface crossing of loaded goods trains coming from Howrah side and going to Harduaganj/Bareilly. This results into heavy detention of trains at Aligarh Junction.

“This location has become a bottleneck and is affecting the train working badly causing delays and detentions and also reducing the wagon turn round. Flyover at Aligarh going over the existing Delhi-Howrah main line is an operational necessity and is essentially required to remove the bottleneck to traffic movement. By construction of flyover connecting Aligarh to Harduaganj the delays and detentions will be avoided,” said Government.

The Union Cabinet also approved continuation of Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) from 1st April, 2020 onward until such time that the scheme is merged with Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP). “RoSCTL scheme for apparel and made-ups will be continued with effect from 1st April, 2020 without any change in scheme guidelines and rates as notified by Ministry of Textiles till such time that the RoSCTL is merged with RoDTEP. Continuation of RoSCTL beyond 31st March, 2020 is expected to make the textile sector competitive by rebating all taxes/levies which are currently not being rebated under any other mechanism,” said Government.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fresh-push-to-strengthen-rural-banking.html

123,26-3-20,Coronavirus economics: Roundup of radical policy steps,"Governments and central banks around the world are ripping up the policy rulebook as they battle to immunise their economies from deeper coronavirus carnage.

Printing new money, gargantuan debt spending, loan guarantees, tax breaks and even direct payments to workers are all in the highly unorthodox mix.

AFP surveys the latest responses by major economies as COVID-19 has spread from China to the rest of the world, making a global recession all but inevitable.

In the United States, Senate leaders and the White House early Wednesday struck agreement on a USD 2 trillion stimulus package for the world’s largest economy.

The biggest ever spending plan in US history had been knocked back by Democratic objections to the Republican plan, which was decried as a “slush fund” for bosses.

But party leaders overcame their differences to clinch a “wartime level of investment into our nation”, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

The Senate and House of Representatives still need to pass the legislation before sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature.

The package will put cash directly into the hands of Americans, provides grants to small businesses and hundreds of billions of dollars in loans for larger corporations including airlines, and expands unemployment benefits.

A separate package from US financial overseers including the Federal Reserve would provide a stunning USD 4 trillion in liquidity to juice up the economy.

The Fed has kept up near-daily announcements to keep dollars flowing, in addition to slashing its main lending rate to near zero.

On Monday, the Fed vowed to buy unlimited amounts of government debt -- akin to printing money -- and offered to lend directly to small- and medium-sized firms.

The country had produced around 1,389 million kgs of tea in 2019, he said.

“The lockdown was inevitable as there is no other option to prevent the spread of the disease. However, the country’s tea production will be hit and this will lead to a collapse of the industry,” Tea Board Chairman P K Bezbaruah told PTI. It will take time to bring tea bushes again to the production stage, he said.

Tea Board’s deputy chairman Arun Kumar Ray said that the “likely shortfall in production due to lockdown would be around 100 million kg this year”, which could lead to rise in prices.

“The impact of the coronavirus outbreak will be felt across the globe. The priority is to prevent community transmission,” Ray said.

With this lockdown, Darjeeling tea planters will lose first flush production, a premium variety, by around 30 per cent, Bezbaruah said

The pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the stringent border controls by a host of countries and imposition of the travel ban on the people of other nationalities to contain the virus infection.

The Indian government has also suspended all air services among the several measures to prevent if from getting a large part of the population infected.

“ India’s aviation sector could incur losses of USD 3.3-3.6 billion in 1QFY2021. Assuming that all domestic and international operations remain grounded until Jun 30,” the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) India said in its preliminary report.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a 21-day complete lockdown from Wednesday, stating that it was the only way of breaking COVID-19 infection cycle.

“Even with some partial resumption of services in May and June, the financial outcomes may not change significantly,” Modi said in his televised address to the nation Monday evening.

The CAPA has also sought “urgent” government intervention and coordinated industry response to address all the requirement of the aviation industry.

According to the CAPA, the airline sector losses are expected to be around USD 1.75 billion while that of the airports and concessionaires at around USD 1.50-1.75 billion and another USD 80-90 million losses of the ground handling companies.

Noting that the domestic airline sector was already vulnerable even prior to the advent of COVID-19, the CAPA said most Indian airlines have not structured their business models to be able to withstand even regular shocks, such as elevated fuel prices or economic downturns, let alone once-in-a-century events.

With few exceptions, Indian carriers have weak balance sheets and precarious levels of liquidity, the CAPA said in the report, adding airlines have generated cash to stay afloat through advance sales or sale-and-lease back margins (and government infusion in the case of Air India), but with no cushion to be able to withstand downward cycles.

Stating that with global aviation almost grinding to a halt - and for what could be an extended period – this is a state of affairs that will heighten risks for even the strongest carriers in the world, CAPA apprehended several weaker airlines might go belly-up.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/indian-aviation-firms-lose--3-6-bn-owing-to----virus----travel-ban.html
126,26-3-20,Surge for stocks fades despite huge US stimulus package,"A global stocks rally petered out Wednesday as Europe took up the baton, despite US lawmakers agreeing a mammoth stimulus package to help the world’s biggest economy resist effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

After huge gains for equities Tuesday, which continued into Wednesday with Tokyo soaring and European indices jumping at the open, London lost some of its gains and Frankfurt was in the red nearing the half-way stage.

Elsewhere, the dollar was lower against main rivals and oil prices retreated.

“The stimulus is now by and large in place, the question is whether it’s enough for the markets or whether the expected spike in cases and deaths in the US and Europe, combined with the emerging picture of the economic damage, means we need to take another leg lower before the bottom is found,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at trading group Markets.Com.

While COVID-19 continues to spread, traders have a rare semblance of optimism after weeks of carnage across global markets, with eyes fixed on Washington where lawmakers thrashed out an emergency bill worth as much as $2 trillion — around 10 percent of US gross domestic product. “At last, we have a deal,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, calling it a “wartime level of investment into our nation”. “We have a bipartisan agreement on the largest rescue package in American history,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said shortly after McConnell spoke.

“So many people are being put out of work through no fault of their own. They don’t know what their future is going to be like, how are they going to pay the bills,” Schumer noted. “Well, we come to their rescue.”

The measure will put cash directly into the hands of Americans, provides grants to small businesses and hundreds of billions of dollars in loans for corporations including embattled airlines, while expanding unemployment benefits.

The prospect of a massive spending splurge, combined with the Federal Reserve’s pledge to essentially print as much cash is needed, sent Wall Street into overdrive Tuesday, with the Dow seeing its biggest rise since 1933, while the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day in more than a decade.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/surge-for-stocks-fades-despite-huge-us-stimulus-package.html

The tallies, using data collected by AFP offices from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), are likely to reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.

130,26-3-20,Air pollution in Italy falls since start of lockdown,"Italy’s air quality has improved since the country went into coronavirus lockdown, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said Wednesday, a trend seen elsewhere in Europe as well.

In Milan, Italy’s economic capital, the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas emitted mainly from vehicles and power stations and which can cause inflammation of the respiratory system, has fallen by 24 percent in the last four weeks, compared with the preceeding four weeks, the EEA said.

The week starting on March 16 alone saw a 21 percent reduction compared with the same week one year earlier.

In Rome, NO2 levels have fallen between 26 and 35 percent for the same four weeks, and in Bergamo, Italy’s hardest hit city, the reduction was 47 percent.

The lockdown in Italy began in certain northern areas on February 23 before it was extended nationwide on March 9. As of 1100 GMT Wednesday, Italy had recorded more 69,000 cases with 6,820 deaths.

EEA said its “data confirm large decreases in air pollutant concentrations... Largely due to reduced traffic and other activities, especially in major cities under lockdown measures.” Other parts of Europe have seen similar effects, in Spain for example where NO2 concentration has fallen by 55 percent in Barcelona and 41 percent in Madrid, on a 12-month comparison.

In the Spanish capital, average NO2 concentration has fallen by 56 percent from one week to the next.

NO2 levels have halved in some other parts of the continent. But the French air quality monitoring agency cautioned that the lockdown had not led to marked declines in so-called PM2.5 and PM10 particles, the smallest and most harmful air pollutants, owing to increased home heating and continued agricultural activity.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/air-pollution-in-italy-falls-since-start-of-lockdown.html

132,26-3-20,Putin postpones public vote on reforms over virus,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday the public vote on his constitutional reforms must be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and declared next week a public holiday.

“I believe the voting must be postponed to a later date,” Putin said of the April 22 plebiscite in a rare televised address in which he called on Russians to show solidarity.

The reforms, proposed by the president and approved by lawmakers over the last few months, would reset presidential term limits and potentially allow Putin, in power for 20 years, to stay in office until 2036.

Putin also took the unusual step of declaring next week a non-working week.

“The long holidays are provided to slow the speed of expansion of the disease,” he said. Unlike other countries, Russia has not yet introduced mandatory at home sheltering.

Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick said that since Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “stay at home” announcement on Monday evening, officers have been on the streets of London to advise people and businesses of the new rules.

“We will only use enforcement if we absolutely have to but we won’t hesitate if there are people who are deliberately breaching the law. But I think the vast majority of people will want to comply with the law to keep their society safe.

135,26-3-20,"‘We are collapsing’: Virus pummels medics in Spain, Italy","By the time Patricia Núñez’s cough started, she was already familiar with the dreaded dry hacking sound tormenting patients who had for weeks been filling the Madrid emergency ward where she works.

“We were fed up of hearing it at the hospital, so it was just a matter of time before I would contract it,” said Núñez, a 32-year-old nurse who tested positive for the new coronavirus about a week ago.

Speaking via video call from her home, Núñez said she is eager to recover, so she can relieve overworked colleagues dealing with a rising wave of patients and dwindling numbers of healthy nurses and doctors.

“The worst thing is that you need to stay at home, worried about infecting relatives, while knowing that you are dearly needed at work,” she told The Associated Press.

The coronavirus is waging a war of attrition against health care workers throughout the world, but nowhere is it winning more battles at the moment than in Italy and in Spain, where protective equipment and tests have been in severely short supply for weeks.

Spain’s universal health care system is a source of national pride and often hailed as a reason for its citizens’ legendary longevity, but the outbreak is exposing its shortcomings, some of which are the result of years of budget cuts.

The country’s hospitals are groaning under the weight of the pandemic: Video and photos from two hospitals in the Spanish capital showed patients, many hooked up to oxygen tanks, crowding corridors and emergency rooms. At the 12 de Octubre University Hospital, patients could be seen on the floor as they waited for a bed in recent days. The hospital says the patients have since been accommodated elsewhere.

On Wednesday, the number of medical personnel infected was nearly 6,500 nationally, health authorities said, representing 13.6% of the country’s 47,600 total cases and about 1% of the health system’s workforce. At least three health care workers have died.

“We are collapsing. We need more workers,” said Lidia Perera, a nurse who works with Núñez at Madrid’s Hospital de la Paz, which has 1,000 beds.

This week, 11 of the hospital’s 14 floors are devoted to caring for those suffering from COVID-19, and there is still not enough room: The patients with less serious cases of the disease are being put in the hospital’s gym or in a large tent outside.

“If you had told me three months ago that I would be working in these conditions in Spain, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Perera said, adding that staff at La Paz are only being tested for the virus if they have symptoms. “If they did (regular testing), they might end up without any workers.”

Widespread infections among health workers reflect the universal difficulty of stemming the spread of the pandemic. But sick health workers do double damage: They add to the toll while also hampering the ability to respond to the crisis. On top of that, they raise the specter of hospitals becoming breeding grounds of infection.

Spain’s experience has been reflected elsewhere.

The World Health Organization’s director-general this week called reports of large number of infections among health workers “alarming.”

“Even if we do everything else right, if we don’t prioritize protecting health workers, many people will die because the health worker who could have saved their lives is sick,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists.

In Italy, where nearly one-tenth of about 70,000 infections are among medical workers, doctors and nurses have been begging the government daily to provide more masks, gloves and goggles.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---we-are-collapsing-----virus-pummels-medics-in-spain--italy.html
136,26-3-20,Italian village where virus is deadlier than war,"The obituaries posted on a board where the newspapers might otherwise hang tell the story of an Italian village living through a disaster the mayor calls “worse than the war”.

The war Vertova mayor Orlando Gualdi refers to is World War II — a cataclysmic event more and more Italians cite while describing the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.

Italy’s death toll is somewhat hard to grasp when they are read out every evening in Rome. The total across the country soared to 6,820 by Wednesday.

It is 36 in Vertova. But the village — its ancient stone houses hugging the side of a mountain 70 kilometres northeast of Milan — has 4,600 inhabitants and usually sees around 60 deaths the entire year.

“It’s worse than the war,” Gualdi told AFP in one of the village’s empty squares.

Four freshly made coffins are bunched together near the entrance of a chapel nearby.

They are waiting to be cremated and then buried in the cemetery in the back.

Funerals have been banned for weeks and the ceremony will be a muted affair attended by caretakers wrapped in protective suits and masks.

The cemetery itself remains closed to the villagers because public gathering are banned — so grieving for your loved ones with flowers at their grave is no longer allowed.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italian-village-where-virus-is-deadlier-than-war.html
137,26-3-20,Italy new virus infections drop to lowest point in crisis,"Italy on Tuesday received more reassuring evidence that its coronavirus infection rate was slowing thanks to a painful lockdown that other nations are starting to apply at great economic cost.

Health officials across the ravaged Mediterranean country are poring over every new piece of data to see whether two weeks of bans and closures have made a dent in the crisis.

The harshest restrictions are theoretically due to expire on Wednesday evening -- although the government is all but certain to extend them in some form for weeks or even months.

Italy’s 743 new deaths broke two days of successive declines that had taken the number down to 601 on Monday.

It set a world record of 793 fatalities on Saturday.

But officially registered new infections rose just eight percent -- the same as Monday and the lowest level since Italy registered its first death on February 21.

It had been running at as high as 50 percent at the start of March.

“The measures we took two weeks ago are starting to have an effect,” civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told the daily La Repubblica before Tuesday’s toll came out.

He said more data over the next few days will help show “if the growth curve is really flattening.” Few scientists expect Italy’s numbers — if they really are dropping — to follow a steady downward line.

The slowing contagion rate is at least offering a ray of hope in the midst of a global health emergency that is only deepening in other parts of Europe and the United States.

Scientists believe that countries such as Spain and France are following in Italy’s footsteps with a lag of a few weeks.

The numbers from the US are also similar to the track of those of Italy about 20 days ago.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/italy-new-virus-infections-drop-to-lowest-point-in-crisis.html
138,26-3-20,"Spain seeks NATO help as virus death toll touches 2,700","Spain’s armed forces on Tuesday asked NATO for humanitarian assistance to fight the novel coronavirus as the national death toll touched 2,700 and infections soared towards 40,000.

With the pandemic spreading across the world, Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries, logging the third highest number of deaths with the latest toll standing at 2,696 after another 514 people died over the past 24 hours.

Despite an unprecedented lockdown imposed on March 14, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with the Spanish army called in to join efforts to curb its spread.

With authorities stepping up testing, the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 rose by nearly 20 percent to 39,673, the health ministry said. Health authorities said it would become clear whether the lockdown was having the desired effect.

“This is a very hard week because we’re in the first stages of overcoming the virus, a phase in which we are approaching the peak of the epidemic,” Health Minister Salvador Illa told a televised news conference.

Like many other countries, Spain has been struggling with a lack of medical supplies for testing, treatment and the protection of frontline workers.

In a statement, NATO said Spain’s military had asked for “international assistance”, seeking medical supplies to help curb the spread of the virus both in the military and in the civilian population.

The request specified 450,000 respirators, 500,000 rapid testing kits, 500 ventilators and 1.5 million surgical masks. With the numbers still spiralling, the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Tuesday sought parliamentary approval to extend the state of emergency for an extra two weeks, until April 11 — the day before Easter — in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.

“We are aware of just how hard it is to prolong this situation, but it is absolutely imperative that we keep fighting the virus in order to win this battle,” government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero told the news conference.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/spain-seeks-nato-help-as-virus-death-toll-touches-2-700.html
139,26-3-20,"US registers 10,000 new cases","The number of coronavirus cases in the United States jumped by nearly 10,000 while about 150 Americans died in a day even as President Donald Trump hoped to reopen the country’s economy by Easter, April 12.

With millions of Americans under a lockdown, the National Guard as well as the armed forces were pressed into service in several states such as New York which saw at least 53 deaths and about 5,000 new cases on Tuesday. New York has so far reported more than 25,000 COVID-19 cases and 210 fatalities.

According to Worldometer, a website which compiles COVID-19 cases, nearly 10,000 new coronavirus cases were reported across the country on Tuesday alone taking the total to around 54,000 while the number of fatalities surged by 150 in a day bringing its total to about 700.

Apart from New York, neighbouring New Jersey, along with California, Michigan, Illinois and Florida were the other coronavirus hotspots. However, no new cases or deaths were reported in Washington, the state which was first hit by the pathogen in the US.

President Trump, whose approval rating touched 50 per cent for the first time apparently because of his handling the coronavirus crisis on a war footing, put up a brave front on Tuesday telling reporters that he expects things to go back to normal in about three weeks’ time by Easter, which is on April 12.

“I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, hand washing and all the other things that everybody knows they are supposed to be doing. Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy,” the president said.

“I hope we can do this by Easter. I think that would be a great thing for our country and we are all working very hard to make that a reality. We will be meeting a lot of people to see if it can be done,” he said and also hoped the Congress would soon vote on a USD 2 trillion bill that would deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans.

“Easter is our timeline, what a great timeline that would be,” Trump said but asserted that his first priority was always the health and safety of the American people.

However, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr Anthony Fauci cautioned against setting any timeline for resolving the crisis, saying, “You got to be very flexible.”

“You can look at a date, but you got to be very flexible. And on a literally day-by-day and week-by-week basis, you need to evaluate the feasibility of what you’re trying to do,” he said.

White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah L Birx informed reporters that of the 3,70,000 tests done so far, 2,20000 were carried out in the last eight days.

140,26-3-20,You may not kiss the bride: Social distancing in force at Indonesia wedding!,"Closed borders and social distancing rules to stem the coronavirus outbreak failed to stop one transnational couple in Indonesia from tying the knot on Wednesday, minus the customary kiss to seal the deal.

Irra Chorina Octora, 29, and her Turkish partner Yavuz Ozdemir, 32, swapped vows at Al Akbar mosque in Surabaya, as friends and family -- each sat two metres apart -- looked on.

The couple both wore facemasks and kept their distance through the ceremony to comply with strict rules imposed by authorities, who have banned mass gatherings including weddings but allowed some exceptions for marriages booked before the pandemic began.

Virus precautions were on full display, with a maximum of 25 people at the event, temperature checks at the door and hand sanitiser throughout the venue. The wedding was also wrapped up in just 30 minutes.

The only hint of physical intimacy came when Ozdemir, whom Octora first met on social media, briefly took off his mask for his bride to feed him a piece of wedding cake.

Their reception party was cancelled and only a compromise with the mosque allowed the pair to proceed with the ceremony on Wednesday, earlier than planned.

142,26-3-20,Observational artiste,"YouTuber and singer Bhuvan Bam finds most of his content by picking on the quirks of people around him, says Saimi Sattar

Lockdown = Soaring demand for internet content for both entertainment and information. But more often than not, these have become the tools for spreading falsehood and myths. YouTuber and singer Bhuvan Bam, who’s BB Ki Vines has 16.7 million subscribers on YouTube, has come out with a video to tackle both. It is called ‘Time to be a Hero’ and focusses on the WhatsApp forwards being circulated about Coronavirus. Says Bhuvan, “This has been going on in my head for a long time. In my own house, I see my parents sharing fake news on WhatsApp because they think it is legit. If this is a scenario in my house, then how many families are there who actually believe this?” So he decided to collect all the fake information related to Coronavirus and compared it with the reality in a 4.05 minute video. The video, which lists out the do’s and don’ts while providing the links to WHO and Ministry of Health and Welfare site in a conversational manner, a style which the artiste is known for, has garnered eight million views within three days.

Not just falsehood, Bhuvan also feels that there is always the possibility of a message being misinterpreted which happened with the Prime Minister’s address calling for a lockdown on March 22. He says the message needs to be spelled out to coherently. “I immediately thought that when he asked for a Janta Curfew on Sunday, we are a billion people, many of whom believe everything. He could have specifically emphasised that you should not be stepping out post 22 too as we have to be spoon-fed. The mindset is that if we have to beat the thali or clap, we will do it together. The gravity of the situation was lost on most as many thought that the disease is spreading in China or Italy or even in another Indian states and there is a border, so it cannot cross that. You don’t know who is travelling where and who has brought which virus. People are underestimating the situation,” he asserts.

However, now with people staying at home, there is naturally an explosion in the demand for content. Bhuvan feels that this is a golden opportunity for YouTubers to create content and share it, though he lists out a prerequisite. “The creator has the responsibility that if s/he is creating a seven-minute comedy, then s/he should also create an awareness video for the audience as they will listen to that too even if they don’t comply with it in entirety,” he says. Of course, there is the possibility that the repetitions from different people might be irritating for the audience but “it is the only way to reinforce the message.” He goes on to point out, “The YouTube community is a vast market and each of the creators can do it in their own typical fashion.”

Time and again we have seen comedy being used effectively for discussing a social issue. It has been explored and utilised widely in films, series as well YouTube videos. Bhuvan too believes in the efficacy of the genre. “If you look at my channel history, whenever I do a social issue, I try not to sound preachy. I have 18 characters in BB Ki Vines, so I can put across my views in the form of a conversation which makes it effective. The message given out as a comedy always registers better,” says Bhuvan who before the lockdown had just started working on his dream project, Dhindora, about which he refuses to divulge much information.

A genre of comedy that has come into its own in the past few years in India is the one which takes a political stand. However, for Bhuvan, every art form is like an opposition. “Someone can voice their opinion and dissent through music or through stand-up or through painting. The political views for or against any issue are always there and artistes reflect it. What has made it really popular in India is that the younger generation is taking politics seriously. Earlier, elderly people discussed it occasionally over tea. That way, it is a refreshing change,” he says.

However, scrolling through his channel reveals that there is nothing which would qualify as a political satire or comedy. Bhuvan laughs as he says, “I personally don’t like getting into politics. I know very little about it and half knowledge is the worst. And you should not speak if you have one-sided or half-baked opinion. Politics is not my cup of tea.”

While political content might be absent, BB Ki Vines is replete with cuss words and that is often the reason why it has received a lot of flak. Moreover, very often, while the audience might enjoy a particular episode, it is wary of sharing it further unless it is with a group of friends. Bhuvan is upfront and says, “I am from Delhi and let that be the end of discussion.” He goes on to explain the content that he puts out, “If someone follows my channel closely, they know that the cuss words are there when three friends are together or if Titu Maama makes an appearance. Truth is that my friends have never talked without using slangs. And this is true for every friend group across the world. It is a part of our life. The only difference is that I am a little transparent while others are hiding it.” He believes that it is nothing but “sheer hypocrisy” when people profess to be fans of Russell Peters or claim to have enjoyed American Pie or Euro Trip but are critical of the content that he puts out. “I am not showing nudity or anything. If someone is criticising me for my choice of language, it is nothing but sheer hypocrisy,” he asserts.

While India and Indians might be critical of the content being put out, for Bhuvan, the country and its people have acted as a source of inspiration. “The country is chalta phirta (fertile ground) meme material. Everyday, a lakh people can create a thousand different videos on different topics because there is so much comedy and content happening around us. India still wouldn’t run out of content,” says Bhuvan, who works on observation which the lockdown has put on hold for a bit. To apply this in practice, the YouTuber travels in the metro and sits in a random coach. “When I look at people, I see how they behave and pick at least one trait. Observation is important and we need to be aware and alert to everything around you,” he says.

However, comedy and YouTube videos was not what he had set out to do, though he had his heart set on being a performer from the very beginning. Bhuvan used to sing at a restaurant in Delhi when he saw a news story, which had a TV reporter interviewing a woman during the Kashmir floods. “Her son had disappeared and the reporter was asking, ‘Kaisa lag raha hai aapko aapka bachcha baadh me gayab ho gaya? (How do you feel as your son has disappeared during the floods?)’ She replied, ‘Kaisa lagega? (How will I feel?)’ I thought this is typical Indian news and an Indian reporter. I made a video about it and posted it on Facebook as at that time, I was unaware that I could use YouTube for this. I thought it was primarily for film trailers. One of my friends told me to separate the videos from my musician profile, so I made a Facebook page called BB Ki Vines. It caught on by word of mouth and people started following me,” recalls Bhuvan who still finds his escape route in music as he tells us, “When I am done writing jokes and creating content, I play the small keyboard that I keep in my room. That is how I get out of stress and anxiety.”

However, he has spread his wings beyond music and videos and even acted in a short film, Plus Minus. Bhuvan happened to be in the right place at the right time to bag this. “I was lucky to be in that room when director Jyoti Kapoor Das and the producer were discussing that they were planning a story on Baba Harbhajan Singh. He is the soldier, who, it is believed, continues to guard the Indo-China border, long after his death. I was really intrigued and wanted a narration. When I heard it, I was like ‘let’s do it’. What made the experience different was that for once, I was not holding a phone in my hand,” he says with a laugh and the fact that he worked with actor Divya Dutta made it special. “Sone pe suhaga ho gaya (icing on the cake),” he adds.

Bhuvan has also received several awards including the ‘Entertainer of the Year’ at Cannes last year, recognising the way he is extending his boundaries. Does he see Indian artistes across board getting recognition worldwide? “In every art form, India is right there. I am glad that people across the globe are appreciating us. Bollywood films were already a hit abroad. But now people have started talking about YouTube as well as there is diversity of content. There is comedy as well as bloggers who create cooking, beauty, travel and more content,” he says and points out that it seems while the content is exploding there are not enough viewers. He gives several parallels to explain the situation and says, “During 90s, every second house had a bat and ball as everyone wanted to be a cricketer. Then there was the phase of the Indian Idol and everyone aspired to be Abhijeet Sawant. Currently, it is the same scenario as every second house has a YouTuber. It is growing rapidly.”

When asked about his future plans, the artiste points out that he does not know beyond two days from now. “I know what I have to do on Saturday or Sunday but I don’t think ahead of that. I take life as it comes and have stopped having any expectations from it,” says Bhuvan.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/observational-artiste-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/observational-artiste.html
143,26-3-20,In short,"Keeping in mind the risk of Coronavirus, the biggest adverse effect of the lockdown has been on the animals, roaming on the deserted roads for food and water. Experts say that if these animals start dying due to hunger and thirst, it will be very difficult for the administration to get rid of the infectious diseases arising from them. Ashima Sharma, founder of the NGO Devbhoomi Animal, said, “We decided to provide them food. So we gathered milk, bread and roti with our own expenses to feed them.

They all are currently posted at PS Mundka, outer district, in recognition of their extraordinary acts of courage.

Here are the details of police personnel and their act of courage.

Out of turn promotion

Currently posted at PS Dwarka Sector 23, Constable Rajiv (number 2404/DW) joined Delhi Police in 2010 as a constable and now, has been granted out of turn promotion by CP, Delhi, for showing exemplary courage in rounding up the armed desperate criminals without caring for his life. He retaliated and fired at the criminals despite sustaining serious bullet injuries on his face while falling on the ground. Rajiv had to be admitted in a hospital and is currently under observation in ICU.

The constable was patrolling in the area along with DHG Ajay Kumar on the intervening night of March 16 near L&T construction site in Bharthal village, Sector 26, Dwarka. They received information from the local guard about firing at the construction site and rushed to the spot. However, the assailants had escaped by then. They searched the area for the fleeing assailants and observed some suspicious movements in a plot located at the outer periphery of the area. They entered the premises and questioned those who they were suspicious about. All the four suspected persons had ran away towards different directions. The personnel managed to overpower one of the fleeing suspects and while taking him for further questioning to the PS Dwarka Sector 23, the escaped three assailants returned and opened fire at Rajiv in order to get their associate released from their custody. Rajiv, showing exemplary courage, retaliated against and fired at the assailants despite sustaining serious bullet injury on his face.

Later, the police carried out vigorous investigation and arrested two assailants within 12 hours of the incident and subsequently more other accused were arrested.

Asadharan Karya Puraskar

Currently posted at DCP office complaint branch, central district, Daryaganj, ASI Ravindra (number 439/C) joined Delhi Police in 1991 as a constable and now, has been conferred with ‘Asadharan Karya Puraskar’ by CP, Delhi for his exceptionally brave work in nabbing one of the accused in a case by going beyond the call of his duty.

On the evening of March 17, he was on his way back to his residence after finishing his duty, when he reached near B-1/30 Building, Noor-E-Illahi, Anand Sagar Road, that he found three persons scuffling with each other and also heard the sound of firing. Before he could understand the complete situation, he saw one person running with a pistol in his hand. He began chasing him. After doing that for 50 metres, he nabbed him with his pistol. Later, the suspected was identified as Imran from Ziauddinpur, New Musrafabad.

Ravindra, later, handled the situation tactfully and persuaded the group. The accused were handed over to local police of PS Bhajanpura for further investigation.

Currently posted at PS Mundka, outer district, HC Joginder Singh (number 658/OD), HC Vijay (number 1286/OD), HC Sanej (number 1263/OD) and HC Krishan (number 627/OD) have been conferred with the ‘Asadharan Karya Puraskar’ by CP, Delhi for showing high sense of responsibility in their official duties and putting their lives in danger in the line of duty.

On March 19, Joginder was deployed on QRT vehicle from 8 am to 8 pm. During patrolling, when he reached at Loknayak Puram, Bakkarwala, he could hear screams of a woman nearby. Later, the woman informed him that two men robbed her gold chain and locket at gun point and ran away. Joginder immediately informed the SHO/Mundka as well as the nearby beat staff and started chasing the accused men. One of the accused opened fire on Joginder, who retaliated the fire with one round in self-defence. During this, both the accused reached the factory area of village Hirankudna and robbed a motorcycle at gun point and fled. Krishan, deployed at Hirankudna Mor, noticed both accused persons reaching the point on the robbed motorcycle. On seeing the police, one of the accused persons opened fired aiming at Vijay. In retaliation, Vijay fired two rounds and caught hold of one of the accused persons while Krishan overpowered the second one. The two were later identified as Dharmender from JJ Colony, Sawada, Delhi and Romil from Jamrud Pur, Greater Kailash I, Delhi.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/acts-of-courage-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/acts-of-courage.html

146,26-3-20,Kane ‘will be off’ if Spurs don’t win trophies,"Tottenham forward Harry Kane will leave the club next year if they fail to win a trophy in that time, Premier League all-time top-scorer Alan Shearer has warned.

Kane is yet to lift silverware in his career despite an eye-catching goalscoring record for both club and country.

The England captain has not played since January due to a serious hamstring injury and was on the losing side as Tottenham lost to Liverpool in last season’s Champions League final.

That is the closest the 26-year-old has come to major honours and Shearer feels it may be time to move on if that does not change in the coming months.

“My guess is, if he doesn’t win anything in the next 12 months then he has to leave,” Shearer told the Match of the Day: Top 10 podcast.

“He’ll do another year, I think, and if nothing comes in terms of trophies, then he’ll be off.”

Shearer sits at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 260 goals.

Asked if Kane, currently on 136 goals, could one day overtake his tally, the former Blackburn and Newcastle striker said: “It depends on his fitness, where he is and what success he’s had at whatever club he’s at — whether that’s at Spurs or somewhere else.

“It’s going to be hard for him. He’s on 136 and there’s a lot of ‘ifs’ being asked — if he stays fit or if he stays in the Premier League. It’s going to be tough, but it’s going to go one day.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kane----will-be-off----if-spurs-don---t-win-trophies.html
147,26-3-20,Shreyas eagerly awaits representing India in Tests,"Test cricket is ultimate test of batsmanship and Shreyas Iyer is now “eargerly waiting” to don the India whites having cemented his place in limited overs format.

The stylish right-hander has already made a mark as a No 4 in white ball formats and there is a lot of buzz that once India again play Tests at the end of the year, he might replace a big name in that Indian middle order.

Asked about his Test ambitions, Shreyas during an interactive session on Twitter said: “It is the ultimate test. It’s every cricketer’s dream to play Test cricket. I’m eagerly waiting for my opportunity to represent my country in whites also.”

Shreyas, who is also the skipper of Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League, and has worked with Ricky Pointing, also said that the freedom which the former Aussie skipper gives to a player was unbelievable.

“He is an outstanding coach to work under and the amount of freedom he gives you is mesmerizing,” added the stylish Mumbaikar when asked about Ponting’s coaching style.

Shreyas also had words of gratitude for his India teammate and senior pro Rohit Sharma.

“(Rohit) is a very good personality to be around. He’s very motivating, caring towards his teammates,” said Shreyas about Sharma.

He was also asked one word for his skipper Virat Kohli and he replied, “Relentless”.

He also said that cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar, former England batsman Kevin Pietersen, former South African batsman Ab De Villiers, Rohit Sharma and Kohli were his role models.

The middle-order batsman also picked former India pacer Zaheer Khan as his all time favorite India bowler and Jemimah Rodriques as his favorite women’s cricketer.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shreyas-eagerly-awaits-representing-india-in-tests.html
148,26-3-20,Kohli & boys handed customised indoor workout routines,"With the government calling for a lockdown to fight the coronavirus outbreak, the Indian cricketers are all home and spending time with their families. But strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb in consultation with physio Nitin Patel has customised routines for Virat Kohli and boys to ensure they stay in top shape despite the pandemic induced break.

Sources in the team management said that the duo of Webb and Patel have made player specific routines for all the contracted players to ensure that they can continue to stay in shape.

“All the players, irrespective of whether they play red-ball cricket or white-ball cricket or all formats have been given fitness routines which they are to follow and give updates to Webb and Patel from time to time. The routines have been created keeping in mind the demands of the players. So, for example, a bowler will has been given exercises which work to make his core and lower body strong. Similarly, a batsman has been given exercises which also work on his shoulders and wrists,” the source explained.

The source further added that the routines have been made keeping in mind the workout patterns of the players.

“So, for example, someone like a Kohli loves to train with weights as well. So, his routine would have weights involved like the clean and jerk and deadlifts and other exercises. While another player might be more comfortable doing free-hand exercises, so in that case, he has been given more free weight functional training options,” the source pointed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli---boys-handed-customised-indoor-workout-routines.html
149,26-3-20,Feverish fans fuelled virus at Italy CL match,"Ecstatic fans cheering and hugging at the Champion’s League game between Atalanta and Valencia in February boosted the spread of the coronavirus, the mayor of the worst-hit Italian city said on Tuesday.

Bergamo, in the northern Lombardy region, is now Italy’s worst-hit province, with nearly 6,728 infections.

Its football team Atalanta had been having a stellar season, with a historic Champions League qualification. Its game against Spanish rival Valencia on February 19 at the San Siro stadium in Milan had been feverishly awaited by fans.

Atalanta pulled off a stunning 4-1 victory — each goal met with shouts of glee, fans clutching at each other in excitement.

Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori told foreign journalists the match was “among the sad explanations” for the high infection rate in the city and wider province.

“Some 40,000 Bergamo inhabitants went to Milan to watch the game. Others watched it from their homes, in families, in groups, at the bar,” he said.

“It’s clear that evening was a situation in which the virus was widely spread,” he added.

But Gori said he didn’t think it was “the starting point”.

Instead he believed Bergamo’s troubles began when a patient at the Fenaroli Hospital in Alzano was admitted with coronavirus but it went undetected, allowing him to infect others.

Two weeks after the historic match in Milan the curve of the number of those infected in Bergamo began to rise steeply and the town has become the epicentre for the pandemic in Europe.

Some 4,178 people have died so far in Lombardy, out of a total of over 6,820 in Italy.

Spanish club Valencia have said that 35 per cent of their team and staff have tested positive for coronavirus, following the trip to Milan.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/feverish-fans-fuelled-virus-at-italy-cl-match.html
150,26-3-20,Trend Blazer,"Arjun recalls mother on death anniversary

Actor Arjun Kapoor penned an emotional note on his mother Mona Shourie’s eighth death anniversary. He said that he has managed to survive eight years without her.

Arjun tweeted a photograph of himself along with his sister Anshula, and mother Mona.

He captioned it, “I wish I could be at home like this today and would have felt safe and maybe even smiled more than anyone has ever seen me smile. It’s been eight years today since you left us mom. The world has come to a standstill now but mine and Anshula’s world was shattered when you left. We have tried to pick up the pieces. Though some days are tougher than the others.”

‘It is unimaginable for me, as a parent, to think of being separated from my children during nation lockdown. While the world talks about humanity, I think it represents more than just an idea, especially for parents sharing custody of their kids and how to keep their kids close to them without infringing on the right of the other.’

—Hrithik Roshan

Actor Farhan Akhtar, who is currently working on his forthcoming film, Toofaan, believes that his key to success is discipline.

Inspired by real life, the actor commented on what mattered the most while prepping for his character, “Discipline changes the game. Mental strength and will power is what separates people who are supremely fit from those who are not. A realistic goal is important. You can’t be Brad Pitt in three days.”

151,26-3-20,The senior hour,"Stores around the world are setting up special shopping timings for old citizens amid Coronavirus fears

As senior citizens deal with anxiety about the Coronavirus, grocery store chains and other retailers have come up with a way to ease their fears — shopping times reserved exclusively for them.

Target, Whole Foods, Walmart and Dollar General, as well as supermarkets in Europe, began dedicating early morning shopping times for older customers this week. The theory is that allowing seniors to shop among smaller crowds could reduce their chances of acquiring the virus and give them first crack at buying hand sanitiser and other products that have been hard to find because of panic shopping.

The idea seems to have worked well in smaller shops but backfired in some larger stores, where big crowds made “social distancing” difficult.

“If you didn’t have coronavirus before you got there, you probably do now,” said Roger Glenn Miller, 82, after he showed up on a recent morning at a Stop & Shop grocery store in North Providence, Rhode Island, along with about 200 other seniors.

Don Gregson, 81, had a similar experience at the same shop. Gregson said he expected to shop with a small group of seniors but instead found aisles crowded with people.

When he saw the number of people in the store, Gregson slipped on a surgical mask he carries in his pocket, then bought four gallons (15 litres) of distilled water for the machine he needs for sleep apnea.

“I’m sure they were trying to do the right thing, but somehow the planning went astray,” he said.

The Massachusetts-based chain, which has started offering the special shopping time for seniors every day, said in a statement that it is asking its customers to consider staggering the days they shop “to ensure a less crowded environment as well as for everyone to exercise caution and social distancing while shopping.”

Ernest Hodge, 72, had a much smoother experience at a Dollar General store just north of Richmond. Hodge showed up at 8 am sharp Wednesday, wearing a face mask and blue rubber gloves to protect himself. He was able to shop among just a half-dozen other seniors and got most of what he needed, including disinfecting wipes, spray cleaner and bottled water.

Hodge said he was happy when he heard about the special shopping hours because he is trying to limit his exposure to people. “I get off work, I go home. I don’t come out again unless it’s a must,” he said.

Dollar General is reserving the first hour of shopping every day for seniors at its more than 16,000 stores. Target has set aside an hour every Wednesday morning for vulnerable shoppers, including the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions. Walmart said it will host an hour-long “senior shopping event” every Tuesday for customers who are 60 and above, one hour before stores open to the general public.

In South Africa, a supermarket chain, Pick n Pay, said that it will open all its markets an hour early every Wednesday for shoppers over 65.

Sainsbury’s, one of the largest supermarket chains in the UK, reserved the first hour of shopping in its stores Thursday for elderly and other vulnerable customers.

Jim Gibson, 72, from Crofton Park, southeast London, went to his local superstore in Bell Green, where he said that he had a “relatively trauma-free” experience except for the fact that some younger shoppers appeared to ignore the request to reserve the hour for senior citizens.

Most of the products he was looking for were there, though many canned items were “leaping off the shelves” and he couldn’t get the medicines that he and his 73-year-old wife want “for love or money.”

William Petri, a professor in the University of Virginia’s Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, said setting aside dedicated times for seniors to shop makes sense. He added that health officials have found that many people who are infected don’t have symptoms right away but are still infectious.

“That’s an even better reason to try to isolate those who are most vulnerable, like the elderly, from younger people through dedicated shopping hours,” he said. However, Petri suggested that it would be even better for seniors to get groceries delivered to their homes.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-senior-hour-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-senior-hour.html

Let’s follow what our PM advised in his address and stay safe. Also, essential services will be operational. Please don’t put yourself at risk by overcrowding shops to stock up. #Covid19India.”

Aditi Rao Hydari tweeted: “21-day lockdown. Let’s be responsible and stay home. if we don’t we’re in for big trouble and could have an even longer lockdown as well as a catastrophic economy. Help us help ourselves. 21 days of discipline is all it takes, please! Let’s do this.”

She tweeted, “I feel the government needs to give some more time for people to stock up. I understand and applaud the government’s efforts to combat the #coronavirus but this panic is going to create more #COVID-19 patients than ever!”

157,26-3-20,BWF looking at possibility of freezing rankings,"The Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Wednesday said it might freeze the world rankings for a while as it works on a “fair solution” to the Olympic qualification process after the COVID-19 pandemic forced a postponement of Tokyo Games.

There have been growing calls to freeze the world rankings after cancellations and postponements wrecked the sport’s calendar. Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal, B Sai Praneeth, Parupalli Kashyap and H S Prannoy have been leading the way in expressing concerns.

“For our athletes, we will review any impacts on the Olympic and Paralympic qualification system to ensure a fair solution is found to qualify players for the postponed Games,” the BWF said in a statement.

“BWF, in the short-term, is also looking into the possibility of freezing World Rankings until international tournaments start again.

“However, we are still working on the technical solution to ensure the freezing and eventual un-freezing of World Rankings works fairly for all players and we will announce this shortly.”

Shuttlers in the singles competition have to be inside top-16 of world rankings to qualify for the Olympics. In doubles, a country can field one pair if they are in the top 16 and two if both pairs are in the top eight.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bwf-looking-at-possibility-of-freezing-rankings.html

159,26-3-20,"Still looking forward, fingers crossed for IPL 2020: Rohit","Star Indian opener and Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma felt that the time he spent with Ricky Ponting at the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise was ""magic.""

Ponting was captain of MI in 2013, when they were yet to win an IPL title. He resigned from the post and handed it over to Rohit but stayed on as part of the coaching staff. His contribution is often seen instrumental in helping MI win their maiden IPL title that year and he would return to the franchise as a head coach, before moving to Delhi Capitals.

""Ricky Ponting to me was magic,"" said Rohit on Thursday in an interaction with former England captain Kevin Pietersen on Instagram.

""The way he handled the team when he was captain during the first half and then he gave the captaincy to me midway. That takes a lot of guts and after that to be as involved as he was as a support staff member. He was supporting all the younger players in the team and he was guiding me in captaincy,"" said Rohit.

Rohit said that he feels MI have made a few good purchases at the auction this year and hopes that the season starts whenever things settle.

""We have got a few good additions to the squad like Chris Lynn, Trent Boult, Nathan Coulter-Nile.

""Boult is a good buy on a pitch like Wankhede with the swinging ball, I was looking forward to that. Alongwith (Jasprit) Bumrah he would have made a good combination. Still looking forward, fingers crossed. At some stage if things settle down, it should happen,"" said Rohit.

Rohit also said that current Mumbai Indians coach Mahela Jayawardene is someone who gives a lot of clarity to his players. ""Mahela is very calm, very composed. He only tells you to do things he sees as right or not to do them if they are wrong. His messages are very clear,"" said Rohit.

The 2020 season of the IPL was scheduled to start on March 29 with defendng champions MI facing Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium in what was a repeat of the 2019 final. However the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic forced the organisers to push the tentative starting date to April 15, which itself is now clouded in uncertainty due to the three-week lockdown declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi throughout the country.

""The special flight will be operated as per Government of India's request and the airline will deploy its Boeing 737 aircraft for the assignment,"" the low-cost carrier said in its press release.

The airline's entire commercial passenger aircraft fleet of 82 Boeing 737, two Airbus A320 and 32 Bombardier Q-400s is currently grounded as the government has suspended domestic and international flight operations to curb the spread of coronavirus.

However, the airline's five B737 freighter aircraft have been operating as usual as there is no ban on cargo flights.

The aircraft, which will be used for Sunday's special flight, will be thoroughly cleaned and fumigated upon its return to Delhi and the airline will follow all the protocols for its crew members, the release noted.

The flight will take off at 1.40 am from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International airport and land in Jodhpur airport at 2.55 am on March 29, the airline said.

161,26-3-20,"COVID-19: Sonia writes to PM, voices support to lockdown","Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, voicing her support to the 21-day lockdown announced by the PM in view of the coronavirus outbreak, and suggested several measures such as protection of doctors, easing the supply chains and deferment of loans.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic sweeping across the world had caused serious public health concerns, anguish and apprehensions in India, she wrote in her letter to the prime minister.

""It has imperiled lives and put at risk the lives and livelihoods of millions, particularly, the most vulnerable sections of our society. The entire nation stands as one in solidarity in the fight to halt and defeat the Corona pandemic,"" Gandhi added.

She noted that the 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by the prime minister as a measure to fight the coronavirus was a welcome step.

""As President of the Indian National Congress, I would like to state that we will support and collaborate fully with every step taken by the Union Government to ensure the containment of the pandemic,"" Gandhi said.

At this challenging and uncertain time, she said it was imperative for each one of us to rise above partisan interests and honour our duty towards our country and indeed, towards humanity.

""It is in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation therefore, that I would like to suggest some measures that I believe will help us address the massive health crisis we are about to face and to ameliorate the immense economic and existential pain that vulnerable sections of our society will soon be subjected to,"" the Congress chief said.

She stressed on the need to arm doctors, nurses and health workers with personal protection equipment, including N-95 masks and hazmat suits.

""Let us ensure the opening and scaling up of manufacture and supply of these items so that not a single health professional faces the predicament of contracting or passing on COVID-19 owing to unavailability of 'Personal Protection Equipment',"" Gandhi said.

Announcing a special ""Risk Allowance"" for doctors, nurses and health workers for a period of six months retrospectively from March 1 was imperative, she added.

Noting that many businesses and companies were laying off and retrenching large numbers of regular and temporary employees, Gandhi said, ""It would be in order for the Union Government to immediately put in place broad-based social protection measures, including direct cash transfer, to these sections to tide over the period of difficulty.""

She also sought a deferment of all loan recoveries up to six months, including those for farmers and the salaried class.

162,26-3-20,Hundreds of people stranded at AP-Telangana checkpoints,"Hundreds of people were left stranded at various checkpoints on the Andhra Pradesh- Telangana borders since Wednesday night as authorities refused to let them into the state in view of the coronavirus lockdown, exposing the communication gap and lack of coordination between the authorities of the two States.

After frantic SOS calls by the stranded persons, including pregnant women and children, AP authorities finally agreed to let them in, on the condition that they be shifted to a quarantine facility.

While those who accepted the government directive were allowed in, others were left at the border points.

As news came in that the student hostels and paying guest facilities were being re-opened in Hyderabad, most of the students chose to turn back.

The AP government said in a release on Thursday morning that 44 people who came from Hyderabad were shifted to a quarantine facility at Nuzividu.

While some others went back to Hyderabad, over 200 persons who refused to move into quarantine were also being sent back, the release said.

""Only those persons with a 'clean certificate' for valid medical reasons are being permitted to enter into the state. Others will not be allowed under any circumstances,"" the release added.

It all began since late Wednesday evening when people started reaching the border checkpoint at Garikapadu on the National Highway-64.

They carried a special travel permit issued by police authorities in Hyderabad after student hostels and paying guest facilities were abruptly shut down.

Intervention of the local MLA and Government Whip Samineni Udayabhanu did not help as he blamed lack of coordination between the two states authorities for the situation.

Local Deputy Superintendent of Police Ramana Murthy maintained that since the lockdown was in force and the inter-state borders have been sealed, no vehicle or person could be allowed into the state.

The stranded passengers faced severe hardship as there was no water or food in the vicinity.

Also, the panic-stricken passengers were huddled in a group as they awaited some intervention from the higher-ups to end the impasse.

Vijayawada Sub-Collector H M Dhyanachandra visited the spot and said the passengers would be moved to a quarantine facility at Nuzividu, some 40-km away, for isolation and medical examination.

Over 600 people, including a few women and children, set off from Hyderabad in cabs after obtaining special travel permits from the local police. After a smooth ride up to Garikapadu, the borderline between the two states, the vehicles were stopped at around 3.30 pm, leaving the passengers stranded.

""We are a group of students and have been asked to vacate our hostels. The Hyderabad police gave us special travel permit to return to our native place and accordingly we hired a cab and started our journey this morning. We were blocked at this place as the AP police are unwilling to let us in,"" a student said.

Another person said he was travelling with his wife, into her ninth month pregnancy, after a medical check-up in Hyderabad. ""Despite our situation, the police are not willing to let us travel to our destination,"" he lamented.

The local MLA arrived on the scene and took up the stranded passengers' case with the police but to no avail.

""Those who were going to Guntur from Hyderabad were allowed via Piduguralla but here they blocked everything.

There is a clear lack of coordination between the officials of the two states,"" Udayabhanu said.

He said the passengers could be permitted further journey after conducting required thermal screening tests.

The issue was taken to Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy's notice but to no avail, as the officials did not relent.

On Thursday, Guntur district Joint Collector Dinesh Kumar said medical teams were being sent to the border checkpoints to screen the passengers.

""As per rules, the passengers cannot be sent to their villages and they only have to go to a quarantine facility.

Only those who agree to this will be allowed into the state,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hundreds-of-people-stranded-at-ap-telangana-checkpoints-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hundreds-of-people-stranded-at-ap-telangana-checkpoints.html

In a joint digital press conference with Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that one case of coronavirus was reported in Delhi in past 24 hours taking the total number of such cases to 36.

Also, concerned SDMs and ACPs have been directed to ensure shops selling groceries, vegetables and milk remain open and essential items are adequately stocked in their respective areas, Baijal said.

Kejriwal said that people are largely keeping indoors and the situation is ""under control"" but more caution was needed to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.

He said that among the 36 cases of virus infection, 26 people were those who returned recently from foreign countries and infected others.

He said despite a Mohalla Clinic doctor and his family testing positive for coronavirus, the centres will not be closed and all precautions are being taken.

""We will continue to conduct tests on doctors, paramedical staff who are engaged in treating COVID-19 patients,"" the chief minister said.

The number of coronavirus cases climbed to 649 in India on Thursday and the death toll rose to 13.

“It will be a great success, and I look forward to being there!”

Trump faces a reelection battle this year and his campaign has likewise been upended by the global pandemic, which has prompted governments to order mass shutdowns of movement and economic activity.

166,26-3-20,"IOA, Sports Ministry to revise preparation plans","The Indian Olympic Association on Wednesday conceded that careers of some athletes would be impacted by the postponement of Tokyo Olympics and the IOA would look to address this when it makes revised preparation plans in consultation with the sports ministry.

Like all stakeholders, the IOA on Tuesday welcomed the International Olympic Committee’s decision to postpone the Summer Games.

“A one-year postponement might impact the career/ qualification and plans of some athletes, which would be addressed in the coming months and all necessary support would also be extended by us,” IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said in a letter to the IOC and the Tokyo Games organisers without specifying any names.

“I am holding discussions and there would be meetings scheduled with the Federations after the locked-down in India is over. Athletes’ safety is our utmost priority now.

“We would be also be consulting with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in revising the preparation plans,” he added.

While the postponement of the Games has brought relief to the athletes, it has also made some of them uncertain about the qualification process, which was abandoned in most sports due to the deadly outbreak.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioa--sports-ministry-to-revise-preparation-plans.html
167,26-3-20,Coaches back to drawing board,"The athletes are playing the waiting game for now but coaches involved with India’s Olympic-bound bunch have already put their thinking hats on to redraw the preparation plans a day after the Games got postponed to 2021.

“It is going to affect the shooters in a big way, especially the young ones who are appearing in their first Olympics. We have been preparing for the past three years. Having said that, we need to accept this without any complaints,” national pistol shooting coach Jaspal Rana said.

So far, close to 80 Indian athletes have qualified for the Games and the number is expected to swell once the qualifiers re-start.

Shooters are almost always considered India’s best bet for Olympic medals.

In Tokyo, 15 of them — eight men and seven women — will take aim for medals, including a bunch of exciting teenagers competing in their maiden Olympics.

Nine boxers and an equal number of track and field athletes have also made the cut so far.

“I will redraw the plans only after the dates for the 2021 Games are out. We need to know when are the next qualifiers. We aren’t really worried because we have got qualification in nine out of 13 weight categories,” said boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva, referring to the five men and four women, who have already made the cut for Tokyo.

Boxing was scheduled to have a world qualifying event in May, which was postponed. India will have a shot at more Olympic slots whenever that tournament takes place.

“These are unreal times...The planning going forward would be focussed mostly on building up rather than qualifying. We are not as concerned as some others, who did not have enough qualifications in the Asian tournament (in Jordan),” Nieva said.

Deputy national athletics coach P Radhakrishnan Nair struck a note of skepticism on what can be achieved and feels a postponement till 2022 would have been better.

Indian athletics has not produced an Olympic medallist till date.

“It will be a challenge for us as far as planning of training and competition schedule is concerned. In this situation of lockdown I feel the athletics season is as good as over for this year,” Nair said, referring to the nationwide lockdown till April 15.

“I don’t think we can start doing anything before September or October. Then the seven-eight months before the Olympics (in 2021) may not be enough. Had it been 2022, it would have been better,” he added.

National badminton coach Pullela Gopichand went with the majority view and said he doesn’t expect any major glitch in the shuttlers’ build-up.

Going by current rankings, P V Sindhu, B Sai Praneeth and the men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy are assured of an Olympic berth.

“I think a year is a good time...We will have enough time to come back. So, I don’t think there will be any problems or negative effect on preparations,” he asserted.

Another strong medal bet for India is wrestling and Vinesh Phogat, one of the biggest stars among the Indian hopefuls, will take the break positively, according to her coach Woller Akos.

“We need to look at the positive side with Vinesh. We have got one more year to prepare against the best opponents,” the Hungarian said, asserting that the Asian Games champion is more than ready for any challenge even right now.

“An athlete needs to be a maximalist. She (Vinesh) is ready to follow our dreams and preparation,” he added while talking about the lone woman among four wrestlers to have qualified for Tokyo.

National weightlifting coach Vijay Sharma said he will have to rework his planning to ensure that the one year in hand is put to best use.

Only former world champion Mirabai Chanu is currently assured of a Tokyo ticket among the lifters.

“We will have to plan everything again now. We are now waiting for guidelines on the new qualifying system, accordingly, we will plan our training,” he said.

“With the cancellation of the Asian Championships (earlier) we changed our plan a bit but now with the Olympic postponement, it will change completely. We will try and find the best way to benefit from this situation,” he added.

Rising Table Tennis player G Sathiyan’s coach S Raman, a former national champion, welcomed the postponement.

Based on current rankings, Sathiyan is eligible for the Tokyo men’s doubles event along with veteran A Sharath Kamal.

“Right decision and should not have come later than now as it would have confused players...You don’t want panic training and the resultant virus among community of athletes,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/coaches-back-to-drawing-board.html

The 2020 Games were delayed until “no later than summer 2021” by the IOC and Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe on Tuesday, but Estanguet said the first postponement of an Olympics during peacetime would not affect the Paris edition, which will now be staged three years after the Tokyo event.

“It was the best decision for the athletes, for all the players in the Games,” added Estanguet.

169,26-3-20,Rescheduled Oly need sacrifices from all stakeholders: Bach,"International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach on Wednesday said that the postponed Tokyo Games would require “sacrifices and compromises” from all sides to make them work.

“These postponed Olympic Games will need sacrifices, will need compromises by all of the stakeholders,” Bach told reporters in a conference call the day after the IOC decided to delay the 2020 Games.

The IOC’s role, Bach said, was “to make the Olympic dreams of athletes come true”.

He admitted that cancelling the Tokyo Games was “discussed and considered”, but said: “It was very clear from the beginning that cancellation was not something the IOC would in any way favour.”

It is the first Olympic Games in peacetime to be postponed.

Bach said the rescheduling of the Games in 2021 remained a “very challenging question”.

A taskforce, named Here We Go, had been created to examine the issue, Bach added, saying the first port of call would be with the 33 international federations, likely starting with a conference call on Thursday.

“The first step, we have to see with them, to see what the options are. We also have to take into account the sports calendar around the Olympic Games,” the German said.

The rescheduling, he added, “is not restricted just to the summer months. All the options are on the table, before and including the summer of 2021”.

Both World Athletics and the International Swimming Federation say they are prepared to move their 2021 world championships to accommodate the rescheduled Games.

170,26-3-20,Stokes continues IPL preparations despite cancellation threat,"Star England all-rounder Ben Stokes continues to train for the 13th IPL even though he is aware that the T20 league may become yet another sporting event to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The league was originally scheduled to start on March 29 in Mumbai but it was postponed to April 15 to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 19,000 lives across the globe.

""At the moment my next competitive cricket is going to be in the IPL,"" Stokes, who was bought by Rajasthan Royals in the 2018 IPL auction for Rs 12.5 crore, told the BBC.

""That hasn't changed yet so I have to think I will be playing on April 20.""

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had said last week that the county season would not start until at least the end of May, while England's tour of Sri Lanka was also postponed due to the dreaded disease.

The number of positive cases in India has surpassed the 600-mark, while 11 deaths have been reported so far, prompting the government to put the country under lockdown till April 14 to halt the spread of the virus.

Given the current circumstances, a cancellation of this year's IPL looks inevitable.

However, Stokes said he needs to keep working on his fitness to be ready if and when the IPL happens.

""I have to get my head round that I am playing even though in the back of my mind I know I am probably not,"" he said.

""I have to build up and get myself physically in a position that if it does happen I am good to go. I cannot take three weeks off and expect the body to be ready for April 20 because it doesn't work like that. It might happen and if it does I don't want to be behind.

In 2019, a three-team women's tournament was held featuring sides called IPL Velocity, IPL Trailblazers and IPL Supernovas.

This year, the BCCI had decided to organise a four-team women's T20 challenge to run parallel to the men's IPL playoffs, but now it has been put on hold along with the main event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

India don't have enough women cricketers for a full-fledged IPL but Raj said it can still be conducted if existing IPL franchises own teams to begin the process.

""I agree we don't have the depth in the domestic pool yet, but the key is to get the existing franchises to form teams, even if (only) five or six of them are keen to begin the process because in any case, the BCCI was going to have four teams,"" she said.

""You cannot wait forever; you have to begin at some point, and gradually, year by year, you can keep evolving the league and then bring it down to four foreign players.""

Raj also said that teen sensation Shafali Verma, who impressed with the bat in the T20 World Cup, should be included in the ODIs too.

""It's not a bad idea to consider her for the ODIs. She is young but that should not be a criterion for not giving her opportunities in the ODI side,"" she said.

173,26-3-20,80 crore Indians to get wheat at Rs 2,"A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a 21-day lockdown to prevent the coronavirus spread, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday announced world’s largest food security scheme to benefit 80 crore people across the country.

Briefing media, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that every person coming under this scheme will get 7 kg ration per month for the next three months, including wheat at a cost of Rs 2 per kg and rice at cost of Rs 3 per kg.

“The Government has decided to provide 7 kg per person of foodgrains to 80 crore people under the PDS, which is the world’s largest food security system,” said I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar, detailing the Cabinet decision.

He said PDS wheat provided at Rs 7 per kg earlier is being given at Rs 2 and rice at Rs 3/kg.

Detailing the logistics of supply of wheat, rice and other items to 80 crore people, Javadekar said that all States have been asked to take foodgrains from the Centre in advance for distribution through the PDS and Food Corporation of India (FCI) networks across the country are geared up for this scheme.

Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), the Government is supplying 5 kg of foodgrains per month to over 80 crore people at a highly subsidised price, he added.

175,26-3-20,Indian cases may reach 13L by mid-May: Foreign study,"India could face between 100,000 to 13 lakh confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus by mid-May if the current trend in the growing number of COVID-19 cases continues, according to a report by an international team of scientists.

The report, compiled by COV-IND-19 Study Group, an interdisciplinary team of researchers, said while India seems to have done well in controlling the number of confirmed cases compared to other countries like the US and Italy in the early phase of the pandemic, the country is critically missing a key component in this assessment — the number of truly affected cases.

This factor depends on the extent of testing, the accuracy of the test results, and the frequency and scale of testing of people who may have been exposed but do not show symptoms, the researchers, including Debashree Ray from Johns Hopkins University in the US, said.

“So far, the number of people tested in India has been relatively small. In the absence of widespread testing, it is impossible to quantify the magnitude of ‘community transmission’, in other words, estimate how many are infected outside health care facilities,” the scientists wrote in the report.

“Thus our current estimates are at best underestimates for India based on early phase data,” they said.

According to the report, it is essential for India to adopt “draconian measures” to act before the growth of COVID-19 infections starts to accelerate in the country.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday a total lockdown for 1.3 billion people in India for 21 days, warning that the nation may go back by 21 years and many families could be devastated if we don’t abide by the lockdown rules.

In their analysis, the scientists used data on the number of reported cases in India up to March 16, and applied tools of modelling disease transmission.

They estimated the theoretical number of infected at any given time, and compared projections for India against the US and Italy. The scientists, including those from Delhi School of Economics in New Delhi and the University of Michigan in the US, noted in a blog post on the platform Medium, that the estimates may change as stricter restrictions and measures are adopted by India.

India, according to the researchers, has the most overstretched healthcare system where it is hard to provide care even when the patient volume flowing into hospitals is “normal”.

Citing World Bank data, they said the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in India is only 0.7, compared to 6.5 in France, 11.5 in South Korea, 4.2 in China, 3.4 in Italy, and 2.8 in the US.

Owing to this, the scientists said, the predicted surge in the number of cases may make it impossible for the healthcare providers in India to support the sheer volume of cases.

The report also identified the most vulnerable groups of population in India. Citing multiple studies, the researchers said the number of people in the country without an insurance policy stretched to about 1,100 million as of 2014, with the number of men and women with hypertension, one of the major risk factors for death from COVID-19, being more than 300 million people.

Without enforcing any intervention in the country, the scientists predicted that the number of cases may exceed the estimated capacity of hospital beds in India, which stands at 70 beds per 100,000 Indians.

They cautioned that the critically ill COVID-19 patients —about 5-10 per cent of those infected — will require ICU beds, which make up between 5 and 10 per cent of bed capacity in Indian hospitals.

The scientists, however, said their estimates came with limitations, including the uncertainty arising from model assumptions of population size, accuracy of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19, and heterogeneity in the implementation of government-initiated interventions.

The number of coronavirus infected cases in India so far is 562, while the death toll due to COVID-19 in the country is revised down to nine, according to Health Ministry data.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-cases-may-reach-13l-by-mid-may--foreign-study-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/indian-cases-may-reach-13l-by-mid-may--foreign-study.html
176,26-3-20,25 Sikhs massacred in Kabul gurdwara attack,"At least 25 worshippers were killed and eight others injured when heavily armed suicide bombers blasted their way into a prominent gurdwara on Wednesday in the heart of Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul, in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority Sikh community in the strife-torn country.

The ISIS terror group, which has targetted Sikhs before in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack on the gurdwara in Shor Bazar area about 07.45 (local time) as 150 worshippers were inside the building. “At least 25 people were killed and 8 others were wounded in the attack at Dharamshala, a Sikh worship place in Kabul,” TOLOnews quoted the Ministry of Interior as saying on the attack that lasted nearly six hours.

“All four suicide bombers who attacked Dharamshala, a Sikh worship area in PD1 of Kabul, were killed after nearly six hours of fighting. Afghan special forces confirmed,” it said in a tweet.

The Ministry said in a statement that 80 people, including women and children, were rescued from the gurdwara.

The ISIS terrorist group, which has targeted Sikhs before in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the latest attack.

The group issued a statement confirming that its members carried out the attack on Sikhs in Kabul city, Khaama Press News Agency reported.

Photos from the blast scene showed security forces carrying wounded people away on stretchers. Some Afghan media outlets shared videos of the family members of victims waiting outside a city hospital in tears.

Police in Kabul said that at least 11 children were rescued from the gurdwara. Sikh lawmaker Nardendar Singh Khalsa told reporters that up to 150 people were praying inside the gurdwara when it came under attack. Khalsa, the only representative of the Sikh community in Afghanistan said he received a call from a worshipper inside the gurdwara, informing him about the attack.

“I rushed over to help. There were about 150 worshippers inside the gurdwara at the time of the attack,” he was quoted as saying by the official Bakhtar News Agency.

“Afghan forces have cleared the first floor of a Sikh worship area in PD1 of Kabul. A number of people have been rescued who were trapped inside the building,” said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack on the gurdwara, TOLOnews reported.

“The attack on the religious sites shows the extreme weakness of the enemy, religious sites should not be vulnerable to attacks and violence,” it quoted Ghani as saying.

The president’s spokesperson described the attack as “yet another heartless, cowardly terrorist attack on a worshipping place in Kabul. The Afghan government strongly condemns today’s senseless attack on Dharamsala Sikh temple.

“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this heinous act,” the spokesperson said.

Former president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the attack on the gurdwara and expressed his condolences to the victims’ families.

Earlier, the country’s main militant group, the Taliban, denied involvement in the attack. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement that the militant group had no link with the attack in Shor Bazar area of Kabul.

In New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the attack on the gurdwara. The Ministry of External Affairs also strongly condemned the terror attack and said the targeting of a religious place in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak reflects the “diabolical mindset” of the perpetrators and their backers.

“India stands ready to extend all possible assistance to the affected families of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan,” it said while expressing condolence to the families of the victims.

“Such cowardly attacks on the places of religious worship of the minority community, especially at this time of COVID-19 pandemic, is reflective of the diabolical mindset of the perpetrators and their backers,” the MEA said.

It said India stood in solidarity with the people, the government and the security forces of Afghanistan in their efforts for bringing peace and security to the country.

“We commend the brave Afghan security forces for their valorous response to the attack and their exemplary courage and dedication to protect the Afghan people and secure the country,” the MEA said.

War-torn Afghanistan is currently mired in a political stalemate with two politicians- Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah - both claiming victory in the presidential election.

The US, keen to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, has been trying to break the deadlock and also save a historic deal it signed with the Taliban militant group that is supposed to pave the way for peace in the country.

The attack comes a day after the US said it would cut its aid to the government by USD 1 billion over frustrations that the political leaders could not reach an agreement and form a team to negotiate with the Taliban.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kabul on Tuesday in a bid to resolve a standoff between President Ghani and his rival Abdullah, who also proclaims himself president following a contested election.

Sikhs have been target of attacks by Islamist militants before in Afghanistan. In July 2018, ISIS terrorists bombed a gathering of Sikhs and Hindus in the eastern city of Jalalabad, killing 19 people and injuring 20.

Awtar Singh Khalsa, one of the country’s best-known Sikh politicians then, was among those killed in the attack.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/25-sikhs-massacred-in-kabul-gurdwara-attack-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/25-sikhs-massacred-in-kabul-gurdwara-attack.html
177,26-3-20,Prince Charles tests COVID-19 +ve,"Britain’s Prince Charles has tested positive for the novel coronavirus after he displayed “mild symptoms” and is now self-isolating, his office said on Wednesday. The 71-year-old heir to the British throne is self-isolating in Scotland with wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who has tested negative for the deadly virus, which has claimed 422 lives in the UK.

“The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus,” the Clarence House statement read. “He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual,” it notes.

In keeping with social distancing advice during the pandemic, Charles has been noticeably using “namaste” as a greeting rather than a handshake when seen in public over the last few weeks, including during an event to mark Commonwealth Day on March 9 at Marlborough House in London.

His wife Camilla, 72, was seek wearing long black gloves during the same event.

“The Duchess of Cornwall has also been tested but does not have the virus. In accordance with Government and medical advice, the Prince and the Duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland,” Clarence House said.

The Royals were tested on Monday after they had flown out to Scotland in a jet on Sunday and the royal couple have remained there since then. The statement adds: “The tests were carried out by the NHS (National Health Service) in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing.

“It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.”

Charles last met 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II “briefly” on March 12, who has been based at Windsor Castle for nearly a week now.

“Her Majesty the Queen remains in good health and is following appropriate advice,” Buckingham Palace said.

Prince Charles’ last public event was a reception and dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief effort on March 12, which took place at Mansion House in London.

Earlier that day, he had attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London, where he also greeted recipients with a ‘namaste’ due to concerns building around the spread of the pandemic.

This comes as Britain entered its second day of a national lockdown. Police are patrolling the streets to enforce the lockdown. According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, there are 428,405 confirmed cases across the world, 19,120 deaths.

178,26-3-20,India and US collaborating on combating COVID-19: Ambassador Sandhu,"India and the US are working together on combating the deadly coronavirus and collaboration is underway in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics of the disease, which so far has taken the lives of more than 20,000 people globally, according to the Indian envoy here.

The deadly coronavirus that first emerged in China's Wuhan city has drastically spread around the world, infecting 471,518 people and causing 21,293 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.

""In the present context of COVID-19 pandemic, close collaboration in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics of the disease is underway, India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.

""India and the United States have had a long-standing productive partnership in the healthcare sector, especially between the research institutions and industries of both countries, he said.

Under the existing bilateral collaboration in healthcare sector- the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the US shared the important reagents with the Translational Health Science Technology Institute in Gurgaon.

Such cooperation is expected to play a big role in developing new therapeutics and testing reagents for the COVID-19.

In addition, India-based vendors of American companies are in touch with the Indian Council of Medical Research to engage and enhance the capabilities for COVID-19 test in India.

""The US will work shoulder to shoulder with India to combat the COVID19 outbreak. Together, we can safeguard our citizens and people everywhere,"" Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Alice G Wells, said in a tweet referring to the cooperation between the two countries.

The United States, she said, stands united with India and echoes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to keep up their fighting spirits.

Cooperation and collaboration in the sector of coronavirus was also discussed between the two countries when President Donald Trump met Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi last month.

Trump and Modi also hailed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that seeks to promote access to high quality, safe, effective, and affordable medications for US and Indian consumers.

In 2012, the Center for Disease Control collaborated with National Centre for Disease Control to establish Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Programme.

This post-graduate field-training programme, modelled after the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), has expanded to two additional hubs at the WHO India Country Office and at the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Epidemiology.

According to the CDC, it has helped strengthen national surveillance for detecting and responding to healthcare associated infections and emerging antimicrobial resistance threats in health facilities in 22 states.

A public-private partnership helped increase capacity to diagnose, treat, and care for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) patients through virtual platforms. In Mumbai, the CDC helped the municipality and local partners, launch an Airborne Infection Control Unit to reduce healthcare-associated transmission of MDR-TB.

The CDC has helped India in implementing a surveillance system in 35 hospitals and 22 states for healthcare associated infections. It has evaluated 346 laboratory facilities across the country to identify needs and trained more than 1,700 laboratorians on quality diagnostic testing/reporting of priority diseases.

183,26-3-20,"Day after headlong rush, Govt ensures supplies","Things stable on Wednesday, Centre asks officials to allay fears on availability of food, medicine, other key items

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a three-week lockdown on Tuesday night to prevent the spread of coronavirus, panicky people flooded the streets to purchase essential items. The mad rush made a mockery of the theme of social distancing. A day later, the Government’s focus shifted to providing essential items, including food, dairy products, medicine, etc, to millions of people across the country.

Things looked far stable on Wednesday. Grocery stores, sabji mandi, milk booths, chemist shops, ATMs, banks, petrol pumps and supply of LPG cylinders were open in most of the States and there was no shortage of supply.

Amid reports of panic purchase of essential commodities in some parts of the country, the Home Ministry asked chief secretaries and DGPs of all States to take action to allay apprehensions and maintain peace and tranquility, and inform people about the availability of food, medicine and other essential commodities. Meanwhile, the Home Ministry has asked State Governments to check the spread of rumours about shortage of food and other essential commodities.

While Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Government is monitoring the availability of essential commodities in the market, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Centre is committed to ensure smooth supply of essential commodious and asked people not go for hoarding.

In a several cities, including Delhi and NCR, vendors were found selling fruits and vegetables on their carts. Petrol pumps were open and supply of LPG gas cylinders was operational. Mother Dairy outlets too were open. Safal, the fruits and vegetable brand of Mother Dairy group, has announced that all its outlets will be operational at full capacity.

Officials of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) claimed that there was no shortage of fruits and vegetables. In Delhi, trading at the Azadpur Mandi, Asia’s biggest wholesale fruits and vegetable market, has come down by 50 per cent in the last two days in the absence of curfew passes to traders.

Meanwhile, top e-commerce sites Flipkart and Amazon have temporarily suspended their services. Flipkart has listed all products as “out of stock” on the search page. Whereas, Amazon will serve only products of high priority. Grocery startup Grofers too suspended operations due to lack of clarity in their listing as an essential service provider while supermarket chain Big Bazaar is continued to offer doorstep delivery services in several States, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Gurgaon, Ranchi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida and States, such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat.

In Jharkhand, the Government has released rate chart of various essential commodities after reports of a few ration shops providing commodities at a higher price while some others selling them in the back market taking advantage of the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the rate-chart, pulse has been fixed at Rs 75 a kg, wheat flour between Rs 22 and Rs 32 per kg, mustard oil is priced between Rs 90 and Rs 95, rice between Rs 20 and Rs 24 each kg, refine oil between Rs 75 and Rs 80 and channa priced at Rs 60 a kg.

PM Modi’s announcement of a 21 lockdown from Tuesday midnight to combat the spread of coronavirus as the only way out to break the coronavirus transmission chain, led to panic-buying of essential items in different parts of the country. Vegetables, fishes, meat and eggs were sold at double the normal price.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh was the first State to announce home-delivery of essential items. Yogi said that more than 10,000 vehicles have been identified for delivering the essentials.

Despite the curfew, people in Punjab and Union Territory of Chandigarh moved out of their homes to buy essential items on Wednesday morning claiming that the authorities failed to ensure their home delivery as promised. While the authorities have fixed different time slots in all districts for the delivery of essential commodities at doorsteps, people at several places complained that they did not get the items especially groceries, fruits and vegetables.

The police representative also said the delivery agents of these companies will be helped by them. Curfew passes will be issued to all delivery persons and all warehouses will be opened. Police personnel at border checks are being sensitised. Home delivery process for the essential items will be made easy by weekend.

Mandeep Singh Randhawa, the Public Relation Officer (PRO), Delhi Police, had a meeting with e-commerce website representatives where they shared the problems faced by them in the movement of essential goods.

“We have issued passes to them and assured that their delivery agents are helped by the police,” said Randhawa.

Earlier, e-commerce portals like BigBasket and Amazon were claiming disruptions in their services due to the restrictions put by the authorities.

One of India’s largest grocery delivery service BigBasket, on their app, said, “Dear Customer, we are not operational due to restrictions imposed by local authorities on the movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by central authorities to enable essential services. We are working with the authorities to be back soon.”

After facing difficulties during the delivery, Flipkart official said they have temporarily suspended its operations and services - including grocery items. The marketplace has decided to halt all orders from March 25 for all three supply chains -- groceries, non-large goods and large items.

“Flipkart has temporarily suspended orders as we assess the possibilities of operating in the lockdown. We are prioritising the safety of our delivery executives and seeking the support of the local Governments and police authorities to meet the needs of our customers as they stay home during this lockdown,” Rajneesh Kumar, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Flipkart, said in a statement.

E-commerce giant Amazon said the company has to temporarily stop taking orders and disable shipments for lower-priority products. “For all pending customer orders on lower-priority products, we are reaching out to customers and giving them a choice to cancel their orders, and receive a refund for prepaid items,” said the company.

The food delivery services, including Swiggy and Zomato, also complained about their delivery boys being stopped by police in Delhi and its peripherals during the food delivery.

“Our delivery partners are facing several hurdles across cities while trying to deliver food which has been classified as an essential service. We are communicating with the relevant authorities and hoping these issues are sorted soon,” said a Zomato official.

Meanwhile, the supermarket chains such as Big Bazaar has offered door delivery of groceries and essential items in some cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Gurugram and states including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat, during the 21-day lockdown.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Delhi Police have also earmarked a separate lane at the Delhi-Noida border for emergency vehicles to pass during the lockdown imposed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The police have also put up a board which reads -- doctors, media, ambulances, police and other exempted vehicles should use the lane. The move comes after many commuters complained that they were having difficulty entering Delhi from Noida amid the lockdown.

In Delhi, several Mother Dairy outlets and local grocery shops witnessed queues to buy essential food items. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said authorities will ensure essential services during the lockdown period and requested people not to panic.

“We will issue e-passes to vegetable-sellers, grocers among others to ensure essential supplies during the lockdown,” Kejriwal said at a joint Press conference with Lt Governor Anil Baijal, amid reports of alleged harassment of vegetable sellers by the police.

“We will ensure strict implementation of lockdown in Delhi,” Baijal said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/passes-for-e-commerce-portals-to-ease-delivery-of-essential-goods-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/passes-for-e-commerce-portals-to-ease-delivery-of-essential-goods.html

On the first day of the three-week countrywide lockdown, the count of confirmed coronavirus cases shot up from 519 on Tuesday to 606 on Wednesday while death toll touched 12 in the country with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of cases at 128, followed by Kerala with 109 cases. Delhi registered five fresh cases. Of the total 606 cases, 42 are cured ones. So far authorities have denied community spread of the disease.

Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu registered their first death on Wednesday. A 65-year-old woman in Ujjain and A 54-year-old man in Madurai died of Covid-19. In its updated figures released on Wednesday morning, the Health Ministry stated that the second death reported in Delhi was Covid-19 negative.

Five more persons tested positive for COVID-19 in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday evening. Kejriwal did not give any details about the new patients, but he did say that only one of the five had a history of foreign travel. The remaining four were either family members of coronavirus patients or had come in close contact with them.

Meanwhile, the Government said of the 64,000 people who arrived in the country since March 21, 8,000 are under quarantine and 56,000 in home isolation.

After the Group of Ministers meeting, Union Health Minister Dr Harshvardhan assured the Centre is making efforts to ensure personal protective equipment and N-95 masks are available in adequate numbers for medical fraternity.

Gujarat, Assam, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Goa, Karnataka, MP and Jammu & Kashmir are also setting up hospitals dedicated for the management of Covid-19.

A total of 118 laboratories have been included in the ICMR network of COVID19 testing while private labs have started collecting samples.

As the cases continue to soar, the GoM called for preparedness on behalf of the States which need to devote adequate resources for creating dedicated COVID-19 hospitals, equipping the medical institutes with PPEs, ventilators and other essential equipment.

The Centre has also asked the States to ensure that essential services and supplies remain open. These include hospitals, medical shops and establishments engaged in manufacturing of medicines, vaccines, sanitisers, masks and medical devices.

Highlighting the critical importance of social distancing as an effective strategy for prevention of COVID-19 and limiting the spread of the disease, Dr Harsh Vardhan, said, “We are fighting an infectious disease. In order to protect ourselves and others, it is highly important that we follow all the protocols, guidelines and directions issued by the Government, failing which may lead to legal actions u/s 188 of IPC.”

186,26-3-20,Centre likely to unveil Rs 1.5 lakh cr stimulus to undo corona downturn,"India is likely to agree an economic stimulus package of more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore ($19.6 billion) to fight a downturn in the country that is currently locked down to stem the spread of coronavirus, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The Government has not yet finalised the package and discussions are ongoing between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office, the Finance Ministry, and Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said both the sources, who asked not to be named as the matter was still under discussion.

One of the sources, a senior Government official, said the stimulus plan could be as large as Rs 2.3 trillion, but final numbers were still in discussion.

The package, which could be announced by the end of the week, will be used to put money directly into the accounts of more than 100 million poor and to support businesses hit the hardest by the lockdown, the sources said.

The Government will also increase its borrowing plan for the fiscal year 2020/21, which starts from April 1, from the current planned gross borrowing of Rs 7.8 lakh crore, both sources said.

The sources added that the Government had asked the RBI to buy some of the Government securities being issued, a move not undertaken by the Indian central bank in decades, due to fears of inflation spiking.

“The RBI will have to buy bonds like other central banks in the world,” the first official said.

The second official added the Government could also use the central bank’s ways-and-means facility — an overdraft facility the RBI offers to the state — if it faces a cash crunch.

The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the plan and the RBI did not immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/centre-likely-to-unveil-rs-1-5-lakh-cr-stimulus-to-undo-corona-downturn.html
187,26-3-20,Novel coronavirus may not spread through tears,"Contrary to some reports, researchers now claim that new coronavirus doesnt spread via tears and it is unlikely that infected patients are shedding virus through eye fluid.

While researchers are certain that coronavirus spreads through mucus and droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing, it is unclear if the virus is spread through other bodily fluids, such as tears, said the study published in the journal Ophthalmology.

There is one important caveat, though.

None of the patients in the study had conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. However, health officials believe pink eye develops in just one per cent to three per cent of people with coronavirus.

For the findings, researchers at National University Hospital in Singapore collected tear samples from 17 patients with COVID-19 from the time they showed symptoms until they recovered about 20 days later.

Neither viral culture nor reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected the virus in their tears throughout the two-week course of the disease, the researchers said.

The study researcher Ivan Seah also took samples from the back of the nose and throat during the same time period.

The findings showed that when a sick person coughs or talks, virus particles can spray from their mouth or nose into another person's face.

You're most likely to inhale these droplets through your mouth or nose, but they can also enter through your eyes, according to the research.

The study also revealed that you can also become infected by touching something that has the virus on it -- like a table or doorknob -- and then touching your eyes.

While the patients' tears were clear of virus, their noses and throats were teeming with COVID-19, the researchers said.

The authors wrote that the findings, coupled with the low incidence of pink eye among infected patients, suggest that the risk of virus transmission through tears is low.

The researchers hope their work helps to guide more research into preventing virus transmission through more significant routes, such as droplets and fecal-oral spread.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/novel-coronavirus-may-not-spread-through-tears-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/novel-coronavirus-may-not-spread-through-tears.html
188,26-3-20,Saudi chairs G20 crisis talks as virus threatens recession,"Leaders of the G20 major economies will hold an online summit Thursday in a bid to fend off a coronavirus-triggered recession, after criticism the group has been slow to address the crisis.

US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will join the emergency videoconference chaired by Saudi Arabia's King Salman, who is also under pressure to end an oil price war with Moscow that has roiled energy markets.

The talks come as the global death toll from COVID-19 soared over 21,000 and over 3 billion people were locked down in their homes.

""As the world confronts the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges to healthcare systems and the global economy, we convene this extraordinary G20 summit to unite efforts towards a global response,"" the king of Saudi Arabia, which currently holds the G20 presidency, said on Twitter.

The meeting, expected to be held at 1200 GMT, comes as the world's 20 most industrialised countries scramble to defend their virus-wracked economies amid forecasts they will likely plunge into recession this year.

On Wednesday, the financial ratings agency Moody's estimated the G20's overall gross domestic product would contract by 0.5 percent, with the US economy shrinking by 2 percent and the eurozone by 2.2 percent.

While wealthy nations including the US have unveiled mammoth stimulus packages, there has so far been no collective action plan from the G20, and concerns are mounting for poorer countries without access to capital markets and adequate health facilities.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged G20 nations to offer support to ""low and middle income countries"", including from Sub-Saharan Africa.

This week, French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pushed for an emergency G20 summit to limit the impact of the pandemic.

French presidential sources said the virtual meeting would focus on ""coordination on the health level"" as well as sending a ""strong signal"" to financial markets over efforts to stabilise the global economy.

With world leaders divided, the meeting stands in contrast to the G20 summits following the 2008 financial crisis, when the group swung into action to mobilise assistance for vulnerable countries.

""The G20 is missing in action today, unlike 2008,"" said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the Eurasia Group.

Talk of global coordination has yet to resonate under the isolationist US presidency of Trump.

On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took aim at China, saying the top diplomats of the Group of Seven agreed with him that Beijing was waging a ""disinformation"" campaign about the pandemic.

At the G7 talks, a day before the G20 summit, Pompeo alleged Beijing was engaged in a social media campaign that included conspiracy theories that the US was behind the virus, first detected in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.

""If G20 leaders can put politics aside and reach a collective G20 agreement, countries have a better chance of success or of delivering more stimulus than on their own,"" Markus Engels, from the Global Solutions Initiative, told AFP.

""Coordination among the G20 sends a strong message of unity and confidence, both of which are urgently needed now."" Crude oil prices -- hammered by the outbreak's impact on demand as well as by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia -- are also expected to be at the centre of the discussions.

Riyadh faces pressure from Washington to row back on its decision to hike production and offer the biggest price cuts in two decades, in retaliation for Russia's refusal to tighten supply as the virus saps demand.

On Wednesday, Pompeo urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to ""rise to the occasion"" and ""reassure global energy and financial markets"".

The G20 members will be joined by leaders from other affected countries including Spain, Jordan, Singapore and Switzerland, Riyadh said.

Leaders from international organisations such as the United Nations, World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) will also participate.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saudi-chairs-g20-crisis-talks-as-virus-threatens-recession-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/saudi-chairs-g20-crisis-talks-as-virus-threatens-recession.html

190,26-3-20,US grants Iraq shortest sanctions waiver yet for Iran gas,"The United States on Thursday granted Iraq a 30-day waiver to keep importing Iranian gas despite American sanctions, two Iraqi officials told AFP, the shortest extension yet.

The US slapped tough sanctions on the Iranian energy sector in late 2018 and has granted Iraq a series of waivers, usually for 45, 90 or 120 days. Baghdad relies on gas and electricity imports from its neighbour Tehran to supply about a third of its power grid, crippled by years of conflict and poor maintenance.

""This is the final extension,"" one source at the Iraqi president's office told AFP.

The source said Washington had been frustrated that Iran was meddling in the government formation process in Iraq.

Adnan Zurfi, who has had close ties with US officials since the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, was nominated on March 17 and has a month to pull together his cabinet.

""The US did not want to put Zurfi in a difficult position by not renewing the waiver,"" a second senior Iraqi official told AFP, confirming the 30-day extension.

The official said Baghdad had prepared a checklist at the beginning of the last 45-day waiver period of ways the country could decrease its reliance on Iranian oil.

""But we haven't been able to accomplish any of them because of the circumstances,"" the source said.

Iraq has been hit by a cocktail of crises in recent weeks, including the government formation stalemate, collapsing oil prices and the novel coronavirus pandemic.

OPEC's second-biggest producer relies on crude exports to fund more than 90 percent of its state budget, but the crash to a price of under $30 per barrel puts it in jeopardy.

The COVID-19 virus has also spread across the country, with nearly 350 confirmed cases and 29 deaths announced by the health ministry.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-grants-iraq-shortest-sanctions-waiver-yet-for-iran-gas-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-grants-iraq-shortest-sanctions-waiver-yet-for-iran-gas.html
191,26-3-20,Video about cop choosing duty over son's pleadings goes viral,"A video put out on Twitter by the Maharashtra police which shows a policeman's son pleading with him not to leave house for work amid the coronavirus scare is winning hearts on social media.

The state police has been using its Twitter handle (@DGPMaharashtra) to spread awareness about precautions needed to keep the virus at bay and to seek people's cooperation in implementing lockdown.

Maharashtra has reported the highest number of COVID- 19 cases in the country -- 125 -- as of Thursday.

The video showed a policeman putting on his uniform to go to work, and his son, about two years old, crying and asking him not to leave house because of the pandemic.

But the policeman is heard telling the child that he has to go because his boss has called him for duty.

While reports about high-handedness of the police in enforcing restrictions on movement on roads are coming from some parts of the country, this video went viral immediately, receiving over 13,000 views and 2,600 likes.

The Maharashtra police uploaded the video with the message, ""In the challenging time of coronavirus pandemic, our officers give preference to their duty over their families. This sense of duty inspires not only people working in emergency services, but also the society at large.""

The state cops are also putting out clever one-liners to encourage social distancing.

""Not all long distance relationships are difficult. Some are just safe,"" said one tweet.

The state police are trying to facilitate smooth delivery of essential goods at home by e-commerce platforms and other vendors.

The Mumbai police has started issuing passes to those who work in the sectors which provide essential services.

""Essential pass, for essential services.

192,26-3-20,"Free food for daily wagers, homeless, says CM","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the number of night shelters in the city has been increased and more food is being distributed for homeless people. To ensure smooth supply of essential services without any disruptions, Kejriwal announced 1031 helpline number. The Government said widows, senior citizens, and divyangs entitled to monthly pension will get additional amount equivalent to one month’s annuity.

“The Government has also decided to double the pension under the widow, old-age, and disability pension scheme,” said Kejriwal.

Earlier, the CM had said the Government does not want daily wagers and homeless to suffer due to restrictions hence it had decided to distribute free food and enhanced benefits under ration scheme.

“We have decided to provide 50 per cent more quantity — 7.5 kg instead of fixed quota of 5 kg — free rations to 72 lakh beneficiaries attached to our ration scheme for one month. The ration will be provided free of cost,” he said at his online Press conference.

The Government will also provide free food twice a day to homeless at night shelters, however, Kejriwal added the offer would not be restricted to occupants of those facilities.

“We are arranging free lunch and dinner at 220 night shelters for every person. The Government has also decided to double the pension under the widow, old-age, and disability pension scheme,” he said.

Kejriwal also said due to curfew, several people were not able to get food, and urged the public to send such people to the nearest shelters of the Delhi Government, where food was arranged.

He said the Delhi Government is working to ensure that not a single person in Delhi should suffer from hunger.

“We have already started distributing food in all the night shelters of Delhi where any person can come and eat. We have witnessed that the number of people is increasing, therefore, we have also decided to increase the number of such night shelters and we will also increase food distribution. But again I want to tell you that I am very happy to know that many people are coming forward to volunteer in the distribution of foods.”

Kejriwal said five fresh cases of corona positive were reported in the city during past 24 hours. With this, now the number of COVID-19 patients in Delhi stands at 35 till Wednesday evening which was stuck to 30 two days before.

Encouraging people to support in the fight against corona spread, Kejriwal urged masses to stay at home, follow and respect Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to maintain social distancing during the lockdown.

He said buyers and consumers do not require any passes to buy essential things required in day today’s needs.

Citing a few examples of doctors facing difficulties in Delhi as house owners termed them corona virus carriers and forcing them to vacate their houses as soon as possible, Kejriwal also urged house owners to cooperate in difficult times.

“These people are warriors and serving in difficult times to keep us safe and healthy, I am requesting to all house owners in Delhi, to not force them to vacate the house,” said Kejriwal.

He, along with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, in a joint video Press conference said this a difficult time and we are not saying there will not be problems, but we will do our best to make sure everyone is looked after.

“There will be no shortage of essential goods,” he said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/free-food-for-daily-wagers--homeless--says-cm-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/free-food-for-daily-wagers--homeless--says-cm.html

194,26-3-20,Challenge with 'Pushpavalli 2' was not to fall in writing pattern of season one: Naveen Richard,"Actor-comic Naveen Richard is thrilled with reactions coming his way for ""Pushpavalli"" season two and he says the response feels sweeter as the team worked hard to not fall into the trap of repeating themselves in the new chapter.

Created by comic Sumukhi Suresh who also stars in the title role, the first season of the Amazon Prime Video's original series saw Pushpavalli move to Bengaluru from Bhopal to stalk Nikhil, a man she is obsessed with.

The new season chronicles the revenge Pushpavalli plans against Nikhil, who rejected her advances.

Naveen said the team wrote season two for close to eight months and he came on board towards the end.

""Between season one and writing two, I was also working on the 'Better Life Foundation' web series. By the time I got back to the show, I forgot the expectations, which helped. You want to do better for sure. But the thing which was challenging was to not fall in the same pattern in writing and character arcs.

""You'll be writing for days and would suddenly realise, 'Damn, we have done this before.' Even with Pankaj, we had to give him a lot of other things to do,"" Naveen told PTI in an interview.

The Bengaluru-based comedian, whose performance as the perennially angry librarian Pankaj has earned him praise from all quarters, asserted he is nothing like his on-screen character.

""I am glad the audience bought into the character and they were able to feel like he's real because he's so different from who I am. I'm glad people found it convincing and weren't put off by the yelling, which means his softness also felt real.

""It is hard to get people to like a character who keeps shouting. I guess we gave him a good arc,"" he said.

Naveen said the trick was to also show a different, softer side of Pankaj, who, as a lot of people texted him saying, ""truly cares for Pushpavalli,"" who manages to manipulate probably the only true friend she has.

""Inherently I'm a more approachable guy. That's why in the scenes where he's interacting with Swati (Preetika Chawla) you see how much of a softy he really is. Once you show the audience that's who he is (they will relate)... On top of that, he always means well.""

His onscreen love-hate relationship with Sumukhi has been appreciated a lot and the comedian said the secret to their chemistry is their longtime off-screen friendship.

""The chemistry comes from years of working together. In fact, the moment we started working together, I remember, she had a sketch with her friends and they wanted me to play a few parts in it. We started getting along, both Tamilians in Bengaluru connecting with each other.

""It's really cool to work with someone who is so energetic. We have been doing sketches for so many years now. When two people act on stage together, you really have to connect to that person. It's much easier for us to connect in front of a camera, also because she is one of my closest friends,"" he added.

Naveen, who has been writing, featuring on shows and doing stand-up comedy for close to a decade, said as a comedian, there's always pressure to constantly keep the laughs coming.

""It's hard not to get into the pressure, especially when you're on stage. When you're on stage and telling a good story, you know when the audience is engaged. Then you don't care about the laughs. As long as it works in the end. If you're confident that the pay off is good, it's fine,"" he said.

""When you're writing a show like 'Pushpavalli 2', it's different. There are scenes where we know we don't have any laughs and then there are scenes we know you'll laugh a lot,"" he added.

Naveen said being a comedian is about trying to stay calm, maintaining some discipline in life and being able to write ""while also relaxing so that life can happen to you"".

""You can't be afraid to make mistakes and get into silly situations but not forcing silly situations. It's about being a little adventurous. The more you experience, the more you write. I try not to lead too boring a life, otherwise you won't have anything to talk about,"" he added.

The comedian also has his latest Amazon comedy special, ""Relatively Relatable"", streaming right now and said it is a ""lovely coincidence"" that it debuted right after the second season of ""Pushpavalli"".

""It feels good. I'm so glad I get to surprise the audience with a character like Pankaj and then the goofy side of me which is my special,"" he added.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/challenge-with--pushpavalli-2--was-not-to-fall-in-writing-pattern-of-season-one--naveen-richard-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/challenge-with--pushpavalli-2--was-not-to-fall-in-writing-pattern-of-season-one--naveen-richard.html

196,26-3-20,Yesteryear star Nimmi passes away,"Nimmi, the doe-eyed star of 1950s and '60s Hindi movies such as ""Aan"", ""Barsaat"" and ""Deedar"", has died after prolonged illness. She was 88.

The actor was brought to a suburban Juhu hospital on Wednesday after she complained of breathlessness. She died in the evening, family sources told PTI.

""She was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday afternoon after she complained of breathlessness. She passed away this evening. She had been unwell for quite sometime. She had been in and out of hospital this year,"" the source added.

Nimmi will be buried at a cemetery in Reay Road in Mumbai on Thursday afternoon.

The actor, born as Nawab Banoo, came to be known by her screen name 'Nimmi', which was given to her by filmmaker Raj Kapoor, who first spotted her as a shy teen on the sets of his film ""Andaz"".

Raj Kapoor cast her as the second lead in ""Barsaat"" in 1949. The film had three popular songs -- 'Barsaat me hamse mile tum', 'Hawa me udta jaye' and 'Meri Patli qamar hai' -- picturised on her.

After the success of ""Barsaat"", there was no turning back for Nimmi.

Though the often played the second fiddle to the popular heroines of her era, she established herself in the roles of ill-fated lover or the feisty village belle.

Such was her popularity that an extended dream sequence was added in ""Aan"" as distributors felt her character dies too early in the film.

Inspired from William Shakespeare's play ""Taming of the Shrew"", the film had Nadia and Dilip Kumar in lead roles but Nimmi as village belle Mangala left a lasting impression on viewers mind.

The film released with the title 'Savage Princess' in England and in France as ""Mangla, fille des Indes"" (Mangla, the daughter of India).

Nimmi worked with top actors of her era, including Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Ashok Kumar in films ""Sazaa"", ""Aan"", ""Uran Khatola"", ""Bhai-Bhai"", ""Kundan"", ""Mere Mehboob"", ""Pooja Ke Phool"", ""Akashdeep"", ""Love and God"", which was her last film.

She left movies to get married to writer-director S Ali Raza, who passed away in 2007.

Mourning her death, actor Rishi Kapoor said, ""RIP. Thank you Nimmi aunty for all the blessings and love for Bobby on its premiere release. You were part of the RK family. Barsaat was your first film. Allha aapko Jannat naseeb kare. Ameen.""

Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt said, ""You may win your hearts desire, but in the end you are cheated of it by death. Goodbye Nimmiji"".

""A beautiful and extremely talented actress and a beautiful and humble human being passes on. #RIP #Nimmi ji,"" tweeted Jaaved Jaaferi.

197,26-3-20,UN condemns terrorist attack on Sikhs in Afghanistan,"The United Nations has condemned the terrorist attack on a Gurudwara in Kabul that killed at least 25 people, with the UN chief calling for perpetrators of such crimes to be held accountable and the world body emphasising that there can be no justification for the killing of civilians at a religious house.

At least 25 worshippers were killed and eight others injured when a heavily armed suicide bomber stormed his way into a prominent Gurudwara on Wednesday in the heart of Afghanistan's capital of Kabul, in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority Sikh community in the strife-torn country.

The Islamic State (IS) terror group, which has targeted Sikhs before in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack on the Guridwara in Shor Bazar area at about 07:45 (local time) as 150 worshippers were inside the building.

The Secretary-General condemns the attack... in Kabul on a Sikh-Hindu temple in which dozens of civilians were killed and injured. He expresses his deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured, Secretary General Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Wednesday.

It added that the Secretary-General reiterates that attacks against civilians are unacceptable and those who carry out such crimes must be held accountable.

""The United Nations stands in solidarity with the people and the Government of Afghanistan and will continue supporting efforts to bring peace to their country, the statement said.

In a tweet, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said it is ""outraged"" by the attack.

""There can be no justification for the killing of civilians at a religious house. Our condolences to the victims and their families.""

High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) Miguel Angel Moratinos expressed his ""dismay"" at the terrorist attack at the Gurudwara, which killed 25 victims, including a child.

The ""despicable attack comes at a time when the world is facing a pandemic which adversely impacts all of us, requiring us to stand together as ""One Humanit', Moratinos said.

He stressed that attacks targeting sacred sites and worshippers are intolerable and have to stop. Recalling the UN Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites, he called on all governments and relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the plan to guarantee the sanctity of worship places and the safety of worshipers.

Moratinos said the latest attack adds to an expanding number of attacks targeting various faith communities around the world. He reiterated that such outrageous acts of terror should not dissuade us from working together to promote solidarity, respect, and peace globally.

On behalf of the UNAOC, the High Representative expressed his condolences to the victims' families and conveys his solidarity to the people and the Government of Afghanistan.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/un-condemns-terrorist-attack-on-sikhs-in-afghanistan-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/un-condemns-terrorist-attack-on-sikhs-in-afghanistan.html
198,26-3-20,WHO 'very much' sided with China on coronavirus: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said that the World Health Organization has ""very much"" sided with China on coronavirus crisis, asserting that many people are unhappy with the global health agency and feel that ""it's been very unfair"".

President Trump was responding to a question on allegations by Republican Senator Marco Rubio that the World Health Organization (WHO) showed ""favouritism"" to China.

Congressman Michael McCaul, ranking member on the House Foreign Relations Committee, has questioned the integrity of the WHO's director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying ""that there were several red flags in his past with respect to his relationship with China.""

""It (WHO) has been very very much sided with China. A lot of people are not happy about it,"" Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Wednesday.

Trump was asked if he agreed that the WHO showed favouritism and the US should re-explore its relationship with the health agency once the dust settles.

""I think there is certainly a lot of talk that it's been very unfair. I think that a lot of people feel that it's been very unfair,"" Trump replied.

In a tweet Congressman Greg Steube alleged that the WHO has been a mouthpiece for China during the coronavirus pandemic.

Both the WHO and China must face consequences once this pandemic is under control, he demanded.

Senator Josh Hawley echoed Steube's view and demanded the same.

""There need to be consequences here. WHO has sided with China Communist Party against the world in this pandemic,"" he said in another tweet.

WHO director Ghebreyesus has faced criticism for praising China's leadership for its ""determination to end the new coronavirus outbreak"".

He has also been accused of conspiring with Beijing in its ""propaganda"" to hush-up coronavirus cases.

Ghebreyesus had gone to China in January to meet President Xi Jinping, and a WHO team comprising of international health experts working in the country.

""Today I met with Xi Jinping, President of China, in Beijing to discuss next steps in battle against the new coronavirus outbreak. WHO appreciates the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak & the transparency authorities have demonstrated,"" he had said in a tweet after his meeting with Xi.

""Just back from China where I held frank talks with President Xi Jinping, who has taken charge of a monumental national response to the coronavirus outbreak. Based on cooperation & solidarity, China has committed to protecting its citizens & all people globally from the outbreak,"" he said in another tweet.

Globally, the death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 21,293 with more than 471,518 cases reported in over 170 countries and territories, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

200,26-3-20,"Grofers user gets delivery slot for April 13, no slots on Bigbasket","Day 2 of COVID-19 lockdown was no different for people who tried to book online delivery of essential items like groceries, milk and vegetables at Bigbasket, Grofers and other online platforms.

To one user's amusement, he got the next delivery slot on Grofers for Monday, April 13.

""When trying to place a new order, the earliest delivery date is coming out to be Monday 13th April. I mean seriously? 19 day waiting period during a lockdown of 21?"" Tanmay posted to Grofers on Twitter.

The online delivery platform replied: ""Due to the current situation and spike in demand, you have experienced a high turnaround time for the delivery of your order. While we understand that this isn't ideal, we're acting to execute things for you as soon as possible"".

The company said it has gone live in a few cities with the help of local authorities nd is hopeful of restarting operations in other cities within a day or two. It, however, did not disclose in which cities it has resumed delivery of essential items.

People experienced similar woes on Bigbasket.

Noida resident Arun Kumar, 42, placed an order for fruits on Thursday morning and got the message from Bigbasket: ""Unfortunately, we do not have any available slots to service you right now. Please try again later"".

Bigbasket posted on Twitter: ""Our delivery executives are working around the clock and overtime to deliver essentials to as many customers as possible"".

A Pune resident replied: ""Didn't get delivery of Milk today, vegetable orders already canceled. Plz confirm ""tomorrow u guys going to deliver milk or not?""

On food delivery platform Swiggy, some new restaurants popped up for Noida Sector 143 residents, although no known restaurants names were available.

Some city authorities late on Wednesday allowed home delivery of essential goods by online apps.

Gurugram Police Commissioner Mohammad Akil said that operators like Zomato, Flipkart, Amazon, Bluedart, Wow Express, Swiggy, Grofers, Bigbasket, Milk Basket, Dunzo, Big Bazaar, and Iffco Tokyo will be allowed to continue delivery services.

Online marketplaces like Flipkart and Amazon along with delivery platforms like Bigbasket, Grofers and FreshToHomes hit a major blockade as local authorities shut warehouses and sent delivery boys back, even harassed them.

Millions of people across cities were left helpless at homes as essential items did not reach their doors despite placing orders well in advance.

Despite the assurance from local authorities, the situation remained grim on Thursday.

Amazon India posted on its website that ""considering the prevailing extensive lockdowns and restriction in movement, pending deliveries will be delayed. New ordering is available only on essential products through pre-paid payment methods"".

201,26-3-20,Iraqi military says 2 rockets hit Baghdad's Green Zone,"Iraq's military on Thursday said at least two rockets hit inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq's government and home to the US Embassy, in the first attack following a brief lull in violence from earlier this month.

The two projectiles struck near the Baghdad Operations Command, which coordinates Iraq's police and military forces, the military statement said. The command center is a few hundred meters away from the US Embassy, which is a regular target of rocket attacks.

There were no casualties, said an Iraqi security official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

The attack occurred as a state-imposed curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus continued for a second week. The effective lockdown has prohibited large public gatherings and shuttered all but essential businesses such as pharmacies and supermarkets.

The statement said the rockets were launched from the al-Nahda area of Baghdad.

It was the latest rocket attack to strike the Green Zone since three rockets hit an area near the embassy last Tuesday. That attack was the fourth to target US interests in Iraq in the span of a week following assaults on the Basmaya training camp and two separate attacks on Camp Taji. Both bases are near the Iraqi capital.

The first attack on Camp Taji killed three coalition servicemen including two Americans. That prompted US airstrikes against what US officials said were mainly weapons facilities belonging to Kataib Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Iraqi militia group believed to be responsible for the attack.

However, Iraq's military said those airstrikes killed five security force members and a civilian, while wounding five fighters from the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella organization including an array of Iraqi militias, including some Iran-backed groups.

Iran-backed Iraqi militias have vowed revenge for the attacks.

The attacks come as the US-led coalition has announced plans to draw down its presence from bases across Iraq and consolidate in Baghdad and Ain al-Asad in western Iraq. The plan was in the works since late last year, a senior coalition military official said last week, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Troops have already pulled out from al-Qaim, on the border with Syria.

France said on Wednesday that it will pull out its military forces from Iraq, citing the need for French forces to help fight the new coronavirus at home.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iraqi-military-says-2-rockets-hit-baghdad-s-green-zone-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iraqi-military-says-2-rockets-hit-baghdad-s-green-zone.html
202,26-3-20,"Coronavirus: Karan Johar, Taapsee Pannu and others pledge to help daily wage workers","Filmmakers and actors, including Karan Johar, Taapsee Pannu and Ayushmann Khurrana, have pledged their support to a new initiative aimed at supporting the daily wage-earners who have been severely affected by the lockdown imposed to combat coronavirus.

The country is witnessing a 21-day lockdown, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to contain the spread of the virus, which has claimed the lives of over 20,000 people globally.

The initiative, I Stand With Humanity, started by organisations -- the International Association for Human Values, the Art of Living Foundation and the Indian Film and TV Industry, will provide families of daily wage workers with 10 days of essential food supplies.

""I pledge to contribute and support this initiative! This is a situation that needs all our help, love, care and support,"" Karan posted on Twitter.

Taapsee said everyone must come forward to help the daily wage workers.

""This one for the daily wage workers. Because we need to do our bit for the ones who work with/for us. If not corona, lack of basic food might take them down. Let's help them to get through this,"" the actor wrote.

Ayushmann described the initiative as ""truly noble"".

""I vow to support this and contribute. India and Indians are under threat and each one of us have the power to make a difference. Let's support and care for each other as much as we can in this time of crisis. #Istandwithhumanity,"" he tweeted.

Kiara Advani and Rakul Preet Singh also pledged to contribute towards the initiative.

""Let's contribute! While some of us are safe at home, we can help those struggling right now... donate,"" Kiara said.

Rakul tweeted, ""I support this noble initiative. Happy to contribute for this humanitarian cause. While staying safe at home, I urge every one else also to contribute online.""

Actor Varun Sharma said, ""I pledge to contribute & support this initiative #iStandWithHumanity""

""In times like these, we need to step up for the ones in need. I'm happy to contribute for this humanitarian cause. And guys whoever can help, you all can also contribute online,"" actor Sidharth Malhotra tweeted.

Filmmaker Nitesh Tiwari wrote, ""There are a lot of daily wage earners who need our help during this tough time. Please help as much as you can. Here's the link to contribute online.""

Actor Dia Mirza said, ""We are in this together. YES we will help #DailyWageEarners get through this with hope and dignity. I am contributing to this effort and I hope many others in our fraternity will do as well.""

Filmmakers Aanand L Rai and Sanjay Gupta have also backed the cause.

""One of the greatest gift a person can give another, is support. I whole heartily support this noble initiative. While staying safe at home, I urge every one else also to contribute online,"" Aanand tweeted.

Gupta called upon the public to help the daily wage-earners through the initiative.

On March 18, the Producers Guild of India had announced that they have set up a relief fund for daily wage-earners impacted by the shutdown of film, television and web productions amid coronavirus pandemic.

Their decision came after many filmmakers, including Sudhir Mishra, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap, raised concerns over the impact of shutdown on the daily wage workers.

South star Pawan Kalyan announced on Twitter that he will donate Rs 1 crore to PM relief fund.

B N Tiwari, President of Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), however, claimed there has been no help from Bollywood personalities or the Producers Guild of India so far.

""In the South, Rajinikanth has donated Rs 50 lakh which is a great thing. But here, we haven't received any call or help from anyone from Bollywood yet.""

""There is one production company called Frames that produces TV shows, they have given ration worth Rs 25 lakh but it is stuck at Navi Mumbai and we haven't been able to give that to workers as they can't come here. We are toying with the idea of taking help of police authorities to give the ration to the workers,"" Tiwari told PTI.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--karan-johar--taapsee-pannu-and-others-pledge-to-help-daily-wage-workers-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/coronavirus--karan-johar--taapsee-pannu-and-others-pledge-to-help-daily-wage-workers.html

It is a tall order. This is the first time that we are in a sequel kind of territory. We have not done anything like this before. We did this because the world in the show is so exciting. It is interesting yet challenging to match up to the expectations. We had to step it up,"" Raj told PTI.

""The Family Man"" follows a middle-class man, played by Bajpayee, secretly working for the National Investigation Agency.

The co-director said the new season will have a tone similar to its 2019 debut but it will be more exciting.

""The design of the show is such that it is close to reality we have picked up from real life incidents but have made a fictitious story that goes with the series,"" he added.

Besides Bajpayee, the first season also featured Priyamani, Sharib Hashmi, Neeraj Madhav, Pawan Chopra, Kishore Kumar, Sharad Kelkar and Gul Panag.

South star Samantha Akkineni, who is making her web debut with the upcoming season, features in a pivotal role.

""What Samantha is playing in the show is going to be a bit of a revelation. She is playing something unique, something she has never done before,"" Raj teased.

He said season two should be out by the end of the year.

""The season two has been finished in record time. We have been shooting around August last year. We are aiming for similar date (as season one) it should come out at the end of the year, Raj said.

On the movie front, the director duo is developing three different scripts.

Asked about the film with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, Raj said, He has to announce that, we are waiting.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-the-family-man--season-two-was-a-tall-order--raj-nidimoru-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/-the-family-man--season-two-was-a-tall-order--raj-nidimoru.html
212,26-3-20,Patty Jenkins reveals why she didn't direct 'Thor: The Dark Word',"Before ""Wonder Woman"" came Patty Jenkins' way, she was attached to direct ""Thor: The Dark World"" for Marvel Cinematic Universe but the director realised it would be impossible to make a good sequel with the poor script she had.

Jenkins at the time was known for directing Charlize Theron-starrer Oscar-winner ""Monster"" and the pilot episodes of AMC's series ""The Killing"".

The director, in an interview to Vanity Fair, said she decided to walk away from the MCU film as she thought it would hurt her chances as a woman filmmaker.

""I did not believe that I could make a good movie out of the script that they were planning on doing. I think it would have been a huge deal it would have looked like it was my fault. It would've looked like, Oh my God, this woman directed it and she missed all these things',"" she told the publication.

Jenkins said she was aware of the pressure that came with being the first female director of a superhero movie like ""Thor"" and the implication it would have on her and other women directors' future.

""( Thor') was the one time in my career where I really felt like, Do this with (another director) and it's not going to be a big deal. And maybe they'll understand it and love it more than I do.' You can't do movies you don't believe in. The only reason to do it would be to prove to people that I could. But it wouldn't have proved anything if I didn't succeed. I don't think that I would have gotten another chance. And so, I'm super grateful,"" she said.

This is why she decided to go ahead with ""Wonder Woman"" and rest, as they say, is history.

Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman"" in 2017 became a critical and commercial success, grossing USD 821 million at the worldwide box office. The director is returning with the film's sequel on August 14.

The reduction has been noticed during the lockdown which was implemented in the country on Wednesday.

""Although we are seeing a larger number of cases being reported and deaths recorded, the rate at which the cases are increasing appears to be relatively stabilizing,"" Joint Health Secretary Lav Agarwal told media at a press conference.

""However, this is only the initial trend,"" Agarwal cautioned.

He said if the measures taken by the government are strictly followed, then there will be a time when no case will be reported.

Agarwal also stressed continuing with measures to contain the dreaded disease from transmitting in the country.

""I want the same level of alertness to continue. If we collectively ensure that lockdown measures are implemented, we will be able to tackle the challenge posed by this disease,"" he said, while requesting the foreign-returnees to follow the quarantine directions.

""It will not only benefit you but your family too. Therefore, I request all the people to cooperate with us. The challenge is big and it is our collective responsibility to overcome it,"" he said.

Dr Raman Gangakhedkar of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), who was also present at the conference, said that there was still no proof of community transmission.

""We are still at the stage of local transmission. If we follow the measures such as social distancing and isolation, we may safely be stable.

It was a 19 percent increase on figures released Wednesday by the authorities in Spain, which has the world's second highest death toll from the disease after Italy.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 56,188, the ministry said.

Despite a national lockdown imposed on March 14, which parliament on Thursday agreed to extend until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with officials warning this week would be particularly bad.

But the rise in the number of new deaths was smaller than that recorded on Wednesday when the figure rose by 738 or 27 per cent.

Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.

The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 17,166 infections -- just under a third of the total -- and 2,090 deaths, or 51 percent of the national figure.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose wife is infected with the virus, has said this is the country's most difficult moment since its 1936-39 civil war.

The other generations in Spain have never, ever had to face as a collective something so hard,"" he said when he imposed the state of emergency on March 14.

226,26-3-20,London hospitals cope with ‘continuous tsunami' of coronavirus cases,"Hospitals in London – Britain's COVID-19 hotspot with over 3,000 of the country's 9,529 confirmed cases - are witnessing wave after wave of seriously ill coronavirus patients, a senior official from the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) said on Thursday as the UK entered day three of its lockdown to curb the pandemic.

Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers – the representative body for hospital chiefs, said that they have been getting reports that the rate at which hospital beds are being filled out is extremely alarming even as their staffing levels are dropping as a result of the infection.

“They talk about wave after wave after wave. The words that are used to me are that it's a continuous tsunami. As one said to me, it's much bigger and large numbers with a greater degree of stretch than you can ever have possibly imagined,” Hopson told the BBC.

“They are struggling with the explosion of demand in seriously ill patients. They are saying it's the number arriving and the speed with which they are arriving and how ill they are,” he said.

The UK government announced the setting up of a makeshift hospital with 4,000 beds to be created at the ExCel conference centre in east London earlier this week, a move welcomed by NHS Providers but with a warning that even that capacity is fast getting filled up in the UK capital.

“One advantage we have is the opportunity to learn from what is going on in London, given that London is some way ahead of most of the rest of the country, recognising there are other hotspots elsewhere,” said Hopson.

“It's encouraging to hear there's progress with the antibody test to identify who's already had the disease. That will make a big difference in time, but the immediate focus is on who has COVID-19 now, and the reality is that despite the push to expand testing, it's not going to be sufficient to cover patients and a significant number of the NHS' 1.2 million staff,” he warned.

The number of people who have died in the UK after contracting coronavirus rose by 43 to hit 465 by Thursday, representing the smallest rise in the number of deaths since last week. However, alongside there was the biggest increase in the number of infections across the UK – up 1,542 to 9,529.

The number of cases and deaths is expected to keep rising as the UK works on trying to flatten the curve of the pandemic following a nationwide lockdown enforced by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday.

Imperial College Professor Neil Ferguson, whose work on the epidemic has informed the government's policy, said his research team is ""moderately confident"" that demand for intensive care beds will peak in two-and-a-half to three weeks' time if the measures have the desired effect.

“We are going to have a very difficult few weeks but we think overall with the capacity being rapidly put in place that whilst the health system will be stressed it won't break,” he said.

Meanwhile, the government has ordered 10,000 ventilators from Dyson – known for vacuum cleaners – to help deal with the coronavirus crisis. The firm, headed by British inventor Sir James Dyson, said it had designed a new type of ventilator in response to a call on behalf of the NHS.

“I will do everything I can to ensure our dedicated staff have whatever they need during this unprecedented time,” said UK health secretary Matt Hancock.

A waiver of parking fees for NHS and social care staff and speeding up supplies of urgent personal protection equipment (PPE) are among some of the steps being put in place.

Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) has said that final tests on finger-prick testing kits should be completed in the coming days. Such a test, which can be carried out by individuals in their homes, will be able to determine if someone has or has already had COVID-19.

The UK's chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, warned rigorous testing needs to take place before the kits are available to the public, saying: “The one thing that is worse than no test, is a bad test.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described these tests as a “total game-changer” as the government ordered 3.5 million testing kits from at least three commercial suppliers.

“Several million tests have been purchased for use. We need to evaluate them in the laboratory, because these are brand new products, to be clear that they work as they are claimed to,” Professor Sharon Peacock from Public Health England, told the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee on Wednesday

""Once they have been tested, and that will happen this week, and the bulk of the tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community in which there will be a mechanism to order a test via Amazon, performed at home and then sent back to see whether they're positive or negative,” Peacock said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/london-hospitals-cope-with----continuous-tsunami--of-coronavirus-cases-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/london-hospitals-cope-with----continuous-tsunami--of-coronavirus-cases.html

233,26-3-20,Need a war-time plan to win the war against COVID-19: Guterres at G20 virtual summit,"UN chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday warned that the world is not winning the war against the deadly novel Coronavirus and needs a “war-time” plan to fight it as the number of infected cases across the world grow exponentially every day.

The UN Secretary-General was speaking at the G20 Virtual Summit on the COVID-19 pandemic hosted by Saudi Arabia, which holds the G20 presidency this year.

“We are at war with a virus – and not winning it. It took the world three months to reach 100,000 confirmed cases of infection. The next 100,000 happened in just 12 days. The third took four days. The fourth, just one and a half,” Guterres said.

“This is exponential growth and only the tip of the iceberg. This war needs a war-time plan to fight it,” Guterres said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also taking part in the virtual summit along with leaders from the group comprising 19 industrialised countries and the European Union.

The UN chief said solidarity among the G-20 and with the developing world, including countries in conflict, is essential to deal with the crisis. Recalling his appeal for a global ceasefire, Guterres said the first critical area for concerted G-20 action is to suppress the transmission of COVID-19 as quickly as possible.

“That must be our common strategy. It requires a coordinated G-20 response mechanism guided by World Health Organisation,” he said, adding that all countries must be able to combine systematic testing, tracing, quarantining and treatment with restrictions on movement and contact – aiming to suppress the transmission of the virus.

He said nations also have to coordinate the exit strategy to keep the virus suppressed until a vaccine becomes available.

There is also need for massive support to increase the response capacity of developing countries.

It is also essential to work together to minimize the social and economic impact.

""The G-20 came of age in the 2008 financial crisis. The challenges before us dwarf those of 2008. And what we face today is not a banking crisis; it is a human crisis,” he said.

Underlining that while the liquidity of the financial system must be assured, emphasis must be on the human dimension and nations must concentrate on people, keeping households afloat and businesses solvent, able to protect jobs.

“This will require a global response reaching double-digit percentages of the global economy,” he said, adding that he welcomes infusions of liquidity and social and economic support in developed countries — with direct transfer of resources to people and businesses.

Noting that a stimulus package to help developing countries with the same objectives requires a massive investment, Guterres said there is need for greater resources for the International Monetary Fund and other International Financial Institutions, a meaningful emission of Special Drawing Rights, coordinated swaps between central banks and steps to alleviate debt, such as a waiver of interest payments.

Guterres also appealed for the waving off of sanctions that can undermine countries' capacity to respond to the pandemic.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/need-a-war-time-plan-to-win-the-war-against-covid-19--guterres-at-g20-virtual-summit-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/need-a-war-time-plan-to-win-the-war-against-covid-19--guterres-at-g20-virtual-summit.html
234,26-3-20,Use 21-day lockdown to bolster health infra against Covid-19: Doctors,"Amid the increase in coronavirus cases across the country, doctors and other healthcare experts reckon that the 21-day lockdown is not enough to wipe Covid-19 out. The government should use the period as an opportunity for strengthening the healthcare infrastructure, banning foreigners' entry to India at least for a month, and ensuring protection for healthcare workers fighting coronavirus.

World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said the lockdown, enforced in India and many other countries to contain coronavirus, was not enough. The countries that had gone for lockdown should use this as a second window of opportunity, Ghebreyesus said.

Dr Dodul Mondal, a senior Delhi-based oncologist, told IANS, ""The 21-day lockdown will be nothing without forward looking measures. The government should focus on expanding quarantine facilities and identify at-risk groups, which included slums.

""During lockdown, the government should increase immediate testing facilities, ensure protective gear for doctors and other medical staff to protect them against the infection, and increase the number of ventilators.""

""We need to strictly quarantine people who are coming from abroad,"" said Dr Mondal.

The administration, he said should also focus on training people during this period, which would be an add-on to contain the coronavirus spread.

Dr Mehvash Haider, Assistant Professor at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, said public health measures, like physical or social distancing, was important to flatten the curve of sharp increase in spread of infection, but they were not enough. ""This lockdown is a golden period. This has to be used for strengthening the testing facilities and hospital response capacity,"" he said.

According to health experts, the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases came after three months in Italy and China, the coronavirus hotspots, as the infected people usually show symptoms after close to 14 days.

Dr Shyam Mohan Nayak, medical officer with the Labour Ministry, said the country was witnessing a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. ""This 21-day lockdown will lead to isolation, where the disease will eventually collapse or the viral infection cease to exist. China and Italy experienced extremely sharp rise in cases and that crippled their healthcare system.

""We should suspend the entry of foreigners at least till the end of April. It will help in focusing the fight against Covid-19 domestically,"" he said.

He stressed protecting people from the second wave of coronavirus, spread through healthy carriers who don't show symptoms. ""Isolation will serve the purpose in the absence of anti-viral drugs. Through isolation, the incubation period of coronavirus can be brought under control,"" said Dr Nayak.

An incubation period is the time between exposure to virus and appearance of symptoms.

According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period for coronavirus is between 2 to 14 days after exposure.

According to reports, more than 97 per cent people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 started showing symptoms within 11.5 days of exposure, and the average incubation period was 5 days.

For many people, Covid-19 symptoms start in mild form only to get worse over the next few days.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/use-21-day-lockdown-to-bolster-health-infra-against-covid-19--doctors-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/use-21-day-lockdown-to-bolster-health-infra-against-covid-19--doctors.html
235,26-3-20,India may see 25 crore COVID-19 cases in next 3 months: Report,"In what could spell real trouble for the country in the next three months, a new report from prestigious Johns Hopkins University and the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP) has predicted that 21-day lockdown may be ineffective to stop the COVID-19 peak arriving in April-May-June – infecting over 12 crore Indians in an optimistic (low) scenario.

In a High scenario (trajectory with current lockdowns but insufficient physical distancing or compliance), the total number of cases (asymptomatic, hospitalized and symptomatic) can even touch a massive figure of 25 crore.

In the most likely (Medium) scenario with moderate to full compliance but no change in virulence or temperature/humidity sensitivity, the numbers of total cases can swell up to 18 crore.

The optimistic (low) scenario constitutes decreased virulence and temperature/humidity sensitivity.

To reach these numbers, Johns Hopkins and CDDEP -- a public health research organisation -- used IndiaSIM, a well-validated agent-based model of the Indian population which has been published widely over many years and has been used for government decision-making.

According to the report, hospitalised cases can reach up to 25 lakh people in the High scenario, 17-18 lakh people in Medium scenario and 13 lakh people in Low scenario.

""Ventilator demand will be 1 million. Current availability in India is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 ventilators,"" said the joint report.

""Mortality in healthcare workers could further increase deaths in the general population. Healthcare workers need personal protective equipment (masks and gowns) to protect themselves. Without them they get sick further straining the capacity of the healthcare system to respond,"" the report warned.

The number of coronavirus cases climbed to 649 in India on Thursday and the death toll hit 13, with one death reported each from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, according to the Health Ministry.

But March is the month when peak is yet to even begin, according to the report.

According to the report, delays in testing are seriously reducing the ability of the population to protect itself.

""This is the most important way in which we can contain the epidemic. An increase in the official number of detected cases in the short term could encourage the population to take distancing more seriously and will reduce panic compared to a big spike later,"" the findings showed.

""Border closures at this stage have little to no impact and add further economic disruption and panic. While international transmission was important in the first stage, domestic transmission is now far more relevant,"" it warned.

A national lockdown, said the report, is not productive and could cause serious economic damage, increase hunger and reduce the population resilience for handling the infection peak.

""Some states may see transmission increase only after another 2 weeks and lockdowns should be optimized for when they could maximize the effect on the epidemic but minimize economic damage,"" said Johns Hopkins-CDDEP report.

State-level lockdowns in the most affected states could change the trajectory of the epidemic and should commence immediately. Any delay allows for more secondary cases to emerge.

Lockdowns should be guided by testing and serological survey data and should be planned on a rolling basis, the report mentioned, adding that preparedness for case load should be the highest priority at this time.

""Temperature and humidity increases should help us in reducing case load. Although the evidence is limited, it is plausible,"" the report mentioned.

Evidence from China indicates that higher temperature and humidity are likely to lower the transmission rates but it is unclear ""how this will translate to the India context"".

India ""should be prepared for multiple peaks in the model and should be prepared for more cases and deaths later in the year"".

In India, initial infections likely first arrived in early February, according to the report.

People who will show symptoms next week are already infected and incubating the virus. Some of these will transmit before they are symptomatic. A large percentage of cases are mild, but for older individuals, the mortality rate is strikingly higher.

""Children are less likely to be infected and also less likely to be hospitalized than adults. Illness is less likely to be severe in children than in adults,"" the report noted.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-may-see-25-crore-covid-19-cases-in-next-3-months--report-2020-03-26.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/india-may-see-25-crore-covid-19-cases-in-next-3-months--report.html
