0,20-4-20,A global war on bio threat,"It is perhaps the first time in history that the entire human race, without any exception, is combatting a common enemy, the COVID-19 virus

In the prevailing period of uncertainty, unpredictability and ambiguity of every aspect of human life, in fact, of life itself, is it a war that we are fighting and what kind of a war is this? The traditional understanding of conflict is violent activity between two or more nations or groups over a period of time, bringing death and destruction in its wake. The world has, however, seen other types of battles. For instance, the war on poverty, class wars, trade wars and so on. So, is our ongoing fight for existence against COVID-19 to be termed a war? The significance is not merely of the word but the principles which should govern this fight.

In the spectrum of conflict, at the lower end is low-intensity engagement and at the highest level there is nuclear warfare. Chemical and biological warfare can also be grouped with nuclear conflict. While chemical weapons have repeatedly been used in some conflicts in the 20th century, the use of biological weapons is relatively less and mostly unproven. But biological weapons are the easiest and cheapest to manufacture and can adversely affect the entire enemy population. (A biological weapon can be as simple as dropping a body in the village well or a town’s water supply.) However, possibly due to morality aspects and more importantly, the inability to control the fallout of a biological weapon, its use on a large scale has been precluded, though many countries are reported to have had biological weapons programmes in the past.

The present crisis would definitely fall under the category of biological warfare. The commencement of this war could be both, natural or man-made. At this point of time, due to inadequate credible information, it would be inappropriate to pronounce a decision as to who is responsible for the commencement of this war. However, it is of extreme importance to analyse inputs when available and reach a conclusion on its genesis because, many aspects of the post-COVID world, including possibly the world order, would depend on it. If this be a biological war, we need to see the scale of it. It is perhaps the first time in history that the entire human race, without any exception, is combatting a common enemy, the COVID-19 virus. Though there have been pandemics in the past, like the Spanish Flu in 1918 and the Asian Flu in 1957, a global catastrophe of this scale is unprecedented. It is not only the sickness and death which the virus-affected world suffers, seemingly at an exorbitantly large scale, but also the economic devastation that is likely to ensue in its wake in the globalised world, which makes this crisis a truly unparalleled one. Additionally, in all previous battles whether conventional or otherwise (war on terror, price wars and so on), there have always been “sides.” In this unprecedented situation, the entire mankind is on one side and the virus is on the other. It is therefore, a true Global War On a Biological Threat (GWOBT).

Considering this to be a war, the “Principles of War” need to be applied to defeat it. While these fundamentals have been enunciated by different military theorists from Sun Tzu to Clausewitz and different countries have adopted their own dictums based on their national and strategic requirements, it is intended to elucidate these principles which are generally acceptable. Let’s deliberate upon them in the context of the GWOBT.

Selection and maintenance of aim: This is the single-most important maxim as all actions will depend upon the aim selected. My experience in the Siachen Glacier and other battle situations is that, it is necessary first to survive to defeat the enemy. A dead man is good to nobody. In the existing situation wherein no treatment is available, the aim must remain focussed on survival.

Concentration of force: Since the entire human race has one deadly enemy, all national boundaries, religions, beliefs, ethnicities, caste, creed and gender are irrelevant in this war. All efforts of the human race must, therefore, be concentrated on defeating the virus. Solidarity and synergy of all resources of the world would be necessary to defeat this enemy, which has humbled mankind.

Administration/sustainability: To be able to fight the war successfully, the human race, especially the economically deprived, has to be able to sustain itself through the entire period that the battle is fought. The administration has to be perfected to take care of essential needs, especially food and medical assistance. Though this is already partly visible but it has to be ensured over a long period till it is business as usual.

Security: In military terms, it means that an appropriate environment must be created and maintained, which will enable necessary freedom of action to achieve objectives. In the GWOBT, it would entail creating an overall international environment wherein those scientists, doctors and researchers, who are involved in finding a solution, feel fully energised and motivated to find a vaccine/solution/drug/protocol, to end this crisis. One of the perils identified by the UN Secretary General on April 9 was of extremist threats, including bio-terrorist attacks. Such dangers need to be dealt with through an effective international response and nipped in the bud. Otherwise these will seriously hamper our efforts at finding a solution.

Economy of effort: With limited resources, especially in the less developed nations and the end not clearly in sight, all efforts must be economised. This would be applicable to both, employment of manpower as also utilising resources, including foodgrain. The inability to implement this dictum will result in serious social disturbances, which will adversely affect preventive measures to contain the virus.

Offensive action: The key to military victories lies in relentless offensive action. In the current situation, too, bold decisions by the leadership, which are in tune with the selected aims and based on available data, would be the drivers of victory. Complacency or delay in decision-making can prove catastrophic.

Flexibility: The world is mostly groping in a relatively unknown domain. The outcome, results and impacts that emerge in the changing situation, must be factored in by the leadership in finding the road ahead. One example is how the ubiquitous anti-malaria drug Hydroxychloroquine has changed the way the world is looking at possible future prevention.

Cooperation: Partnership among all, cutting across boundaries, political ideologies and religion, will hold the key to a solution. It is also very important that, post-COVID financial benefits accruing to a nation or company, must not be the key criterion. A competition at this stage has the potential to ruin or delay success whereas, collaboration will speed up the process, which in turn can benefit all nations.

Morale: These are times which most of the present generation would not have ever faced earlier. A positive state of mind in this situation needs to be created. A sense of well-being, group cohesion and the feeling that the nation is firmly behind every individual, need to be reiterated. An inspired leadership — at the international, national, State and local level — is the need of the hour.

India has a lot to contribute to the world in the current situation. The way the second-most populous country on the planet is controlling the pandemic, will definitely be watched globally. The lockdown decision, albeit delayed, is being appreciated by many the world over. The sense of discipline in most areas and a high state of morale, despite the extended shut down which the country can ill-afford right now due to its precarious economic situation, are examples for the world to follow.

India has also set the example of international cooperation by releasing the Hydroxychloroquine tablets to many nations. In the field of research and finding a vaccine/treatment as also finding a solution through traditional methods, India can be a world leader.

Despite all the challenges that the nation is facing today, especially the economically deprived citizens, India could be at the forefront in this GWOBT and thereby be an important contributor in the post-COVID world.

As in war, leadership in all spheres and at all levels — political, judicial, executive, legislative, military and at the national, State and local levels, will be judged by the manner in which they handle the crisis.

History has also shown us that from the ashes of war, great economic giants have risen. Remember Germany, Japan and more recently Vietnam?

1,20-4-20,Choosing lives over livelihoods,"Nations that have got the infection rate down and have testing/tracing teams ready can start reopening, although there will be a low but steady stream of deaths

Wuhan, the Chinese city where it all started, was locked down for 79 days before the restrictions on movement were finally lifted last week. A bit overcautious perhaps but in China the Coronavirus does really seem to be under control — not totally eradicated but controllable without extreme measures. If President Donald Trump “reopens” the US at the end of this month, then California and a few other States will have been under lockdown for only half that many days and some States for much less time or even none. Far from being under control, the Covid-19 virus is killing a huge numbers of Americans, with 37,175 casualties on March 18 and the number is still rising daily. These two giants define the extremes of the “lives vs livelihoods” debate but almost every other country is having it too. Everybody knows that you can’t shut the economy down indefinitely but nobody wants to risk a second wave of infections by moving too soon. Well, almost nobody. The toddler-in-chief in the White House is frantic to reopen the economy because he has an election coming up in six months, and he will lose it if the economy has not recovered by then.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the American physician and immunologist who has served as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has doubtless explained that lifting the restrictions on movement on May 1 will cause a second wave of deaths and a second lockdown before November. But Trump doesn’t retain that sort of information for long. His attention span is not only short but selective: He forgets unwelcome information very quickly. Trump might actually order the country to reopen on May 1, as he believes that: “When somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total.” But most States beg to differ and wouldn’t obey his command. As New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said: “We have a Constitution … we don’t have a king … the President doesn’t have total authority.”

Elsewhere, some countries are cautiously reopening their economies a bit at a time but they either had a very high death rate early and have now wrestled it down again — China, Italy and Spain — or responded hard and early and never had a high infection rate, like Germany, Denmark, Austria, the Czech Republic and New Zealand.

We should also note two countries that never closed their economies down at all, because they could test, identify the infected and trace their contacts fast enough to break the chains of infection and keep deaths low: Taiwan and South Korea.

All three of these groups have one vital thing in common. They have the ability to “test, test, test”, as the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, put it a month ago, warning countries that they “cannot fight a fire blindfolded.” And they can follow up the tests with contact-tracing teams and apps so that not just the individual who tested positive but the whole cluster of other people who had contact with him/her can be isolated.

Any countries that have their infection rate down and have their testing and tracing teams ready can start reopening their economies, although there will be a low but steady stream of deaths until a vaccine is found. France, Canada and Australia can probably do it next month. Countries like Turkey, Russia and South Africa are more debatable, because they gave the virus a head start. But their medical infrastructure is strong enough, so they could think about letting their citizens go back to work by July. However, the US, the UK, Brazil and India are very worrisome. India is doing the right things but it started late. Its medical resources are limited and given its population of a whopping 1.3 billion, the sheer number of victims may overwhelm the system. Brazil has the reckless Jair Bolsonaro in charge, who not only wants to open up the country’s borders but also fired his Health Minister Luiz Mandetta for wanting to encourage social distancing for what Bolsonaro calls a “little flu.” Post Mandetta’s exit, many people in the healthcare system may fall victim to Bolsonaro’s bullying ways.

As for the US and the UK, they both reacted very late to the threat, which guarantees that their casualties would be considerably above the rich-country average. Worse, they do not have the testing and tracking resources in place that would make reopening the economy a relatively safe proposition. On April 3 the British Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, pledged 1,00,000 Coronavirus tests per day by the end of the month. Half the month is gone and the maximum number of tests carried out on a single day has been under 15,000. The US situation is harder to judge, since there is not a unified healthcare system but a highly fragmented “healthcare sector.” However, nobody has spotted evidence of nationwide preparations for extensive testing and tracking once everybody goes back to work, so a second wave of deaths later in the year is practically guaranteed. Finis Trump, perhaps but at a high price.

2,20-4-20,An agonising wait for the Coronavirus cure,"Vaccines have saved the human race on numerous occasions even though their historic importance was always dwarfed by more glamorous scientific developments

As cases of the rapidly spreading Coronavirus increase, the world has come to a standstill. Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus which has so far infected over two million people and killed 154,388, has also caused some severe economic and social disruptions. Experts believe these may lead to political upheavals even after the spread is somehow neutralised.

In the line of fire are regimes who seem to be fumbling in addressing the spread of Covid-19. Over the last two weeks, the international media has specifically targetted the bombastic neo-populist regimes that came to power in various countries after 2014.

Unable to comprehend an issue which does not fit their blathering narratives, such governments in India, the UK, the US, Brazil, Hungary, Philippines, Iran and Pakistan are now constantly on the receiving end of criticism. But this does not mean that countries that seem to be doing a better job of handling the crisis know when or how this crisis will recede; they are being forced to think on their feet. Such is the elusive nature of this virus.

On March 12, Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese pulmonologist who has been at the forefront of his country’s fight against the pandemic, told Reuters that the spread of Covid-19 can be “contained” by June this year but only if governments continue to enforce strict social distancing through lockdowns.

This does not mean that even if the world somehow succeeds to check the spread in the next two months, everything will automatically return to normal. First of all, what was considered to be normal before the outbreak will change, leading to a new normal. But even this won’t emerge unless an anti-Covid-19 vaccine appears.

Vaccines usually take up to 10 years to develop for mass usage. But recent advances in virology have helped scientists to greatly shave off years of required testing and launch anti-viral vaccines in much shorter periods of time.

Pharmaceutical companies working frantically in China, Europe, India and the US believe that an effective anti-Covid-19 vaccine can appear in the next 12 months. That’s still a whole year. However, the US pharmaceutical giant Merck was able to produce a vaccine against the 1968 influenza pandemic in four months.

Vaccines have saved the human race on numerous occasions. But their historic importance always gets dwarfed by other, more glamorous scientific feats. Human beings have been victims of catastrophic viral breakouts for centuries but the first vaccine wasn’t developed till the 18th century.

In the late 18th century, a British doctor, Edward Jenner, noticed that those in England’s villages who had contracted cowpox, became immune to smallpox. For centuries, smallpox had been one of the deadliest and most painful diseases that killed millions. It was caused by a highly contagious virus. Cowpox, on the other hand, was relatively mild and not fatal.

In The Life and Death of Smallpox, Ian and Jenifer Glynn write that Jenner drew some matter from a sore of a woman suffering from cowpox. He then injected it into an eight-year-old boy who had contracted smallpox. After several days, the boy recovered. Jenner then injected the boy with matter taken from a fresh smallpox patient to see if he had developed immunity. He had. Compared to modern-day practices of lab sciences, this method seems rather cruel but in the 18th century, it turned Jenner into a celebrity.

By the 19th century, smallpox vaccination became compulsory in various European countries and in some American States. Almost a 100 years after Jenner’s discovery, a French biologist, Louis Pasteur, was successful in developing a vaccine against another painfully fatal disease, rabies. Caused by a virus that enters the human body through an infected animal bite, it can cause a horrific death. In 1885, Pasteur successfully cured a rabies case with a vaccine. He used the attenuation method, in which the virus is weakened in the lab and injected in the patient to prompt the body’s immune system to work harder.

Building on the works of Jenner and Pasteur, the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the introduction of vaccines against ailments that were once incurable and contagious. In 1914, a vaccine against typhoid became common in the US; in 1921, French bacteriologists developed a vaccine for TB; in 1939, US doctors developed a vaccine against whooping-cough; in 1954, an anti-polio vaccine was successfully tested by American scientists; in 1958, the first measles vaccine was introduced and in 1966 an anti-mumps vaccine was launched in the US.

Between the late 1960s and 1970s, robust vaccination programmes were highly successful in checking and, in some cases, eradicating the spread of some of the worst contagious diseases known to man. However, scientists have always been running a tricky race against flu viruses because they continue to mutate. This means scientists have to always be on their feet to readjust flu vaccines according to fresh mutations.

A problem governments have faced in checking the spread of contagious diseases is the continuous existence of “anti-vax” segments in some societies. These are groups within a population who are against forced vaccination. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described them as a “threat” to public health.

The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the 19th century when the British Government introduced compulsory smallpox vaccination. Some groups refused to get their children vaccinated, fearing it was against their religious beliefs.

In 1926, newspapers in the US reported attacks on vaccination teams in certain conservative rural areas of the country. Even recently, anti-polio vaccination workers were attacked in some areas of Pakistan by those who believe that polio vaccines contain harmful chemicals.

According to a June 27, 2016 article in Healthline by Dr Deborah Weatherspoon, the “anti-vax” mindset is often the result of a mistrust of science in some groups who believe that pharmaceutical companies are enhancing the fear of otherwise benign diseases to sell their medicines, or that such sciences are opposed to religious beliefs, or that “natural” cures through homeopathy or other traditional means are more effective.

Among these are also some who insist that vaccines stunt the reproductive capabilities of men. Ironically, this perception is most prominent in some of the world’s most densely populated regions.

3,20-4-20,Women the biggest losers,"Gender-based consequences of Coronavirus make it imperative for both the administration and social networks to ensure that the pandemic does not negate the gains of gender equality

Even after the conclusion of the first phase of the three-week nationwide lockdown imposed by the Government and its further extension up to May 3 to curb the spread of Coronavirus, signs are emerging that the virus is not going away anytime soon. This is grim news for the country from both the health and economic perspective, especially for the female population, which is likely to suffer on multiple fronts due to the spread of the virus and the resultant need for the people to stay indoors.

The first category of affected women are healthcare staff, including nurses, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and anganwadi workers, who have been holding the fort against the disease all across the country. A Government of India report of 2015 revealed that 88.9 per cent of the support and ancillary staff among health workers, primarily nurses, midwives and ASHAs, are female. This is corroborated by earlier data from the 68th round of the National Sample Survey on the “Employment and Unemployment Situation in India” (July 2011 to June 2012). With hospitals facing an influx of Coronavirus patients and given the need for active contact tracing of positive cases, these workers have become frontline warriors in times of crisis.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that globally, too, women comprise a majority of the healthcare staff, accounting for 70 per cent of the total in 107 countries, including India. The COVID-19 outbreak is a physical and emotional nightmare for many healthcare workers. Eleanor Holroyd, currently Professor at New Zealand’s Auckland University of Technology, recounts her interactions with student nurses when she was professor of nursing at the Chinese University of Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic in 2003. A large section of these nurses experienced confusion, anxiety and stress from the long days of caring for patients and seeing many of their colleagues, too, contracting the disease in the process. “There’s the idea that if there’s a gap in the health system, the nurses will fill it. Their duty is to be ever-present and visible, offering empathy and care… Add that to a sick child or husband or parent and the very uncertain nature of an epidemic, it can be hard [for the nurse] to hold on,” says Holroyd.

The crisis is also likely to affect women disproportionately because of the already declining female labour force participation (FLFP) rate in India, which according to the Economic Survey of India of 2017-18, fell from 36 per cent in 2005-06 to 24 per cent in 2015-16. The India Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted in two waves in 2004-05 and 2011-12, too, reported a fall in the FLFP from 31.12 per cent in 2005 to 24.77 per cent in 2012. The IHDS is a multi-topic survey jointly conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, covering 41,554 households in 1,503 villages and 971 urban neighbourhoods across India. This survey also suggests that the decline in FLFP could be due to the lack of demand for female labour rather than that of labour supply. The paucity of demand for women workers could be reinforced in the coming months after the real impact of the Coronavirus becomes apparent in various sectors of the Indian economy.

Another category of women likely to be impacted by the pandemic are salaried workers, many of whom are currently working-from-home but could eventually face the prospect of lay-offs and pay cuts once their employers return to the normal work routine in a recessionary economy. The temporary or permanent closure of many businesses is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a range of professions dominated by women, such as flight attendants, tour operators, sales assistants and frontline hotel staff and cleaners.

Academics, who have studied past pandemics, including Ebola, Zika, SARS, swine flu and bird flu, report their deep and persistent effects on gender equality. According to Julia Smith, a health policy researcher at the Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada, these outbreaks affected everyone’s incomes but “men’s income returned to what they had made pre-outbreak faster than women’s income.” This outcome is compounded by the already-existing wage discrimination in many sectors. For example, in the healthcare sector, overall, women reportedly earn 11 per cent less than their male counterparts. Anganwadi and ASHA workers receive salaries in the range of merely Rs 3,000-4,500 per month, which is even below the minimum wage, without any additional benefits like pension and maternity leave. These women may not lose their jobs but any decline in their family incomes due to the pandemic will make them an equal part of the economic crisis looming ahead.

Even women, who are out of the workforce and traditionally stay at home, are facing a huge challenge emanating from the lockdown with their already extensive care-giving duties multiplying even further due to the reverse migration of household service providers like maids, cooks and nannies to their native villages. A 2015 survey by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that an Indian woman does far more “unpaid work”, almost six hours per day on an average, than her peers in most other countries. The corresponding figure for men is just 52 minutes per day.

In fact, as per an Oxfam report titled, “Mind the Gap”, released in March 2019, Indian women do the most unpaid care and domestic work in any country, barring Kazakhstan, largely because patriarchal norms, which dictate tasks such as cooking, cleaning, looking after children and the elderly and fetching water and firewood, have to be performed by women alone.

Data for the first wave of IHDS also highlights the domestic drudgery for women, especially in rural areas. The survey found that women in India’s villages were spending an average of 240 minutes per week collecting firewood and 66 minutes per day fetching water as compared to much lower corresponding figures of 136 minutes per week and 29 minutes per day, respectively, spent by men in the household.

Last but not the least is the issue of domestic abuse, the incidence of which is believed to go up exponentially in any kind of crisis, especially the current one that mandates people to practise social isolation and stay at home for sustained periods. What is worse, in a lockdown situation, women in violent relationships are unable to seek help as the perpetrators of the violence are always around, whereas those who can help the victims are inaccessible.

The US, the UK and China have witnessed a significant rise in domestic violence since the advent of the Coronavirus. In India, the National Commission for Women (NCW) reported double the usual number of domestic abuse cases since the imposition of the lockdown. According to the NCW Chairperson, Rekha Sharma, a total of 257 complaints related to various offences against women were received during the period March 24 to April 1, out of which 69 complaints were related to domestic violence. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has, in fact, urged Governments “to make the prevention and redress of the horrifying [domestic] violence against women a key part of their national response plans for COVID-19.”

These gender-based consequences of Coronavirus make it imperative for both the administration and social networks to ensure that the pandemic does not negate the gains of gender equality achieved over the past few decades. Diah Saminarsih, Senior Adviser on Gender and Youth to the WHO Director-General, avers that tackling this issue will be top priority in the WHO’s forthcoming study on the connections between gender and COVID-19. It remains to be seen how well women will be able to ride out the Corona storm.

4,20-4-20,Persuasion is hard,"The RBI is imploring banks to start lending but recent memory is still hobbling bankers’ confidence

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is doing a lot in trying to inject some liquidity and more crucially, some confidence into the Indian economy, which is currently suffering from the ill-effects of the Coronavirus-imposed nationwide lockdown. In a desperate bid to stop the economy from slipping into a deep recession, for the second time in a row, the Central bank, headed by Shaktikanta Das, sought to plug the gaps where it erred before and introduced yet another liquidity package to help businesses stay stable and ensure that the money reaches to those most vulnerable. However, banks have been unwilling to start lending aggressively. Measures include Rs 50,000 crore liquidity support for National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and National Housing Bank (NHB), another Rs 50,000 crore for banks for funding and a quarter-percentage-point cut in its reverse repo rate, which has now been lowered by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent. It is more than obvious that the Central bank wants to fund the financial institutions so that they can then forward it to businesses, big and small, and the most vulnerable — all of whom have been facing the pangs of the Coronavirus in some form or the other. But the Central bank can just fund the Treasury. As any student of history, like the RBI Governor was, knows, historical events have a habit in determining how we act today. Indian banks, both private and public, which got their hands (and the Indian taxpayer) burnt with bad loans handed out a decade ago, have been unwilling to really start lending as evidenced during previous rate cuts before the lockdown began. Of course, it would be unwise to predict just how banks will behave once the COVID-19 pandemic is over but with no clear end in sight, talk of an extended lockdown and the subsequent economic impact hanging in the air, we do not know just how banks will react. It is likely that their risk-averse nature will continue. What is also sure is the fact Indian entrepreneurs and industrialists will be unwilling to really start borrowing. However, both the RBI and the Government are desperate to make sure that when things do improve on the public health front, the economy is not beyond redemption. Unfortunately, with the Indian economy already having been on the back foot even before this crisis started, things could actually get a lot worse before they get better. What is needed right now is a stimulus package that can help the economy breathe. With the Coronavirus leading to a huge gap in demand and supply, there’s a glut in the market, leading to shortage of revenues.

This is because bankers and businessmen alike have no idea of what things will be like when we tide over the present crisis. This is not just the case in India but across the rest of the world. Banks are parking with RBI on a daily basis. So whatever money they have with them and whatever they are getting from RBI, the banks are giving back to the central bank instead of investing or lending it. Cheaper rates may not encourage thousands of businesses to start borrowing but it is possible that the Government could start doling out money to millions of Indians. This might really get things going and people will spend “free money” once this is over. Again, there is no idea of the efficacy of that strategy as well. People and companies have both incurred losses. Talks have gone from losing increments to actual worry about large-scale job losses across white collar, blue collar and informal sector jobs as well. At the end of the day, it all comes down to confidence. There might be no winner from this war, because we are not sure when the Coronavirus will finally be conquered. However, we have to start planning for the future from today. While the plans may not be perfect, since we do not know an end date for the start, we have to be prepared for it. We are already paying the price for having a woeful public health system.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/persuasion-is-hard-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/persuasion-is-hard.html

6,20-4-20,Sun halo in sky wows Koraput residents,"Have you ever seen a ghostly rainbow halo, a ring around the sun? The sight was spotted in the sky of Damanjodi in Koraput district on Sunday.

Amid the coronavirus scare and restrictions of lockdown, the residents of the locality enjoyed the circular halo around the sun that lasted for about 10 minutes. At the same time, they feared for a suspected climate change in upcoming days. However, astronomy experts ruled out people’s assumption.

Deputy Director of Pathani Samanta Planetarium, Bhubaneswar, Dr Subhendu Pattnaik termed the halo as an ‘optical illusion’.

“It is not a rare occurrence in the sky. Halo is an optical phenomenon produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The halo around the sun is caused by the reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin clouds.

8,20-4-20,Srikant writes to CM: Will lockdown be extended?,"Former Union Minister Srikant Jena on Sunday demanded that Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik clarify if the lockdown would be extended, why Odisha workers stranded in other States have not been brought back and whether the Rs 100-crore package is sufficient to provide livelihood support to urban labourers.

In a letter to the CM, Jena wanted to know why the number of COVID tests still remains unsatisfactory and the State has been unable to procure adequate rapid test kits.

""According to the World Health Organisation, lockdown bears no meaning if adequate numbers of blood samples are not tested. After 26 days of lockdown, only nine thousand tests have been done (in the State). If the Andhra Pradesh Government could bring 1 lakh rapid test kits, why the Odisha Government couldn't? In this situation, will your Government extend the lockdown,"" Jena wanted to know.

Noting that the Utter Government has brought back thousands of students from Rajasthan's Kota city by 500 buses, Jena wanted to know when the Odisha Government would do so.

Jena pointed out that only 30% of the Rs 100-crore package announced by the CM for urban labourers would reach the targeted 4.5 lakh workers as per labour component norm. Thus, each wager would get Rs 4.44 per day. Is the amount sufficient to help the poor group when Mudhi costs Rs 50 per kg and a cup of tea Rs 10 now?

9,20-4-20,Officer on duty despite cancer surgery,"Despite not being in perfect health, OAS officer Aditya Swain, Tehsildar of Digapahandi in Ganjam district, has been working hard in the Covid-19 situation.

Swain was diagnosed with colorectal cancer about six months ago. Though he underwent surgery and was administered chemotherapy, he is supposed to be taking rest to recover from the excruciating pain. However, he chose duty over everything and became a frontline warrior in the anti-coronavirus battle.

Ganjam district Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange has acknowledged Swain’s services on his official Twitter handle addressing him a ‘COVID warrior’.

The Health & Family Welfare Department has already made it clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect people with existing medical history and weak immunity. However, the cancer history has not posed as barrier to Swain from carrying on his assignments.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/officer-on-duty-despite-cancer-surgery.html
10,20-4-20,Real corona heroes too many; false only a few,"The incidence and prevalence of COVID infection across India are a bit misleading because ‘proportionate-to-population' tests are not being conducted due to lack of facilities. Lately, Odisha has been testing huge numbers of COVID suspects. The test results are fairly reassuring as only one in a hundred is positive, most of them without symptoms or complications. Naveen Patnaik as the first CM to extend the lockdown period to the end of April has again shown the way to others. Modi and Naveen together can build a truly happy, safe and secure India.

Evidently the low-wrung police officials, sanitary workers, nurses and a majority of doctors are the real warriors as infantry in the army for they slug like crazy in the most dangerous conditions.

It is also true that some very tricky, sly public officials try to get glorified by confusing the media guys, who are news-hungry in a virtually no-activity period. In contrast, what really moved millions is the act of Andhra-cadre IAS officer Srijana Gummalla who sacrificed her six-month maternity leave and returned to work within just a week of giving birth to a baby. The young mother was back in office as commissioner of an urban body with the little baby in arm.

Similarly, the act of Dr Sudhanshu Bhushan Mohapatra, Additional District Medical Officer of Malkangiri in Odisha is praiseworthy for he lost his father in Ratnagiri village near Chandikhol but had no means at hand to travel 700 km to reach on time. So, he decided to stay back and serve the people and come later to attend the tenth or eleventh day rituals. Incidentally, Malkangiri District Magistrate Manish Agarwal is himself a role model. He had earlier put his wife in the remote tribal district hospital for delivering a baby. Dr Mohapatra may have been inspired by the young District Magistrate and come on record as a dedicated healthcare professional.

Most significantly, Arun Bothra, a 1996-batch Odisha-cadre IPS officer, has made Odisha people extremely proud. One Neha Sinha of Mumbai had tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet seeking supply of camel milk for her three-year-old autistic child, who survives on camel milk and pulses. Because of lockdown, she could not organise camel milk. Sinha’s tweet did not get any response from any authority. On April 6, one of Bothra’s followers on Twitter tagged him. Though very active on Twitter to help people in other matters, the ‘call for camel milk' moved him no end. He got into action instantly by activating his contacts to discover a company ‘Advik Foods' supplying camel milk in Mumbai. Bothra requested the company to help. Incidentally, the company owner had lost his father two days earlier. Still, he and his partner went out of their way to arrange the last available 400 grams of camel milk powder from a supplier in Andheri to tide over the immediate crisis. Mumbai had run out of stock. Bothra did not give up. His nonstop appeals on WhatsApp groups revealed that the Railways could help. So, he got in touch with Chief Passenger Transport Manager of North-West Railway Tarun Jain in Jaipur to seek transporting help. Tarun checked with his seniors and found that a parcel train running between Ludhiana and Bandra in Mumbai could carry the milk from Rajasthan. The milk stock was sourced at Sadri near Pali in Rajasthan and the nearest scheduled stop is Jodhpur. However, due to the lockdown, it was not possible for the supplier to reach Jodhpur. The compassionate railway authorities organised an unscheduled stop for the train at the Falna station where 20 litres of frozen camel milk and 20 kg of camel milk powder were loaded. Thus, the lifesaving milk finally reached Chembur on April 10. Bothra’s act of humanity now is part of history.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/real-corona-heroes-too-many--false-only-a-few.html

12,20-4-20,The hunt for a vaccine,"Our scientists are working on a multi-purpose antidote. This highlights the need to fund R&D in a post-COVID world

As ever-increasing numbers of people test positive for Coronavirus daily, Indian scientists, medical professionals and researchers are toiling round-the-clock to create a vaccine to treat and cure people. Researchers at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) believe that they may be on the threshold of a watershed moment in the fight against the Novel Coronavirus. The scientists are testing a multi-purpose vaccine that has in the past proven to be effective against leprosy and which boosts immunity, too. Having received the approval of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the MW Vaccine is now being tested. Work is going on in developing the RNA and recombinant DNA vaccines. CSIR is also working towards synthesising the drug Favipiravir that is currently under trial in Japan. Two more approvals are awaited and once these are secured, trials will begin. However, the process of making a vaccine is a lengthy one as it is done in multiple stages till it reaches human trials. Once it proves successful in multiple human trials, it will take months for enough vaccines to be created and an even longer time before they hit the market. The timeline given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the development of any vaccine meant to specifically tackle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is 12 months or maybe even longer. Meanwhile, a desperate race is on, not just in India but also in the US and China, to come up with a cure in the form of a vaccine or drug but no definitive results have been shared with the world as yet. In a bid to understand the way the virus functions, Indian scientists are working on its genome sequencing which should help understand and trace its place of origin and the path through which it spreads. They also aim to understand with the help of genome sequencing whether or not the virus is mutating and developing any form of resistance to the drugs being used against it.

What is foxing the scientific community is the fact that there are around six to seven strains (of the Coronavirus) in the world. It is simply too early to accurately determine just how many strains may be present in the country and scientists are racing against time. They are only too aware that each day that passes brings with it an increasing number of cases, making it that much harder for a nation already suffering from an economic slowdown to go about its business as usual. As the COVID bomb continues to tick, Pune’s National Institute of Virology has completed 25 sequencings and the CSIR 30. The aim is to complete between 500 to 1,000 genetic sequencings in the next two weeks. This race against time is also a pointer on why we need to prioritise R&D, give adequate grants to the sector, incentivise our scholars and disseminate their findings widely. If home-grown scientists are working with the world now, it is clear that there is no dearth of talent and innovation. As we have said before, health and education budgets in a post-COVID world will be the real deal.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-hunt-for-a-vaccine-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-hunt-for-a-vaccine.html
13,20-4-20,MP Govt to extend tenure of local bodies leaders,"Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the State Government has decided to extend the tenure of the Presidents Jila and Janpad panchayats.

While holding discussions with a delegation of the Jila and Janpad Panchayats’ Presidents at CM House, Chouhan informed that the increase in the tenure of Panchayat representatives will be for the period till the next elections. The Chief Minister said that these representatives serve as an important link between the administration and the public.

He said that it is not possible to hold elections in the current situation caused by Coronavirus. Keeping in view the responsibility of the representatives of rural areas in this time of crisis, their tenure needs to be extended.

This will enable them to work freely with coordination between the public and the administration.

Chouhan said whether it is helping people in lockdown or to make the people aware, the responsibility of the public representatives becomes even more important.

Chouhan said that after April 20, some restrictions will be relaxed in line with the guidelines of the Government of India. In areas that do not fall within the periphery of hotspots and containment, works like MNREGA to give employment to labourers and other small construction works will be started.

It will also speed up the economy. Chouhan further said that our public representatives will play a vital role in accelerating all these activities. People's representatives will also be able to help the state get out of the Corona crisis.

52,20-4-20,Fear and Anxiety to hit Indians after lockdown: Experts,"Amid the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, health experts have warned that fear and anxiety will be more prevalent post-lockdown and people should be mentally prepared and remain positive to tackle the situation.

According to Shanu Shrivastava, psychologist at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in New Delhi, it is because psychologically people took time to adapt isolation and it will be again a relearning to adapt to be a social person.

""It will be certainly difficult and new experience once again as the lockdown was a new experience...person will be feeling anxious and suspicious in meeting with people as fear of coronavirus has affected our psyche,"" Shrivastava told IANS.

Social gatherings and handshakes will be difficult for people, celebrating festivals, and meeting people will not be easy for anyone, the doctor said.

Samir Parikh - Director of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Fortis Healthcare, New Delhi said that during the lockdown, the key has been to stay positive, support one another, and stay connected with friends and family. A lot of people have also been involved with work at home.

""Once the lockdown ends, we must continue to follow all guidelines as we resume working. It's important to continue to have the same focus and continue to utilise our social connect to keep motivated. It's time to bring all our positivity and effort so we can collectively take the necessary steps for our organisation and society,"" Parikh told IANS.

For people to remain mentally fit, it would be important for people to maintain similar routines to the way they had been before the lockdown, the doctor suggested.

""Doing so would not only keep them more productive during the lockdown but also help transition back to work once things resume. Remember it's ok to take a couple of days to adjust, but it's best to stay mentally prepared, keep yourself updated and make a plan for how to take things ahead,"" he said.

Parikh also added: ""We must continue to follow all guidelines as we resume working. It's important to continue to have the same focus and look forward to reconnecting with colleagues to keep motivated. It's time to bring all our positivity and effort so we can collectively take the necessary steps for our organisation and society.""

According to Preeti Singh, Clinical Psychologist, Paras Hospital in Gurugram, once the lockdown opens it surely doesn't take away the uncertainty of the minds.

""We are already anxious now we all may feel exposed, more anxious of the fear of being infected, working will be out of comfort zone for a lot of us. What may hit us harder when the corporates and the employers will actually be making life-changing decisions in terms of financially, cut off in salaries, layoffs because things won't come back to what we left a few months back,"" she said.

""The economic burden will hit a lot of us which will also create a sense of helplessness and hopeless, sleep disturbances may be both sleep deficit or sleeping excessively, increased consumption of alcohol and smoking, in quite a few it may be leading to depressive symptoms, Singh told IANS.

One very important mantra is keeping someone closer in the loop about what we are feeling and thinking, a vent out is important, she added.

On Sunday, coronavirus cases in India have reached 15,707 including foreign nationals, with 12,969 active cases, the Union Health Ministry said in a morning update.

60,20-4-20,SCPCR to issue advisory to State Govt on school fees,"The State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) will issue an advisory to the Uttarakhand Government about the private schools purportedly pressurising parents to submit the school fees of their children during the lockdown. Several parents have complained to SCPCR about the schools pressurising them to pay the school fees including the charges for the facilities which are not even being utilised by students.

Even before the implementation of lockdown, various schools were already not operating due to concerns caused by novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) spread. Though many of the schools are reportedly facilitating online classes, they are also continuously pressurising parents to deposit the school fees including various other charges.

""My two children study in seventh standard. Last week, the school mailed us asking us to deposit three months fee that included transportation charges, lab charges, sports fees and others. The school is hardly providing a one hour online class per day since the lockdown implementation. It is totally unfair to demand such a hefty amount just for one hour online class,"" said Haldwani resident Sandhya Dwivedy. According to Rajpur resident Harish Bhandari, “I am quite furious that our state government has not issued any strict orders to stop such harassment by school administration.

We are getting the reminders from school to deposit the fees of my three kids every day. I work in Delhi but since the implementation of lockdown I have been here and without any pay I cannot deposit three months fee that include all the unnecessary charges.”

On this issue, the chairperson of SCPCR Usha Negi opined that when everyone in the country is trying to help others in every possible way, some schools are still thinking about making money.

She said that those schools that run under charitable trusts and societies are also pressurising parents for fee submission when there is actually an opportunity to do some help and charity. However, there are some schools which have waived off three month fee considering the current crisis, informed Negi. The SCPCR will issue an advisory to the State Government and the Education Department about schools pressurising parents for fee submission, said Negi. She added that no school would be allowed to hike fees even after the lockdown, or charge for any other facilities which are not currently being used by students.

Reportedly, the Principals Progressive Schools’ Association (PPSA) had earlier questioned how the schools would pay salaries to staff if the school fee of three months is waived off. Talking about this, Negi said that paying the staff does not mean that schools will ask for unnecessary charges during the crisis. On being asked about the said issue, chief education officer Asha Rani Painuly stated that until the state administration gives any instructions, nothing can be done by her on this matter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scpcr-to-issue-advisory-to-state-govt-on-school-fees.html
61,20-4-20,Prevention is the key,"In the last couple of decades global warming and consequential ecological problems have been at the centre stage of all climate change discourse. Even if in varying degrees, all developed and developing nations are bearing the impact of globally rising decadal temperatures. Due to the increasing anomalies in weather cycles globally, nations are negotiating possibilities of maximum reduction in green house gas emissions.

A higher concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere has been linked to melting of glaciers, recurrent flooding, droughts, forest fires and resulting population displacement. However there is an important yet often neglected aspect of this global climate crisis. Thus is the prospect of new and deadlier epidemics which have been emanating in the last few years. A greater threat is that such challenging infectious diseases could only proliferate in complexity and number in the coming years. The two most critical areas which can have a potential impact on human health in contemporary world are - climate change and solid waste management. Both are also intricately linked to one another.

The pandemic of Covid- 19 which the world is currently confronting, is a grim instance of how a rapidly contaminating ecosystem is more susceptible to unprecedented human health problems.

It becomes indispensable therefore that all health risks associated with faulty waste management are eliminated. The present crisis is only a warning to the many more epidemics which can arise due to lacunae in effective waste disposal mechanisms.

At the same time it is also a reminder of the need to build better resilience in the face of such natural disasters should they recur in the future.

Most Asian counties including India are experiencing a demographic trend, where population is becoming rapidly urbanised.

In fact half of the world’s mega cities are presently found in Asia. With a haphazard and rapid urban growth, a plethora of infrastructural -economic problems have come up too. The highly industrialised cities despite being engines of economic growth have also become massive generators of solid waste.

The very relationship between solid waste and climatic problems lays in the faulty and non systematic manner in which the former is dealt with. Most of the urbanised metropolitans in India are seething under this vicious cycle of waste mismanagement and environmental degradation. Only a partial chunk of the total urban waste being generated is collected by the municipal authorities and even this waste is dumped in dump sites and landfills.

In fact the waste sector is an identifiable contributor to the total green house gas emissions in India. The emissions in municipal solid waste sector can be attributed to the burning of waste and decaying in the dumping sites. Such activities lead to the emitting of carbon di oxide as well as methane. The sudden rise in many lung disorders in India in past few years can be attributed to crippling levels of particulate matter pollution in India.

Leachate percolation from landfills into the ground water is also a major source of pollution. The metal residues present in leachate enter the food chain as ground water is often used for drinking and irrigation purposes.

This poses a serious public health hazard. The landfills have also been reported to be a breeding ground for disease hosting organisms. Thus a clean and better organised waste management system has to be implemented with cooperation from various sections in the community. At individual level proper segregation as well as minimisation of waste are practices which can go a long run in reducing the menace. A critical aspect of disease prevention during the present crisis is ensuring the safety of waste collecting personnel.

Despite all preventive measures being implemented by the Government, the threat of further spread of the Covid-19 disease cannot be completely ruled out.

As communities are practicing social distancing and observing the lockdown regulations, the dependence on few essential services is indispensable. Facilities like municipal waste collection have to be carried out compulsorily for the upkeep and hygiene maintenance of the community.

As the waste collection personnel are risking their lives in disposing their duties, it also becomes the duty of all the citizens to facilitate their work by extending utmost cooperation. Any careless disposal of medical waste can be a potential source of COVID-19 infection to the municipal workers and rag-pickers.

People must be educated to dispose off their gloves, tissues, sanitiser bottles and used masks into separate bags. Besides, people must also segregate their household waste into different categories like - organic, dry and bio medical waste.

Such a segregation of waste at source will automatically reduce the need for municipal workers to touch and separate waste manually, thereby ensuring their safety further.

Thus by making informed choices and by ensuring our cooperation to the Government we can prevent the dreaded Covid-19 from spreading its wings further.

Climate change and mismanaged waste are the most tangible caused of communicable diseases. So real resistance and resilience can be achieved by an overhauling of our waste management systems and mitigating other major causes of ecological pollution.

As we fight the Covid-19 pandemic, hoping to recover from its clutches soon, we must be futuristic by learning to treat our ecology with care and respect which it deserves.

67,20-4-20,Punjab cops over 55 yrs or with pre-existing medical risk not be deployed on Covid duty,"A day after Ludhiana Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) died of coronavirus, Punjab Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta on Sunday ordered non-deployment of cops over 55 years or those with pre-existing medical risk on frontline jobs.

Announcing several protective and welfare measures for the police personnel on

Covid-19 duty, DGP also ordered strict compliance of his orders on weekly off or rest days of all policemen on frontline duties.

The State police chief had directed all the Commissioners of Police and Senior Superintendents of Police to follow a rotational system of providing a weekly off or rest to the frontline personnel, with efforts to organize deployment in such a manner that two days of rest can be provided to all personnel after every 10 days.

He has also directed that police personnel over 55 years of age or those with pre-existing and enhanced medical risk factors, such as hypertension issues, cardiac history, asthma or a compromised or suppressed immune system for any reason, should not be deployed on the frontline, as far as possible.

To ensure protection for these police personnel, the DGP has also requested the state Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh to direct the State Health Department to provide a minimum of 4050 PPE kits or suits and 18,000 N-95 masks on immediate basis.

“At present, some PPE suits are already available with the Police department, which are being used during the performance of sensitive tasks.

However, the police officers deployed at hotspots, containment zones, clusters, isolation wards, Covid hospitals (Levels 1-2-3) need PPE suits, which are certified by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” he said.

Gupta said that the police personnel who have to come in close contact with either confirmed or suspect cases of coronavirus, while carrying out debriefing, contact tracing and tracking of Tablighi Jamaat cases etc also need such PPE kits.

Listing the welfare measures for police personnel discharging their duties amid Covid-19, the DGP said that to boost their immunity, about 1.36 lakh tablets of multi-vitamins have been distributed among the cops. The police personnel are also being provided with nutritious, rich and adequate diet, to minimize risk to those exposed to coronavirus, and also facing the threat of lowered immunity due to lack of sleep and rest.

Notably, between 43,000 to 48,000 Punjab Police personnel have been deployed in various districts of the state on different days to enforce the curfew in the State, ensure distribution of food, essential supplies and medicines, besides operating Dial 112 Helplines and Covid Helplines etc.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cops-over-55-yrs-or-with-pre-existing-medical-risk-not-be-deployed-on-covid-duty.html
68,20-4-20,Sidhu defies CM’s order to wear masks at public places,"Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu’s ‘mask-less’ act of distributing masks has come under Amritsar Administration’s scanner with the Chief Minister’s Office forwarding a demand notice against the Congress MLA to the Deputy Commissioner concerned. The development comes after a Chandigarh-based advocate has written a letter to the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh demanding to put Sidhu into home quarantine and also withdraw his security during the lockdown period as the former minister is roaming around in Amritsar without a mask amid Covid-19 scare.

Advocate and activist HC Arora, in his letter, has also set a three-day deadline for the Chief Minister, while making it clear that he would be “left with no other option, except to file an urgent writ petition (PIL) in the High Court, for seeking requisite relief, in the public interest”.

“Needless to state that in case appropriate action is not taken on this demand within next two or three days, in that event, I shall be left with no other option, except to file an urgent writ petition (PIL) in the Hon’ble High Court, for seeking requisite relief, in the public interest,” said Arora, in his letter to the Chief Minister.

It has been learnt that the Chief Minister, after receiving the demand notice through e-mail, has forwarded the same to Amritsar Deputy Commissioner for taking appropriate action.

Notably, Arora has also written to the Chief Minister on April 17 urging him to direct the authorities at Amritsar to register an FIR against “VIP figure” for repeatedly moving in the city without wearing a face mask, and thereby putting not only his safety but also the safety of the public, at risk due to spread of Covid-19 pandemic.

The same day, Arora noted, the Chief Minister had issued strict instructions to authorities all over Punjab to challan all those people who come outside their homes without wearing face masks. “I have, however, to point out that ink on your orders had not even dried when yesterday again Sidhu travelled on Amritsar roads in his car, and then came out of his car in front of Civil Hospital, Amritsar, without any mask on his face,” he said while pointing at the related news telecasted on national TV news channels.

Arora added, “Thus, a stage has been reached when Sidhu should be restrained from coming out of his residence and should be ordered to be put under home quarantine during the whole of curfew period, and his security should also be withdrawn, or to register a case against him, as he is misusing his security also by taking his security men along while violating the curfew order,” he demanded. Action be also initiated against Amritsar DC or Commissioner “for deliberate inaction in this sensitive matter pertaining to the safety of the public”. Sidhu, on Saturday, donated 1,000 N95 masks to frontline healthcare personnel of Amritsar and Taran Tarn civil hospitals, and the Government Medical College in Amritsar — which was his fifth public visit since the curfew was imposed in Punjab. To top it all! He defied government orders of mandatory wearing of masks in all his visits. During his brief visits across his constituency, even his security guards and supporters were not seen wearing masks.

It may be pointed that Punjab has made wearing a mask compulsory in public past week. On Friday, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had ordered strict enforcement of the compulsory wearing of masks in the public and asked the police to take stringent action, including the imposition of fines, against the violators.

SIDHU’s DEFENCE

In his defence, Sidhu’s office released a statement, saying, “WHO stresses that it is critical that medical masks and respirators be prioritized for healthcare workers and reminds that a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.

Thus, WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and misuse of masks. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.” “The WHO recommends to only wear a mask if you are ill with Covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have Covid-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or (not) looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask,” the statement, released on Saturday, added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sidhu-defies-cm---s-order-to-wear-masks-at-public-places.html
69,20-4-20,Measures taken to save wildlife in Zoo: Hry Chief warden,"Stating that the Wildlife wing of Haryana Forest department has taken all preventive measures to protect the animals from the deadly corona Virus by keeping a close watch on them, Alok Verma, PCCF and chief warden, Haryana said those staff involved in dealing with animals and birds in Zoos being kept on highest alert.

“Adequate measures such as entire Zoos being frequently sanitised, only essential staff allowed to work, strict social distancing, and keepers maintaining minimum contact with animals, among others are being taken to ensure the welfare of animals,” Verma said, adding that all arrangements have been made as per NTCA guidelines. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Central Zoo Authority had earlier issued directions regarding the same. In Haryana, there are four Zoos at Rohtak, Bhiwani, Hisar and Pipli (Kurukshetra) and Bird Sanctuaries in Bhindawas (Jhajjar), Sultanpur (Gurugram) and a National Park in Kalesar, Yamunanagar.

The Chief Warden said that elaborate measures have been taken to protect the health of captive animals and birds in Zoos in view of this epidemic. Additional bio-security measures, including daily health screening of staff, had been introduced, he said, adding the patrolling staffs have also been asked to keep an eye on any abnormal behaviour by the wildlife at their jurisdictional limit. In addition to this, instructions were given to minimise human-animal interactions, use of safety gear by the staff, isolation of sick animals and sending their samples for testing to three identified veterinary labs.

Yamuna Nagar DFO (Wildlife) Shiv Singh said that the staff have been asked to stay put at the posts and they are being supplied with essentials there to prevent the possibility of their getting infected with COVID-19 and then passing it on to the animals that they have to handle. Zoo keepers who handle them are also being subjected to regular thermal screening to check if they have any symptoms of corona, he said, adding that the food for captive animals is sanitised at the gates before being brought in to be served to them.

“Strict guidelines have been issued to the staff to inform the authorities if they spot the carcass of an animal within the reserve or at its peripheries. They have been asked to inform the senior officers if they see signs of illness in an animal,” he said. Singh said, “The instructions were issued to observe symptoms consistent with COVID-19, such as respiratory signs of nasal discharge, coughing and laboured breathing through direct observation in animals. In case of symptoms, the animals are to be isolated and samples to be collected and sent to the designated animal health institutes to initiate COVID-19 testing, while following all biocontainment and safety measures as per the national protocol.”

The National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), Bhopal, the National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE), Hisar and the Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic (CADRAD), Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareilly are the designated animal health institutes named by the Central Zoo Authority for the purpose of conducting COVID-19 testing.

He said that all vehicles carrying food material are passed through a trough filled with anti-microbial solution in Zoos so that microbes attached to the tyres are removed. Instruction has been given to officials concerned to ensure availability of food and medicinal requirements of animals during lockdown. Singh said wild animals are having a gala time during the lockdown as they are getting bolder and becoming explorers as areas outside their habitat are becoming quiet.

""Wild-life is always happy when environment becomes quiet. They (wild animals) are roaming not only in their own areas but also outside in forest fringe areas,"" he said, adding that due to human activity and busy roads otherwise, they never used to venture out. Now, even spotted deer is trying to come out and ""see what all is happening"".

He further said that they (wild animals) are basically free-ranging animals; when they find that their surroundings have become quiet, they tend to come out and explore. When asked about a leopard attacking a labourer working in the fields and injured him near Pratap Nagar town of Yamunanagar district on April 15, Singh said that big cat might have gone there for hunting dogs when the incident occurred. In front of officials, leopard went to forest area on the same day.

Meanwhile, officials have been directed to keep a vigil so that wild animals such as leopard don’t enter the fields and human habitations. At the same time, as a part of precaution, harvesting should not be done till late evening in some areas, he advised.

When asked about illegal wildlife trade on the rise amid the nationwide lockdown, he said that there is no such report so far. ""Patrolling has been intensified and officers are put on alert. They have been strictly directed to protect exotic birds and save them from being traded,"" Singh said. The Department has taken measures, including stepping up night patrolling, to curb such activities, he added.

He further said that all precautions had been taken to deal with forest fires. ""Round-the-clock monitoring is being undertaken to ensure timely action in cases of detection of forest fires"", Singh added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/measures-taken-to-save-wildlife-in-zoo--hry-chief-warden.html

Confirming the seven cases, State health secretary Dr Nitin Madan Kulkarni said, ""Seven new cases of Covid-19 have been reported. Five cases have been reported from Hindpiri, the epicentre of the pandemic in State. One case has been reported from Bero in Ranchi district while other case has been reported from Simdega.”

With Sunday's findings, the number of positive cases in Simdega has increased to two.

Last week a youth from Simdega was tested postive.

Sources said that the emergence of new cases in Bero and Simdega is cause of concern for State government as both the cases have been reported from rural areas.

Sources said that three cases –two in Ranchi and one in Bero—have links with Tablighi Jamaat, however the district administration is yet to give an official confirmation on this.

Ranchi SDM Lokesh Mishra said, ""The administration is enquiring about the links of these persons with Jammat.""

On Sunday 93 samples were tested in first slot out of which 89 cases were found to be negative, four cases were found positive.

The four cases which were found in the first half of Sunday are of varied age group. Sources said the man who tested positive in Bero is 52-year-old, Simdega youth is 17-year-old while two cases which were recovered from state capital are in age group of 24 and 42 years respectively. The remaining three were reported in late evening.

The first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 31, after a Malaysian woman was tested positive. The woman had reached Ranchi from Delhi after attending the Tablighi Jamaat ( religious convention). Since the recovery of first case in Hindpiri area where the woman was hiding, Hindpiri area has emerged as epicentre of Coronavirus.

On April 2, a positive case was reported from Vishnugarh in Hazaribag followed by cases in Bokaro and other parts of state, but the Hindpiri area still accounts for nearly sixty per cent cases in Jharkhand. Ranchi Hindpiri is hotspot with maximum 21 cases. The district wise figures are Ranchi 22, nine from Bokaro, two from Hazaribag, two from Simdega, one from Dhanbad, Giridih, Koderma.

The district administration has taken several measures to check the spread of disease in Hindpiri area. The entire area has been sealed since the recovery of cases in the area. The district administration is making door to door delivery of foodgrains and medicines. The administration has assigned the job of delivery of foodgrains to volunteers.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/seven-more-covid-19-suspects-test--ve.html

His escape was noticed the same Saturday night and since then a big hunt is on to track him down by three teams of police but he continues to be untraced till the time of filing of this report.

Civil surgeon John F Kennedy said as his swabs were sent for test report of which is yet to come. He was taken down into cornovirus isolation ward on April 17 only and slipped from there on April 18. Kennedy said his health condition was not any worrisome when he was brought in the isolation ward

Kennedy describing his escape as most unfortunate and unwarranted said a test of swab is just for ruling out any morbidity but here this youth in his sheer frustration and ignorance made his escape much to everyone right from health officials to police’s acute stress.

Sources said a repair work is on in the vicinity of this isolation ward which itself raises eyebrows as to how repair work can so go on near or close to the isolation ward as then there will be many hands there to work and there will be many footfall there too.

Sources said this repair or renovation work in the vicinity ought to have been a total avoidable thing but here at this isolation ward its going on poses too many questions to health safety measures.

Sources said the workers engaged in this repair/ renovation work are not equipped with any protective shoes and gloves except masks on their faces.

Sources said it is suspected this youth taking advantage of the presence of these labourers escaped when they after winding up their day’s work on Saturday trooped for their respective homes.

SP Palamu Ajay Linda said, “SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta has apprised me of this work going on there. Police will look into it as to how this can be so allowed in and around isolation ward.”

Linda said he has sought a full report from SDPO in this regard. SP said there should not be movement of people not connected in any way to health duties there at any isolation ward.

Gupta said to the Pioneer,“I too do not understand the exigency of any work that is so going on there even on Sunday today. Police will delve deep into this issue.”

Gupta said, “The escapee had come to Palamu before Holi in March. He came from Gujarat. He had some fever and so villagers pressed him to be here in the isolation ward where he was admitted on April 17 but in panic and foolishness he went out from here without anyone noticing his escape.”

Gupta said, “Our SP Linda has given us this big task to find him out and we are on it but the youth continues to outsmart us.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-suspect-escapes-from-isolation-ward-in-daltonganj.html

76,20-4-20,Punjab to relax lockdown measures from April 20,"Punjab Government has announced to relax lockdown measures from April 20 while declaring more goods as essential including the sale of air-conditioners, air-coolers, fans and their repair shops amid approaching summer, besides permitting sand and gravel mining and stone crushing as part of construction-related activities, along with allowing operation of book shops, among others from Monday.

In line with the Centre’s guidelines, the state would also allow industrial activity in rural areas, provided that operators of industries, employing 10 or more persons, should make all arrangements for the stay or transport of workers.

As per new orders issued by the state Home Department, ‘dhabas’ have also been allowed to remain open but they will serve only packed food.

At the same time, it has been clarified that any activity in the containment zones would continue to be banned.

The State Government has authorized the Deputy Commissioners or District Magistrates to exercise due diligence in regulating timings of various establishments including industries and other permitted activity depending upon local requirements and norms of social distancing.

The trigger for establishing a containment zone is the discovery of two or more confirmed cases of Covid-19 in a locality. The zone is to be set-up by district authorities (DC, SSP, and CS) based on the number of cases, their geographical distribution, and feasibility of sealing the area.

The containment zone can accordingly be starting from a locality to a colony, sector (village), single or multiple wards or the entire city itself, the spokesperson said adding that the guidelines dated April 15, 2020, would be applicable only outside the containment zone which may not be confused with hot-spot, red zone etc.

These set of directions have been issued for the implementation of the Central Government’s revised Covid-19 containment guidelines from April 20, 2020.

In the state, Mohali, Jalandhar, SBS Nagar (Nawanshahr), and Pathankot districts have been declared as coronavirus hotspots, and with Patiala also reporting 15 cases in a day, it is also expected to figure in the red zone.

“The state will follow complete curfew till May 3, 2020, and the prevailing practice of requiring a curfew pass for movement during curfew shall continue,” said the official spokesperson.

Spokesperson said that the State Government has also allowed industrial activity on the condition of due arrangements of stay in factory or transport of workers to be taken care of by the operator, involving employment of 10 or more persons. The prevailing practice of requiring a curfew pass for movement during curfew shall continue.

Construction-related activities like stone crushers, sand and gravel mining have been permitted. Even though it is not specifically mentioned in the (Centre’s) guidelines, it is implied that the related activities in terms of stone crushers, mining of sand and gravel and its transport, sale outlets of cement, steel etc, are also to be permitted. Their working norms can be regulated, as per instructions.

The Centre in its revised guidelines to states for containment of Covid-19 has allowed construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings, water supply and sanitation, renewable energy projects, continuation of works in construction projects within the municipal limits.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-relax-lockdown-measures-from-april-20.html

78,20-4-20,Why you need to use ACs with caution during Covid-19,"Rumours spread on the Internet suggest that use of air conditioners during this summer may not be safe as it can help spread the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The truth, as per the fact check done by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), is not that straightforward.

Based on inputs from doctors, the official handle of PIB Fact Check tweeted that running windows AC in a room where there is no coronavirus patient poses no risk to people.

""As the mercury soars, here's one more #PIBFactcheck.

""Claim: ACs should not be used to cool off in the heat, as they spread #Covid_19.

""Fact : It's a little complicated. Window ACs are ok, but not central air-conditioning. Let's listen to this segment from @DDNewslive,"" said the tweet.

In the video clip accompanying the tweet, doctors are heard saying that in healthcare establishments where there could be coronavirus positive patients, central ACs may pose some risk.

A guidance document by the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating & Air Conditioning Engineers (ISHRAE) also suggested that people should use air conditioners with caution during the pandemic, especially in healthcare establishments.

""The most important factor in this scenario is to ensure that the virus-laden airborne particles do not leak out of the rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients and also to maintain the concentration of virus-laden particles inside the patient room at a minimum,"" said the document titled, ""COVID-19 Guidance Document for Air Conditioning and Ventilation"".

This is required to control the spread of infections and also to protect the healthcare workers, it added.

""As is the normal practice, most of these patient rooms would be served by a HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) system that would be of a recirculatory type, wherein the air from the room is taken back to the AHU (air handling unit) for thermal conditioning and brought back,"" ISHRAE said.

""The same HVAC system could also be connected to a few other areas of the hospital. In some cases, there might be no dedicated return air duct and it could be a ceiling return system.

""If a COVID-19 patient had to be admitted to such a room, it would present a significant risk of the virus-laden particles spreading out from the designated COVID-19 patient rooms,"" the document added.

The engineers suggested how air conditioners should be used in different settings such as homes, commercial establishments, and in healthcare facilities.

The document suggests that recirculation of cool air by room air conditioners must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust by natural exfiltration.

""Set room temperature between 24 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees C. Maintain relative humidity between 40 per cent and 70 per cent,"" ISHRAE said, adding that in humid climates, one should set temperature closer to 24 degrees for de-humidification and in dry climates closer to or at 30 degrees and use fans to increase air movement.

""In dry climates, do not allow relative humidity to fall below 40 per cent. Water evaporating from a pan kept in the room will increase humidity if it falls below 40 per cent,"" it added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/why-you-need-to-use-acs-with-caution-during-covid-19.html

91,20-4-20,Implications of increasing food and fuel supply,"The nation is struggling amidst a complete lockdown for the past fifteen days that has confined everyone to their homes. With most people at home, there has been a surge in the demand for LPG. On April 9th, the Hindu Business Line released an article stating that the Indian Oil Corporation has increased its LPG imports by 50 per cent to meet the growing demand for LPG cylinders during the lockdown. Moreover, free refills are being provided to PMUY beneficiaries for the month of April, May and June 2020. In the last fifteen days, 3.38 crore LPG cylinders have been distributed among LPG customers in the country.

Liquefied petroleum gas or LPG, is one of the most commonly used cooking fuel in urban households and in the past few years after the launch of the PM UjjwalaYojana that provides free LPG connections to poor households, the share of LPG customers has increased. In order to provide security of fuel supply, LPG cylinders are being provided to customers and PMUY beneficiaries along with other essential goods. Since PMUY beneficiaries also qualify for the direct cash transfer of the subsidy on LPG, the entire amount that they pay for their cylinders or refills are being credited to their bank accounts.

Increasing the supply of cooking fuel in this economic situation of a complete lockdown coupled with a pandemic has left people panic-stricken and clueless. This lockdown came suddenly a fortnight ago, and left the most vulnerable sections of our society battling with loss of employment and lack of money in their hands. Under such dire circumstances, the initiative to increase the availability of LPG for residential purposes is a welcome move, especially for LPG users in the country. However, this increase in supply is going to be met with imports rather than indigenous production.

Indian Oil has already decreased its throughput (amount of crude oil being refined) at most of its refineries by 25-30 per cent. In the midst of a crisis like this, where oil refining, wholesale distribution and retail distribution of LPG come under essential services, that have been kept open by the government, scaling up the supply and distribution of LPG is difficult with a fall in throughput and scarcity of workforce. The only alternative way to pump up supply of LPG to domestic customers is to import the additional LPG required.

Indian Oil is planning to increase LPG imports by 50 per cent to meet the additional demand for LPG in the country. Over the last few months, global oil prices have plummeted and this is expected to give some relief to the major oil importers, India being one of them. However, with the increase in LPG imports the positive effect of the reduction in oil prices may not be significant. Although, LPG imports form just about 5 per cent of the total imports, an increase of 50 per cent in LPG imports now, can lead to a 41 per cent increase in LPG imports compared to January 2020. Moreover, the free supply of LPG cylinders to all PMUY beneficiaries is supposed to continue till June. This implies a huge leakage from government reserves, in the form of a higher import bill as well as greater cash transfers to bank accounts of beneficiaries.

However, this does not mean that the government should not help the poor and vulnerable households at all. These are desperate times, and desperate measures will have to be taken. There will always be a trade-off: whether to spend more in providing people with food, money and fuel so that they feel secured in this lockdown or try to correct the fiscal and trade deficits so that the economy does not sink into a recession. It is indeed a tough choice for the government of any country, especially for a country like India that was already grappling with slowing economic activity and a banking sector failure before the pandemic hit.

The need of the hour is to be prudent. Where on the one hand, providing essentials like food and fuel to households is crucial for the people to remain secured during the lockdown, the responsibility of managing trade and fiscal deficits is also important. In a recent interview to NDTV, RaghuramRajan said that India cannot spend on an economic package that 15 to 20 per cent of GDP, despite the debates about the economic package that the government has extended being insufficient. This statement tries to propose a simple point that spending more is not necessarily good for the economy or the people.

Hence, there needs to be a proper planning regarding how increased supply of LPG is going to be met in the next few months. There is already a massive drain of our monetary resources to help those in the medical profession with proper medical gear and infrastructure, to fight the pandemic. In order to keep the economy from plummeting further and being able to fight the Covid disease with our limited capacity, a choice has to be made, a plan has to be chalked out before spending resources and the execution has to be efficient. In these situations, the need for a cheaper alternative fuel that could have been provided to the poor and vulnerable families instead of imported LPG becomes more prominent. Today, if the rural areas in the country would have cleaner and cheaper alternative for cooking like biogas and urban households would have transitioned to the use of electricity for cooking as well, the pressure on importing LPG would definitely have been lesser. Well, this is the time to think, whether there can be an alternative to LPG that can take some load off of the import bill. As for the economy and the country, both will take some time to heal and bounce back from this calamity.

As part of the address to the people in the state through social media, Uddhav said: “The migrants living in the State are in a mood to co-operate with the State Government. They have quietened down now. I would like to tell them once again that we are holding talks with the Union government. I am confident that in the next few days, we will find a way out of the current situation”

“Please don’t worry at all. In Maharashtra, we are slowly starting the activities. If possible, I request you to come back to work. You can continue to earn living.

100,20-4-20,Will request Guv to conduct in dignified manner amid crisis: TMC,"With all its transgression the sneaky coronavirus has failed to keep politics at bay in Bengal. Even as State Governor Jagdeep Dhnakhar got embroiled in a twitter war with the Mamata Banerjee Government for its inept handling of the lockdown protocols, senior TMC leader Sudip Bandopadhyay slammed him for his partisan ways threatening to take the issue up in the Lok Sabha when it opens.

“In this hour of crisis the Governor is doing more politics than the BJP … We will request him to conduct himself in a more dignified manner befitting his high chair” Bandopadhyay said adding how the Governor by “acting in a partisan manner is putting his constitutional post to disgrace.”

He said “if he does not stop acting in a politically partisan manner then we will be forced to raise the issue in the Lok Sabha when it reopens.”

Bandopadhyay was referring to situations where the Dhankhar was “being wrongly informed by the BJP leaders and making adverse comments without checking the truth.”

The Governor had earlier alleged that he was not being kept in the loop about the situation emerging out of the corona outbreak. “Despite several requests and efforts made by my office to get in touch with the Chief Minister, Raj Bhavan remained ignored,” he said, adding “the lockdown between the Raj Bhavan and Nabanna (state secretariat) must end during this fight against a pandemic.

Ruing that his office was not getting any input from the Government he said “I would appeal to the chief minister that this is not time for anyone — for the government or political party to engage in theatrics. It is time for her to adhere to the essence of the Indian Constitution and brief me,” he said.

The Governor later also expressed concerns about alleged mishandling of the public distribution system with many people not getting their share of ration.

Raj Bhavan sources also said that he had expressed concerns over how some BJP MPs like Arjun Singh, John Burla and Subhas Sarkar were prevented from distributing relief materials to the public.

The war of words came amid fresh controversies over a “made up video” in which a poor man from Basihaat town in North 24 Parganas cried pleading hunger and sought urgent relief from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee but subsequently told the television camera that he being a part-time actor was asked by some local people to act like that before the video was made to go viral.

The TMC promptly pointed fingers at the BJP for the mischief soon after the latter went to town complaining how the relief materials being sent by the Centre were being misappropriated by the TMC workers.

While the Trinamool saw BJP hand in the fake video the latter washed its hands from it but insisted that the relief materials were not reaching the target groups and the people down there were starving. The middle-aged ‘actor’ of the video has since been arrested, police said.

Meanwhile, the Government on Sunday decided to introduce both rapid anti-body tests and pool-testing in hotspot and cluster areas as well as the ten districts where there has been no trace of corona infection thus far.

“The pool testing which has been successfully done in Holland, Maharashtra, Andaman and Nicobar Islands will now be introduced here in Bengal with swabs of five persons will be tested with a single kit. This will not only save the kits but also time,” said an official. Bengal has been under fire from critics who blamed the State for under-testing.

The Government’s decision to start pool-testing and rapid tests comes amid reports of 3 doctors of the Calcutta Medical College contracting the disease.

The said doctors have been hospitalized and their 12 other colleagues have been sent to quarantine, sources said adding the doctors of the gynaecology department might have been infected from the patients. Three patients of the same hospital were earlier diagnosed with corona.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/will-request-guv-to-conduct-in-dignified-manner-amid-crisis--tmc.html

The Government is aiming to use 42,000 kits in a week, with the main focus on the containment zones.

“We have started a trial run and training in the LNJP hospital and from Monday, these kits will be used in the hotspot areas,” he said.

Health Minister Satyendar Jain also said there is no point in doing random testing. “These kits will be used on people who ever had even minor symptoms,” he said.

The rapid antibody tests have been initiated in Delhi on Sunday for all the containment zones across the national capital. Two kinds of diagnostic tests are being currently prescribed for use in India— the RT-PCR test and rapid antibody test — as per global health norms.

A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA that detects the virus while the antibody tests, which use blood, detect the body’’s response to the virus.

In rapid antibody test, the result will be positive only if the antibodies have been generated. So, even if a person is infected but the antibodies are not generated, the result will come negative.

RT-PCR test takes time and is a costly affair, because of its elaborate kit.

On the other hand, the rapid antibody test is less expensive and the result can come in 20-30 minutes, experts said.

The number of containment zones in Delhi on Saturday had increased to 76, with eight new zones being added in various areas in one day.

The total number of coronavirus cases in the national capital on Saturday climbed to 1,893, with 186 fresh cases and one death being reported in a day, according to the Delhi Government authorities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capital-gets-42k-rapid-antibody-covid-test-kits.html

Importantly, Delhi has become an epicentre having second-highest number of cases after Maharashtra with 1,893 people testing positive.

Following the mandate of the Central Government, Kejriwal said, “As per the instructions of the Central Government, some restrictions of the lockdown can be lifted from Monday, especially in the areas that have not been severely impacted by Covid-19. We have to deliberate on which restrictions that have been imposed, should be relaxed.” “The Central Government has also said restrictions should not be relaxed in the hotspot areas or containment zones. There are containment zones in all the 11 districts in Delhi.”

It is pertinent to mention that the Delhi Government has done its assessment in consultation with various experts and departments.

“In the last few days, there has been a considerable rise in the number of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi. We have also increased our testing capacity and the cases are also rising.” “ Yesterday, we obtained reports on 736 tests done, out of which 186 or approximately 25 per cent cases were tested positive. All the 186 COVID-19 positive cases that were reported on Saturday were asymptomatic, they didn’t know they had coronavirus. This is more dangerous and worrying because these people tested were living their normal routine, and they must have infected more and more people in the meantime,” he added.

Surprisingly, Delhi’s food distribution centres are also under Corona grip. Interacting digitally, Kejriwal highlighted that while interacting with one of the patients, it was found out that the person had been distributing food in a designated food center of the Delhi Government.

“I have instructed that rapid testing of all the staff and the people who have visited the food center be done. This means that COVID-19 has been spreading in Delhi. The number of containment zones is also rising, which has now reached 77 containment zones.”

“We did random testing in the containment zones, and it was observed that no cases were reported in the areas where containment protocol was strictly followed, but a surge in cases was observed where the protocol was not followed and people defied the norms of social distancing and lockdown.”

Giving example of Jahangir Puri where 26 people of joint family were tested COVID+ because they did not observe the containment protocol, Kejriwal urged people in containment zone not to interact others even within localities.

There are 1893 COVID-19 cases in Delhi, out of which 26 are in ICU, and 6 are on ventilators.

Around 46 people have lost their lives due to COVID-19.

Kejriwal said, “If the lockdown had not been imposed, we would be on par with other nations where the numbers are quite high. What if 3000 people would require the ICUs and 2500 people would require ventilators.”

“We have observed a similar pattern in Italy, Spain and the US, where the ICUs, ventilators and the entire healthcare system were not sufficient in treating all the patients. Our country would be

suffering from a similar fate if the lockdown had not been imposed,” he added.

“We have to deliberate on whether or not any relaxation should be made because as much as we realize that people are in distress and are facing difficulties due to the lockdown, we also have to see that the situation does not worsen in terms of rising COVID-19 positive cases. We have to be patient,”

“We have decided to not relax any restrictions in Delhi for now. We will have discussions with experts and the concerned departments again after a week and will review our decision,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-accounts-for-2--of-indian-population-while-virus-cases-12---cm.html

Speaking at a meeting of G20 ministers organised by the grouping’s chair Saudi Arabia via video-conferencing, Vardhan said India has completed 25 days of the lockdown which will further extend till May 3 and its positive results were evident.

“The results of the same were realised when our case doubling rate which was about 3.4 days on March 17, dropped to 4.4 days by March 25, and is currently about 7.4 days,” he told the G-20 health ministers.

India has successfully tackled public health emergencies of international concern and pandemic in the past as well, Vardhan asserted.

“This time the hallmark of our approach has been fivefold — maintaining a continuous situation awareness; pre-emptive and proactive approach; graded response as per continuously evolving scenario; inter-sectoral coordination at all levels, and lastly but most importantly creating a people’s movement to combat this disease,” he said.

Vardhan’s participation at the virtual meeting of the grouping comes after the March 26 emergency G-20 Summit in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated through video-conferencing and pitched for developing a new crisis management protocol to deal with the global health crisis.

In his address, Modi had also urged the grouping to come out with a concrete action plan to fight the pandemic and said human beings rather than economic targets should be put at the centre of its vision for global prosperity and cooperation.

The G-20 grouping shares 80 per cent of world GDP and 60 per cent of world population.

Vardhan, in his remarks at the meeting, said India started surveillance of flights from Covid-affected countries twelve days before the first case in India on January 30.

By March 22, with less than 400 cases India banned all international flights to and from India, and by March 25 implemented a nationwide lockdown, he pointed out.

“In the past, we as a global community have faced and successfully tackled threats to the health of our people, by a collective sense of purpose, supporting and collaborating with each other. I look forward to similar cooperation and mutually respectful & useful collaborations to deal with coronavirus,” Vardhan was quoted as saying in an official statement.

While some of the countries particularly Japan, Singapore, South Korea have fared well, others are still struggling with Covid-19, he noted. The scale of impact is unprecedented and therefore calls for cooperation between nations to attain normalcy, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/harsh-vardhan-highlights-lockdown-gains--india---s-pre-emptive--proactive-approach.html

120,20-4-20,IIT-B start-ups develop novel tech weapons for frontline warriors,"Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay start-ups have developed several novel technological weapons for front-line professionals and workers –including contactless detection, hot spot monitoring and real-time monitoring of logistics—to combat Covid-19 effectively.

The other weapons that the IIT-Bombay have developed include: smart trolley for hospitals, rapid ambulance service and pregnancy care. “Most of these were developed within days of the nation-wide lock-down announced by the government,” an IIT-B spokesperson said here on Sunday.

Two start-up companies Augle AIand Faclon Labshave devised solutions for detection, tracking and localization in a densely populated city. The temperature sensing system developed by Augle skims through hundreds of people moving in public places.

Tejendu, head of their tech team, said: “We are integrating this with our existing facial recognition system to strengthen the safety and security in offices, government buildings, public places, malls – any place where people gather in large numbers.”

The two start-up companies will also provide drone-based crowd analytics for quarantined areas for increasing the safety of police officials and health workers.

Faclon is working closely with BMC to install automatic plug & play screening devices that can be mounted on wall or tripod. They capture thermal snapshots of individuals andactivate alarms upon detectingthose with fever.

A robotic smart trolley with racks designed by the start-up JanYu Technologiesis being tested in local hospitals.

Dr. Om Singh of Lifecare Hospital, Vasai said that the trolley with its WiFi connected tablet screen and in-built camera for patient interaction through live audio-visuals.

Lt. Gen. Subrata Saha (Retd.) tweeted about the smart trolley for remote care for COVID patients. These trolleys can be remotely operated, for taking food, medicine, clothing and other critical supplies between isolation wards and supply units.

“Our company develops robots for hazardous workspaces. We modified these to meet the current requirements, and are delivering trolleys to hospitals in Hyderabad, Lucknow and Delhi” Sai Hemanth, founder of the company said.

Routetomarket Media India, which offers sales, distribution and media management services, is manufacturing customisable personal protection equipment (PPE) for healthcare professionals, law and order personnel and other frontline workers. Harsh, one of the founders of R2MI, said: “We are manufacturing about 5,000 PPEs per day and have pledged to donate 50% of them.”

Adapt Ideations provides Cloud-based platforms for real-time monitoring of logistics and delivery. They utilized their network to manufacture face protection shields with BSL-2 compliance for use by doctors, health workers and enforcement officials.

The IIT-spokesperson said: “As of today, 200 face shields were donated to Thane traffic police,and 1250 were supplied to Aastha Pratishthan for Ratnagiri Police.More are in production, to meet the requests from Andhra Pradesh police, Telangana medical authorities, and Dharavi residents in Mumbai”.

A PhD student Farha joined hands with Sukanya, founder of a bioplastics start-up called Phabio, to develop a community engagement project. Their Spot. Corona app provides a heat map for informed decisions on contaminant zones, by predicting the number of hidden and reported cases. It uses multiple sets of data including symptoms, detection, travel history and contact tracing to identify infection hotspots. Thishelps in deciding about increased tests, optimal isolation zones and localized lockdown.

The CareNxteam developed a video series and webinars called ‘Don't Panic, Protect’in partnership with renowned gynaecologists, doctors and counsellors. Their app is used by frontline workers to counsel more than 10,000 pregnant women in remote areas.

The HelpNowstart-up team developed an app called MedCabs, reducing the time required to get an ambulance to under 15 minutes. They are aggregating ambulances, mobilizing Uber drivers andgiving them AHA-certified training as well as protective equipment.More than 350 such vehicles are currently moving on Mumbai roads, and have serviced over 9000 calls for help. The team launched a 24x7 helpline to provide sanitized ambulances with ventilators for COVID emergenciesand are helping the government to sanitize public places like CST, BKC and Dharavi.

“HelpNow was started by Aditya Makkar after his father suffered a heart attack and was told to wait for 45 minutes for an ambulance; he was saved by driving to the hospital in their own car” Dr. Aparna Rao, who coordinates various courses offered by Desai Sethi School for Entrepreneurship at IIT Bombay, said. More than 25 start-ups including Augle, Adapt, CareNx, Faclon, HelpNow, JanYu, Phabio, R2MI and others were started by IITB students who were inspired and empowered through DSSE courses and mentoring programs.

We are proud to see them rising to meet the COVID challenges with fresh thinking and effective solutions.” Dr Rao added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/iit-b-start-ups-develop-novel-tech-weapons-for-frontline-warriors.html

These are brand names of ‘desi daaru’ or the country liquor (arrack to be precise) distilled and sold in interior Kerala for those tipplers who could not survive without their daily quota of spirits.

A 200 ml measure of Manavatti will make the tippler behave like a bride! The head will bow down in shyness till it hits the chest. Aana Mayakki is so lethal that a small measure will put the man out of action for hours.

There are persons in all panchayats and municipalities well versed in distilling the country liquor with minimum raw materials and equipment. A little bit of ammonium sulphate, used batteries, and rotten vegetables are the ingredients.

The desi daaru made a return with the closure of the liquor outlets in Kerala and Tamil Nadu as part of the national lockdown. Both the States have fairly large number of tipplers who did not anticipate this kind of deprivation from the authorities, according to Jose Roshan, an entrepreneur in Perumbavoor. Roshan knows the spots in the town where daaru is available. With more than hundred thousand migrant labors in the town, bootleggers are doing roaring business and the coronavirus has brought them a bonanza through Manavatti and AM.

The case in Tamil Nadu is no different. The last two days saw police seizing liquor stored in unauthorized places in Puthukottai district and destroying the same by pouring the spirits into deep pits much to the anguish and agony of the tipplers. Some of them were seen pleading with the police not to be cruel and to show some kindness towards their agony.

There are reports from all over the State about bootleggers being arrested and illegal stuff getting destroyed. But for those in the know of things and who has right contacts at right places, freshly distilled daaru is available 24x7. One has to remember that the non-availability of liquor has claimed at least ten lives in Kerala alone.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bootleggers-make-hay-with-desi-daaru-in-tn--kerala.html
123,20-4-20,Priyanka urges UP Govt to evolve plan to bring back migrant workers,"Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday called upon the Uttar Pradesh Government to evolve a plan to help migrant workers from the State reach their home.

In a video appeal, she urged the State Government to set up a helpline and control room to reach out to all those migrant workers from UP who are stranded at various places.These workers are our own. It is the responsibility of all of us to help them. We cannot leave them like this. We have to find a way out,"" she said.

""I urge the Uttar Pradesh Government to set up a helpline and a control room of 1,000 persons so that these stranded workers can be reached out. You have to evolve a plan to bring them back,"" she said.

Gandhi said she has talked to the migrant workers from the northern state who are stuck in different places and are finding it difficult to survive as they are now huddled together in one room.She said the migrants are scared and want to come back to their homes in UP, as they have no ration or cash left.

The Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh also lauded the state government for bringing back stranded students from Kota in Rajasthan.

""These migrant workers are also our own. They do not have anything to eat. Helping them is also the responsibility of the state government,"" she said in her appeal.

Thousands of migrant workers have been stranded at state borders and in various large towns due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus.

124,20-4-20,Minister flouted lockdown norms: BJP,"The opposition BJP has accused Chhattisgarh Excise Minister Kawasi Lakhma of violating the coronavirus lockdown norms during his visit to Raigarh district on Saturday and demanded registration of a case.

The minister, however, has refuted the charges by terming them as “baseless”.

“At a time when people are being asked to stay indoors and not to step out unnecessarily to prevent the spread of coronavirus, state minister Kawasi Lakhma made a surprise visit to Raigarh town on Saturday,” said Gomti Sai, BJP MP from Raigarh on Sunday.

Without informing anyone, the minister travelled for about 250 kms from Raipur to Raigarh by road and returned on Sunday morning, she alleged.

“Neither was he seen wearing a face mask nor he followed social distancing protocol,” Sai claimed.

Moreover, a three-star hotel which was shut due to the lockdown was opened for the minister’s stay, the MP alleged.

“The minister even met with an MLA of his party, the Mayor, the party workers and a few media persons in violation of prohibitory orders,” she said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/minister-flouted-lockdown-norms--bjp.html
125,20-4-20,Army now manages Narela quarantine centre,"Extending all out support in the national effort to fight coronavirus pandemic, the Army is now managing the Narela quarantine here. It is one of the biggest centres in the country to look after corona patients and now has nearly 1,300 people in its care. In a similar endeavour, the Navy is looking after people of Karwar in Karnataka and its hospital INS Patanjali, at present, is treating nine corona positive.

Giving details of the army efforts, officials said here on Sunday the force has taken over the responsibility of managing the Narela quarantine centre in Delhi during the day from April 16. An Army medical team was deployed at Narela centre since April 01 to assist the civil administration.

“From April 16, the Army has taken the initiative to manage the facility from morning 8:00 am to evening 8:00 pm relieving the Delhi Government Doctors and medical staff to manage the facility only during the night. The Army team comprising of 40 personnel which includes six medical officers along with 18 paramedical staff have volunteered to stay within the premises only,” the Army said.

Presently, 932 members who attended a religious congregation in Nizamuddin area in Delhi are being taken care at the facility out of whom 367 have tested COVID-19 positive, the Army stated.

The inmates have been very cooperative and positive to the Army medical team, thereby, facilitating smooth handling of all medical procedures, the Army said adding there is tremendous synergy with the civil administration to run this entire facility. The Narela centre was established by the Delhi Government in the middle of March.

Narela Quarantine Centre in Delhi is amongst the largest centres in the country for managing the COVID suspects. Initially, 250 foreign nationals arriving from friendly foreign countries were kept in this centre. Later an additional strength of approximately 1,000 more were brought here from Nizamuddin Markaz. The professional approach of the Army Medical Team has won the hearts of inmates, who have been very cooperative and positive to the Army Medical Team, thereby, facilitating smooth handling of all medical procedures., officials said.

Chief of Defence Staff(CDS)General Bipin Rawat had visited the camp some weeks back to boost the morale of the army team and assure the local administration of all support by the armed forces.

Similarly, the Indian Naval Hospital Patanjali at Karwar has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, by treating the patients from the Uttara Kannada district.

Acting on a request from the Karwar District Administration upon announcement of nation-wide lockdown on 25 Mar 20, Patanjali was prepared in every aspect within 24 hours to receive the first group of COVID-19 positive patients on 28 Mar 2020. A team of three doctors, nine medical staff alongwith and nine support staff has ensured 24 x 7 care to the nine COVID-19 positive patients admitted thus far.

Out of the nine patients admitted at the hospital, eight have been cured and discharged so far. With the discharge of these eight patients over last few days, the hospital is now attending to a lone patient admitted on April 16 who is also responding favourably to the treatment.

In view of this additional responsibility, INS Patanjali has made alternate arrangements for routine medical attention to the large population of service personnel and families dependent on the hospital.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/army-now-manages-narela-quarantine-centre.html

127,20-4-20,Ministry disapproves spraying of chemical disinfectants on people,"The Union Health Ministry has disapproved spraying of chemical disinfectants on people to disinfect them from COVID-19, saying that it is physically and psychologically harmful.

""Even if a person is potentially exposed to the Covid-19, spraying disinfectants on external parts doesn't kill the virus that has entered your body,"" the Ministry said in an advisory issued recently.

The advisory came following reports of some health workers in Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh using hose pipes to douse disinfectants on a group of migrant workers, amid fears that a large scale movement of people from cities to the countryside risked spreading the coronavirus. The incident had caught everyone's attention when its video went viral on social media.

To ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future, the Government advisory said “Spraying individuals with chemical disinfectants is physically and psychologically harmful. Disinfectants were chemicals that destroy disease causing pathogens or other harmful microorganisms.”

The Ministry said spraying of chlorine on individuals could lead to irritation of eyes and skin and potentially gastrointestinal effects, like nausea and vomiting. ""Inhalation of sodium hypochlorite can lead to irritation of mucous membranes in nose, throat and respiratory tract and may also cause bronchospasm,"" it said.

Also, use of such measures might lead to a false sense of disinfection and safety, it said and added it could hamper public observance of hand washing and social distancing measures.

The Union Health Ministry said it had received many queries regarding the efficacy of disinfectants, like sodium hypochlorite, spray to disinfect people.

The strategy seems to have gained a lot of media attention and is also being reportedly used at local levels in certain districts/local bodies.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ministry-disapproves-spraying-of-chemical-disinfectants-on-people.html
128,20-4-20,Nieva expects national camp to resume next month,"Indian boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva expects the national camp to resume at least partially next month and foresees no hiccups in fans rushing back to live sport in the age of social distancing as he feels people always “look for risks”.

The seasoned coach, who has been with the Indian team since 2017, is quite optimistic of things improving by the beginning of next month despite the rising COVID-19 cases.

“I think the camp will restart next month. If not full strength, then at least the core group,” he said.

The core group comprises the ones who have already qualified for the Olympics and those who are seen to be strong contenders to make the cut in future qualifiers.

Asked what gives him the belief that camps would be good to go if the national lockdown ends, the Swede said, “That’s my hunch. Of course I can be wrong but I think we will be able to restart early next month.”

“Humans have the ability to adapt to different situations. And I think here, people are facing up to the reality quite well even though it is an unprecedented crisis.”

Talking of the crisis and its impact on sports, Nieva said things would never be the same again but asserted that people will not give up on live sports either.

“In amateur boxing, we are used to fighting in empty halls, so no fan concerns for us,” he joked.

“But seriously speaking, yes, there will be more restrictions on movement of people, the security is going to be tighter, it won’t be that easy to travel. But fans, they are going to rush back at the first opportunity,” he predicted.

“People don’t care. I think they should be more careful but mostly they are not. They will come back easily because they have been confined at homes for too long.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nieva-expects-national-camp-to-resume-next-month.html
129,20-4-20,"Govt U-turn leaves Amazon miffed, retailer body overjoyed","The government’s U-turn on home delivery of non-essential items will leave consumers disappointed, the world’s largest online retailer Amazon said, but the decision was welcomed by local kirana store body CAIT that called it the “most pragmatic”.

Four days after allowing e-commerce firms to also deliver non-essential items such as electronic goods and readymade garments, the government on Sunday said non-essential items will continue to be prohibited during the lockdown period.

Commenting on the decision, Amazon India said the new guidelines will disappoint consumers whose list of essentials has expanded to ‘work from home’ and ‘study from home’ products, as well as small businesses, sellers and manufacturers.

The company said it will continue to follow the guidelines and deliver essential products and work with authorities for expedited processes to make safe deliveries of priority products possible.

“The new guideline will disappoint not only the consumers whose list of essentials had expanded to work from home and study from home products but also the thousands of small businesses, sellers and manufacturers across the country, who had geared up in the last 48 hours to provide millions of people with safe access to products,” Amazon India spokesperson said.

Amazon India further said the company hopes that “this situation is rectified soon so that the urgent need of consumers is met and that there is revival of economic activity”.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which had been campaigning hard against allowing e-commerce firms to also commence non-essential deliveries during the lockdown period, “lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the most pragmatic decision” of “valuing the sentiments of Indian traders and protecting their business interests”. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on his part said the move will “help in creating a level-playing field for small retailers”.

Separately, the Retailers Association of India (RAI) said the government’s home delivery permissions need to be broad based and all types of retailers, including neighbourhood stores, should be allowed to operate.

The retailers’ body said allowing neighbourhood stores and large essential products’ chain retailers to do home delivery will help fulfil consumer needs in these trying times and play a part in enhancing social distancing.

Soon after the government had on April 16 announced graded plan to lift the lockdown by allowing all e-commerce deliveries and movement of trucks, some states such as Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan issued notifications allowing non-essential deliveries alongside essential ones. CAIT had resented the move and said that the state governments were against Indian traders and “prefer to destroy the businesses of Indian traders at the hands of foreign e-commerce players”.

“Multinational e-commerce players have been trying to disrupt the businesses of small Indian traders by adopting unfair business practices such as deep discounting and predatory pricing by controlling inventory. Even in the lockdown period, they would have adopted their vitiated business model and promote all kinds of malpractices to damage the foundation of Indian retail,” CAIT said in a statement on Sunday.

The home ministry on Sunday issued an order saying the following clause — “E-commerce companies. Vehicles used by e-commerce operators will be allowed to ply with necessary permissions” — is excluded from the guidelines issues.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-u-turn-leaves-amazon-miffed--retailer-body-overjoyed.html

“CBDT today said that in order to facilitate taxpayer to avail full benefits with various timeline extensions up to 30th June 2020 granted by the government, it has initiated necessary changes in the return forms so that taxpayers could take benefits of their transactions carried out during the period from 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020 in the return forms for FY 2019-20,” an official statement said.

The necessary modifications in the return forms are being made to allow taxpayers to avail the benefits of their investments and transactions made for the April-June 2020 period. Once the revised forms are notified, it will further necessitate the consequential changes in the software and return filing utility.

Thereby, the return filing utility after incorporating necessary changes shall be made available by May 31, 2020 to avail benefits for FY 2019-20.

Due to outbreak of Covid-19, the government has extended various timelines under the Income-tax Act, 1961 vide Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation of certain provisions) Ordinance, 2020.

Accordingly, the time for making investment and payments for claiming deduction under Chapter-VIA-B of IT Act which includes Section 80C (LIC, PPF, NSC and so on), 80D (mediclaim), 80G (donations), and others for FY 2019-20 has also been extended to June 30 2020.

Further, the dates for making investment, construction or purchase for claiming roll over benefit in respect of capital gains under sections 54 to section 54GB has also been extended to June 30, 2020. So, return forms are being revised to facilitate reporting of the transactions of the relief period, said the statement.

Generally the income-tax return forms are notified in the first week of April.

This year also the e-filing utility for filing of return for Assessment Year 2020-21 was made available as on April 1, 2020, and the Income-tax Return (ITR) Forms ITR-1 (Sahaj) and ITR-4 (Sugam) for the FY 2019-20 (Assessment Year 2020-21), too, were already notified vide notification dated January 3, 2020.

132,20-4-20,Ex-HP CM calls for ban on Tablighi Jamaat,"Senior BJP leader in Himachal Pradesh Shanta Kumar on Sunday sought an immediate ban on the Tablighi Jamaat, claiming it is responsible for spreading coronavirus in half of the country.

“Their insolence has not stopped. Stones were pelted on health workers. I want to say to the government that enough has been tolerated,” Kumar, a former chief minister, said in a Facebook post.

“It is because of the Tablighi Jamaat that the disease spread to almost half of the country. Hundreds will die,” he said.

“Now immediately ban this Jamaat,” the veteran politician added.

The Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz (headquarters) in Delhi’s Nizamuddin West emerged as a coronavirus hotspot as hundreds of people, who attended a religious congregation there in the second week of March, tested positive for COVID-19.

Several others spread across the country, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat, are suspected to be carriers of the deadly virus.

In an apparent reference to Kangra MP Kishan Kapoor and Mandi MP Ramswaroop Sharma, who recently returned to the state from Delhi despite the lockdown, he said, “Some friends have rightly raised questions about our two MPs.”

Without naming the parliamentarians, Kumar said, “I want to say clearly that the law is for everybody and the law is to be obeyed.

133,20-4-20,MP: NSA detainee virus patient escapes from hosp,"(): A man detained under the National Security Act (NSA), who had recently tested coronavirus positive, escaped from a hospital here on Sunday while undergoing treatment, an official said.

134,20-4-20,Alarming rise in asymptomatic cases new concern,"An alarming rise in asymptomatic persons — they do not show noticeable symptoms like illness, but can still pass the Coronavirus to others — turning out to be Covid-19 positive is the next big concern for the Government, already grappling with an ever-increasing tally of cases of the deadly pathogen in India.

On Sunday, the positive cases crossed the 16,000-mark while the toll was nearly 550 across the States.

With 186 asymptomatic cases, Delhi joined the list of States like Karnataka, where 60 per cent of the total 315 cases are asymptomatic ones. In worst-affected Maharashtra, the trend is more worrisome and alarming as over 70 per cent of novel coronavirus cases in the State are asymptomatic with patients having no knowledge that they were infected.

Various studies using the mathematical modelling of outbreaks in Tianjin, China, and Singapore in January and February have also found significant amounts of spread by people who had not shown or developed Covid-19 symptoms.

The asymptomatic cases came to the fore only after India started aggressive testing of all foreign-returned and those with travel history to Covid-19-incidence regions of the country. Some even tested positive way after completing the 14-day period.

A district-wise analysis of data in Karnataka up to April 16 shows 186 of the 315 Covid-19 patients to be asymptomatic patients.

Experts say that this trend will add additional stress on the state machinery, which is already struggling to cope with the increasing samples it has to test daily.

“If there are more asymptomatic cases than those patients with symptoms, the authorities will not be able to neglect a large section of the population, which means an added burden on testing labs,” one of them said. An asymptomatic person does not show noticeable symptoms like illness, but can still pass the virus to others.

According to researchers, with a very high viral load in their upper respiratory tract, such persons can shed the virus through spitting, touching their mouths or noses and then a surface, or possibly talking. People who don't feel ill end up coughing or sneezing occasionally.

“We are actually dealing with a very huge challenge along with the rest of the world. In this particular infectious disease, not only people who are symptomatic, but even asymptomatic persons as a carrier may pass on the infection,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry had said a few days ago.

If the asymptomatic cases are not tracked down early and subjected to the preventive and therapeutic interventions, the country might witness rapid spurt in the cases.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray too cautioned that over 70 per cent of novel coronavirus cases reported in the state were asymptomatic and the patients did not know that they were infected. ""70 to 75 percent positive cases are asymptomatic. At least 52 per cent of the patients are in serious conditions. Many have reported in the last stage. I want to appeal that do not hide symptoms,"" Thackeray said.

Similarly, in Tamil Nadu, which is the third worst-hit State many patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 , were asymptomatic. So far, 15 COVID-19 positive patients have died in Tamil Nadu while in Odisha, asymptomatic cases and discovery of coronavirus infection in persons even after the 14-day quarantine or isolation period has added to the trouble of the Government, underlining an urgent need to redefine efforts for containing spread of COVID-19 in the State.

While asymptomatic cases constitute almost the bulk of COVID-19 cases in the State, the pattern has led to serious concerns over their ability to spread the virus in the community without knowledge of themselves or their contacts.

Health experts have called for aggressive testing apart from carrying out strict containment measures at places where cluster of positive cases has emerged.

In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, expressed concern about the spread of the disease by people who haven't yet developed symptoms, or who are only a bit sick.

""There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or even presymptomatic. That means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people,"" he said.

Others agree that people without serious symptoms play a substantial role in the spread of the new coronavirus.

""Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic transmission are a major factor in transmission for Covid-19,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

Also, large-scale studies using mathematical modelling of outbreaks in Tianjin, China, and Singapore in January and February have found significant amounts of spread by people who had not yet developed symptoms.

The study shows that between 48% and 66% of the 91 people in the Singapore cluster contracted the infection from someone who was pre-symptomatic. Of the 135 people in the Tianjin cluster, between 62% and 77% caught it from someone who was pre-symptomatic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/alarming-rise-in-asymptomatic-cases-new-concern.html
135,20-4-20,Home is the new office and internet is the new meeting room: PM Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took to the employment and business-oriented platform Linkedin to share his thoughts on Covid-19 saying the contagion has “changed the contours of professional life and these days home is the new office and internet is the new meeting room”.

“For the time being, office breaks with colleagues are history,” he said and went out to maintain that he too has adapted these changes. “Most meetings, be it with ministerial colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing,"" Modi wrote in an article, ‘Life in the era of Covid-19’, on the networking site.

“It has been a topsy-turvy start to the third decade of this century. COVID-19 has brought with it many disruptions,” said the PM adding India’s energetic and innovative youth can show the way in ensuring a healthier and prosperous future.

But at the same time, he cautioned “Covid-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood”.

Modi told the young professionals that digitalization has helped Government to reach out and deliver to common people in the lockdown days of Covid-19 pandemic, overcoming the bureaucratic hurdles. In order to get ground level feedback from various stakeholders, there have been videoconference meetings with several sections of society.

“There were extensive interactions with NGOs, civil society groups and community organisations. There was an interaction with Radio Jockeys too. Besides that, I have been making numerous phone calls daily, taking feedback from different sections of society. One is seeing the ways through which people are continuing their work in these times. There are a few creative videos by our film stars conveying a relevant message of staying home. Our singers did an online concert. Chess players played chess digitally and through that contributed to the fight against COVID-19. Quite innovative! The work place is getting Digital First. And, why not?” said Modi in a lengthy article.

He reiterated that the most transformational impact of Technology often happens in the lives of the poor. It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures, he said.

“Let me give you an example. When we got the opportunity to serve in 2014, we started connecting Indians, especially the poor with their Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar & Mobile number. This seemingly simple connection has not only stopped corruption and rent seeking that was going on for decades, but has also enabled the Government to transfer money at the click of a button. This click of a button has replaced multiple levels of hierarchies on the file and also weeks of delay.

“India has perhaps the largest such infrastructure in the world. This infrastructure has helped us tremendously in transferring money directly and immediately to the poor and needy, benefiting crores of families, during the COVID-19 situation,” wrote Modi, also explaining the role of Internet brought in the education sector.

“COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity, he said. The Prime Minister also wrote on the need of new investment models for farmers.

“COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together. Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience,” he said urging the young professionals to concentrate on fitness, Yoga and use of traditional medicine.

“Lastly, and importantly, please download Aarogya Setu Mobile App. This is a futuristic App that leverages technology to help contain the possible spread of COVID-19. More the downloads, more its effectiveness,” Modi stressed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/home-is-the-new-office-and-internet-is-the-new-meeting-room--pm-modi.html
136,20-4-20,India asks Pak to ‘urgently’ repair damaged Kartarpur Gurudwara domes,"A day after some domes of Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib were damaged due to rains and strong winds, India on Sunday asked Pakistan to “urgently” repair the damage keeping in view the sentiments of Sikhs.

Elaborating upon this here, sources said India has taken up the issue of the collapse of domes at Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib with Pakistan. ""It has been highlighted that the damage to the structures in the Gurdwara have caused great consternation to Sikhs. Their strong sense of faith and devotion to the holy site must be fully understood and appreciated.""

""India has urged Pakistan that in deference to the sentiments of the Sikh community, the deficiencies which led to the damage to the newly constructed structures be urgently rectified and remedied,"" they said.

At least, two domes of the shrine collapsed during heavy winds and rain. Several photos posted on social media over the weekend showed at least two domes of the Gurdwara had fallen off during heavy rains and strong winds..

The photos were widely shared on social media, and the Indian side raised the damage in a “note verbale” sent to Pakistani authorities.

The pilgrimage and registration for Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara was stopped on March 15 amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Government also stopped movement of all types of passengers through the international border points with Pakistan.

137,20-4-20,Observe Modi’s mantra ‘stay where you are’: Javadekar,"Refusing to be drawn into any controversy against the backdrop of the UP Government bringing back thousands of its students in buses from Kota, Information and Broadcasting Minister, on Sunday, however, called for fully observing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s request to people to stay wherever they are. He also asserted that unlike leaders in some other countries, who are “confused” between the choices of shutdown and letting economic activities pick up, Modi is “not in two minds” about the way forward and knows what needed to be done and when.

The Yogi Adityanath Government had on Saturday sent buses to Kota in Rajasthan to bring back students from the State stuck there. This had irked Bihar Chief Minsiter Nitish Kumar who said it was against the spirit of lockdown

A day before a host of relaxations to boost economic activities kicked in amid the nationwide lockdown, Javadekar said that more relief measures are bound to come if India continues to manage the coronavirus crisis well, asserting that “you cannot (have) lockdown permanently”.

When asked about the incident of buses ferrying UP students, Javadekar told PTI, “I will not go into any particular incident but let me make it clear that the Prime Minister has spoken about people facing hardship when they are away from home. He has advised them to stay wherever you are. That is the real point,”

Some Opposition leaders have also questioned why the Central Government is not making similar provisions for stranded migrant labourers to return to their homes.

“Our policy is stay wherever you are and help each other,” Javadekar said, adding that Modi’s appeal in this regard should be observed 100 per cent.

A member of the group of ministers to oversee the measures to combat the pandemic, Javadekar said, “The PM gave the call of lockdown at the right time and is now partially allowing economic activity while the lockdown continues. With such a (huge) population we have managed well, if this continues we will get more relief.”

While the relaxations starting from April 20 are primarily aimed at boosting the rural economy, Javadekar expressed confidence that economic activities will start in cities as well “sooner than later”.

“The lockdown has been very successfully conducted. The world is praising it because this is the way to fight the coronavirus. But even after this you cannot (have) lockdown permanently. It was needed to start economic activity. The world has seen that in such a pandemic the country which saves lives actually then gets better. We have saved lives and at the same time we must start economic activity. To that end Prime Minister has partially opened economic activities,” he said.

To a question about Rahul Gandhi’s claim that the lockdown is not a solution to the pandemic, he took a dig at him, saying that the Congress leader must be “more knowledgable” about COVID-19 than others.

“The world is praising India for timely lockdown and its good implementation. Compared to what we are witnessing in western countries, we are doing much better,” the senior BJP leader said, in an apparent reference to thousands of deaths in developed countries like the US, France and Italy.

Javadekar said, the PM kept a keen eye on the COVID spread outside India even when there was not a single case here and would tell his cabinet colleagues about its potential danger and seriousness.

India now has 700 COVID-19 hospitals, over one lakh isolation beds, more than 11,000 ICUs for coronavirus patients and has begun manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), rapid test kits and masks that it did not no earlier, he added.

The Union Minister said the partial resumption of economic activities, including all agriculture-related work, fishery and dairy works besides industries active in rural areas, under the prescribed guidelines, will be a good relief to the rural economy. The work under MNREGA will also start and over 13 crore families will benefit, he stated.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/observe-modi---s-mantra----stay-where-you-are-----javadekar.html

139,20-4-20,"Govt unlikely to exempt GST on ventilators, masks, PPEs as it would lead to blocking of ITC","The government is unlikely to exempt GST on medical items like ventilators, PPEs, masks, test kits and sanitisers, as it would lead to blocked input tax credit (ITC), thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing and increase the price for consumers.

There have been demands from certain sections to exempt GST on certain items like ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPEs), masks, test kits and sanitisers that are essential items for treatment of COVID-19 saying that GST exemption on these items would lead to reduction in prices. Currently, GST rate on ventilator is 12 per cent; on mask, it is 5 per cent; on test kits, it is 12 per cent; on sanitiser, it is 18 per cent; and on PPE, it is 5 per cent (costing up to Rs 1,000) and 12 per cent (if the cost is more that Rs 1,000 per piece).

Sources said GST exemption on such items would lead to blocked input tax credit (ITC), thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing and a higher price for consumers.

GST exemption on such items would jeopardise the interest of the industry and would not result in any significant gains to consumer, they said adding that in the past, GST exemption on sanitary napkin has led to similar situation for the domestic manufacturers.

The sources said that while consumers do not gain from GST exemption on these items, the compliance burden would increase for manufacturers as they would be required to maintain separate account of inputs, input services and capital goods used for manufacture of these items. In case, they are not in a position to maintain separate account, they shall be required to reverse the input tax credit on all inputs input services used in manufacture of exempted PPE after applying detailed calculations.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-unlikely-to-exempt-gst-on-ventilators--masks--ppes-as-it-would-lead-to-blocking-of-itc.html

Trump, who has expressed disappointment over China’s handling of the coronavirus disease, alleged non-transparency and initial non-cooperation from Beijing with Washington on dealing with the crisis.

“If they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences. You’re talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody’s seen since 1917,” he told reporters at a White House news conference on Saturday.

Trump said his relationship with China was very good till the time the deadly COVID-19 swept across the world.

“The relationship was good when we were signing that, but then, all of a sudden, you hear about this. So, it’s a big difference. You know, the question was asked would you be angry at China. Well, the answer very well might be a very resounding yes, but it depends,” Trump said.

The president underlined that there was a big difference between a mistake that got out of control and something done deliberately.

“In either event, they should have let us go in. You know, we asked to go in very early and they didn’t want us in. I think they knew it was something bad and I think they were embarrassed,” Trump said.

China has come under increasing global pressure over lack of transparency in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has so far infected over 2,333,160 people and claimed more than 160,790 lives across the world.

President Trump on Saturday said his administration was looking into reports that the novel coronavirus “escaped” from a Wuhan laboratory before it spread to the world.

“We’re looking at it, a lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told the media when asked if there was an investigation into whether the coronavirus disease escaped from a lab in China’s COVID-19 ground-zero city of Wuhan.

Trump’s comments have come two days after another 1,300 fatalities were added to the official count in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started in November last year. The revision puts China’s overall death toll to more than 4,600.

According to farmers, the exemption given to farm sectors and agri machineries by the Home Ministry, have not reached the local authorites that’s why they have not allowed the movement of farm machineries.

""Over the past week, we have continued to adjust down our country-specific real GDP growth forecasts on the back of persistent low oil prices and the widening spread of COVID-19. Our forecasts remain fluid and, even despite the recent downward revisions, we believe that the risks remain skewed to the downside,"" the rating agency said.

For India, it said the real GDP growth rate for 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021) has been revised down to 1.8 per cent from 4.6 per cent, previously.

""We now expect private consumption to contract, versus a weak expansion previously, due to large scale loss of income across the economy in the face of a worsening domestic outbreak of COVID-19,"" it said.

Fitch Solutions also anticipated a deeper contraction in fixed investments as businesses choose to cut back on capital expenditure to conserve cash amid elevated economic uncertainty.

""The slow roll-out of fiscal stimulus by the central government will only exacerbate India's economic woes,"" it added.

For China, it revised downwards its 2020 real GDP forecast to 1.1 per cent from 2.6 per cent previously, to reflect the impact of a worsening global economic outlook.

""Real GDP (of China) contracted by a sharp 6.8 per cent y-o-y in Q1 2020, and our current forecast reflects our view that private consumption and net exports will continue to drag heavily,"" it said. ""Meanwhile, targeted fiscal stimulus should see fixed investment growth come in relatively flat, while strong government consumption will provide the bulk of support and prevent a full-year contraction in 2020.""

154,20-4-20,Death sparks unrest at major migrant camp in Greece,"A fire ripped through one of Greece’s largest migrant camps leaving widespread damage and many people homeless after the death of an Iraqi woman sparked unrest, officials said on Sunday.

The blaze late Saturday at Vial camp on Chios island destroyed the facilities of the European asylum service, a camp canteen, warehouse tents and many housing containers, Migration Ministry Secretary Manos Logothetis told AFP.

“A large part of the camp’s administrative services was destroyed,” said Logothetis, adding that no injuries were reported. The UN refugee agency’s spokesperson in Athens Boris Cheshirkov said the damage is still being evaluated but that many camp residents have likely been left homeless.

“Authorities are still assessing the damages but a few hundred people are likely affected because their shelters have burned down. We have donated tents to the authorities which can quickly be put into use and we will assist in replacing the warehouse tents,” he told AFP.

At least three vehicles outside the camp were also gutted.

A police source in Athens said two Afghans and an Iraqi had been arrested in relation to the unrest, which erupted after a 47-year-old asylum seeker from Iraq died in the camp on Saturday.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/death-sparks-unrest-at-major-migrant-camp-in-greece.html

The country’s economy has been ravaged by the challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis. More than 22 million people have lost their jobs, as the heavy job creating sectors like travel and tourism has come to a standstill.

Over 95 per cent of the country’s 330 million population are under a stay-at-home order.

The deadly virus has killed more than 39,000 people and infected over 740,000 in the US, which has the highest number of COVID-19 casualties in the world.

The Trump Administration has brought in a stimulus package worth USD 2 trillion to boost the economy.

However, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank say that the American economy is in a recession.

Mnuchin exuded confidence that the economy would soon be back on track in a matter of months.

“I think it will be months. I definitely don’t think it will be years,” Mnuchin said on asked if it will be months or years before the economy is back to the strong position it was before the pandemic.

Pence vowed that the coronavirus testing in the US will increase substantially, allowing the country to progress according to the Trump administration’s plan to gradually reopen the economy.

158,20-4-20,North Korea denies that Kim sent Trump ‘a nice note’,"North Korea on Sunday dismissed as “ungrounded” President Donald Trump’s comment that he recently received “a nice note” from the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un.

Trump said during a press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic Saturday that “I received a nice note from him recently. It was a nice note. I think we’re doing fine.” Trump also defended now-stalled nuclear diplomacy with Kim, saying the US would have been at war with North Korea if he had not been elected.

The North’s Foreign Ministry said there was no letter addressed to Trump recently by “the supreme leadership,” a reference to Kim. It said it would examine why the US leadership released “the ungrounded story” to the media.

“The relations between the top leaders of (North Korea) and the US are not an issue to be taken up just for diversion nor it should be misused for meeting selfish purposes,” the statement said.

Kim and Trump have met three times and exchanged letters and envoys on many occasions since 2018, when they began talks on how to address the North Korean nuclear crisis. The two leaders have built some personal relationships, and Trump once said he and Kim “fell in love.” Their nuclear diplomacy has made little headway since the breakdown of their second summit in Vietnam in early 2019, when Trump rebuffed Kim’s calls for sweeping sanctions relief in return for a partial denuclearization step.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/north-korea-denies-that-kim-sent-trump----a-nice-note---.html

“Frankly, I don’t pay that much attention to the president’s tweets against me. As I’ve said, he’s a poor leader. He’s always trying to avoid responsibility and assign blame,” Pelosi told ABC’s This Week during an interview.

She was responding to a question about a series of tweets against her by Trump in the last 48 hours.

In his tweets, Trump levelled a series of allegations against the powerful Congresswoman calling her weak and crazy, away on vacation during the coronavirus crisis. He also accused her of costing Americans jobs by blocking new funds for the Paycheck Protection Program.

The Trump Administration, Pelosi alleged, has failed in the handling the coronavirus crisis.

“If he continues to predicate the action that we take on a false premise, then we’re in further danger and his earlier delay and denial caused deaths. So it’s very important that we walk the line that is close to evidence, data, science, as we go forward and not whimsy, magic hoax allegations and placing blame instead of taking responsibility,” she asserted.

“We’ll go over all of that. Except he was drawing strength in his own view of what his falsehoods were gaining him and we cannot — we cannot fight a pandemic. We cannot open up to our economy based on falsehoods,” Pelosi said.

Appearing on “State of the Union” on Sunday talk show on CNN, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the economy might not open unless there is more testing. “We will not be able to get the economy going full-fledged unless we have testing,” he said. “We have examples: South Korea, I think they had a case, one day, the first case was within a day of each other in the US and South Korea, the first case. But they did just what we’re calling for. They did a massive increase in the number of tests. They did contact tracing. And now South Korea is way over the hump. We must do the same thing for the good of the health of America and the good of the economy,” Schumer said.

160,20-4-20,Live a sound life,"The positive effects of learning music make it an ideal activity to engage in for children during quarantine, says Sachin Sharma

How difficult is it to sit idle? Well, this is something that every individual in the world must have found the answer to during lockdowns amid the Coronavirus scare. And with the new extension order in India, people are looking for ways to engage themselves. Since children are now involved in remote learning, they are also looking forward to exciting and entertaining ways to keep themselves busy. So, why not music?

In today’s digital world, distractions come easy. Help them break free from the tentacles of boredom by encouraging them to learn music. Lift off that cloth from your piano or the old keyboard, ask them to play those guitar strings and hand them those drumsticks, for music will not only keep them engrossed but will have numerous benefits.

Even if your child doesn’t know how to play an instrument, there are numerous apps to assist them online. There are tutorial videos, games, and apps that will take you from holding your instrument for the first time to playing your favorite songs. Chordana Play, a music application supported by android smartphones, is one such app that aids children to take three-step lessons either using the app’s keyboard or a USB-connected musical instrument keyboard. There is also a scoring system that lets one keep track of his/her progress. With such facilities at hand, it becomes easier for you to support your child in learning new music.

Learning music helps youngsters in several ways which a lot of parents might be unaware of. Here are a few reasons that would motivate both parents and children to imbibe the benefits of this beautiful art form:

Unites everyone

It can be a driving force in uniting people. Examples abound — the National Anthem keeps the people of a nation united while having the ability to promote ideals like peace and solidarity. It can motivate the the Army to face the challenges in a battlefield. A lullaby between a parent and child not just builds an emotional connect but also creates the ‘soundtrack’ of life for the child. While dancers groove to the beat of a song, rebels might have an anthem to voice their concerns. Connecting to a musical instrument leads to lasting friendships and memories. It can be a social glue, too, said researchers from Tokyo University of the Arts in a study.

Leads to better learning

Music sensitises our brain in a way that it breathes life in its less-active areas. It helps to improve memory, keeps the mind sharp, alert and engaged. Rhythm and pitch can be expressed as mathematical formulae, and musicians know the techniques through which they produce a certain sound. This not only makes the mind think deeper but also empowers the ability to differentiate between various things and sounds.

Stimulates creative and critical thinking

The creativity involved in learning an art strengthens critical thinking skills in kids. Visual learning through drawing, sculpting, and painting develops visual-spatial skills. This, in turn, teaches them how to interpret and use visual information. Additionally, sound and silence can improve concentration, fostering better analytical skills in children. For instance, some digital pianos have high tone quality and rhythm for the child to soak in the different tune.

Effects of enhanced creativity extend to many aspects of a child’s life. Children develop innovation skills when they’re encouraged to express themselves. Music is a form of self-expression which not only unfolds a child’s creative side but also imbues him/her with the ability to take calculated risks. Owning a creative hobby acts as an emotional modulator that restores a sense of balance in our lives.

Lowers anxiety and stress

The effect of music on human stress is spectacular, as various studies have shown. For centuries, sound therapies have long been popular as a way of relaxing and restoring one’s health. Music is an easy way to take some of the pressure off from all the daily hassles that spike your stress level and leave you feeling drained and anxious. Learning it early will help the child to grow with a sense of accomplishment. Playing music, like daily meditation or hitting the gym, increases focus and attention span.

Cultivates patience and discipline

Fortunately, there is no shortcut to playing a musical instrument. It takes a lot of time, effort, attention and determination to become competent. The process itself teaches patience and discipline with or without the learner realising it.

Research has shown that music offers enormous benefits to our body, mind and overall health. At this stage of life, where everything has come to a standstill, it is time to take baby steps in brightening your child’s future and well-being by inculcating a habit of practicing music in them.

As Plato said, “Music gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination.”

“The process of working from home bears fruit each day and when the day arrives, for one day it will, when the doors shall open, there could be hesitant indulgence on whether to step out or not. Cage an animal for years and years and years, and then suddenly one day just open the doors and see its reaction,” he wrote.

‘Goldie (Behl) has been a delight to work with. My character is quite interesting. Even though I have played the role of a police officer before, this one is glamorous yet strong. I would like everyone to watch Season 1 (RejectX) on ZEE5 and catch up as Season 2 is coming soon. Can't wait to hear people’s responses.’

Actor Angad Bedi is a doting father of a one-year-old daughter, Mehr, and he feels his life has totally changed after her birth.

He says “I have started valuing little things in life... the way I now treat my parents is totally different from the way I used to treat them, because now I know what it feels being a parent. Mehr has changed my perspective towards life. We all keep on chasing higher goals, bigger people in life and then get stuck in rat race. Thankfully, she has taught me how important is it to take two steps back sometimes and spend time with your family.”

162,20-4-20,Over thousand virus cases on French ship,"Figures from France’s military leadership show more than half the sailors aboard the country’s flagship aircraft carrier contracted the new virus as the ship traveled through the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

A navy official says 1,046 of the 1,760 people aboard the Charles de Gaulle tested positive for the virus.

Navy Chief of Staff Adm. Christophe Prazuck attributed the quick spread to the “great population density aboard the ship.” Speaking Saturday evening to Europe-1 radio, Prazuck said virus protection measures weren’t followed properly, which “did not allow us to detect the beginning of the epidemic, and therefore to contain it.” The ship is undergoing a lengthy disinfection process since returning to its home base in Toulon last week.

One person who served aboard is in intensive care and more than 20 others are hospitalised. Among those infected are two U.S. Sailors serving as part of an exchange program.

Investigations are underway into what happened, and French military leaders have been questioned in parliament.

The National Care Forum (NCF) report, released on Saturday, demonstrates 2,500 deaths within care homes within seven days, figures which it says highlights significant flaws in the current national reporting of coronavirus related death toll in the UK.

“It is hoped that this analysis will provide insight and impetus for the government to better address the needs of the care sector,” the NCF said.

The group’s research came as pressure mounts on the British government to start counting deaths within the wider community and care homes to its daily hospital toll figures, which hit 15,464 on this week.

Amid concerns that the national statistics presented by the government for coronavirus related mortality rates were not incorporating figures of deaths within residential and nursing homes, the NCF said it led an independent benchmarking exercise. As many as 47 of its care provider members contributed to the audit, representing 1,169 care services that collectively support 30,217 people across the UK — 7.4 per cent of the overall residential care sector population.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-deaths-in-uk-care-homes-doubled-in-week.html
164,20-4-20,"Fearful but impatient, Italy edges toward end of lockdown","Italians debated Sunday their first cautious steps out of a coronavirus lockdown that has left an estimated half of the working population seeking Government support.

The Mediterranean country has been filled with rumours and speculation about when people will finally be allowed to walk the streets freely for the first time since early March.

The balmy weather is not helping government efforts to keep everyone inside in the face of a disease that has officially killed 23,227 in Italy — second only to the United States.

The number of daily fines for illegal outdoor activity is rising and police are setting up barricades along roads leading to the beaches on the western outskirts of Rome.

The growing sense that weeks of confinement were ending forced an unnamed source in Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s office to tell media that “nothing will change”.

But some officials seem to think that extending the strictest lockdown measures beyond their May 3 deadline might simply not work.

The daily death rate has fallen to half of what it was at the peak of the crisis and people — feeling less frightened but more stir crazy — may simply start going out.

“We must give citizens greater freedom of movement,” Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri said on Saturday.

Conte gave little of the game away in one of his characteristic late-night Facebook posts on Saturday.

He said some activities will be allowed to resume “according to a well-structured programme that balances the need to protect people’s health with the need to resume production”.

The ship, the Costa Deliziosa, was heading on Sunday toward a port in Spain before ending its journey in Italy — both countries devastated by the coronavirus outbreak.

Costa Crociere, an Italian cruise company, said that the Deliziosa, which set sail from Venice in early January with 1,831 passengers, had no cases of COVID-19 aboard.

The Deliziosa, a nearly 300-meter (1,000-foot) vessel, will disembark 168 Spanish passengers on Monday at Barcelona’s port. Then the Deliziosa will head to its final destination, Genoa, Italy, where it is expected to let off the remaining passengers, Italians and those of other nationalities, on Wednesday. A company spokesman said a passenger left the ship earlier in the week in Marsala, Sicily, for health issues and had a Covid-19 test, which was negative.

Being on the liner for weeks during the pandemic “was not surreal, it was incredible,’’ said passenger Carlos Paya’, who lives in Valencia, Spain, and is sailing with his wife. He added that they have family members in Spain. “The news that was arriving from home was causing us all a lot of worry and grief,,” he told The Associated Press by text message Saturday evening.

“For us it was a stroke of good luck to be where we were.” “From Perth (Australia) given the growth of the pandemic, and of course for those of us who have children in Spain, we would have preferred to return,” he added.

“Other passengers, on the other hand, given their old age, wanted to stay on board knowing that the boat was safe and secure.” French authorities had rebuffed a request by Costa for permission to disembark several hundred passengers from France and nearby countries at Marseilles. “The health situation on board the ships doesn’t present any problem for public health and no case of COVID-19,” Costa’s statement said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/world-cruise--begun-before-virus-pandemic--approaching-spain.html

169,20-4-20,Knock them down,"Tech companies step up to fight against false Coronavirus information

Potentially dangerous Coronavirus misinformation has spread from continent to continent like the pandemic itself, forcing the world’s largest tech companies to take unprecedented action to protect public health.

Facebook, Google and others have begun using algorithms, new rules and factual warnings to knock down harmful Coronavirus conspiracy theories, questionable ads and unproven remedies that regularly crop up on their services — and which could jeopardise lives.

Health officials, critics and others who have long implored the tech companies to step up their response to viral falsehoods have welcomed the new effort, saying the platforms are now working faster than ever to scrub their sites of Coronavirus misinformation. “It was definitely, within the companies, a shift,” said Andy Pattison, manager of digital solutions for the World Health Organisation, who for nearly two years has urged companies like Facebook to take more aggressive action against anti-vaccination misinformation. Pattison said he and his team now directly flag misleading Coronavirus information and, at times, lobby for it to be removed from Facebook, Google and Google’s YouTube service.

Last month, Iranian media reported more than 300 people had died and 1,000 were sickened in the country after ingesting methanol, a toxic alcohol rumoured to be a remedy on social media. An Arizona man also died after taking chloroquine phosphate — a product that some mistake for the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, which President Donald Trump and conservative pundits have touted as a treatment for COVID-19. Health officials have warned the drug hasn’t been proven safe or effective as a virus therapy. Days later, Twitter and Facebook began cracking down in unprecedented ways on posts promoting unverified treatments.

Twitter deleted a post by Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani that described hydroxychloroqine, a cousin to chloroquine, as “100 percent effective” against Coronavirus. The company also removed a tweet from Fox News personality Laura Ingraham touting what she called the drug’s “promising results.” Other widely shared claims that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19 live on. A conservative radio host’s tweet claiming that “All hospitals and health care workers are using it with total success” has been shared more than 12,000 times. In what may be a first, Facebook removed a post from Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro, who promoted hydroxychloroquine as “working in every place” to treat coronavirus. Twitter also removed an associated video.

It has long resisted calls to fact check or remove false claims directly made by politicians, arguing the public should be able to see what their elected officials say. In this pandemic, however, the platforms have no choice but to rethink their rules around misinformation, said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at Harvard Kennedy School. “The damage to society is clear cut: it’s death,” Ghosh said. “They don’t want to be held responsible in any way for perpetuating rumors that could lead directly to death.”

YouTube began removing videos that claimed coronavirus was caused by 5G wireless networks last week. Some of the videos had racked up hundreds of thousands of views. Google searches for “5G” and “coronavirus” now redirect users news videos debunking the theory. Facebook-owned private messaging service WhatsApp has limited how many chats users can forward messages to in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Since WhatsApp encrypts all messages, it can’t read them to determine if they contain misinformation.

The pandemic has thrown up new challenges to content moderation. Early on, health considerations forced the contractors that employ human moderators to send most of them home, where for privacy reasons they couldn’t do their jobs. Facebook eventually shifted some of that work to in-house employees and leaned more heavily on artificial-intelligence programmes. More recently, it has made new arrangements for contract moderators to do their jobs remotely.

Meanwhile, bogus ads for masks, hand sanitiser and unregulated blood tests for COVID-19 still appear on Facebook and Google. And one North Carolina man with 44,000 YouTube subscribers who complained that his videos promoting the 5G and Coronavirus theory were removed is now using the platform to hawk $99 subscriptions to view his videos.

The tech platforms point out they are putting facts about the virus from news outlets, fact checkers, and health officials in front of their users when their safeguards fail.

Google “Coronavirus” and you’ll be directed to your local health department. Search on Twitter for “Coronavirus hoax” and you’ll get a link to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Watch a Coronavirus conspiracy theory video on YouTube and you’ll see a label promoting legitimate news outlets and COVID-19 information from the CDC hovering over it. “There’s a lot of misinformation when there is a lack of good information,” said Pattison. “People will fill the void out of fear.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/knock-them-down-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/knock-them-down.html

“I spoke to Roger and Rafa a few days ago,” Djokovic, the world number one, said in an Instagram chat with friend and rival Stan Wawrinka on Saturday.

“We had a long conversation about the near future of tennis, what is going to happen, how we can contribute and how we can help especially lower-ranked players, who are obviously struggling the most.”

“The majority of the players who are ranked between 200, 250 in the world, and the 700th or 1,000th do not have federation support, do not have sponsors. They are completely independent and left alone,” he said

“Guys who are ranked between 200-250, especially to 700...are thinking of leaving tennis right now.”

He said players, the ATP and the four Grand Slams “would all get together and will contribute to a player relief fund that ATP will distribute.”

“It looks, hopefully, that there will something between $3 million (2.75 million euros) and $4.5 million that is going to be distributed,” he estimated.

Djokovic said the cash could come from the prize money for the season-ending World Tour Finals or the final bonus pools for top players.

‘Future of tennis’

“Maybe if we don’t have any tournaments this season, we can take a certain percentage from our prize money form Australian Open in January,” he said.

“These guys are the grass roots of tennis. The future of tennis. We need to show them they still can rely on support of the top guys.”

According to reports in tennis media, Djokovic, as president of the ATP Players' Council, which also includes Federer and Nadal, proposed to members that players in the top 100 for singles and the top 20 in doubles contribute according to their rankings.

The proposed scale runs from $30,000 for a top-five player to $5,000 for those between 51 and 100.

That would raise approximately $1 million and the ATP would make a similar contribution.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tennis-big-three-plan-to-help-lowest-ranked-players.html
171,20-4-20,Ishant’s thirst for knowledge impressed Gillespie,"Former Australian pacer Jason Gillespie was very impressed with Ishant Sharma’s “thirst for knowledge” when he played English county under his coaching, despite being an established international cricketer.

Ishant, who has so far picked 297 wickets from 97 Tests, played for Sussex in 2018 with Gillespie as the coach.

“You know what really struck me about Ishant was his thirst for knowledge, his willingness to listen, ask questions, try new things, because sometimes you can get senior players, experienced players who will just go about and do their thing,” Gillespie said on a chat-show Cow Corner Chronicles.

In fact, during the last first-class season, Ishant acknowledged that every one spoke about his problems but it was Gillespie who provided solutions.

“They know what they need to do and that’s fine. But Ishant was very much...He knew what he needed to do to bowl well. He also knew he wanted to get better,” remarked Gillespie.

India toured England later that season in 2018 and Gillespie felt Ishant was better for the experience.

“Knowing that he had an opportunity at Sussex, knowing that India were going to be playing in England, later on, I think he saw it as a very good opportunity, to learn and bowl in English conditions, and test himself. Look he was fantastic with us at Sussex,” added Gillespie.

Gillespie also said that Ishant made impact on Sussex players.

“The Sussex players were really impressed with Ishant’s work ethic. He fitted in really well in the dressing room. His work ethic in the nets, or on the track was phenomenal. It was really good for our young seam bowlers at Sussex to see, that this is what it takes for a Test bowler,” he added.

Gillespie, who worked with another Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara, whom he coached at other county side Yorkshire, also praised the latter.

“We had Pujara at Yorkshire, when I was head coach there. We needed a batsman in the top three who could do a job for us in sometimes challenging conditions, Someone with a very good temperament, someone who could absorb some very good bowling.

“Pujara fitted that bill perfectly. He found it a challenge, the early season in county cricket with the duke cricket ball moving around in English conditions. He found that a challenge. I think that was really a good test for him as a player. A good learning curve for Cheteshwar,” said Gillespie about Pujara’s first stint with Yorkshire in 2015.

Gillespie feels the county stint helped Pujara, who has amassed 5840 runs from 77 Tests, immensely.

“I think he grew as a player. He learnt more about his game. He adapted to conditions in England which can be quite challenging for top three-top four batsmen at the best of times. So, I thought he did wonderfully well,” Gillespie signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ishant---s-thirst-for-knowledge-impressed-gillespie.html
172,20-4-20,Faf reveals secret of Dhoni’s IPL success,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s intelligent recruitment policy of roping in international captains who can contribute stretagically, was one of the biggest reason for Chennai Super Kings’ stupendous success in IPL, feels former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis.

CSK has been a part of 10 out of 12 seasons of IPL and have never finished lower than semi-finals or play-offs.

“A great thing that CSK has done over the years, and that’s credit to MS and (Stephen) Fleming the coach, is they have targeted captains — (Brendon) McCullum, myself, (Dwayne) Bravo, obviously MS, (Suresh) Raina’s captained a bit — because they want thinking cricketers,” the 35-year-old told CSK’s website.

“So, there’s a lot of leaders within group, that experience of thinking cricketers is what they want and obviously it has proven to be very successful,” he added.

“Chennai Super Kings is a great franchise to be a part of. MS has got such strong leadership. He leaves a massive hole when he’s not on the field,” the former SA skipper waxed eloquent about Dhoni.

Du Plessis, who has been part of CSK, also spoke about his passion for fielding, adding the team had a few very good fielders.

“I love going to positions on the field where the ball goes all the time. We are lucky at CSK that we got a few very good fielders. Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) is incredible, he has got the strongest arm in world cricket. Jaddu wants them to try and run. He jogs to the ball because he knows if you run, you are out,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/faf-reveals-secret-of-dhoni---s-ipl-success-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/faf-reveals-secret-of-dhoni---s-ipl-success.html
173,20-4-20,Bit surprised by CA''s financial health but we will work together to overcome crisis: Hazlewood,"Fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is a ""bit"" surprised that Cricket Australia is struggling financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic but said players will work together with the governing body to overcome the crisis.

With the coronavirus outbreak halting all cricketing action, Cricket Australia (CA) has laid off 80 per cent of its staff for the rest of the financial year which ends on June 30. Reports suggest that CA will run out of cash by August.

""I was a bit surprised there but there has to be some impact, no doubt,"" Hazlewood was quoted as saying by 'Sydney Morning Herald'.

Hazlewood said the financial crisis will hit cricketers too and they are ready for a reduced salary.

""We are no different from any other sport. It just depends how long it hangs around as to how much it is going to affect us, I guess. If it leads into next summer, it will be quite serious,"" Hazlewood said.

""We're obviously partners in the game and we've always said that. We have ridden the highs and now its probably time to ride the lows, a little bit.""

CA and Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) had an ugly pay dispute in 2017 but Hazlewood said relations have improved since and hoped this crisis will be handled better this time.

""I think the relationship is a lot better now, between the ACA and CA. It's developed a long way in the last 18 months to two years, probably,"" he said.

""... so that will go a long way towards having this episode (handled) a lot better than last time. It's all positive from our end and I think, from both ends.

""Hopefully it's a lot better communication this time and I think you will see that in the coming weeks and the coming months. As long as they show a lot of transparency on all the numbers, all the players will be pretty happy with that.""

According to the MOU signed in 2017, CA has to provide ACA with revenue estimates and a national contract list for the upcoming summer by April 30 and Hazlewood expects the deadline to be met so that players can be better prepared for the financial fallout.

""April 30 is what the players want and it's in the MOU but I guess these are strange times. Anything can happen,"" Hazlewood said.

""The ideal (situation) is that they're put out before April 30 and obviously then we will know, financially, what we can get ready for and how much of a percentage is lost and how much of our contracts are affected.

""The sooner we know that, the more we can plan for the next 12 months.""

The global health crisis, which has killed more than 1.6 lakh worldwide, has put this year's T20 World Cup and India's tour of Australia under threat.

174,20-4-20,Japan virus expert 'pessimistic' Olympics can be held in 2021,"A Japanese expert who has criticised the country's response to the coronavirus warned Monday that he is ""pessimistic"" that the postponed Olympics can be held even in 2021.

""To be honest with you I don't think the Olympics is likely to be held next year,"" said Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious diseases at Kobe University.

Japan and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed last month to delay the Tokyo 2020 Games until July 2021, after pressure from athletes and sports federations.

But in recent days, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread worldwide, there have been questions about whether even a year-long delay will be sufficient.

""Holding (the) Olympics needs two conditions, one: controlling COVID-19 in Japan and (two) controlling COVID-19 everywhere, because you have to invite the athletes and the audience from all over the world,"" Iwata told journalists at a press briefing.

""Japan might be able to control this disease by next summer, I wish we could, but I don't think that would happen everywhere on Earth, so in this regard I'm very pessimistic about holding the Olympics Games next summer.""

Iwata said he could only see the Games being held next year if they were significantly altered, ""such as no audience, or very limited participation"".

Iwata hit the headlines earlier this year for his public criticism of Japan's handling of the coronavirus-wracked Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked off the country's coast.

Japanese officials opted to carry out an on-ship quarantine, but more than 700 people on board ended up contracting the virus, and 13 died.

The decision to postpone the Olympics is unprecedented in peacetime, and followed a wave of complaints from athletes facing travel bans and lockdowns.

The postponement is a huge undertaking, but organisers have insisted they are working towards the new opening date despite ongoing uncertainty about when the pandemic will be over.

There is ""no Plan B"", Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told reporters at an online briefing on last week.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/japan-virus-expert--pessimistic--olympics-can-be-held-in-2021-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/japan-virus-expert--pessimistic--olympics-can-be-held-in-2021.html
175,20-4-20,We had to tell Kaif to be cautious: Tendulkar,"Former India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar recalled a hilarious incident which ended up with his former teammate Mohammed Kaif getting a new nickname. The Master Blaster was referring to an incident that took place recently in the first match of Road Safety Series against West Indies XI.

Tendulkar stated that Kaif was giving his all in the field despite being 39 and that prompted others to caution him that it is the first match of the tournament and there is still a long way to go.

""We had to tell Kaif to be cautious. We nicknamed him ‘bhai sahab, bhai sahab, thoda sambhalke.' It's the first match of the tournament and there are a lot of matches to be played,"" Tendulkar said in a video uploaded on 100 MB YouTube channel.

""What if you pull a hamstring or something. It (diving and fielding quickly) comes naturally to him. He thinks if you are fit, you continue doing those things. He was a really fit guy. He was an outstanding fielder in team,"" he added.

Kaif was regarded as one of the finest fielders ever to don the iconic blue jersey. He, along with Yuvraj Singh, marshalled the cover-point area with great aplomb in an era where fielding wasn't Team India's strongest suit.

Despite his incredible fielding skills, Kaif is fondly remembered by almost every Indian cricket fan for his Man of the Match performance in the Natwest Trophy final against England at Lord's in 2002.

178,20-4-20,Key to immunity,"While shooting his film, Yoga for Health & Global Harmony, filmmaker, art historian and photographer Benoy K Behl realised that inner harmony is the answer to the prevailing issues

Almost for a decade I’ve discussed health and yoga with senior mainstream doctors in India, USA and Germany. All of them agree that inner peace is essential for a healthy immune system. It is essentially the balance within us which protects and heals us. Of course, medicines are also required when things go too far. Perhaps, that is why the Chitrasutra (the oldest-known treatise on art-making) says that art is the most valuable treasure of mankind. In this time of COVID-19, Ajanta presents the most beautiful image of inner harmony and the peace of spirit within us. This is Bodhisattava Padmapani, the Bearer of the Lotus (5th century).

In the ancient tradition, such images were created for us to look upon them and to awaken those qualities within us. I’ve recently completed the shooting of the film Yoga for Health & Global Harmony in India, USA, Japan, Germany, China, Bahamas, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia and Argentina. During this time of extreme stress because of the pandemic, these are some excerpts from the commentary and interviews of the film which can be helpful for our general well-being.

It was the dawn of civilisation when yoga was conceived 5,000 years ago in the Indian sub-continent. By the 8th or 9th centuries BCE, a collection of beautiful verses called the Upanishads were composed. These verses crystallised deep philosophical ideas, which would last forever. Yoga was fundamental in the vision of life contained in these.

The three-thousand-year-old Katha Upanishad says, “He… whose senses are uncontrolled, who is not tranquil, whose mind is not at rest, he can never hope to attain the true self, not even through knowledge.” It also says, “The supreme being is formless and cannot be discerned by the senses, hence, all knowledge of the eternal must be acquired by the more subtle faculties. These are developed only through the purifying practice of meditation.”

In an interview in the film, Dr Ananda Balayogi from Puducherry, who is a yoga expert as well as a medical doctor shares, “The biggest question that is asked by the research scientists today is how does it happen? However, ancient rishis, who were the great scientists of that time, asked who am I? Modern science has its eyes outward. It is always looking at someone else, something else or some place else. The yoga dhristi, the yogic perspective has always been inward. Looking at one’s own self, understanding who we are, knowing the answer to the question, kaun hain hum (who are we)? If you want to go in everything has to be still, right from your body, emotions, mind. That is why the yoga rishis adopted still postures to stabilize the mind and went on to finding oneself. In recent times, science and spirituality have been separated. This was not so in that era. Yoga is the challenging study of consciousness itself, understanding one’s body, emotions, mind and beyond that understanding one’s true self. Conquering the fretful disturbances of the world around, great thinkers researched deep into the self. This was an epic project spread over many centuries. A science of life was developed to help us to know ourselves better. To help us attain peace and joy, which can be found within.”

In another interview yoga expert, Minakshi Devi Bhavnani says, “Unless one’s sole purpose of taking up science is to achieve liberation, to evolve one’s consciousness to grow in spirit, I don’t think one should use the word yoga. They can use any other name.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/key-to-immunity-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/key-to-immunity.html
179,20-4-20,A healing touch,"One can use spiritual power and tolerance as tools for social transformation and to uplift the needy, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

We have come across several situations where we have to make a choice between toleration and retaliation. For example, if we come across a person who has no control over his words, is uncultured, impolite, short-tempered and talks in an offensive manner, then what would we do? Well, under such a situation, a cultured and spiritual person would choose to tolerate because he knows well that when tolerance is lost, temper is also lost and this means a disturbance of mental balance.

Hence, under such a situation, one should not feel hurt or injured and think of taking revenge. Instead, one should pity that person and give him/her positive vibrations of peace so that he/she learns control their temper. This approach would enable one to remain calm, composed and dignified. Tolerance, in such provocative situations saves life. And when you add humility, it has great value, even as a matter of policy, strategy or tactic. Therefore, if one loses tolerance in intense situations even for a moment, it might cost lives or other grave consequences and unpredictable repercussions. Tolerance is not only a high-class virtue and moral value but a non-violent strategy for self-defence and survival and a weapon for victory too.

One must always remember that tolerance and humility can soften the hearts of our bitter critics and opponents while ensuring peace of mind for us. It creates harmony and even the most arrogant person, at some point of time, expresses appreciation for tolerance in the face of grave aggravation. Along with this, we should also learn to forget and forgive lapses and shortcomings of others in the spirit of friendliness and brotherhood, or else we cannot have goodwill, co-operation and peace.

However, most people question as to how long should they allow their tormentor to continue with cruel acts, nefarious designs and dirty ways? Should they tolerate injustice? If they do so, wouldn’t it mean a silent consent to their acts? Wouldn’t it deprive them of justice? Also, it would mean their connivance in his/her acts of cruelty? Isn’t it a kind of self-imposed servitude, servility and slavery? The answer is that we must put forth our moral resistance and show our disapproval through non-cooperation. Better still, we must use our skill of persuasion at appropriate time. We must make efforts to show the tormentor the real nature of his act, the evils and the consequences that follow.

We must have the spiritual power to change his/her heart and transform him/her into a better human being. We must try a healing touch to the mentally and morally sick person. One must pity him rather than lose our own moral sense and react with a feeling of rancor and vengeance. That would be our tolerance. But the question that ultimately comes up is whether we have that spiritual power to transform a sinner into a saint? For that we must check up our spirituality and fill ourselves with power through yoga and mediation. With our high spiritual power, we can use tolerance as a tool of social transformation and can be god’s instruments for uplifting a man who has fallen from his seat of morality.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-healing-touch-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-healing-touch.html
180,20-4-20,An equal parent,"This lockdown has reconfirmed the fact that the gender-based, socially constructed roles can be smashed and that too for good, says Rucha Satoor

The entire world has been facing an unprecedented and difficult times due to COVID-19. Majority of the countries have implemented either complete or partial lockdowns. In India, the initial 21-day lockdown has been extended by the government till May 3, keeping the safety of people in mind.

The situation isn’t new for a majority of Indian women, both rural and urban, who are not allowed to work by their families or have left their careers midway after getting married or becoming mothers. However, men, in both rural and urban settings, are for the first time forced to stay at home for such an extended period. This unusual situation where men are at home, has given rise to two kinds of incidences. On one hand, increase in cases of abuse against women and children are being reported and on the contrary, there are other narratives of men sharing the household chores.

Men are breaking many ‘patriarchal traditions’. A few are entering the kitchen and learning how to cook, some are helping in taking care of children and elderly while others are helping in maintaining a clean house. This lockdown has reconfirmed the fact that the gender-based, socially constructed roles can be smashed and that too, for good.

Fathers are not meant to contribute to the development of their children only financially. They must learn co-parenting and participate in the holistic development of children along with their partners.

In March, when the Corona scare had just started rearing its head, parents were trickling in to pick up food packets for the afternoon from the Milin Nagar Anganwadi Centre in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune. Children were at home, safe and sound. Rohini Chittaranjan Joshi, who has been an anganwadi sevika for the last 30 years, was elated to see fathers in the queue. According to her, men have started being actively involved in their child’s development. She has seen this change in the last two years.

“It’s actually funny because some of these men used to come to this same anganwadi centre as children themselves,” Rohini shares. “Now that they’ve grown up into capable men, I don’t need to convince them about the importance of nutrition and childcare as much as I had to, 30 years ago.”

Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a government programme in India, which provides food, preschool education, primary healthcare, immunisation, health check-up and referral services to children under six years of age and their mothers. Even though the programme used to target mothers as parents, in the last two years, active efforts have been made to ensure that male caretakers are involved too. The Poshan Pakhwada’s key message this year was ‘Men for Nutrition — Increasing Male Involvement in Poshan Abhiyaan to Improve Nutrition Indicators’.

Through public meetings, home visits and the Poshan Pakhwada celebrations, anganwadi workers all over Maharashtra have been equipping fathers to interact with their children, break gender barriers and share more responsibilities around the household. “I demonstrate how fathers can banter with their child while bathing them, washing their hands and feeding them. These instructions are especially welcome by migrant families where the family consists of only parents and children. Men have to take up responsibilities,” shares Rohini.

All the anganwadi sevikas I interacted with mentioned that both fathers and grandfathers are keen to know more about the children. But there are still certain barriers that keep them from being fully involved in their child’s formative years. Kiran Shivsharan, another anganwadi worker from Gautam Nagar, Pimpri, shares, “In my community, male involvement in meetings often deterred mothers from joining in. As women ourselves, we did face some hesitation and perhaps shyness in interacting with men. Moreover, as my anganwadi is quite small, unlike other anganwadis in Maharashtra, both parents cannot fit in every meeting.”

It is not just women who are constrained by the gender norms but men are also restrained by them and are mocked upon if they try to become an exception. “Men from my community started getting involved by performing outdoor chores like registering their pregnant wife with us or getting them for vaccination and periodic visit. With regular counselling provided by anganwadi workers, many fathers have started breaking the barriers by undertaking household chores. This has become an inspiration for many more,” says Meera Pandirkar, an anganwadi worker in Mandangad, Ratnagiri.

Anganwadi workers all over Maharashtra have been taking innovative steps to ensure fathers, who often come from working class families, are reached out to creatively and as per their availability. “I always schedule my home visits on Thursdays. With weekly power cuts on the same day, it becomes easier to talk to them,” says Kiran Shivsharan.

As fishermen in coastal Maharashtra return from sea only in the afternoon, Sunaina Sotekar, anganwadi worker for Valmiki Nagar, Mandangad schedules all the Poshan Pakhwada events during that time to ensure that these men get to attend the community programmes. “I ensure that I keep reiterating the progress of their child every time a father comes to pick up. This ensures that fathers feel more invested in their child’s progress,” shares Meera Pandirkar adding that grandfathers are also slightly easier target group to work with.

Meanwhile, Rohini finds technology helpful to engage fathers. “At the end of every Poshan Pakhwada event, whether it is haat bazaars or palak melawas, I send WhatsApp photos to fathers’ numbers.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic, fathers are getting more time with their families. Hopefully, they will learn to put these measures into practice and thus engage in co-parenting during the lockdown and will continue doing so once the world becomes free of this virus.

181,20-4-20,Neuer irritated as Bayern contract talks stall,"Bayern Munich captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer told German media on Sunday he has become “irritated” with negotiations to extend his contract, which have reportedly stalled in recent weeks.

“All talks I have had since I have been here have been confidential... nothing has ever leaked,” the 34-year-old told Germany’s most popular daily Bild.

“But now, details about the current talks are constantly appearing in the media, and are often untrue. That irritates me. It’s not something I am used to at Bayern.”

The veteran goalkeeper’s unusually candid comments come amid widespread reports that his current contract negotiations have hit the rocks.

If the talks fail, club captain Neuer could be free to leave Bayern in June and attract the interest of the Premier League clubs.

Bayern have recently extended the contracts of forward Thomas Mueller and head coach Hansi Flick, both until 2023.

Neuer hailed Flick as a “super coach” and said that the 55-year-old’s extension had convinced him too to stay on at Bayern.

“I want to have a contract which is a win-win situation for me and Bayern. I want to perform, be there for the team... and give 100 percent,” he said.

“The conditions have to be right (for that),” he added.

Neuer, who helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup title, has been named world goalkeeper of the year four times.

He has kept 191 clean sheets in 373 appearances for Bayern since joining from Schalke in 2011.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/neuer-irritated-as-bayern-contract-talks-stall.html
182,20-4-20,Messi a level above Ronaldo: Beckham,"(): Former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham rates Barcelona’s Lionel Messi higher than Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo succeeded Beckham as Manchester United’s No 7 before arriving at Real Madrid two years after the England captain left the Spanish giants.

Beckham has also experience of playing against a young Lionel Messi in the latter’s initial years with Barcelona and faced him once while he was playing for Paris Saint-Germain.

“He [Messi] is alone in his class as a player, it is impossible that there is another like him,” Beckham told Telam. “He, like Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not at his level, are both above the rest.”

Beckham recalled his last match against Barca in 2013 Champions League quarters. PSG were ahead at one stage at Camp Nou when Messi came on as a substitute. Eventually, Pedro scored and Barca went through on away goals rule.

“We were leading before Messi came in, and once he came in, Barca scored,” Beckham said. He was 37 years old by then and ended his illustrious playing career at the end of season but Beckham said that he did not enjoy losing that tie.

“Although I enjoyed playing at that level at my age, I do not like to lose. Our team played well. In both matches, we did things we should be proud of. We didn’t lose against Barcelona, and that is something that should motivate us,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/messi-a-level-above-ronaldo--beckham.html
183,20-4-20,I should have scored more goals: Rooney,"Wayne Rooney may be Manchester United and England’s record goalscorer but he still believes he should have found the back of the net more often during his career, even though he was not a natural finisher.

Rooney, a teenage sensation at Everton, joined United in 2004 and went on to score 253 goals in 559 appearances during a 13-year spell for the Old Trafford club that saw the Red Devils pile up the trophies.

Rooney surpassed 1966 World Cup-winner Bobby Charlton as United’s all-time leading scorer, just as he did for England with a tally of 53 goals.

Despite those figures Rooney, writing in his Sunday Times column, insisted: “I’m going to be honest — and this might surprise you — but I’m not a natural goalscorer.”

The 34-year-old, now a player-coach at second-tier Derby County, added: “I was never a Gary Lineker or a Ruud van Nistelrooy; I never looked at myself that way.

“I hold the goal records for Manchester United and England and am very proud about that — yet there have been better No 9s than me.

“How did I become a record-breaker if I wasn’t a natural scorer? Time,” Rooney explained. “I played for United for 13 years, England for 15 years. I had time to break those records — and looking back I should have scored more.”

Rooney backed Harry Kane to break his England record, although he would like the Tottenham Hotspur striker “to stay high as that No 9” after seeing him drop deeper in during the past two seasons.

“I don’t think it will take long for Harry Kane to claim my England record and it would be a proud moment for me,” Rooney said.

“I’ve never been a selfish player and it would be great for England for Harry to get there. Bobby Charlton had to wait 50 years (for Rooney to break his England record) — I hope it’s not so long for me.

“The United record might last longer simply because players don’t stay at clubs as long as they used to.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-should-have-scored-more-goals--rooney.html

187,20-4-20,No relief for asymptomatic +ve Capital,"Delhi paid price for Markaz event, rues Kejriwal

The Delhi Government is not going to relax the lockdown for at least a week as the Covid-19 spread appears to have gained pace in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday.

Asserting that the decision has been taken to save lives, Kejriwal said even though Delhi accounts for 2 per cent of India’s population, the cases account for 12 per cent of the total cases in the country. Delhi has 77 containment zones, with 2 more added on Sunday, which have been sealed.

Citing instances of asymptomatic people testing positive for the virus, Kejriwal said out of 736 samples collected recently, 186 were found infected by Covid-19 and the people did not know they were carrying the virus.

“When we talked to one of them, he said he was engaged in serving food at a Government-run centre. I have ordered for rapid testing of all those who visited the centre,” the CM said during a video conference.

Kejriwal said Delhi paid the price for the markaz event where thousands of Tablighi Jamaat followers attended an event during the lockdown.

Kejriwal, however, assured the situation is under control and his Government will reassess it after a week to see what relaxations can be given. An order by Chief Secretary Vijay Dev said the administration will review the situation on April 27.

The decision to prolong the restrictions came a day after the Delhi Government added eight new containment zones, increasing their total to 77, and as the number of Covid-19 cases neared 1,900 in the city.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-relief-for-asymptomatic--ve-capital-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-relief-for-asymptomatic--ve-capital.html
188,20-4-20,6 foreign tourists in Rishikesh cave sent to quarantine,"Six foreign tourists who tried to sit out the coronavirus pandemic in a cave in Rishikesh have been sent to quarantine at an ashram in the town after they ran out of money, police said Sunday.

The four men and two women — from France, the United States, Ukraine, Turkey and Nepal — had been living in the cave near Rishikesh in Uttarakhand since March 24, police inspector Rajendra Singh Kathait told AFP.

They have now been moved to Swarg Ashram, Rishikesh where they will be quarantined for 14 days, although none have shown coronavirus symptoms.

“Before the lockdown began, they were living in a hotel in the Muni Ki Reti region but they moved to the cave after they ran out of money,” Kathait said.

“However, they had saved some money to buy food and other supplies.”

The Nepali man had been helping the group buy essential items, Kathait added.

About 700 foreign tourists remain in Rishikesh, according to the Uttarakhand’s tourism department, and the Government has launched the website “Stranded in India” to help travellers from abroad.

The Rishikesh town was made famous by the Fab Four, who came to Rishikesh in 1968 looking for refuge from Beatlemania, for spiritual enlightenment and to immerse themselves in Indian culture.

Numerous governments, including Germany, the US and Britain, have chartered flights to take their nationals home from India.

189,20-4-20,Stringent measures in hotspots from today,"With no sign of abatement in Covid-19 cases which crossed 17,200 marks on Sunday, the Government has decided not to allow non-essential services from Monday in the containment areas in designated ‘hotspots’ districts where rate of doubling of coronavirus cases is less than four days, against the national average of six days.

The move aims to curb the spread of the virus which has taken its toll on 556 lives so far. Luv Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said at a Press briefing here that “From tonight, there will be no relaxation in containment areas in hotspot districts. Stricter measures could be taken.”

He said there will be a strict parameter control in the containment zones, under which no services other than essential services will be allowed.

According to the Health Ministry guidelines, hotspot or red zones are the areas where “there are a large number of Covid-19 cases or where doubling rates of cases is less than four days.”

In these hotspots, the local administration delineates containment and buffer zones to control the disease spread. With 1,324 fresh cases registered in the last 24 hours, the total number of novel coronavirus count in India crossed more than 17,000 to reach 17,200 confirmed cases so far and death toll to 556, according to the Government data.

Alluding to the areas where there will be selective relaxation, the Joint Secretary said, “Areas outside the containment zones, States and districts have to ensure that the measures related to lockdown are followed. Social distancing SOPs and preparatory actions in offices, workplaces, factories or establishments are taken.”

Certain activities which will be prohibited in such areas till May 3 are passenger traffic movement by air, rail and road, education institutions, industrial commercial activities, hospitality services, cinema halls, malls shops, social, political and religious gathering.

“Some activities are, however, relaxed such as agricultural activities so that the rural economy remains functional, employment of daily wage earners and others is monitored and supply chain is maintained,” he said.

“Our effort is to restore normalcy”, Luv Agarwal said, adding if any positive case comes in zones where there are relaxations, they will be made a part of the containment or red zones.

However, offering some hope, the official said the rate of recovery of Covid-19 patients has improved to a little over 14 per cent, officials said, while 43 districts have not reported any new cases in the last 14 days.

“There are no new cases in 54 districts in 23 States and UTs in the country in the last 14 days,” Agarwal said.

This includes 10 new districts, including Bihar’s Gaya and Saran, Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, Punjab’s Fatehgarh and Rupnagar, Haryana’s Bhiwani, Hisar and Fatehabad and Assam’s Kachaar and Lakhimpur. Mahe (Puducherry) and Kodaggu (Karnataka) have not reported fresh cases during the last 28 days.

The Health Ministry also said that there are total of 755 dedicated hospitals and 1,389 dedicated healthcare centres in the country where severe or critical patients can be treated to 2,144.

Agarwal also said that a high-level task force has been constituted to work on cutting edge vaccine and drug testing.

“Its main task is to speed up academia, industry and international efforts. It will be co-chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government and NITI Aayog Member,” he added.

“Under this, the Department of Biotechnology has been made the central coordination committee to develop the vaccine. It will make efforts to identify the pathways for vaccine development.

“We will make efforts to make a dynamic list of national and international efforts of those working on vaccine development and monitor their progress.

“In this task force, clinical cohorts, which will focus on long-term follow-up of people for better understanding of disease and its management, will be worked on,” Agarwal said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/stringent-measures-in-hotspots-from-today.html
190,20-4-20,Sena raps Guv for not naming CM as MLC as deadline nears,"Amid the coronavirus upsurge in Maharashtra, a major political controversy broke out on Sunday, as the ruling Shiv Sena launched a sharp attack against Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for his “failure” to act on the State Cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray as a member of the State Legislative Council by saying “Raj Bhavan should not become centre for political conspiracy”.

In normal course, the Governor has to go by the recommendation of the State Cabinet without any undue delay. Kohsyari’s failure to nominate Uddhav has surprised many in the State political circles and that too at a time when the State is passing through a coronavirus crisis.

The Governor has given no indication that he would go by the recommendation made by the State Cabinet on April 9 to nominate Uddhav as a Member of Legislative Council from one of the two vacant slots.

Uddhav took up the reins as the Chief Minister on November 28, 2019 and needs to become a member of the either House, Assembly or Council, before six months, May 27, as prescribed under Article 164 (4).

If Uddhav fails to get the nomination, he will have to resign from his post. In that scenario, it will be up to the Governor to invite Uddhav to take oath as the Chief Minister once again. Once Uddhav is sworn into the office as the Chief Minister, he will have another six months to get elected to either of the Houses. Subsequently, Uddhav’s other Ministers will have to be once again administered oath of office by the Governor. If anything, he will be at the mercy of the Governor.

More than anything else, the Government re-formation exercise — which will take at least three to four days — will affect the MVA Government’s ongoing efforts to combat coranavirus situation in the State. An angry Shiv Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut lashed out at Koshyari through two tweets — one in Marathi and another in English.

In a tweet that he put out first in Marathi, Raut said, “Raj Bhavans should not become dirty den for politics. I am suddenly reminded of a ‘shameless’ late Andhra Pradesh Governor Ramlal. This clue is enough for those who can understand”.

In another tweet that he put in English, Raut said, “Raj Bhavan, Governor’s House shouldn’t become center for political conspiracy. Remember! History doesn’t spare those who behave unconstitutionally.”

The reference to late T Ramlal should be seen in the context of the fact when, as he as the Governor of then united Andhra Pradesh had appointed N Bhaskar Rao as the Chief Minister when the incumbent Chief Minister NT Rama Rao was away in the United States for a surgery in a much-discussed coup political carried out with the support of the Governor and the then Congress Government at the Centre in August 1984. His reign as the Chief Minister had lasted for mere 31 days.

Uddhav, who was sworn in as the Chief Minister on November 28 last year, is not a member of either of the Houses of the State Legislature. As provided under the Constitution, Uddhav will in the normal course have to get elected to either of the Houses on or before May 28, the six-month deadline for his becoming a member of either of the Houses.

It may be recalled that on April 9, at a meeting presided over by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, the State Cabinet had decided to recommend to Koshyari to nominate Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray as a Member of Legislative Council, from one of the two vacant slots.

In the normal course, the Election Commission was to hold the elections to fill the posts of nine MLCs, who will be retiring on April 24 from Upper House, and Uddhav was to contest these elections. However, the EC has postponed these elections in view of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.

The Shiv Sena-led MVA had recommended to the Governor to nominate Uddhav from the slot vacated by Rahul Narvekar, who quit the Sharad Pawar-led party and got elected from Colaba constituency to the State Assembly in the October 2019 elections. It was one of the vacant Governor-nominee slots, the other being the vacancy caused by the resignation of NCP MLC Ram Wadkule. The Governor had not allowed the NCP earlier to fill up these vacant posts for more than four months.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sena-raps-guv-for-not-naming--cm-as-mlc-as-deadline-nears.html
191,20-4-20,"US COVID-19 tests more than India, 9 others combined: Trump","The United States has carried out more tests for the novel coronavirus pandemic than 10 other countries, including India, taken together, President Donald Trump has said.

Trump asserted on Sunday that the US continued to make steady progress in its war against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the country had tested 4.18-million people. ""That's a record anywhere in the world,"" he said.

""We have done more testing than all of these countries combined -- France, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden and Canada,"" Trump told reporters at a news conference in the White House.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in the US crossed 40,000 and the total infections were more than 764,000 so far.

New York, the epicentre of the deadly COVID-19 in the US, has 2,42,000 cases and over 17,600 fatalities so far. It has registered a 50-percent decline in new cases over an eight-day period.

""That's a fantastic climb,"" Trump said. ""That's a beautiful thing to see after going through the opposite.""

According to Trump, countries like Italy and Spain, which initially were reluctant in closing their country, had to pay a huge price.

""We would've had millions of people die if we didn't do this, he said, referring to the earlier projections of massive deaths if there were no social-distancing measures and the country was not closed.

More than 95 percent of America's 330 population are under stay-at-home order.

Instead, it looks like we'll be at about a 60,000-mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number (1,00,000) thought of,"" he said. ""It's similar to a flu.""

The president listed out the steps being taken by his administration on a war footing to address the challenge posed by the pandemic. ""We are doing a great job,"" he said.

Trump highlighted that the situation continued to improve with the declining trajectory of cases in Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis and Houston Metro areas

""More evidence that our aggressive strategy is working and I thank the American people for their selfless devotion,"" he said. ""The American people have done a hell of a job. We're saving countless lives.""

Trump assured the people that the country was going to be safe.

""We have to be safe. We don't want to close anything. We're not going to be closing, but we're going to be doing it beautifully, systematically,"" the president said.

Trump pointed out that the administration was working very well with most of the governors

""A couple of them, no matter what you do, you'll never satisfy them. You could find the cure tomorrow and they wouldn't be satisfied. They'd find a reason to complain; wise guys,"" he added.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-covid-19-tests-more-than-india--9-others-combined--trump-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/us-covid-19-tests-more-than-india--9-others-combined--trump.html

197,20-4-20,Safe zones ease into relaxation,"Movement of stranded migrant labourers within State allowed, but e-com firms can’t sell non-essential goods

After a week-long “strict enforcement” of the lockdown post-April 14, the Government is set to relax activities in some sectors on Monday though no relaxation would be given in the containment zones and e-commerce companies will not be allowed to sell non-essential commodities.

A day ahead of the reopening of the agriculture, industry and construction sectors in “Green Zones” (non-hotspot zones), the Home Ministry on Sunday paved the way for migrant workers and labourers to return to their place of work in cities, given they do not show any symptoms of coronavirus.

Though migrants will be allowed to return to their places of work in cities, which are non-containment zones, State borders will remain closed for any movement. The Government’s decision comes in the wake of thousands of workers being stranded across the country, along State border lines, since the national lockdown was imposed on March 25.

The Government had first imposed a nationwide lockdown for 21 days till April 14, and then extended it to May 3 in the wake of rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country.

The Home Ministry’s decision to reverse its decision on sale of non-essential items through e-commerce platform is a U-turn on its April 15 circular. “In this regard I would like to clarify that while operations of e-commerce for non-essential goods stand prohibited, they will continue to operate for essential goods as has been allowed earlier and continue to be allowed under clause 13(i) of these guidelines,” said Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla in a letter to all States, changing provisions on Clause 14(v) which allowed transport of vehicles related to e-commerce.

The Clause 14(v) gave permission to all vehicles transporting of e-commerce goods, while Clause 13(i) gave only sale of essential commodities. This loophole in the April 15 MHA guidelines may be misused by e-commerce companies, alleged trade bodies. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) petitioned to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal for banning the sale of non-essential commodities by e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart.

They alleged that e-commerce giants are manipulating the guidelines and got clearance from Maharashtra, Odisha and Rajasthan Governments.

“On behalf of the seven crore traders of India, the Confederation of All India Traders today lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the most pragmatic decision of prohibiting e-commerce companies to deliver non-essentials amid lockdown period.

The CAIT has written a letter thanking the Prime Minister and the Home Minister for valuing the sentiments of Indian traders and protecting their business interests. Notably, since the day of notification, the CAIT was up in arms against the notification and even sought the intervention of Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah besides calling upon Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal,” said CAIT leaders BC Bhartia and Praveen Khandelwal.

When the country reopens in selected zones, exceptions would be made in the areas including healthcare, agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, tea and rubber plantations. The Government has also exempted projects and activities related to co-operative credit societies, non-banking financial institutions, water supply, electricity and communication in rural areas.

Apart from this, the Government has said that bamboo, coconut, betel nut, cocoa, spices cultivation, harvesting, processing, packaging, fruit and vegetable carts, shops selling sanitary items, grocery , ration shops, dairy and milk booths, poultry, shops selling meats, fish and fodder, electricians, IT repairs, plumbers and activities of motor mechanics will also be allowed to open up activities with strict regulations.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while extending April 14 lockdown to May 3 had cautioned that areas which do not show compliance with guidelines would find relaxations withdrawn immediately.

Activities will also be increased on highways from Monday. Rs DhabasRs will also open on the highway for truckers with some restrictions.

Besides, construction work on roads, irrigation, building, renewable energy and all kinds of industrial projects outside the city will also start from April 20.

The Delhi Government has announced that it would not give any relaxation and review situation on April 27.

The Kerala Government will implement the odd and even scheme in the State from April 20 to allow movement of traffic. “Odd and even scheme will be implemented in the State from April 20. By implementing the scheme, we can reduce the number of vehicles on the road by 40 per cent. Three persons can travel in a car, including the driver. Relaxation will be given to women-driven vehicles and Government vehicles,” according to the State police.

The Karnataka Government will have partial relaxation measures across the State, excluding the coronavirus-hit hotspots to restore normal life gradually. The partial relaxation will allow two-wheelers and cars with passes given so far to ply on the roads. Construction activities will also be allowed across the State except in hotspots with the condition that workers will have to stay at the site with all facilities, including food, water and shelter. However, ban order under Section 144 of the CrPC will remain in place till May 3 and wearing of mask will be mandatory.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that limited financial activities will begin in the State from April 20. Addressing the media via video-conference, Thackeray said, “tomorrow onwards we’re starting some financial activities. As we don’t run our economy now, we’ll be in financial crisis after we come out of corona crisis. We’re starting some business activities in a limited way.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/safe-zones-ease-into-relaxation-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/safe-zones-ease-into-relaxation.html

199,20-4-20,India rejects Pak PM's allegations of discrimination against Muslims,"India on Sunday trashed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's comments alleging targeting of Muslims in the country in the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the ""bizarre comments"" by the Pakistani leadership was an attempt to shift focus from the ""abysmal handling"" of that country's internal affairs.

In a tweet, Khan accused the Indian government of deliberately targeting the Muslim community against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis.

""Instead of concentrating on fighting COVID19, they are making baseless allegations against their neighbours,"" the MEA spokesperson said.

He was responding to media queries on Khan's remarks.

""On the subject of minorities, they (Pakistani leadership) would be well advised to address the concerns of their own dwindling minority communities, which have been truly discriminated against,"" Srivastava said.

200,20-4-20,"16 killed in shooting rampage, deadliest in Canadian history","A gunman disguised as a police officer went on a rampage across the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, shooting people in their homes and setting fires, leaving 16 people dead Sunday, in the deadliest such attack in the country's history.

Officials said the suspected shooter was also dead. A police officer was among those killed. Several bodies were found inside and outside one home in the small, rural town of Portapique, about 100 kilometres north of Halifax what police called the first scene.

Bodies were also found at other locations. Authorities believe the shooter may have targeted his first victims but then began attacking randomly.

Overnight, police began advising residents of the town already on lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic to lock their doors and stay in their basements. Several homes in the area were set on fire as well.

Police identified the man believed to be the shooter as Gabriel Wortman, 51, who was thought to live part-time in Portapique. Authorities said he wore a police uniform at one point and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.

Police first announced that they had arrested Wortman at a gas station in Enfield, outside Halifax, but later said he had died. It was not clear how, and they did not explain further.

""This is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province's history,"" said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.

RCMP spokesman Daniel Brien confirmed that 16 people had been killed in addition to the suspect. The dead officer was identified as Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force. Another officer was also injured.

Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada. The country overhauled its gun-control laws after gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. Before this weekend's rampage, that had been the country's worst.

It is now illegal to possess an unregistered handgun or any kind of rapid-fire weapon in Canada. The country also requires training, a personal risk assessment, two references, spousal notification and criminal record checks to purchase a weapon.

""As a country, in moments like these, we come together to support one another. Together we will mourn with the families of the victims, and help them get through this difficult time,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a written news release.

While they believe the attack did not begin as random, police did not say what the initial motive was. RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said many of the victims did not know the shooter.

""That fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,"" Leather said. He added that police believe he acted alone.

Leather said they would investigate whether the attack had anything to do with the coronavirus pandemic but no link has been found thus far. At one point, there was an exchange of gunfire between the suspect and police, he said.

Late Sunday morning, there were half a dozen police vehicles at the scene of the gas station where the suspect died. Yellow police tape surrounded the gas pumps, and a large silver-colored SUV was being investigated.

Cpl. Lisa Croteau, a spokeswoman with the provincial force, said police received a call about ""a person with firearms"" late Saturday night, and the investigation ""evolved into an active shooting investigation.""

Christine Mills, a resident of the area, said it had been a frightening night for the small town, with armed officers patrolling the streets. In the morning, helicopters flew overhead searching for the suspect.

""It's nerve-wracking because you don't know if somebody has lost their mind and is going to beat in your front door,"" she said.

Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the Municipality of Colchester, said the quiet community has been shaken.

""This is just an absolutely wonderful, peaceful quiet community and the idea that this could happen in our community is unbelievable,"" Taggart said by phone from his home in nearby Bass River.

A Gabriel Wortman is listed as a denturist a person who makes dentures in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, according to the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia website.

A suspect photo issued by the RCMP appears to be of the same person seen in video footage being interviewed about dentures by CTV Atlantic in 2014.

Mills also said that Wortman was known locally as someone who divided his time between a residence in Halifax and a residence in Portapique.

Taggart said he didn't know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he telephoned about municipal issues.

Taggart described knowing Wortman's ""lovely big home"" on Portapique Beach Road.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/16-killed-in-shooting-rampage--deadliest-in-canadian-history-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/16-killed-in-shooting-rampage--deadliest-in-canadian-history.html

202,20-4-20,Motormouths fish in troubled waters,"Posts by celebrities in the virtual world during lockdown are landing them in major controversy. If actor Ajaz Khan was arrested on Saturday for a controversial Facebook post, actress Kangana Ranaut’s sister Rangoli Chandel’s twitter account has been suspended.

Wrestler Babita Phogat is in soup over her unsavoury tweet against Muslims with badminton star Jwala Gutta and actor Swara Bhaskar slamming her. In the midst of all this, a man has been arrested in Gujarat for a controversial post.

Khan had reportedly said in a Facebook live session that, “If an ant dies, a Muslim is responsible, if an elephant dies, a Muslim is responsible. If there is an earthquake in Delhi, a Muslim is responsible, i.e. a Muslim is responsible for any incident. But have you ever thought who is responsible for this conspiracy?”

Supporters of Khan are campaigning on twitter for his release.

Besides, several celebrities on social media have demanded a similar action against Phogat and Chandel for their communal remarks.

Earlier wrestler turned politician Phogat sparked a row with her tweets that coronavirus is the second biggest problem in India and that uncivilised Jamaati are India’s number one enemy. She went to the extent of comparing them with “pigs.” But no action has been taken against her.

Badminton player Gutta and boxer and Congress leader Vijender Singh have urged Phogat to take back her controversial views.

Vijender also reacted on the backlash for the wrestler with hashtags like #SuspendBabitaPhogat trending on Twitter. He wrote on the Twitter that there was no religion in the world that gives one the permission to show enmity towards another religion.

Defending her tweets on Tablighi Jamaat, Phogat said she stands by her tweet and she wrote nothing wrong. Phogat also said she is not ‘Zaira Wasim’, and would not get bogged down by any kind of threat.

Gutta said, “Sorry Babita I don’t think this virus sees race or religion…I request you to take back ur statement…we are sportspersons who represented our great nation which is secular and so beautiful…when we win all these people have celebrated us and our wins as their own!!”

Celebrity Bhaskar posted an image that displayed statistics of various religious sites in the country, including Kerala’s Aatukal Pongala, Tirupati temple and ISCKON, Ahmedabad, where people had gathered after lockdown was announced.

As Tablighi features way down on the list, Bhaskar asked Phogat if all the people who gathered at these places were also tested for Covid-19. She also drew Phogat’s attention to the fact the Delhi police had granted permission for the Nizamuddin event.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/motormouths-fish-in-troubled-waters-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/motormouths-fish-in-troubled-waters.html

207,20-4-20,New tool helps predict risk of death in people with dementia,"A new tool that predicts risk of death and admission to a long-term care facility for patients with dementia may help conversations between health care providers, patients and their families, according to researchers.

Dementia is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities.

""Our study shows that the survival of many people with dementia is poor. It may be that many would choose care that focuses on comfort care and quality of life should they become acutely ill,"" said study researcher Dr Peter Tanuseputro from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada.

According to the study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the researchers have developed a tool that asks simple questions about a person at the time of dementia diagnosis and translates it to the chance of dying and of entering a nursing home over the next 5 years.

""This information can be used in conversations about what to expect,"" Tanuseputro said.

""For newly diagnosed dementia patients and their families, personalized information about their trajectory may be helpful to plan for the future, including advance care planning and planning for additional supports,"" Tanuseputro added.

The study used linked data from the International Credential Evaluation Service (ICES) on more than 108 000 people living in the community in Ontario who were newly diagnosed with dementia from 2010 through 2012.

Researchers found that more than half of individuals (55 per cent) died within 5 years -- comparable to many cancers -- and almost half of those who died (28 per cent) lived in institutions. Only one in 4 people were still alive and living in the community 5 years after diagnosis.

Older age, male sex and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure and kidney failure at the time of diagnosis of dementia were the most important factors that predicted death and admission to long-term care.

""If we can help patients and families understand what is likely to happen to their health, and what the next few years may hold, it can help with planning, perhaps provide some peace of mind, and ensure they maximize the quality of life remaining,"" Tanuseputro said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-tool-helps-predict-risk-of-death-in-people-with-dementia-2020-04-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/new-tool-helps-predict-risk-of-death-in-people-with-dementia.html

209,20-4-20,Positive tests at Afghan presidential palace,"At least 20 employees at Afghanistan's presidential palace have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a senior government official who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to comment on the subject.

It wasn't clear whether President Ashraf Ghani had been in contact with any of the employees or whether he had been tested himself. The presidential palace has refused to comment.

Ghani has reportedly been self-isolating, although he still meets daily with some senior officials.

At 70 and a cancer survivor, Ghani is considered in the higher risk category.

Afghanistan has reported only 993 positive cases even as the International Office of Migration, which monitors the movement of refugees, says more than 200,000 Afghans have returned from Iran in the last two months.

Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the region with more than 82,000 confirmed cases and over 5,000 deaths.

Many of the returning refugees scattered throughout Afghanistan without testing, generating widespread fears of an outbreak of cases that could overwhelm the country's war-ravaged health care facilities.

210,20-4-20,US wants to send team of experts inside China for COVID-19 probe: Trump,"The US wants to send a team of experts to China to investigate the coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said, a day after he warned Beijing of ""consequences"" if it was knowingly responsible for the spread of COVID-19 which has killed more than 165,000 people globally, including over 41,000 in America.

Describing the coronavirus as a plague, Trump, during his White House news conference on Sunday, said that he is not happy with China where the pandemic emerged in December last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

We spoke to them (Chinese) a long time ago about going in. We want to go in. We want to see what's going on. And we weren't exactly invited, I can tell you that, the President told reporters.

I was very happy with the (trade) deal (with China), very happy with everything and then we found out about the plague and since we found out about that I'm not happy, he said.

The US has launched an investigation into whether the deadly virus ""escaped"" from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

He has repeatedly expressed disappointment over China's handling of the coronavirus disease, alleged non-transparency and initial non-cooperation from Beijing with Washington on dealing with the crisis.

Based on an investigation, we are going to find out, Trump told reporters.

A day earlier, he warned China that it should face consequences if it was ""knowingly responsible"" for the spread of the novel coronavirus, upping the ante on Beijing over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If they (China) were knowingly responsible then there should be consequences. You're talking about, you know, potentially lives like nobody's seen since 1917, Trump said on Saturday.

The opposition Democratic Party said that Trump has falsely claimed he acted early by restricting travel from China when it was little too late and he continued to downplay the virus throughout February.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in the US crossed 41,000 and the total infections were more than 764,000 so far.

New York, the epicentre of the deadly COVID-19 in the US, has 2,42,000 cases and over 17,600 fatalities so far. It has registered a 50-percent decline in new cases over an eight-day period.

The novel virus, which emerged in China in December last year, has killed over 160,000 and infected more than 2.3 million people worldwide.

211,20-4-20,China reports decline in new coronavirus cases,"China's new confirmed coronavirus cases dropped to 12 with eight of them reported from Chinese nationals coming from abroad, taking the total tally to 82,747, health officials said on Monday.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 82,747 by Sunday, including 4,632 people died of the disease, 1,031 patients still being treated and 77,084 others who had been discharged after recovery.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Monday that 12 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in the country on Sunday, of which eight were imported indicating a drop in the recent cases.

The other four new cases were domestically transmitted, the NHC said in its daily report, noting that three cases were reported in Heilongjiang Province and one in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

No death was reported Sunday on the mainland.

As of Sunday, China has a total of 1,583 imported cases with 841 were being treated with 43 in severe condition, the NHC said.

Also on Sunday, 49 new asymptomatic cases, including five from abroad, were reported in the country, the NHC said, adding that 990 asymptomatic cases, including 184 from abroad, were still under medical observation.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

By Sunday, 1,025 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in the Macao and 420 in Taiwan including six deaths.

Globally, more than 165,000 people have died and over 2.4 million people have been infected by the coronavirus, according to data maintained by Johns Hopkins University.

212,20-4-20,"France nears 20,000 COVID deaths but situation 'improving'","France's prime minister said the country was starting to beat back the coronavirus as the outbreak's death toll approached 20,000 Sunday while new hospitalisations continued a slow decline.

The country reported 395 deaths from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, the government said, bringing the epidemic tally to 19,718.

But in a positive sign, the number of people in hospital declined for the fifth day in a row to 30,610 -- a small decline of 29, top health official Jerome Salomon told a televised press conference.

There were 5,744 people in intensive care, added Salomon, 89 fewer in the 11th consecutive day of decline.

""We are scoring points against the epidemic,"" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told the same briefing, adding the ""situation is improving gradually, slowly, but surely"" and the epidemic is ""slowing"".

But he stressed that a nationwide lockdown which entered into force on March 17 to halt the spread of the virus must be strictly respected until May 11, when it will start being lifted in phases.

""We are not out of the health crisis yet,"" said Philippe, warning that lifting anti-infection barrier measures too soon risked unleashing a second wave of the epidemic.

He said that since relatively few people in France have been exposed to the virus, there has been no widespread build-up of immunity.

A vaccine is unlikely to become available until next year, and there is no known effective treatment, making it essential to maintain measures to stop person-to-person infection.

People will ""probably"" be required to wear masks on public transport as an infection prevention measure from May 11, the premier announced, even as Health Minister Olivier Veran said the jury was out on the efficacy of public mask-wearing as a means of epidemic control.

Philippe said those people who can work from home should continue to do so as far as possible, and that cafes and restaurants will remain shuttered for the time being.

Businesses that will be open, such as supermarkets, will have to ensure measures are in place enabling people to respect the one-metre safety distance from one another, and they may be expected to provide virus-killing hand sanitising gel to all customers.

Schools will reopen bit by bit, but the details have yet to be hashed out.

""To imagine that, because the situation has stopped worsening and is starting to improve, the epidemic is behind us, would be a mistake,"" said Philippe, stressing that people were still dying every day.

""Our life from May 11 will not be like our life before, not immediately, and probably not for a long time."" It would, for example, be ""unreasonable"" for people to think of taking a foreign trip in the near future, Philippe said.

Veran said the government was working on making 500,000 coronavirus tests possible per week for people who show symptoms and those they had been in contact with -- up from the current 150,000 weekly.

People who test positive will be placed in isolation.

France will shortly be producing some 17 million washable, reusable fabric masks for the general public per week, Veran added.

Eight million were produced in France in the past week, and tens of millions more have been ordered from abroad.

Philippe reiterated that the economic crisis that will result from lockdown measures taken to fight the epidemic would be ""brutal"".

France expects its worse recession in 2020 since the end of World War II, with economic activity down 36 percent since the lockdown started.

But economic life cannot resume until the virus has stopped circulating among the population and hospitals' capacity to treat the seriously ill is restored, the prime minister said.

And even when it does, people will have to live differently -- continuing to avoid physical proximity to others.

""Not respecting the barrier measures literally exposes us to a resumption of the epidemic,"" Philippe warned.

The government will unveil a more detailed plan on the lifting of confinement in the next two weeks.

""Fifty-nine people have been arrested (in Padarayanapura) and have been taken into custody. The people attacked the officials who had gone to quarantine some poeple who were the primary and secondary contacts of three COVID-19 patients,"" a police officer said.

A large number of people, mostly youth from the minority community poured on to the road on Sunday and thrashed the health workers who had gone to quarantine some people who were the primary and secondary contacts of the health workers.

The officials were allegedly beaten black and blue.

Some local residents who went to the rescue of these officials were also thrashed.

According to police, one among the arrested is a woman by name Firoza who had allegedly instigated the mob to attack the health and police officials.

Subsequently, a large number of police personnel were deployed in the area to avert any untoward incident and to quarantine those who are suspected to be infected with COVID- 19.

Blowing sirens, a strong contingent of policemen carried out a flag march in the area.

The Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao later called on Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and briefed him about the situation in Padayarayanapura.

The violent incident drew angry reactions from various quarters.

Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said an incident like the one at Padayarayanapura will not be tolerated.

""I met Chief Minister and briefed him about the incident. He has told us to act strictly. I have told the same to my officials. We won't tolerate such acts by anyone. We have arrested 59 people. Five FIRs have been registered,"" the minister told reporters.

Bommai, who visited the area took the senior police officials to task for not being present on the spot when the incident took place.

""Where were you? What were you doing when the incident happened?"" he questioned a senior police officer.

""We will demonstrate to the people what is containment zone, what is seal down and what is police action,"" he said.

Condemning the incident, Health Minister B Srimulu warned those who indulged in such activities.

""The inhuman act of attacking police and health workers in Padarayanapura is highly deplorable. Our government will take appropriate step against those indulging in the attack on health officials and police officials who had gone there to protect them,"" he tweeted.

BJP's firebrand MP Shobha Karandlaje reacted sharply.

""Seculars attack #CoronaWarriors when they were quarantining the secondary contacts of #Covid19 in Padarayanapura of BLR. While #HealthcareHeroes are working overnight to contain #CoronaPandemic, these morons are assaulting our heroes! Let's not be soft on these anti- nationals!"" Karandlaje tweeted.

Meanwhile, the minority leaders called on Congress state president D K Shivakumar to persuade the people of the minority community to assist in identifying the COVID-19 patients or carriers.

Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy too condemned the attack and demanded stringent action against the culprits.

The Congress MLA from the area B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan while condemning the incident, sought to know why the health workers and police officials went to the area late in the night and not in the morning.

""Why did the police and the health workers go in the night when I had told the BBMP Commissioner that I will take them at 10 am?"" Khan told reporters.

Defending those who attacked the government officials, Khan said they were uneducated labourers who didn't know what they were doing.

Padarayanapura and Bapuji Nagar were among the first areas to be completely sealed as people were not abiding by the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC.

According to Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, as many as 25 per cent of people infected with the new coronavirus remain asymptomatic.

In a recent interview with NPR, Redfield said: ""That's important, because now you have individuals that may not have any symptoms that can contribute to transmission"".

According to Dr Neha Gupta, Consultant, Infectious Disease, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, 25-50 per cent patients do not have any symptoms as per CDC and Iceland data, and are contagious.

""That's why lockdown is even more essential to prevent transmission from these likely to be missed out asymptomatic cases when the population is large and testing capacity is limited,' Dr Gupta told IANS.

""Lockdown restrictions can be eased out in areas where no COVID 19 is documented in the last 14 days as most cases take this to recover. But the incubation period can be as long as 27 days and 2.5 per cent of the COVID-19 can develop infections beyond the 14-day incubation period,"" she informed.

""For the first time, the close proximity, low value structures that we have built are the cause of new problems. The last few months have taught us that we're suffering from close proximity. We have the image we want to project of ourselves and there's a part we want to hide. We have social responsibilities as architects and builders.""

He further said: ""We are creating a community which we're ashamed of. We should be really driven by the desire of creating, it creates a world culture.

""I think the happenings of the last few months have should have been a wake-up call for us. We have been humbled to realise that a disease could run across the globe, totally changing the dimension of how we are and what we do.""

""I think we have to consider this issue as being our problem, and not their problem. We need to concern ourselves with the quality of lives everywhere. We need to ask ourselves, ‘are we ashamed of what we see or proud of what we see'. We need to consider urban communities as one,"" he said.
