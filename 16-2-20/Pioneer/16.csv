0,16-2-20,Gandhi lives on,"The idea of putting Gandhi on the Budget cover page by Kerala Government may have many connotations, but one thing can certainly be said. More than seven decades after his death, Gandhi refuses to die. Some may find fault with Gandhi’s ways, some may make uncharitable remarks against him and some may move the Supreme Court to direct the government to confer Bharat Ratna on Gandhi. Either way, Gandhi lives on. Evaluating Gandhi is a tall order. It is better to try and understand him. The beauty of Gandhi’s personality is that even his sworn detractors realise that you cannot negate Gandhi. As a course instructor teaching Business Ethics to management students for over two decades, I have found Gandhi fitting in the curriculum even without a mention of the name. The same is true for the Ethics course for the Indian Administrative Services. There cannot be a course on Ethics without Gandhi. There was a time when Gandhian thought was a part of the curriculum for the civil services. Even if it is not so today, Gandhi’s ideas remain the essence of the course. The things Gandhi stood for are difficult to capture in a piece or even a volume and naturally people find it difficult to understand him. The Ahimsa centre at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, US has been actively pursuing Gandhian ideals ever since it was established in 2004. It is rather strange that Gandhi is less researched in his own country. One opinion that is often expressed to describe Gandhi’s views are that they are too idealistic to be practiced. Nothing can be further from truth. Gandhi was a practical idealist. Those trying to dismiss him as impractical are simply trying to negate the truth. Even if Gandhi’s ideas were too ideal, the point is that there is little sense in setting a wrong benchmark in the name of practicality. Lest we forget, at the turn of the millennium two decades ago editors of several globally reputed periodicals asked historians to rank the greatest leader of the twentieth century. Gandhi’s name figured at the top. In Gandhi they found the right leadership qualities. Isn’t it fallacious that you know what is right and advocate what is wrong? The debate on Gandhi often veers around wrong points. Gandhi was a votary of values based leadership, and a practitioner, too. Practicality and morality can harmoniously go together. Machiavellianism and Gandhism are two different approaches and both are possible. Only one has to believe. Realism may not necessarily be non-idealism. Gandhi epitomised the most desirable managerial quality that is widely talked about these days in management jargon as ethical leadership. It is not about idealism versus realism but idealism as realism and it can provide answer to most of the problems the world faces today. The problems of the world in the present times are problems of faulty leadership styles than anything else. Ego driven rather than ethics driven. Gandhi accomplished what he could by sheer dint of his moral courage. That is what we need today. Gandhi is recognised as a global icon and will remain so whether people like it or not.

1,16-2-20,Delhi lessons for BJP: Controlled aggression,"The resounding win of the Aam Aadmi Party in the elections to the Delhi Assembly has, quite predictably, attracted a great deal of comment. However, before exploring the significance of the verdict, it is necessary to be clear about what the election outcome does not signify.

First, it does not imply that the clear mandate for Narendra Modi in the 2019 general election has been dissipated. Increasingly, Indians are voting in different ways in national and State elections. This was clear in the recent Assembly elections in Haryana and Jharkhand. The pattern has been repeated in Delhi. Yet, the authoritative India Today Mood of the Nation Poll conducted in January this year clearly suggested that in the event of a snap general election, the BJP and its allies are likely to secure a renewed mandate, with only a small loss of Lok Sabha seats.

Second, despite the disproportionate attention on the protests by Muslim women in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, there is no evidence to suggest that the Delhi vote suggested public opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. On the contrary, the indications are that the aggressive pro-CAA campaign mounted by Home Minister Amit Shah in the final 10 days of the Delhi campaign led to the popular vote for the BJP going up by at least 10 per cent. Despite its failure to win more than eight of the 70 seats, the popular votes for the BJP in the Delhi election was the highest since the Delhi Assembly was constituted in 1993. Amit Shah’s campaign energised a moribund party which, pre-campaign opinion polls had suggested was stuck at 30 per cent of the vote share, and boosted the NDA’s vote share to around 40 per cent.It has been suggested that the aggressive campaign in favour of the CAA will not strike any chord in West Bengal where Assembly elections are due in May 2021 are completely missing the point. In West Bengal, the CAA is less a national issue as it is a local issue. The beneficiaries of the CAA are concentrated in eastern India, particularly West Bengal, Assam and Bihar. In all these States, Assembly elections are due in the next year.

In Delhi, there was, however, a clear distinction between national and local issues. The BJP’s clear failure lay in its inability to evolve a counter-narrative to the AAP Government’s welfare schemes. In the past five years, the AAP Government had subsidised electricity charges, provided free water and improved the quality of schools run by the local Government. These were among its achievements and can be compared to the Ujjwala scheme and the Kisan Samman programme that added to Modi’s appeal in the 2019 general election. Against the welfare schemes of the Kejriwal Government, the Delhi BJP had little by way of either a critique or future promises.

The message is clear: any ideological thrust has to be complemented by close attention to local issues centred on governance. The BJP should do well to recall that while ideological and emotive issues played a big role in the final phase of the Gujarat Assembly elections of 2002, 2007 and 2012 that Narendra Modi won so handsomely, they were always complemented by a solid record of achievements in the sphere of governance. This blend of local and ideological issues has been the hallmark of Modi’s electioneering.

An associated feature of the Modi model was the emphasis on local party organisation. The BJP has worked best when its election campaign has been built on the back of a solid party organisation that is visible all year, and not merely when elections are imminent. In Delhi, the party was too affected by local in-fighting and complacency after the big win in 2017.

The issue of the absence of a chief ministerial candidate to oppose Kejriwal has been mentioned. In the past, the BJP always fought the Delhi Assembly elections with a clear projected Chief Minister. There is no clear-cut evidence to suggest that a projected face would have made a decisive difference. The evidence is mixed but normally it helps if the alternative is able to have a distinctive appeal. In the forthcoming Assembly elections, the BJP and its allies have clear leadership candidates in all States except West Bengal. This is an issue the Central leadership will have to seriously consider.

Finally, there is the question of the tone of the campaign. While all election campaigns have their excesses, the BJP in Delhi was affected by the aggressive pronouncements of two MPs. These attracted the censure of the Election Commission. Subsequently, after the outcome, Amit Shah expressed his disapproval of these remarks, but the damage had been done. More than anything else, such comments appear to have affected the voting preferences of women voters. The exit polls indicated that 60 per cent of women voted for AAP and only 35 per cent for the BJP; the male voters were, however, split 49 per cent for AAP and 43 per cent for the BJP. The lesson is clear: while aggression is in order, crossing the bounds of decency is not. This is a lesson that has a relevance beyond Delhi. Every election outcome throws up important lessons. Political parties that imbibe these lessons are normally the ones that benefit in the future.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/delhi-lessons-for-bjp--controlled-aggression.html
2,16-2-20,‘Odisha has turned a major hub of stolen idols’,"The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) held its annual State conveners’ conference on Friday. The conveners from different chapters expressed their grave concern on the rising cases of temple thefts in all over the State.

Digamber Mohanty of Bhadrak said the INTACH has brought to light many instances of idol theft and registered FIRs at police stations but to no avail. There have been 20 cases of theft in the last decade in Bhadrak district but not one single recovery made.

State convener Amiya Bhusan Tripathy, a former DGP, lamented that there is an absolute lack of awareness and the authorities’ gross apathy regarding the intrinsic value of these idols which represent the rich cultural heritage of the State. The prevailing laws intended to prevent idol thefts and burglary are inherently ineffective. A holistic national heritage protection policy and system should be put in place. There is no true objective database for all the antiques, both stone and metallic idols, in about 22,000 ancient places of worship in Odisha. It is true that more than 95% of the antique idols in these temples remain legally unregistered as the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities remains incomplete.

Tripathy said that weak legislations like the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act and the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act, 1904 are ineffective to curb these crimes. New legislation and amendments are the pressing needs of the hour. The State police should have a separate wing for dealing with such crimes.

Anil Dhir, who had recently made the report on the Antiquities of the Prachi Valley, said more than 300 valuable idols were found missing in the different places. He said idols which had been photographed and documented by scholars in the last three decades have vanished.

Dhir reported that nearly 48 FIRs had been filed in different police stations of the Prachi valley area in the last decade, but only one recovery has been made.

In the Buddhist sites of Ratnagiri and Lalitagiri, many votive stupas have been stolen.

Dhir said proper methods should be adopted as per international norms to discourage this rampant illegal trade. Metal idols should have laser markings as the base as evidence of ownership. In the event of theft, this will be evidence. The stone idols should have metallic engraving at base having the name of the temple and the place. The State Archaeology Department should develop a database by photographing and documenting the physical dimensions of the idols including their specific identifying features.

Last year, two Asthadhatu images dating back to the 11th Century were recovered by the Crime Branch from the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. The decoy used by the police was asked to pay Rs 2.5 crore for them.

Bhubaneswar convener Baikuntha Panigrahi said the INTACH has undertaken listing and documentation of monuments in all its chapters and published nearly two dozen reports.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---odisha-has-turned-a-major-hub-of-stolen-idols---.html

9,16-2-20,"27,916 Anganwadi Centres have no own buildings","As many as 27,916 Anganwadi Centres in the State do not have own buildings, informed Women and Child Development Minister Tukuni Sahu in the Assembly Saturday.

10,16-2-20,"Punjabi singers face scrutiny for glamourizing guns, liquor","Punjabi singers, it seems, just cannot keep themselves at an arm’s length from weapons and booze. They have been striking the chord with their targeted audience by eulogizing “guns” and “daaru” in their songs.

Their songs on arms and the man have, however, triggered a reaction by the social activists, cops, and the ‘saviors of culture’ who have been gunning for them, literally. They argue that such songs are ruining today’s younger generation.

The fact that the singers, especially Punjabi, have been shooting themselves on the foot is evident from the number of cases registered against the crooners during the past few years.

The latest in the list are Amrit Maan, Afsana Khan, Shubhdeep Singh alias Sidhu Moosewala and Mankirt Aulakh who have come under scanner for singing “objectionable” songs.

While a complaint was filed in Bathinda against singer Amrit Maan for glorifying guns through his 2018 song ‘Main te meri rafal rakaane combination choti da (my rifle and I are the best combination), singer Afsana Khan was also accused of singing “obscene” songs at a government school of which she is an alumnus.

Days before that, Moosewala and Aulakh were booked by Mansa police for allegedly promoting violence through a song uploaded on social media, “Pakhiyan, pakhiyan, pakhiyan …gun vich panj goliyaan, ni tere panj veeran layi rakhiyan (I have five bullets in my gun for your five brothers…)”.

If that was not enough, sample this: ‘Chandigarh mildi aa daaru sasti’ by Sukhi; ‘On the spot gun shot rule ae’ by Karan Aujla; ‘Daaru badnam karti…eh taan naina terian de kaare…Ho thekian de raah bhul gye…Jadon tak le sharaabi nain tere’ by Kamal Kahlon and Param Singh; Aye haye daaru daaru…Jad daru mainu chad jandi ae, Akh meri khad jandi ae’ by Deep Jandu, Divine, Gangis Khan; ‘Pa Hor Peg, Power Peg Ho’ by Sukh-E and Pardhaan. Songs like these are surprisingly gaining viewership and getting popular among the youngsters.

The gravity of the issue can be gauged from the fact that the Akal Takht — the Sikhs’ highest temporal seat — has also maintained that it can pass an edict (hukumnama) to check the menace if the Sikh intellectuals felt there was a requirement for the same.

What is more, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in 2019, had also took serious note of the menace and directed the Director Generals of Police (DGPs) of Punjab and Haryana, and the Union Territory of Chandigarh to ensure that no songs are played glorifying liquor, drugs and violence, even in live shows.

NO MECHANISM TO CHECK THE TREND

In the absence of any proper mechanism by the powers that be, the menace continues to be alive. Unchecked, the Punjabi singers are singing in praise of vulgarity, liquor, and violence making a bad influence on the young generations.

Even as the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has declared that no movies or songs promoting crime, violence, drugs and gangsterism or crime in the State will be allowed by the Government, it was not clear what exactly the Government intend to do.

“We have been initiating action as and when required…The district police is registering cases against such singers who are indulging in singing such songs as was done in recent cases…Besides, the State Government is also coming out with a policy to check this trend,” a senior Government official, requesting anonymity, told The Pioneer.

PROPOSAL FOR CENSOR BOARD IN LIMBO

Mooted in 2012 by the then SAD-BJP government, the proposal to set up state’s own ‘Censor Board’ — to screen the content shown in videos and lyrics so that the censored content reaches the public — is yet to see the light of the day.

Eight years back when the then Cultural Affairs Minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur proposed to set up the Board, the State received a dressing down by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) dubbing it as a “separatist move”.

However, the same demand once again gained momentum the previous year in the wake of continued trend with the “objectionable” lyrics and picturisation of the songs.

Punjab State Commission for Women chairperson Manisha Gulati, in 2019, raised the demand with the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh insisting that a Censor Board must be constituted for the songs on line with the censor board for films.

“We have demanded from the Punjab Government to set up a committee which would scrutinize the contents…We have also urged the Centre regarding this. But, we have received no inputs on this so far. During my meeting with Chief Minister on this issue, he assured me that the Government would do something and I think that something on this aspect is coming…they are forming some committee,” said Gulati.

The demand by the state women panel’s head came after she ensured registration of a case against Punjabi rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh for using “lewd lyrics” against women in his song ‘Makhna’ along with the producer Bhushan Kumar.

Gulati insisted that there should be some restrictions on lyrics and content of the songs. “Besides, there should be some control by the government also,” she added.

At the same time, Gulati rued over the apathetic attitude of the “senior” and “good” singers, like Gurdas Mann and others, for not coming forward to guide “today’s singers”.

“We appealed to Gurdas Mann and had high expectations that he would come forward to tackle this issue but unfortunately we received no response from him, though he supports this cause indirectly. Singers like them, who are role models for the younger generation, should step forward in dealing with this,” said Gulati, who maintained that the State Government is working on “something” on this aspect.

INDIVIDUALS’ CAMPAIGNS

Alarmed over the growing trend of songs glorifying guns and liquor, several individuals and social activists have taken upon themselves to clean this mess.

Being a sociology student and teacher, an Assistant Professor (Sociology) at Government College, Sector-46, Chandigarh, Pandit Rao Dharennvar maintained that songs “do affect one’s mind”.

“I can very well prove scientifically and sociologically that songs do affect one’s mind. In fact, if bhajans, and gurbani can have an impact on one’s mind, why not these songs,” said Dharennvar, who has moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court against Punjab top cop Dinkar Gupta alleging contempt of court.

Citing the High Court’s directives, issued on July 15, 2019, Dharennvar said that said that even the High Court had observed that the “songs affected the children of impressionable age”.

“The High Court had, in July last year, issued directions to the DGPs to check the menace. But, seeing the trend still continuing, I have now filed a contempt petition on January 28, 2020, on which the High Court has directed the Principal Secretary (Home) to file the action taken report and how they are going to handle this before the next date of hearing, that is April 24, 2020,” he added.

Dharennvar also maintained that to bring the movies and also the web series under the scrutiny, he has been campaigning to seek amendments in Cinematograph Act, 1952.

Crusading against “anti-social” songs, the Kannadiga man’s modus operandi is simple—apologize or face legal action. “I first seek an apology from the singer or lyricists, etc. in case, they do not apologize or admit their guilt, I file a formal complaint and if needed be, a legal case too,” he added.

Working on the same lines is an NGO ‘Mission 6213’. Started to working against noise pollution, the Mission is also making efforts for the implementation of the High Court orders wherein it had directed the state DGP to ensure that any music promoting violence, drugs and liquor was not allowed to be played, not even in live shows.

Going a step ahead, Ludhiana Police Commissioner Rakesh Agrawal has, on February 1, imposed a ban, for two months, on playing songs that glorify liquor, drugs, violence and gun culture. As per the ban, such songs cannot be played even during live music concerts, DJs played during weddings and other programmes, besides the music played in public transport.

According to the ban, FIR will be registered against a person if he or she shares such songs on YouTube or other social networking sites under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

To ensure its implementation, police patrolling teams will keep a close tab.

WHAT THE HIGH COURT SAYS

The High Court, in July last year, had directed the Directors-General of Police in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to prevent playing of songs glorifying liquor, wine, drugs and violence even in live shows.

The Division Bench had observed that the glorification of violence, wine, drugs and vulgar songs have given rise to culture of gangsters in both the states and Chandigarh. The songs affected the children of impressionable age, it added.

The Bench had made it clear that the Court could take judicial notice of the fact that glorification of liquor, wine, drugs and violence in the songs in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory, Chandigarh, had increased in recent times.

GOVT TO BRING LAW TO CHECK MENACE

Punjab Government is in the process of formulating a law to curb the “menace” of Punjabi singers promoting drugs, liquor, or glorifying weapons in their songs and films.

“We are working on it but the main problem is how to control the contents on the social media which is just a tap away…It is quite difficult to censor the content at a time when everything is on everyone’s fingertips,” a senior government official said.

Over the period, the leaders, and the respective Ministers had only created noise, instead of actually acting upon it.

During the present regime, the state’s former Cultural Affairs Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had announced to set up a Punjab Sabhyachaar (Culture) Commission to check “obscenity and vulgarity” besides the “glorification of drugs and violence” in Punjabi songs.

He had also maintained that the Commission would also have powers to monitor content served through the social media, but the same is in a state of uncertainty.

TREND NOT NEW IN PUNJAB

This trend of songs, with objectionable lyrics, is not new in Punjab. In fact, it traces its history back to the 1980s when Amar Chamkila, known as the ‘Elvis of Punjab’, started singing songs using double entendres.

Chamkila, along with his wife and stage partner Amarjot Kaur, used to sing double meaning songs about alcoholism, drug abuse, hyper-masculinity, extra-marital affairs which were considered obscene and vulgar by a section of society, but his popularity amidst his fans and supporters was undisputed. But, the legendary singer duo was brutally assassinated, along with their two troupe members, in 1988.

Decades later, the trend continues, but with nastiest lyrics. Several singers have faced public’s ire including popular singers like Diljit Dosanjh, Gippy Grewal, Miss Pooja among others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjabi-singers-face-scrutiny-for-glamourizing-guns--liquor.html

22,16-2-20,UP to develop all 75 dists as export hubs,"Buoyed by the success of the DefExpo 2020 held recently in the state capital and the investments that came after the UP Investors’ Summit in February 2018, the Uttar Pradesh government has stepped up efforts for achieving the goal of becoming a trillion dollar economy by 2024.

The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to develop all the 75 districts of the state as potential export hubs in the near future. Putting the proposal in top gear, the state government has constituted 10-member district level export promotion committees headed by the respective district magistrate or chief development officer.

“The committees will be entrusted with the task of preparing their district export plan (DEP),” Principal Secretary (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Export Promotion) Navneet Sehgal said here.

Sehgal, who was recently nominated as the state trade facilitation commissioner, said the decision to develop all the 75 districts as potential export hubs was taken in the light of an advisory given by the Central government in this regard.

The district-level committees would include the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) nominee and district industries and entrepreneurship promotion centre deputy commissioner as co-chairman and convenor, respectively.

Besides, the panel would comprise members of the lead bank apart from representatives of the various state and Central government departments and agencies.

To implement the ambitious vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convert each district in India into an export hub, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget 2020-21 speech said that each district should be developed as an export hub and the efforts of the Central and the respective state governments were being synergised and institutional mechanisms created.

The Union Commerce and Industry Ministry through DGFT has already been engaging with states to initiate preparation and implementation of a DEP specific to each district through an institutional structure at the district level.

Besides, the DGFT is developing a portal to enable states to upload all information related to the products with export potential of every district. The preliminary exercise will include an assessment of a district to identify the current export profile and potential.

The key officers related to agriculture, horticulture, livestock, fisheries, handicrafts, handlooms and industry in the district, apart from the lead banker, will work towards the participation of export promotion councils, quality and technical standards bodies. Central government departments like MSME, heavy industry, revenue and textiles will be part of such meetings.

The products identified for exports from the 75 districts include leather, sand and stone articles, spices, garments, wool, food products, ceramics, cement, silk, carpet, glass items, metal crafts, sports goods, pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, auto parts, poultry products, vegetables, cut flowers, forest produce, bamboo products and scientific instruments.

Meanwhile, the state government is preparing an export policy to give an impetus to the MSME sector, which accounted for 80 per cent of the total exports of about Rs 1.14 lakh crore in 2018-19. The state had engaged the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) to prepare the policy draft.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-to-develop-all-75--dists-as-export-hubs.html

Four of these officers were shifted out from districts so that they could not influence the probe. Now, once the probe report is made public, these officers are likely to again get prime postings.

The SIT was instructed to complete the investigation within 15 days.

The sources further said that Vaibhav Krishna would continue to remain suspended as enquiry against him is still pending.

He was suspended after the objectionable video that went viral against Krishna when he was SSP of Noida and it turned out to be authentic. The forensic lab in Gujarat submitted its reports on the viral video of his chat with a woman, authenticating it.

Krishna was suspended for the violation of Officer Conduct Rules. A departmental inquiry was also ordered against him. ADG Lucknow Zone SN Sabat is investigating the matter and he will submit the report as soon as possible.

Krishna had earlier said that the chat and videos were fake and had lodge a report against unknown persons for making the video viral.

In his FIR, Krishna alleged that the video were fake and were made by some IPS officers and journalists to malign his image as he had initiated action against them for their corrupt practices.

He had also named five IPS officers in a report submitted to the chief minister on November 26 last year seeking appropriate action.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/5-ips-officers-facing-probe--likely-to-get-clean-chit.html

26,16-2-20,Akal Takht supports protesting Muslims,"The highest temporal seat of the Sikh religion, the Akal Takht, has extended support to protesting Muslim groups against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Akal Takht head Giani Harpreet Singh met a delegation led by Delhi Minority Commission chief Zafarul Islam Khan in Amritsar and assured his support to them, a senior functionary told IANS on Saturday.

There is a sentiment of fear and insecurity among the minorities and the Sikhs are bound to stand by the oppressed, Giani Harpreet Singh was quoted as saying to the visiting Muslim delegation.

They thanked the Sikhs for standing with the Muslims and others on the CAA and the NRC.

The Takht chief reportedly said he received a similar request for support from other Muslim groups also. Adopting a tough posture, Shriomani Akali Dal (SAD) supremo and five-time Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal two days ago said those in power at the Centre and states should ensure that the country was run strictly in accordance with secular democratic ethos as enshrined in the Constitution.

Addressing a protest rally near Amritsar, Badal expressed grave concern over the social and political climate in the country.

""Any deviation from the sacred principles of secularism can only weaken our country. Those in power must work unitedly and tirelessly to safeguard, preserve and protect India as a secular democracy,"" he said.

""It was the legacy we inherited from the great Gurus, saints and seers, and we must preserve it for the coming generations,"" he said.

Striking an emotional chord, Badal said the governments and the political parties must work to bring Hindus and Muslims as well as others in an embrace of love and understanding.

In January, Punjab after Kerala became the second state to pass a resolution against the CAA.

The Congress-ruled government moved the resolution in the Assembly that got the support of the main opposition AAP.

However, the SAD, an alliance partner of the BJP in the state, opposed the resolution in the Assembly but protested against the non-inclusion of Muslims under the CAA.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had said the issue of CAA had shaken the entire country.

Describing the controversial legislation as ""inherently discriminatory"" and a negation of the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based, the Assembly adopted by voice vote a hard-hitting resolution seeking immediate repeal of the unconstitutional CAA, which the Chief Minister compared to the ethnic and religious cleansing in Hitler's Germany.

Clearly, no lessons had been learnt from history, said a visibly anguished Chief Minister during the discussion on the resolution, which also urged the Central government to put on hold the work on the National Population Register (NPR), till forms or documents associated with it are amended suitably, in order to allay apprehensions that it is a prelude to the NRC.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akal-takht-supports-protesting-muslims.html

There are about three lakh employees working in Government services, corporations and authorities in the state. The employees have as many as 120 associations and seven federations.

The decision of SC that the reservation in promotion is not a fundamental right and State Governments are not bound to provide reservation in the promotions has resulted in unprecedented polarisation of the employees on caste lines.

35,16-2-20,Plan afoot to stabilise sinking Ridge in Shimla,"The Public Works Department of Himachal Pradesh has chalked out a plan to stabilise sinking portions of the historic Ridge in Shimla in two phases.

The Ridge has been sinking for several months on three sides--outside Gaiety Theatre, near Lakkar Bazar and DAV School.

Shimla PWD Superintending Engineer (SE) Suresh Kapoor said the sinking portions of the Ridge will be stabilised under the Shimla Smart City project.

In phase I, the sinking portion outside Gaiety Theatre will be stabilised by constructing an RCC (reinforced cement concrete) structure at an estimated cost of Rs 8 crore, Kapoor said.

""We are waiting for a technical report from the IIT-Roorkee to know whether the construction of an RCC structure outside Gaiety Theatre is feasible or not,"" he added.

The estimated cost of constructing RCC structures under phase II will be known only after preparing designs and drawings for it, he added.

Earlier in 1980s, a similar problem was faced in the area where Padam Dev Complex is situated now.

An RCC structure was constructed in 1988-89 during the tenure of first Shimla Mayor Adarsh Kumar Sood to tackle the problem.

""We created an RCC structure to stabilise the sinking portion after getting a technical report from the IIT-Roorkee. A multi-storey PD commercial complex was built beneath the RCC structure for the optimum utilisation of the space. On the top, we installed the statue of the late PM Indira Gandhi in 1990,"" former mayor Sood said.

Welcoming the proposal, he said it should have been done several years ago.

The IIT-Roorkee was engaged a few months ago to carry out a study to know the reasons behind the sinking Ridge and probable steps to stabilise it.

It is likely to submit its report to the state government soon.

""We have already prepared the designs and drawings of phase I,"" Kapoor said, adding that after getting the technical report, the phase I of the project will be forwarded to the Shimla Municipal Corporation and the Town and Country Planning Department for approval.

Kapoor said the work on phase I will start within a month of getting necessary approvals.

In reply to a question, the PWD official said, ""Our main aim is to stabilise the sinking Ridge. After constructing RCC structures, we may think of using the space beneath these for use on the lines of PD Complex if the National Green Tribunal and other institutions approve so.""

Kapoor further said they may think of installing a statue of the late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the top of the RCC structure outside Gaiety Theatre.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plan-afoot-to-stabilise-sinking-ridge-in-shimla.html

51,16-2-20,BJP expresses displeasure on proposed closure of schemes,"State BJP Vice President cum Rajya Sabha MP Samir Oraon today said that the State government is trying to close down public welfare schemes just to cover up its failures. Addressing media persons in a press conference here on Saturday Oraon said that at one hand the grand alliance parties had come to power promising huge soaps for farmers including loan waiver, while on the other hand reports are coming of the proposed closure of farmers’ welfare scheme MMKAY.

He said that it seems as if the government has made up its mind to sacrifice the farmers. “Through the Krishi Aashirwad Yojana, 35 lakh farmers were getting direct benefits and they were becoming self-reliant instead of debtors. With the closure of this scheme, the farmers will be forced to once again get caught by the Mahajans,” he added.

Oraon further said that news is coming through various newspapers that Hemant government is also going to discontinue the ongoing Re 1 registry scheme for the empowerment of women, which is unfortunate. He said that the Re 1 Registry scheme was not a government programme, but a social campaign whereby women as well as a family were becoming stronger and self-reliant and Hemant government's closure of such a programme clearly reflected the party’s malicious mentality.

He said that the registry of land / house for 1 rupee made women the owners of property today, that is why 80 per cent of the registry was done in the name of women in the last five years, but Hemant government, despite knowing everything, only with its hatred with BJP is going to stop such welfare schemes. He said that Hemant government should clarify what is its intention behind taking harmful steps for the women of the State in this manner. Oraon said that while the government is investigating the tenders, it should also take action in this investigation by checking the land purchased by the Soren family in seven districts of the State in violation of CNT and SPT Act.

State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that the Chief Minister does double politics. In Lohardaga, a procession of the people of the majority society was stoned and one person was killed and dozens were injured but the Chief Minister showed his thinking towards the majority society by not visiting the site after 20 days of the incident. He said that when Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in the opposition, its leaders would always say that the report of the SIT probing the land matters should be made public but after the change of guard now they have suppressed the report of the SIT. This clearly shows that their voice is different in the opposition and their voice changed after coming to power.

State Spokesperson Anil Sinha said that the Hemant government, which came to power by making big promises and announcements, is now ready to make excuses and the Hemant government does not have the ability to fulfill its promises. Therefore, they are misleading the public by pretending that the treasury is empty. He said that the government should also investigate the tenders held in the road construction department in the year 2014 by probing the tenders of 2015, the government is showing its ill intentions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-expresses-displeasure-on-proposed-closure-of-schemes.html

54,16-2-20,Focus on tribal children in reopening schools: Edu Min,"The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)-led Government will particularly focus on the requirements of tribal children living in the far-flung villages of the State while reopening the schools that were shut down by a former NDA-led Government here, School Education and Literacy Minister Jagarnath Mahto said on Saturday.

The step, he said, will be taken in a bid to ensure free quality education to the children living in the mountains, forest areas and hamlets situated in the interiors of Jharkhand. “Even if there are 10 children in an area, they should have a school at a comfortable distance from their home. These children living in the interiors will be our focus while reopening the schools that were closed by the former Government,” Mahto told this newspaper on Saturday.

Under the leadership of former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, the School Education and Literacy Department decided to merge around 4600 primary schools with bigger schools. Later, the Government also resorted to shutting down around 6000 more schools that were said to have a ‘negligible’ strength of students. The decision – despite being criticized by many Right to Education activists and the opposition parties – was projected by the Government as a move to provide better infrastructure and facilities to the children studying in smaller schools.

According to reports, Jharkhand was one of the three States picked for a 30-month programme of the Centre under which the NITI Aayog entrusted Boston Consulting Group to implement reforms in the primary education system. The Jharkhand government then merged schools in two phases.

In the first phase, schools with fewer than 10 students and in the second phase, schools with fewer than 30 students were merged with primary or upper-primary schools nearby.

The third round of mergers was stalled when BJP MPs from the State objected and said that the closure of schools was affecting thousands of lives in the hinterland.

Since taking charge as the Chief Minister, Hemant Soren has been vocal about his plan of reopening the schools that were closed. However, the new Government is also likely to make changes in the curriculum and the syllabi in order to ‘localize’ the primary school lessons and also make it holistic. “We are yet to take any official decision regarding the change of syllabi.

However, necessary changes will be made at the right time,” Mahto said.

Sources from the School Education and Literacy Department said that the Government was also planning to include fresh lessons on the local heroes of the State and the tribal personalities.

The lessons, they said, will be aimed at making students aware of the glorious history of Jharkhand.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/focus-on-tribal-children-in-reopening-schools--edu-min.html

As it was expected that outgoing president Rakesh Singh might be given a second term for party's victory in Lok Sabha elections in his leadership, the party high command did not show confidence in him. In Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had swept 28 out of 29 seats in May last year.

Factually, losing State Assembly elections in his leadership, cost Rakesh Singh dearly.

Meanwhile, Sharma, the Khajuraho MP, besides serving in various capacity in Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) nationally, was appointed General Secretary of BJP in Madhya Pradesh in the past.

Party sources said that his closeness to 'Nagpur' rewarded him with selection on this important post.

Sharma was also National vice president of Nehru Yuva Kendra had started his political journey from Gwalior as a student union leader.

Dubbed as an RSS man, Sharma despite belonging to Gwalior was fielded from Khajuraho parliamentary seat in Bundelkhand in 2019 and won the poll by close to five lakh votes.

The outgoing State president Rakesh Singh hailed the appointment saying that it was a natural process of change and claimed that Sharma's appointment would energize the party State unit.

Besides Singh, leaders like Bhupendra Singh, a close aide of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, former Minister Narottam Mishra, Faggan Singh Kulaste and others where in the race for the key post.

72,16-2-20,"AICC holds meet to defuse tussle between Nath, Scindia","Amidst the continued tussle between the Chief Minister Kamal Nath and ex-union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, a meeting of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) co-ordination committee held in New Delhi on Saturday. As expected, former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia remained absent from the meeting.

Though the details of the meeting were not known, it was believed that the panel decided to remain united against all odds.

While talking to media persons, Nath had said that he had a positive meeting with the interim president Sonia Gandhi and he had discussions on urban and rural local body polls.

He had spoken to Gandhi on the reconstitution of party state organisation.

To a query on co-ordination between the State Government and the party organisation, Nath said, ‘he was the party state president and co-ordination fell under his purview.’

To the threat of Scindia to ‘take to streets on unfulfilled poll promises’, an apparently upset Chief Minister Kamal Nath here on Saturday replied saying ‘Let him do so’.

As the media questioned Nath over Scindia’s annoyance over unfulfilled poll promises tagged with the threat that he might take to streets to get them fulfilled, a visibly upset Nath replied, “To Utar Jayen (let him do so).”

Without discussing the issue any further, Nath was quick to move away in his vehicle.

It all started two days ago, when Scindia had reached Tikamgarh to meet agitating guest faculties.

Addressing the guest faculties, the former union minister had told them that their demands were in the Congress Vachan Patra (election manifesto) and the document was the most auspicious for the party.

“If every single promise mentioned in the Vachan Patra is not fulfilled, you people don’t consider yourself alone, Scindia would take to streets with you,” he stated.

Scindia’s statement had come hours after Co-operative Affairs Minister Govind Singh had expressed inability in fulfilling farm loam waiver, at least for the time being.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aicc-holds-meet-to-defuse-tussle-between-nath--scindia.html

77,16-2-20,Love story of Salim and Anarkali ‘Mughal-e-Azam’ screened at Bharat Bhavan,"The epic love story of Salim and Anarkali “Mughal-e-Azam” was screened on Saturday. A four-day film festival of classical movies is being held at Bharat Bhavan. The festival is being held under celebration of its 38th foundation day.

The festival will begin with screening of the film Mughal-e-Azam. It is a 1960 Indian epic historical drama film directed by K. Asif and produced by Shapoorji Pallonji.

Starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Madhubala, Durga Khote, and Dilip Kumar, it follows the love affair between Mughal Prince Salim (who went on to become Emperor Jahangir) and Anarkali, a court dancer.

79,16-2-20,You can write your life anew,"Picking up threads from the previous issue, let us now look at the premise on which destiny is formed. That will make it clear whether we are bound by its indications or that it leaves scope for making amends through conscious efforts. Remember, unlike other species that are fully bound by their predefined nature, and with no scope for making any exception, human beings enjoy the privilege to guide their actions by choice and discrimination. But whenever there is a choice, the probability of its use and misuse remains equal. And there is nothing like a free lunch in this world. So, we have to bear with the consequences of right or wrong choices we make in life. We, thus, get trapped into a circuitous web of cause-effect chain that runs in succession, often stretching on the next birth cycle, usually difficult to exit. In this scheme of things, the doings and undoing in the past lead to what we encounter this moment, which in turn, serves as ground on which future takes off. This is the premise on which our Karma cycle stands.

For all the good and well-intended choices, we make, may offer beneficial results. Evil minded choices would obviously make us subject to pains and sufferings. Bear in mind; all that we do, good or bad, gets imprinted in the inner realms of our mind in the form of thought-seeds, respectively carrying positive and negative connotations. As and when situations arising in life offer ground suited to store memory imprints, they come into play. Evidently, the character and content of the karmic imprints in play would set the terms of experiences we become due for. To sum up, it is our choice option that sets the terms of our future Karma, what in common parlance we call destiny.

It needs to be appreciated here that choice option, if prudently used, does also enjoin upon us with the capacity to make amends through conscious efforts. Bear in mind; we are armed with the exclusive privilege of the faculty of discriminate intelligence. Applying this prerogative, we could evaluate and judge things in the right perspective and pick up the right lead. Not simply that, it could also help us self-reflect upon our mind-trends, and dispassionately identify and acknowledge inherent fault lines. These infirmities won’t let us negotiate the callings of life with ease and comfort. Having known thus, we could make a conscientious choice to make amends with the help of educative inputs. Here comes the role of ‘patra’— personality orientation of a being — out of the three variables referred to in the previous issue. To sum up, should we become aware of our own self, we could write anew our personality trends, which in turn, may reorient the future course of our life. The paradox, however, is that seldom do we remain conscious about the need to strive sufficiently to improve our own lot. And when we fail, instead of owning one’s failures, we try to cover it up by taking refuge in fate.

Let us now have a look at astrological pointers to your child’s habit tendencies. The fiery Sun is ill-disposed off to another fiery planet Mars, makes her impulsive, aggressive, and argumentative. Moon opposite Uranus makes her unconventional, careless, unstable, having a mercurial temperament. Mars placed adverse to mischievous Neptune makes her self-deluding and addictive. Also, it makes her vulnerable to develop inferiority complex. Venus opposite Mars, and also placed adverse to Neptune makes her vulnerable to get into bad company. She may unmindfully misdirect her energies towards unproductive ends. Afflicted Neptune in the 2nd accounts for her indiscrete statements that may offend others. All the more, because she is undiplomatic and tactless as her lagna sign Sagittarius implies.

The positives in her are no less. Intelligence signifying Mercury conjunct wisdom-oriented Jupiter implies that if she is given the right exposure, she may quickly acquire knowledge with clarity. The Sun aligned so well to Saturn brings in the strength of character. So, once she develops awareness, she could promptly put them to use. All that is needed is to exploit her positives. But you need to seek the services of a good counsellor, who may help bring about the desired change. On your part, engage her with sense of love. In terms of time frame, progressed Sun begins to close up with benevolent Jupiter beginning the 16th year. Given the right efforts, she may show marked improvement in a year’s time thereafter.

80,16-2-20,‘I have been my own person’,"Karan Deol | The third-generation actor, who made his debut with Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas, speaks with Shalini Saksena about how he wanted to be a footballer till he was 13 before the acting bug bit him, his disappointment with how the film was received and what is keeping him busy

What was the challenge that this film put in front of you?

The biggest challenge was to establish an identity of my own in the industry and what sets me apart from each member of the family. Each one of us is unique. For me, it was to step out of my family’s shadow. As for the challenges faced during the shoot, it was to stand in minus 2 degrees and give a perfect shot especially emotional scenes. One had to be in the zone. We would give the shot and as soon as the word ‘cut’ was screamed out, I would run to the heater to warm myself while all the time all I could do was stand there shivering.

How tough is it for star kids to break away from their parents’ identity?

It is tough. For people they may be stars but for me they are family — my grandfather, dad and chacha. Unfortunately, the problem is that one is always compared as Sunny Deol’s son. Is he like this? Was he like his father here? They like stuff about my father and dada and automatically presume that I will be a combination of them which is impossible. They are their own people and brilliant. I am not here to copy them. It does tie you down. It is sad that this presumption comes even though the audience doesn’t do this intentionally. Each person has a different personality thought there are genetic similarities. What people miss is the one’s uniqueness that is separate from the others. However, one has to accept it and move forward and hope that the more they see your work, the more you start to step away from the shadow.

How much pressure did this put on you?

There was definitely a lot of pressure that was built due to other factors. As far as my family is concerned, it was only when I started giving interviews to the media, the that the distinction came. Until then, they were just dad, dada and chacha. They were never Sunny Deol, Dharmendraji or Bobby Deol. But I didn’t think about this too much, there were chances that I could succumb to it, and not do my job properly.

What is the lesson that this movie has taught you?

The movie has taught me a lot. As an actor, I am trying to improve my craft each day. After the film released, I looked at the criticism and have been working to improve on those areas. It has pushed me to make myself better. It has taught me to look at life in a different way, to take more risks and to think outside the box.

Kids usually want to be a doctor or an engineer. Did you always want to be an actor?

When you are young you don’t think about being an actor. At that age one wants to be an astronaut. Like in my case it was to be a cook and or a footballer. But when I was turned 14, I had some understanding of the field. Gradually, I realised that I wanted to be an actor but was scared to take the first step.

What kind of training did you do for the film?

I took a lot of workshops. In order to understand the character better I went to Himachal Pradesh before the shoot began.

Was Sunny Deol a father or a director on the sets?

He left the father-son relationship at home. He was totally a director and a tough task master; something that was urgently required. Though he never scolded me in front of others, he would take me aside and explain if I didn’t understand things and tell me what I was doing wrong in a stern voice.

Were you disappointed with the results?

Obviously, there was disappointment. It is human nature to feel bad. But it was my first movie. Now, I am now trying to map out the next course of action; for this I am reading a lot of scripts. The more scripts I read, the better understanding I have of different kinds of characters. I am also attending workshops. I hope at the end of it all, I am able to reinvent myself and people like the new me in that avatar.

The movie had a world premiere on Valentine’s Day on Zee Cinema. How did you want people to perceive it?

Since it was watched by so many more people, I wanted them to see it as a simple love story; there are no complications. So hope that people enjoyed it sitting at home.

Why was the song Pal pal dil ke paas not there in the film?

That was my father’s decision. The song is so iconic; he didn’t want to recreate it. Even today, people love to hear it. It is such a beautiful song with fantastic melody and lyrics. I would say that it is one of the best romantic songs.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-have-been-my-own-person----2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-have-been-my-own-person---.html
81,16-2-20,Larry’s theme for a dream,"It has been 20 years since Larry’s China at The Ambassador opened. SHALINI SAKSENA tells you how the ageold restaurant has captured tradition and yet evolved with time

One of the first things that strikes you as you sit down to dine at this restaurant in the heart of the Capital is the menu. It is interesting to note the photographs alongside the menu, some dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. These photos, with a brief description of where they were taken, give a sneak peek into the culture that existed in China then a perfect example of Chinese tradition along with the culinary evolution of the cuisine.

Executive Chef Sanjeev Chopra, while serving some of the signature dishes like shredded chicken asparagus in oyster garlic sauce, sliced sole fish with roasted chilies and honey chili lotus stem regales you with how the restaurant came up with this unique idea of the menu. “The concept of this restaurant is based on L Carrington Goodrich, an American sinologist and historian of China. As a child, he had spent many years in China.

He remembered those times through the photos which were difficult to take given the circumstances back then. Luther aka Larry collected these photos and made an album. We went a step further and created a restaurant on this theme,” Chopra shares.

He tells you that Chinese food was brought to India by the immigrants and first took root in present-day Kolkata where they developed a cuisine to suit the Indian palate and came to be known as Indo-Chinese cuisine. This food became popular in Kolkata and spread to other parts of the country. He tells you how the popular American Chop suey came to be.

“Just like immigrants came to India, they went to the US as well particularly San Francisco. A popular dish here is American Chop suey. A popular story goes that one late night some American soldiers who were hungry landed at Li Ching Hong’s eatery and demanded food. Everything had finished. But Li chopped veggies, noodles and meats and cooked them together, added sauce and the dish was born,” Chopra says and tells you that while the dish doesn’t find a mention on the menu, if a guest wants it, it is served. “There is no need for it. Everyone who comes to Larry’s knows that the restaurant’s name is synonymous with American Chop suey. Then there is how there was need for another Chinese restaurant back in the 80s besides House of Ming. We decided to introduce Indo-Chinese American cuisine here,” he explains.

Serving the perfectly blended lemon coriander chicken soup that is not too hot, not too cold, Naresh Khaitan, Larry’s China’s supervisor who started off as steward staff at the Ambassador in 1978 tells you that over the years, Larry’s has undergone renovations. “Back then the restaurant had wooden flooring. In 1990, Taj took over and then in 1997, the renovations were done. The lighting was improved. It is so much brighter now. The name was changed to Larry’s China due the change in the theme and the concept on which it is based. The senior management brought in Cantonese as well as Schezwan food. The good thing is that everyone can relish these dishes,” says Khaitan whose sons also work with the Taj group.

In comes the lotus stem honey chilli. One is told it is cooked in such a manner that it remains moist and well-cooked on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is a trick that their chef has perfected over the years. Another winner here is the sesame tiger prawn. It is the restaurant’s signature dish. Nobody who has visited this place has walked away without trying this dish if he is a non-vegetarian.

“People have been coming here for decades to eat this. They now bring their grandchildren. There is a guest who has settled in the US long back, but every time he is in Delhi, a must do on his list is a visit to this place to savour this dish. He also sends his guests and then calls me and tells me that I must serve them this dish. If you look at the size of the prawn you would not believe that a prawn can be this large. But there is a trick which we can’t reveal but it depends on how it is cut. It is then batter fried and tossed with onions, green bell pepper, spices and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It is a dish not to be missed,” Khaitan asserts, telling you that he has served the likes of Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj who used to celebrate her birthday here and even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who is a regular here.

And he is spot on when he says that once the guest has eaten this dish, there is no way he will not order it the next time he comes visiting. The taste is amazing and even those who diligently stay away from sea food will like this. The crispiness of the batter fried prawns and veggies is perfect — no taste overpowering.

But if one wants to still stay away from prawn, go for sliced Pentagon chicken. Thinly sliced chicken strips that are shallow batter fried, tossed with Chinese five spice and dry red chillies is good. No meal is complete without dessert. While one may think that date pancake is not something to be ordered. But the truth is that it is so different from what one would have eaten anywhere else. Therefore, it makes for a must eat making it a perfect way to end a great meal.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/larry---s-theme-for-a-dream-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/larry---s-theme-for-a-dream.html
82,16-2-20,"‘When you do a single, sky is the limit’","Music composer-singer NAKASH AZIZ speaks with SHALINI SAKSENA about his latest single, journey and future projects among other things

What is Superstar all about?

Naresh Sharma, who happens to be Mithun’s father, got in touch with me, regarding this song. I was excited to collaborate with him. He has worked with the greats like of Laxmi Kant-Pyare Lal, Bollywood industry celebrates this musician. he has amazing music sensibilities. I went and recorded this song. He and Anand B Seshadri (penned the song) worked on the song. I just grabbed the opportunity. The good part is that I was allowed to do my thing; I had a lot of fun.

Why are playback singers turning to indie space?

There was never a singles culture in India, it was always about the album. Music companies don’t really invest in an artist that much. Though there are exceptions like Sony Music has Badshah and T-Series has Guru Randhawa. Singles are a great way for an artist to express and experiment with what they are doing; to say what they want to. Normally, when an artist does a film, it is story-driven. The kind of songs that I do are to promote a movie barring a few. When you do a single, the sky is the limit. You can do a song on a budget of Rs 10,000 or even Rs 50 lakh.

There was a time when singers just did films. Does Bollywood restricts artists and hence they are diversifying?

Actually, there is too much work at present. There are say, 10 new films being made just for Netflix; like this, there are other OTT platforms. Then there are Bollywood films. Then there are TV shows, then there is YouTube. Everybody gets an opportunity today. I don’t feel restricted in any way as Bollywood music puts me on the biggest platform. If I sing a song it will come on different platforms. People are doing other things to be noted by Bollywood. People in Bollywood are doing other things since they have a following and want to expand that base.

When you did Selfie, did you feel it would do so well?

I call such songs 100-year songs — songs that will last for a long time. For example Ek, do, teen. How, when during a party, it is played. Kids who are12-13 when they turn 30-40, is when songs that I have sung for Pritam da and or Vishal-Shekhar will become Ek, do, teen for them.

What is about such songs that they become popular?

I would say that for me when I sung Selfie — it was done with great intent. We put in a lot of works and wa done with honesty. There may be artists who would look down upon this song and say it is not serious music. I never believed that music needed to be serious. I enjoyed doing this song. It was meant to be for a big-budget movie and enjoyed the opportunity. I try to mean when I sing.

Do you think people are looking for peppy numbers only?

People are looking for those romantic numbers. There are too many majnos who get their hearts broken. Only when they are partying do they listen to me.

What are the plans for this year?

I am in the process of making a short film and send it to festivals. The workshop is on for the actors. I have a great director on board. I love storytelling and promote people who want to say something different rather than trying to do what the trend demands. As for music, films require music and there are a few singles in the pipeline. My friend (Sargam) and I, we have a production house — Moth Music Records — we are trying to collaborate with artists and who crazy things and do their things.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---when-you-do-a-single--sky-is-the-limit----2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---when-you-do-a-single--sky-is-the-limit---.html
83,16-2-20,Modern-day twist to your lehenga,"There are ways to reuse your wedding trousseau heirloom clothing with a modern style quotient. Here’s how

Wedding trousseaus are an integral part of Indian weddings, where bride’s mother prepares a collection of outfits, jewelry, and makeup that the she would use in her post-marriage life. While the ritual dates to centuries, there’s a need to redefine the meaning in a way that it suits the needs of modern women.

Traditionally, a wedding trousseau consists of the bridal lehenga, silk sarees that are either brand new or belong to the family heirloom, suits for festive occasions and the makeup collection. Now, most of these are often heavy and unfit for regular wear and so they are mostly kept unused.

The best way to use these precious items is to re-style them into something that can be used a multiple time.

Here are some unique ways to restyle the old lehengas.

Mix and Match different outfits

Substantial dupatta with a plain salwar kameez, the adorned skirt with a plain shirt and overwhelming pullover with a plain saree or crude silk skirt like a harvest top and skirt-voila! You can have four diverse outfit choices on the off chance that you simply blend and match from your lehenga set!

Pair it with different accessories

Who said you need to wear the whole lehenga set at whatever point you do? Style it with a calfskin blouse or wear the skirt with a long kurti — play with options here, and you may concoct something you like!

Modern style blouse

Get a long blouse with cuts or a sheer blouse made, which looks in vogue, and winds up concealing pieces of the skirt, which helps in making it look progressively wearable. This is a decent choice on the off chance that you have one of those lehengas with work that is truly attractive and overwhelming. You could even go for a brilliant short blouse and cart it away without a dupatta which will look extremely current!

Cape instead of blouse

Dump the pullover and dupatta that accompanied the lehenga and cart away the skirt with an instant brilliant or differentiating cape-it’s in in fashion and would not look over the top.

Dupatta into a pallu

If you have a beautiful dupatta with the lehenga, it isn’t reasonable for simply keeping it around! You can get fabric sewed to it and make a glitz half-half saree with plain fabric in a way that the dupatta makes it to the front and becomes the pallu!

Here are some of the most iconic ways for keeping your family’s heirloom close to your heart forever.

Doormats: Searching for economical approaches to adding magnificence to your home? All you need are a couple of old sarees. Welcome mats or place mats are most of the fun methods for reusing old sarees and making something altogether.

Table runners: Its an extravagant style thought which you can do when visitors come over. Looks extremely exquisite.

Tapestry: This is one of the harder choices to execute with sarees. Be that as it may, all things considered it very well may be the most beautiful too. On the off chance that you have a silk saree in Kantha, or something which has an intricate story plan on it, at that point you can cut it in a square shape and include extra borders to add an edge to your room.

Potlis: Potlis, tote-sacks, and wallets or satchels with pattu border make for varied treasured pieces and every one of them can be made by reusing your old sarees.

84,16-2-20,Haat’s off,"The 34th edition of Surajkund Mela comes to an end today, after 15 days of fun, food and unending entertainment. MUSBA HASHMI visits the fair to bring you untold stories of artisans and the hidden treasures that the festival has on offer

To bid adieu to the chilling winters of Delhi and to give a warm welcome to the hot summer months to follow, the 34th edition of Surajkund Mela in Faridabad always has a few surprises waiting for those who visit the mela. Today, is the last day of the 15-day long festival that was nothing short of a power-packed fiesta.

From the Rajasthani folk dance to the mouth-watering Rajasthani cuisine to the craft from Himachal Pradesh to souvenirs from Ghana and to bamboo sofas made by local artisans, the festival had it all. There was something for everyone to relish and cherish. The festival is hosted by the Surajkund Mela Authority in collaboration with the Union Ministries of Tourism, Textiles, Culture, External Affairs, Department of Tourism, Government of Haryana and Haryana Tourism Corporation. The theme State of the festival this year is Himachal Pradesh; last year it was Maharashtra.

The world’s largest international crafts fair has been drawing crowd in tens of thousands and this was no different. One of the highlights among the flooded streets of the mela apart from the luxurious craft from all over the world was the behrupiya brothers. With people lining-up to click selfies just like they do with B-town celebs if not more. The behrupiyas stood calm and patiently posed for the photos. Among all the behrupiya brothers, the one who drew the most attention was the djinn or the genie.

Naushad Khan, the 32-year-old from the community based out of a village in Rajasthan is carrying forward his forefathers’ legacy. He has been visiting the mela for several years now.

“I have been into this profession all my life. It is a skill passed down to me by my forefathers. This is a craft that we live for. As far as my visit to the mela is concerned it is because of the Haryana tourism board. They have called me and my five brothers, who are disguised as Lord Krishana, joker, dacoit, genie and a monkey, here,” the well-built Khan tells you.

Dressed in a black gown paired up with an orange pyjama, face painted with purple-pinkish colour with silver highlights, messy hair, wearing devil’s horns and necklaces made of both big and small beads, there was something eye-catching in Khan’s appearance. On closer inspection, one will notice his deep yellow eyes. Not that Khan drinks or smokes, it is a part and parcel of his profession. A reaction of wearing paint on his face for too long.

“I wear the costume for about eight to 10 hours a day. It takes me three hours to disguise myself as different characters. It is not an easy task. There are certain challenges that we go through daily. Like whenever I put paint on my face my eyes turn yellow. It is due to an allergic reaction. As soon as I will remove it, they will get back to normal. Not only the eyes but my skin too had to pay the price. Though the paint is home-made but still it affects the skin,” he says.

Coming from the behrupiya community who have been into the profession for several centuries, there is no alternative for Khan but to earn a living from this.

“My purpose of visiting these fairs is to bring the behrupiya art to light. I want the art to be recognised by the people. I love entertaining people and making them happy. Of course, money is another reason but its not the sole one. I want people to respect this art form. There are many people in my village who are sitting jobless because they are not getting a platform to showcase their talent. We don’t have any other option to eke a living,” Khan says.

However entertaining people is not everyone’s cup of tea. There is a lot that Khan has to go through to make others happy. “I come across a lot of people who mock me. They ask me ‘why am I doing this? Can’t I follow another profession?’ It hurts and sometimes I get angry but then I can’t do anything since I want to carry on the legacy. I have to listen to their taunts and behave as if I am deaf,” Khan tells you.

Khan feels that mobiles are responsible for certain people’s behaviour to some extent. “When my forefathers were into this business, people appreciated the art form. But nowadays its all about, hello, taking a selfie and bye. That’s it. People have no time to appreciate you. Some are kind enough to stop and give us a reward while others just leave after taking photos,” he explains.

Though Khan has a lot of love and respect for the art he has made up his mind to not allow his children to take up the profession. “While I am all set to take this art to other States, I feel there is no money. While I am here entertaining people, I am not sure whether my family back home has enough money to buy food. It is discouraging to see that no one is bothered about taking the craft ahead. My children are currently studying. I have already told them to do whatever they want but not follow our footsteps. I don’t want to see them suffer since I don’t see any future for this craft in the future,” Khan, who has done theatre and taken part in Ramleela events in his home State, tells you.

Another gem hiding a few shops is edible kitchenware. Yes, you read that right. Plates, spoons, bowls and glasses that can be eaten!

Brainchild of Delhi-based environment conscious Puneet Dutta, Attaware is offering edible kitchenware that is easy to dispose and is environment friendly.

“I was working as a global recruitment manager for a software firm and had to travel frequently. I always wanted to do something for the environment. One day, while I was crossing River Yamuna, I noticed a long stretch of some white things floating in the black water. I went closer and to my horror it was thermacol plates. I was disappointed to see how we are spoiling the Nature. I was travelling to Vrindavan back then. Once I entered the city, I saw a man holding a puri in his hands with sabzi on top of that. I realised that there was no thermacol or plastic plates required. That’s when the idea hit me to come up with something that leaves no residue — Attaware — a brand that offers cutlery made of atta and gur,” Dutta tells you.

It was in 2013 when he started to play with ideas and a bowl was the first thing that he made. Dutta then went on making plates, spoons and glasses. The brand was launched in August last year.

“It took me several years to do the research before I came out with the products. Then I went for the trials. I did lot of lab tests. But I was not satisfied. I wanted to note its practical applicability. I approached a pub in Gurugram and asked them if they would sell their drinks in our edible made glasses. They agreed and the response was positive. Everything went smoothly. But then I decided to check where these glasses went after use. I found, that people generally preferred to have their drink in cars and throw the glasses away. After a few days, we got to know that mice would carry them to their burrows and eat them,” he tells you.

To begin with, most people including his brother, Sahil, would laugh at his business idea. But he too came on board. “Initially, he used to laugh at my idea. He used to make fun of me by saying ‘pehle Puneet suit pehan kar flights mein jata thha ab dekho kaha atte ki boriyan lata rehta hai.’ I used to keep quiet but once the brand was launched he too accepted the fact that whatever I was doing was good,” he says.

Since its launch the brand has sold 35,000 samples. “Yes, the samples are not free. People have to buy them. The response that we have received from our customers is overwhelming. Even the vendors at the Surajkund Mela have been kind enough to agree to sell our products,” he says.

The edible kitchenware is an answer to many problems. It not only helps in reducing waste as it is completely bio-degradable, it also helps in saving water that is used for washing dishes, provides employment opportunities and offers food to all living beings. One can eat it too!

“Through this start-up we are able to give employment to around 1,100 widows from Delhi-NCR and Mathura. The work they do can never be replaced with machinery. The women need to check the texture and the quality of the dough before the final product is moulded. If the texture is not correct it will fluff up like a roti. Also, our products are completely safe and hygienic. Atta and gur are baked at very high temperatures; this kills the germs,” Sahil, who doesn’t want to disclose the whole process tells you.

This is not all. The next product on cards is a water bottle. “We will soon come up with an edible water bottle. The name has not yet been finalised but we are planning to call it Power Bottle,” Sahil tells you.

Adding to the charm of the festival was an Armenian souvenir shop in the Foreign Shops section. Cute handmade necklaces, woolen scarfs and bags, wall hangings and fairy dolls are a cherry on the cake.

Maral Sheuhmelian Berberian, a Syrian-Armenian, who visited the festival for the first time did everything possible to make her shop look one of the cutest among all the chock-a-block shops with variety of stuff.

“The reason why I am here is I wanted to showcase the culture of Armenia. We have received a warm welcome from the people here and I already have made a lot of friends in India. The one thing that I liked the most is the kind nature of the people,” she tells you. All the designs on the shop have been handcrafted by Maral. “I loved designing since I was a child. I had seen my mother and grandmother doing this and wondered how they were able to design their thoughts so beautifully. I wanted to do the same. Now, its more like a passion,” she tells you.

The delicious food that the mela has on offer definitely needs a special mention. However, many shopkeepers felt that the year was not as good for them as it used to be but having said that if you have a keen eye for art and culture and want to see the heritage of the country of for that matter other countries, Surajkund Mela makes for a must visit place. If you have missed it this time, don’t forget to add it in your bucket list for next year.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/haat---s-off-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/haat---s-off.html
85,16-2-20,Mann Ki Baat: Esthetic blend of flames of the minds,"The pleasure of understanding is one of the purest things available to man, and the passion of the Indian for it burns in the bright flame of the mind.

— Dr S Radhakrishnan

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY (Volume I)

Radio has a chequered history vis-à-vis literature. In 1956, BBC approached Samuel Beckett to pen script for radio production. Radio appealed to Beckett and he brought out five plays. Exploring the relationship between Beckett’s these plays and radio, literary critic Nicholas Johnson wrote a piece in 2016 in Irish Times stressing importance of radio in the context of internet: “The newer, stronger and younger mass medium.” Not oblivious of unifying role of radio, Johnson concluded, “Listening is again turned into an active and sensory occasion… It is a throwback to an era where families tuned in together.”

Radio and Mann Ki Baat

Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers “Mann Ki Baat” every month through Radio: a medium of communication that was almost consigned to the debris of the past. This is what the Prime Minister said in “Mann Ki Baat” (November 2018) about selection of radio. He recalled: As party worker in 1998 he was travelling in Himachal Pradesh and in the evening stopped for tea at a wayside “Dhaba”. The tea seller first offered him sweet, a “Laddoo”. He asked about the reason for this. The tea seller replied, “It is a momentous and joyous moment. India has exploded the bomb today!… Sir, just listen to the radio.” It was the topic of discussion on the radio. The tea seller informed how then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had announced on the radio about bomb explosion. The tea seller heard it and went jubilant. The PM then stated, “Watching that particular impact of the news on the radio led me to realise and internalise that this was the medium truly connected with the masses and was a mighty means of reaching out.”

Prime Minister Modi is a poet. His poetry book “a Journey” originally written in Gujarati was translated in English by Ravi Mantha. While “a Journey” is “evocative and poignant… and awakens the mind to bloom, expand and glow” (Modi’s Metaphysical Musings, published in The Pioneer on May 18, 2014); “Mann Ki Baat” is mass experimentation with thinking and thoughts-sharing process. One basic feature of “Mann Ki Baat” made abundantly clear by the PM (November 2018) is “…this programme has remained apolitical. When ‘Mann Ki Baat’ started, I had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political.” Thus “Mann Ki Baat” is not political in nature.

As “Mann Ki Baat” necessarily involves thinking, it is pertinent to talk of psychologists John Radford and Andrew Burton’s work on thinking (1974) where they deal with three activities (i) self-observation: one aims to observe his experiences; (ii) self-reports: one relates experiences and (iii) thinking aloud: one attempts to provide a running commentary on some mental activities as it proceeds. It seems all these three activities get employed in “Mann Ki Baat”, making it akin to “introspective contemplation.” Space being a constraint, a very limited attempt is made here to put forth a few illustrative aspects of “Mann Ki Baat” by culling out some material from selected months.

First, “Mann Ki Baat” aims at empowering people. Professor AK Sen records in his book, The Argumentative Indian, his conversation with “a barely literate” and “certainly very poor” villager telling him, “It is not very hard to silence us, but that is not because we cannot speak.” The power to exchange ideas and thoughts was tilted towards, to use Professor Sen’s words, “the powerful” and “well-schooled”…even though “the most interesting accounts of arguments involve members of disadvantaged groups. “Mann Ki Baat” caters to the broader requirements of plurality and heterodoxy empowering even the most disadvantaged members of the society to reach the Prime Minister.

Methodology employed in “Mann Ki Baat” involves: The PM reaching out to people, enabling people to reach out to him with their suggestions/comments; sharing of experiences and suggestions of people as conveyed to the Prime Minister; discussion about books; narration of tales and stories, etc. Acknowledging people’s suggestions for “Mann Ki Baat”, Prime Minister said (August 2017) “My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude and indebtedness as millions of people from across the country come together with “Mann Ki Baat”. Even the smallest of your suggestions help us think anew on a wide variety of subjects.” Again (September 2016) “…for me, Mann Ki Baat is a means to feel the strength of my 125 crore countrymen.” He reiterated (November 2018) “Honestly speaking, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ carries my voice but the examples, emotions and spirit represent my countrymen.” (June 2019) “This is my journey from ‘I’ to ‘We’. Many a time your words work as a catalyst to my thought.”

In the first episode (October 2014) after saying, “We have forgotten ourselves. We have become hopeless”, PM Modi set the ball rolling by telling what Swami Vivekananda used to say. Once a lioness, with her two cubs, spotted a flock of sheep. She chased the flock with one cub accompanying it and other left behind. The left behind cub was reared up by a mother sheep. Growing up along with other sheep, he started speaking sheep’s language adapting to their ways of life. Once the fully grown cub met the left behind brother and was shocked to hear him speak like a sheep. “What are you doing, brother? You are a lion,” he said. But the left-behind brother refused to believe, “No, I am a sheep; I speak like a sheep. I am brought up by them.” The lion took his left-behind brother to a well and both of them saw their face in the water. As soon as the lion saw similarity of faces, his self-esteem got awakened and he attained his self-realisation. After narrating this, the PM continued, “My countrymen, we 125 crore Indians have tremendous strength and capabilities. We need to understand ourselves…carry our self-respect… move forward in life and be successful,” which “will make our country a winning and successful country.” This is a startling way to begin and make people realise their strength. It tantamounts to empowering them.

Second, immutably linked with empowerment is quality of life. Multiple indices to fathom quality of life exist. Such an effective participation by masses in “Mann Ki Baat” unquestionably adds to their quality of life. They have effective say and their viewpoints are heard at the top. Can there be any more satisfying parameter enhancing quality of life? For example, he talked (December 2015) of “Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme” to provide subsidy directly in the bank accounts of beneficiaries. This scheme got a place in Guinness Book of World Records as the largest “DBT Scheme” “which has been successfully implemented.” “Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan” through which both physical and virtual infrastructure would be improved for “Divyang persons”. (April 2016) Quality of education, shifting priority from literacy campaigns to quality education; from “outlay for education” to “outcome of it.” From “Enrolment! Enrolment! Enrolment!” to providing “a good and worthy education”. One crore families have voluntarily given up their subsidy on gas cylinders. “Retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers and small shopkeepers. These are middle-class and lower-middle-class families that have given up their subsidy.” (March 2016) “Kisan Suvidha App” to enable farmers get agricultural and weather related information on mobile.

(July 2016) Lives of pregnant women. “Anaemia during or after pregnancy, pregnancy-related infections, high BP, any such complication can have devastating effects.” Talking of a new campaign, “Prime Minister Safe Motherhood Campaign”, under which, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant get a free check-up at Government health centres, the PM urged poor families to avail of this benefit so that the lives of both mother and child remain safe. (January 2018), “Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana” is concerned with making healthcare affordable and encouraging ease of living. Medicines at Jan Aushadhi Centres are 50 to 90 per cent cheaper than branded drugs in the market. “This is a great help for common people, especially for senior citizens requiring medicines on a daily basis, and results in a lot of savings.”

(August 2017) Of Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, financial inclusion, the PM said, “On 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana will complete three years. Thirty crore new families have been linked to this scheme; bank accounts have been opened. This number is larger than the population of many countries of the world.” “…the last man on the fringes of society has become a part of the mainstream economy of the country.” He goes to bank and is financially secure. “There is now an air of prudence.” A poor person having a RuPay card in his pocket gives him “a sense of dignity”. In the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, underprivileged people have deposited almost 65,000 crore rupees in banks. He said, “In a way, this is a saving for the poor, this is his empowerment for the future. And those who opened their accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana have received the benefit of insurance as well.” The PM explained many schemes like Suraksha Bima Yojna, Start Up Yojna, Stand Up Yojna, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, etc. (January 2018) Nari Shakti: contribution of woman power towards positive transformation in the country and society these days. He referred to Matunga railway station in Mumbai being the first station in India, run by an all-women staff. (January 2016) A novel experiment in Haryana and Gujarat, where from every village the most educated daughters were invited to do flag-hosting in Government schools. (August 2015) in one year, 1,31,000 Financial Literacy camps organised for linking banking sector, economy and poor people. (August 2017) On sensitivity towards environment, he asked, “Are your activities eco-friendly or otherwise?” Not being environment-friendly meant being unacceptable in society. “I find that the “eco-friendly Ganapati” in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign. A “massive and pleasant transformation”. (February 2019) Shared his experience about meeting with beneficiaries of PMJAY scheme under Ayushman Bharat’s umbrella, “about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme over a period of last five months”, bringing about a “transformation in the life of the poor”. (January 2016) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana: its benefits to farmers left in lurch due to natural calamities got the focus. In New Beema Yojana, for the Kharif crop premium will be 2 per cent and for the Rabi crop 1.5 per cent. Swachchh Bharat Mission with examples from various places found mention several times. Initiation of “Swachchh Bharat” Abhiyan on October 2, 2014. (September 2017) Emphasising “we shall connect people through cleanliness”, the PM informed that during first four days of Swachchhata Hi Sewa Abhiyan, more than “75 lakh people joined these activities with more than 40,000 initiatives.” In February 2018, organisation of hygiene campaign for one month under Swachchh Bharat Mission by 15 lakh women in Jharkhand where they constructed 1,70,000 toilets in just twenty days. In October 2019, “Swachchh Siachen” campaign where the temperature drops from zero to minus 50-60 degrees Celsius, Indian soldiers are running this campaign with positive consequences like clean water in the river. “…to remove 130 tons and more of garbage from the glacier and its surrounding area’s fragile eco-system is a great service.”

Similarly many more welfare enhancing measures were explained in different months by PM Modi, in simple language, for the knowledge of people, especially poor and downtrodden.

Third, PM Modi’s love for youth and students is exhibited at many places. “Mann Ki Baat” acts as an effective platform for sharing concerns and anxiety thereby working as a safety valve. “Mann Ki Baat” provides solution to what psychologists call “functional fixidity” or “blinding effect” where only a few fixed set of solutions are thought of. There are ways in “Mann Ki Baat” how to look beyond. For example, PM Modi dealt with (February 2015) examination pressure on students telling them, “Examinations are not the end of the world. Exams are not the test of your life.” For “self-development competition with oneself is more important.” He gave the example of athlete Sergei Bubka, who broke his own record 35 times. The PM suggested a new technique: “I say Desire + Stability = Resolution and Resolution + Action = Achievements.” Followed by a novel suggestion: “Cannot we celebrate a week-long exam festival twice a year?” There should be poetry sessions, debates, lectures on psychological facets of examinations, cartoon competitions, debate competition. “Be successful not to defeat others, but to overcome your own challenges,” he advised students. PM Modi referred to (May 2015) former President Dr APJ Kalam’s book “My Journey-Transforming Dreams Into Action”, where the late President narrated how his dream to become a pilot failed. He became the President of India and made a big contribution to atomic power of the country. “Failure is a kind of opportunity… Fighting with failures gives us strength to live our lives.” He told (January 2017) students, “Knowledge, skill, confidence and willpower matter more in life,” rather than earning more marks. (February 2019) He talked about “Pariksha Pe Charcha” organised in Delhi where “there were open discussions” about “various topics related to examination” which would be “useful for the students.”

(March 2017) The issue of depression and dealing with it collectively. Expression of depression instead of its suppression is the first mantra. Creating “a psychological environment for its cure” should be a beginning. What happens to one should be shared with colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and teachers. Another way: “If you are unable to express yourself to your family and friends, then do one thing you can serve those in need around you. Devote yourself with all your heart into helping others and sharing their joys and sorrows... Your own inner sufferings will begin to disappear.” (December 2014) Drug abuse by children. PM Modi said, “Drug addiction is a 3D problem: Darkness, Destruction and Devastation.” He posed a question to the youth caught in the drug trap: if they ever thought where money used for buying drugs go to? What if the money is spent by terrorists for weapons? And with these weapons, the same terrorists might be pumping bullets in the hearts of our soldiers. He told people to “foster ambition in children, make them dreamers and individuals with a desire to achieve something in life.” He cautioned (September 2019) people against getting addicted to tobacco which causes high-risk diseases and also against e-cigarette which have dangerous chemicals that affect health badly.

Fourth, it’s about unity and world vision. Talking of World Yoga Day: 21st June, PM Modi said (May 2017), “At a time when disruptive forces are raising their ugly heads, this has been India’s great gift to the world. We have successfully united the whole world through yoga.” (June 2015), Photo of a Vietnamese child doing yoga invited world attention. Yoga’s unifying role got highlighted. (June 2019) “Promoting Yoga is a great social service.” He said, on Yoga Day, “the world appeared like one big, happy family”. Sharing is an old Indian tradition: it brings people closer. One way to unite is to share with each other. (January 2016) He gave an example of ocean and said, “In Sanskrit, the sea is called ‘Sagar’ it means endless abundance. Borders and land may be separating us, but water connects us, sea connects us.” (October 2016). He talked of Indian festivals, their widespread effect, depth and reach to individuals which are all interlinked with “one sprit”: “Evolution from the ‘self’’ to the ‘whole’, the collective existence. The underlying idea is development of individuals and their personalities, while scope of thinking must expand and cover “society” as well as “the whole universe”. The overall theme is unity with world vision. (May 2018) He stated, “World has experienced the message of ‘Yoga for Unity and Harmonious Society’ in past years.”

Aware that unity of the country is threatened by menace of terrorism, PM Modi talked (November 2017) of it as a global threat and said India gave the message of love and non-violence to the world. His advice for Armed Forces Flag Day was to invite people from forces to schools and colleges “to share information about the forces” so that new generation gets an opportunity “to be aware of armed forces.”

Solemnly remembering Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, PM Modi said (October 2018), “…if we are able to see a United India” it was totally because “of the statesmanship and acumen of Sardar Patel”. He further said that on 31st October, 2018, “We shall dedicate the Statue of Unity (the world’s tallest skyscraping statue) to the nation as a true homage to Sardar Patel. (October 2019) “Run for Unity symbolises that nation is one.”

Such integrative thoughts indeed produce invigorating impact on the psyche of people.

Fifth, it aims at inculcating creativity and expanding personality. He spoke (May 2016) about role of satisfaction in life. “There is an environment to find dissatisfaction in everything that has happened. This is another form of negativity… But if you are not satisfied with what you have got, you will never be able to do new things.” (May 2015) He told people when they travel, they should record things: seen and heard and share their travelling experiences with him. “I will share your experiences with others.” (March 2016) Talking of creative urge, he requested people to upload the photographs of places visited. “But this time, please write and send a small piece about the place displaying your creative prowess.” Things we cannot learn in classroom, or from family and friends, we learn these “from travel.” Holidays to be utilised for adding one more attribute and skill to personality. “If you don’t know swimming, resolve to learn it, cycling, resolve to learn… There are so many skills for personality development. Why not add to our strength?” (April 2017). Talking of benefits of travel in a second class unreserved compartment for 24 hours, PM Modi said “You will learn more in this 24-hour journey than a year’s study.” Such experiences teach tolerance, add skills and enrich personality. He invited (July 2019) young students to participate in quiz competition relating to space, India’s space mission and matters relating to science and technology. “Students with maximum scores from each State will be invited to visit Sriharikota with expenses borne by Government.” It’s an amazing way to enhance creativity in children. PM Modi talked (July 2019) about sharing of some facets of books read by people through the Narendra Modi App. (June 2017), he told about a programme run by PN Panicker Foundation in Kerala, encouraging people to organise celebrations like “Reading Day” and “Reading Months”. He talked of gifting books or khadi handkerchiefs rather than bouquets. “Earlier (October 2014) people were encouraged to buy Khadi, I don’t tell you to use only Khadi products. I am insisting you to use at least one khadi product: a handkerchief, a bath towel, a bed sheet, a pillow cover, a curtain…..because when you buy a Khadi product, it helps poor people light lamps in Diwali.”

Sixth, it’s about innovations and innovative thinking. (July 2016) Saying, “The future is technology driven and technology is fickle”, PM Modi talked of “Atal Innovation Mission”, to create an ecosystem in the country to forge “a chain of innovation, experiment and entrepreneurship; generating new employment opportunities.” For developing the next generation innovators, children must be linked with it. “That is why the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs”. Schools having these labs would get Rs 10 lakh and further Rs 10 lakh for maintenance over a period of five years. (April 2016) Meeting of Prime Minster with chiefs of NCC, NSS, Bharat Scouts and Guides, Red Cross and Nehru Yuva Kendra where they informed that this was the first such meeting since independence which made the PM realise “huge need for greater coordination”. (March 2018) Involvement, in case of health sector, of all concerned Ministries rather than involvement of Health Ministry alone as was the conventional approach earlier. A harmonious synchronisation. (February 2018) He talked of importance of Artificial Intelligence for “improving the lives of underprivileged” and other uses like predicting disasters, providing assistance to farmers on crop yield, etc. (October 2018) Self4Society App. “A novel spirit of IT to society, from I to We is imbibed in this.’ (June 2019), He informed about creation of a new Ministry — Jal Shakti —for fast decisions on water related issues. For water conservation, he shared his experience of writing letters to Sarpanchs and Gram Pradhans. Consequently, people in villages resolved to accumulate every single drop of rainwater and got involved in competition for raising “water temple.” (February 2017) He talked of an innovation for poor fishermen. A simple mobile app but capable of providing guidance for direction to locate most productive fishing zones, wind conditions, tides, etc. Such information would help fisherman, “earn their livelihood in a better manner.”

(July 2019) PM Modi shared a comment by one Muhammad Aslam of Jammu & Kashmir who played an active role in organising community mobilisation programme — Back to Village in June where public directly entered into a dialogue with the Government. The PM said, “People of Kashmir are avid to join the national mainstream and their enthusiasm is reflected in the mechanism of this programme.” He added for the first time, senior officials reached the villages directly and were available to the villagers at their doorsteps, to “find the obstacles in the path of progress and to remove the hurdles”.

Last but not the least, it is about land of wonder, kindness and joy. PM Modi gave many examples. (September 2017) A retired teacher Shriman Chandrakant Kulkarni donating 51 post-dated cheques of Rs 5000, each for the cleanliness drive out of his monthly total pension of Rs 16,000. (July 2016) Shared his experience of meeting children who brought photo album to show pictures of beautification of Aligarh railway station. These children drew artistic paintings on the station. They collected “plastic bottles and oil cans lying in the garbage in the villages”, and filled those with soil and planting saplings and thus “transformed those pots into a vertical garden”. “This is a prime example of huge transformation.” (December 2015) He shared a news story about Dileep Singh Malviya, a mason by profession, from Bhojpura village in Sehore district who when provided with material, renders his labour free of cost for constructing toilets and he had constructed 100 toilets. “This is the hope of the nation and these are the things which carry the nation forward.” (October 2015) Efforts of girls of Saint Mary Upper-Primary School, Chittoor, Kerala for public awareness about organ donation. “Organ donation is a habit and an instinct.” (May 2018) About D Prakash Rao, a tea vendor from Cuttack who opened a school “Asha Ashvaasan” for more than 70 children living in slums and hutments providing them from his meagre income “education, health and meals”. (October 2019) About “A 92-year old woman offering free drinking water to passengers at Gwalior railway Station.”

Umpteen number of such examples fill us with positivity telling us so much of the country around is kind, wondrous, and beautiful.

To round off, the most rejuvenating thread emerging off and on in “Mann Ki Baat” is a firm belief that temporary setbacks must never be allowed to deceive clear eyes as the ruckus disheveling the serenity of our existence is set at rest through tranquility of our faith and karma. With “collective thoughts” forming the warp and woof of “Mann Ki Baat”, it has come to represent an unprecedented oneness between the PM and the people of the country and vice versa. Decades later when subsequent generations would look back at “Mann Ki Baat”, they will be reminded of Rabindranath Tagore’s lines in GITANJALI, “When…new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders’. We, the people, welcome A NEW INDIA.

86,16-2-20,C’garh starts special online classes in govt-run schools,"Chhattisgarh school education department have come up with an innovative online study project, wherein an expert teacher provide assistance through online video. The move aims to tackle the shortage of specific subject teachers in government-run schools.

Then live question-answer session with students is carried out to resolve doubts, backed by homework.

The pilot project has been launched since February 10 in 12 government schools for students of class 9th to 12th. As per department, this scheme will be further expanded to around 1000 schools across the state.

Elaborating on the project, school education department officials said expert goes online at 12.00 noon. The subject related session is carried out through video lecture of 20 minutes. After which doubts of students are addressed real time with the expert teacher answering queries of the students. To evaluate how much a student had grasped the subject, through App, two-way communication through conferencing is done. Students are also asked to submit home-work online.

Officials further said in selected schools only through wifi connectivity, LCD projector, laptop or mobile is connected and then the session is taken. Thus, students can carry out two-way communication with subject experts and get their doubts cleared.

State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT), Chhattisgarh and National Informatics Centre (NIC), Nava Raipur, have developed the studio where the vedio shoot of the subject expert is done. It is then reviewed and then uploaded on YouTube Channel, DEL Chhattisgarh for students.

The pilot project has been started at Champa, Kharora, Bemetara, Sail, Khomakhan, Balod, Mungeli, Khauna, Sankara, Navapara (two schools), and Barna. Each school has a coordinator who acts as a link between students and experts along with providing technical assistance for the online class.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/c---garh-starts-special-online-classes-in-govt-run-schools.html
87,16-2-20,Malaria-Free Bastar drive screens 1.56 lakh people,"In first phase of Malaria-Free Bastar drive, in Narayanpur district a total of 10559 positive cases of malaria have been detected after 1.56 lakh people underwent malaria test.

The health team faced geographical barriers of hills, rivers, rivulets and reached inaccessible areas on foot through forest areas covering several kilometres to reach villages, schools, ashrams, hostels and para-military camps to conduct the test.

The team conducted malaria tests in several such villagers where never such health camps were held. The drive which began on January 15 has covered around 1,56,546 people. 10559 women, men and children were found malaria positive out of which 236 cases of PV (Plasmodium vivax), 10147 of Pf (Plasmodium falciparum) and 176 were of mixed cases were detected. Similarly, 152 pregnant women were also found malaria positive.

Narayanpur Collector P.S. Elma appreciating efforts of health team said, malaria is key reason to malnutrition problem in Bastar area as after the onslaught of the disease people become anemic. Through the drive there is a hope to eliminate anemia, malnutrition, child and maternal mortality rates, he added.

Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr Anandram Gota said villagers are also being explained by the health team on how to prevent malaria by taking preventive steps. Villagers are being motivated to use mosquito-net. Market places are being used to create awareness through video films and folk arts.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/malaria-free-bastar-drive-screens-1-56-lakh-people.html

90,16-2-20,Sustainability goals 2020,"Sustainability and SDGs are not only for the national policies to reflect, it is a combined responsibility for all of us, writes Somnath Debnath, as he lists out the tasks before us

Sustainability or sustainable development, used interchangeably at times, is a much abused phrase today as much as the need of the hour. Although sustainable development as a way of life resonates with everyone, and should be a desired state of our existence, its enactment in any form is hardly a force at present to shape economic, regional or national policies, let alone the fabric of our daily lives. However, few exceptions are shining examples that include efforts of countries like Germany and the Netherlands who have taken a radical view towards implementing it at national level and ensuring progress of their countries in the right directions.

Globally, nations have committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (or SDGs in short) set by United Nations in 2015 to be achieved by 2030, ratified through UN resolution 70/1, it has hardly influenced national priorities in the recent past. Most of the countries are consistently pursuing current model of development (business-as-usual) to improve the lives of their citizenry. Whether that has improved the situation in general, is a debated topic. Data shows deteriorating environmental and social divergences and trends. From long rainy season in India, heat wave in Europe and snow in Mexico, unpredictable weather patterns in 2018-19 and environmental uncertainties are becoming a norm now.

Similarly widened income gaps and development patterns between the first and third world countries and social challenges like genocide, human trafficking, war, religious fanaticism, loss of natural resources and biodiversity, poverty and hunger have remained a persisting challenge. Political commitments of sovereign governments have swung to appease the popular views and public sentiments, but we fail to recognise that at the end it would be us — humans, the life sustaining capacity of Mother Earth, and our future — which would be paying the price for our common ignorance.

Contemporary development agendas of governments do not concern us individually and remained a national choice, left to the elected representatives, while we believed that the impacts of our collective choices can be considered in isolation. Challenges like participating in globalisation, trade barriers, inflow of migrants or refugees, participating in regional wars and other crises shaped our views through news headlines and public debates.

In contrast, sustainability and SDGs are not only for the national policies to reflect, it is a combined responsibility for all of us. Sustainability, at its core, changes our worldview towards appreciating the interconnectedness of our choices and encourages us to be holistic in our approach. This is something we — the human societies — are learning for the first time where the impacts of our actions and decision go beyond the walls of our isolated existence and permeate the very fabric of life and shape our existence. This is challenging even for the western theories and ideologies to connect to, considering the tradition of atomism and deductive reasoning (a part representing the whole) that has been central to it.

On the contrary, eastern wisdom has practiced the art and philosophy of caring, sharing and nurturing all life-forms for long, including the non-living world, but has less to offer in this regard. The onslaught of industrialisation and materialistic well-being could be the reason for this debacle that overshadowed the wisdom of eastern philosophies as well, more in favour of pragmatism, ensuring current form of development as the only one to pursue, even when the toxicity in its current form has been profound, to leave social and environmental externalities for us to pay, now or in future. Surprisingly, nomads and aboriginals for centuries have lived in harmony with nature and supported sustenance, without the sophisticated knowledge that modern societies and economies have claimed to be essential to become civilised, yet it is the latter that has led to the precarious situation that we are in today.

SDGs sensitise us to strive for pursuing national policies to target for a societal footprint that is less challenging and more inclusive. It has overall 17 goals, first six of which target eradicating social evils like poverty and hunger, promote health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, and clean water and sanitation facilities. Goals seven through twelve relates to economic challenges that the prevailing economic and industrial mindset and encourages countries to work towards providing clean and affordable energy, decent work and economic growth, industry and infrastructure improvements, reducing social inequalities, promoting sustainable cities, and responsible production and consumption.

Next set of four goals relate to environmental activism that encourages nations to move towards climate action, improve marine life, bio- and eco-diversity, and promote eco-justice. The last one is the international cooperation needed to promote policies and measures supporting sustainable development. Having said that, we would agree that grouping these goals in labeled buckets would be incorrect, as by nature these goals are sprawling, cutting across domains and generic in nature. In addition, interdependency across the goals cannot be avoided. So, instead of debating the hierarchy of order in which these can be addressed, urgency of the situation warrants that we can start anywhere.

We start with the education (SDG 4), Quality education is not always about developing Institutes of higher learning like IITs, IIMs, or Universities; it is enabling an ecosystem that is accessible to everyone (60 million Indians are deprived of access, according to RTE forum) and supports students and learners to pursue learning path of their own choice. Moreover, our challenge is not only that of skill mismatch (nearly 6 million people as of 2019 enrolled and awaiting for skill upgrade under Skill India mission), it also reflects on a factory production of largely outdated skills that the education system is churning out and challenging the industry and its limited resources. I believe, our mindset towards education needs to move from numbers (like highest pay package received by a student, number of engineers or doctors, number of grade A+ universities) to skill augmentation (like new innovations and patents, research potential of students, new areas of learning) and potential future capacity (number of start-ups, industrial patents, business plans or new seed capital received). This also means enabling a reward system that does not place a premium on one form of learning over others, and promote “meritocracy, with heart”.

In terms of primary and secondary education system should not be viewed by allocation of funds in national budget (which is anyway lower than suggested 6% of GDP by Niti Aayog), but as an investment towards building an ecosystem that scales and contributes to other SDGs, like alleviating social discrimination by bringing children of all social strata together. Such a system would allow children to learn from each other and appreciate diversity, and pursue a field of study of their own choice. Establishing a school system that is founded on the principles of building social equity and impartial learning would require us to change our model of schooling from the presently outdated Macaulay system to the one that has best elements of modern thinking as well as those of Indian traditions and wisdom. Here the role of teachers needs to be redefined as well. For example, teachers can be drafted into the system from other jobs and professions. One idea could be to reserve the teaching jobs primarily for experienced and senior citizens and fill the gap of 45% of shortfall of teachers as reported in 2018-19. This will help students benefit from the vast experiences of their teachers, and teachers can have a life filled with the love of their students. This could also lower the cost of education, where learning can be more fun-filled and quality intensive, and wisdom of life would get a chance to shape the heroics of youth.

Quality education and learning is directly related to the goal of establishing gender equality (SDG 5), which is a challenge for India and if we follow the social practices that shows considerable gap from our belief systems. Niti Aayog dashboard shows this in red zone with composite score of 42. Now, specific redressal for the challenge through government machinery would be limited to legal remediation, whereas working to improve social customs and practices would be with society. Data points to the skewed social practices with nearly half of the population remaining marginalised. For example, sex ratio in 2019 averaged at 896 (female per ‘000 males) pan India, males earning 25% higher than females, staggering 33% of married women aged 15-49 experiencing spousal violence at least once, 60% crimes against girl children as against all children, 18% female labour participation rate, only 14% owning operations and holding.

While crime against women and children should be dealt with iron hands, laxity in our law and order system also reflects the bias that half of the population is facing. This would not only need women to come forward and fight for their own rights, those in power and influencing positions whether in homes, offices, institutions, and establishments need to cultivate the mindset and practices to improve understanding and sensitivity towards gender equality. Similarly, educational institutions like schools and colleges can address this through innovative ideas like removing gender specific dress codes, promoting gender-neutral attires, and delink subject choices with gender preferences. However, it is a long way from home as it stands today.

Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) is another goal that requires infrastructure development as well as changes in our attitude. Over the past ten years, allocation of funds by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has seen an annual average increase of 9%, whereas budgetary allocation to rural programmes has seen shifts like Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin that has half of the cumulative sanction funds still to be released as on Oct 2019. Change in mindset and governmental actions on open defecation has led to around 80% of households having a toilet, 37% of households in rural areas are using improved sanitation facility, and 72% of 5,93,731villages have been verified as open defecation free.

Niti Aayog dashboard for this SDG shows a score of 88 (on all India basis) and considered as green. Statistics is one side of the story; equitability is the challenge here. One of the learning that can be transferred from the developed countries is to offload the sanitation facility to the restaurants, eating joints, malls, shopping complexes, businesses that serve any kind of food, or to promote more shared markets which would improve the facility outreach forcing its upkeep as well, which today is dependent on the puny public support and local administration. So far as drinking water is concerned, a few points merit attention.

For example, infrastructural arrangements are needed to handle gray water, recycling mechanisms, and forcing the industries to reduce dependency of fresh water. Similarly, controlled discharge of untreated water and ground water recharging should be mandated and practiced. Dwellings in cities should be enforced for mandatory rain water harvesting, recycling water, and using gray water. While our government has worked to bring Ganges river to normalcy, this should immediately be taken up for all rivers and improve their water quality. Similarly, connected reservoir system that was once a pronounced method to connect different rivers and exhausted due to commercial exploitation, should be reversed and revitalised.

Sustainability goals 2020

Last, but not the least, is the goal of good health and well-being (SDG 3) which is shows in yellow in Niti Aayog dashboard and a composite score of 61. With child mortality rate of 50 (under 5 years of age per ‘000 of population) and nearly 40% of children below 5 year of age remaining outside the immunisation, our efforts in this direction is not yet enough. Amongst adults nearly half of the married ladies do not use any form of contraceptives, whereas outreach of caregivers are tiny (38 physicians, nurses, and midwives available per 10,000 of population). This is not to say that the only effective resolution in improving the healthcare systems and infrastructure is to build more, we need to work towards a system that is agile and corresponds to the challenges that our society is facing, For healthcare to be more approachable and available, and not constrained by the lack of qualified doctors, we can develop the system of primary care givers can be networked to provide initial diagnosis and immediate help to patients. They can be trained and drafted from the area in which they reside and can provide these services.

Use of technology for the outreach is another perspective that is yet to be explored. The idea being promoted here is that the role of primary care giver should decouple from the need of having experts on every single occasion. At the same time, the responsibility of improving the fitness and health depends on us as well and can be guided through changing lifestyles practices and by following simple practices. A daily dose of yoga, routine exercise, walking, jogging or running, drinking ample water etc., can help us fight common illness. Building a healthy nation on the principles of inclusivity would need the medicine practices to be separated from greed and money. Alternate schools of medicine like Ayurveda or Unani schools of medicine can join the movement with the prevalent forms of modern medicine. In terms of hospitals and care centers, development agenda can include policy initiatives like PPP, BOLT, BOT or other operating vehicles to channelise investments.

What would the role of an individual to improve the situation? Sustainability challenges have mostly been confined at mega levels — at the United Nations, at national policy levels, or how multinational corporations conduct their businesses, at a scale that we believe is beyond our personal lives. However, sustainability is everybody’s business; it impacts all of us, and depends on the actions and choices that we all make as individuals, as groups, and as societies. This would need us to appreciate that the system of life and sustenance that has evolved over many millennia has been challenged by pursing materialistic well-being and industrial ecosystem. In Indian context, for example, our choice of vegetarianism has been proved to reduce carbon emission per gram of food produced and consumed. So our choices can effectively shape societal choices.

Similarly, we can decide to behave respectfully towards fellow human beings irrespective of caste, color, creed, physical appearance, or social strata and contributing towards the SDG 10 (reducing inequalities). If we practice energy conservation in all possible forms, we would be contributing to SDG 7 that relates to energy. If we decide not to waste any food, while at work and home, serve or order food what we can eat, not only we would save food, we can donate remaining untouched to food banks, enabling the less fortunate ones to have one meal per day, and contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger). Similarly, if we practice gender equality, encourage others and promote gender equality, we would be contributing to SDG 5 (gender equality). While these contributions and small behavioral changes could be seen as negligible, in reality they have an accumulated effect as “if many small people in many small places change in a small way, the face of the earth changes”, an African proverb says.

91,16-2-20,Ways to Staying Healthy,"Lifestyle plays a big role in our health. Research shows that meditation and vegetarian diet are two proactive ways of increasing our wellness, says Sant Rajinder Singh

Each of us has the power within us to create a healthier way of life. The choices we make today impact our physical, mental, and spiritual health tomorrow, whether months or years from now. Our choices also impact our family. What we choose today regarding the care of our body, mind, and spirit will determine what our future health will be.

Medical research points at two ways by which we can increase our wellness. One is meditation and the other is a vegetarian diet. Meditation helps us increase our health and well-being physically, mentally, and spiritually. It keeps our body and mind calm and reduces our chances of contracting stress-related illnesses.

Research by medical practitioners and doctors indicates that meditation benefits the body and mind. As someone put it in jest: “we can counter the effects of ill, pill, and bill by being still”. Being still refers to sitting in meditation. This increased interest and popularity of meditation has grown as scientific studies verify what has been known in the East for centuries.

Let’s reflect a little on the two simple steps to staying healthy:

Step 1: Meditation

Be still. Our parents had this one solution for us when we were children. These words really are a precursor for a healthy lifestyle. Being still is another word for meditation.

When we meditate, we slow our heart rate and breathing to a point where we are calm. When we are agitated and upset, the body produces fight or flight hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline which may be useful when in danger to help us defend ourselves or run, but not when simple problems of life upset us. We do not need cortisol and adrenaline to kick in when our spouse or children leave the toothpaste cap off or someone cuts us off on the highway. We have been so conditioned to becoming upset about things that are not life-threatening that we produce stress hormones that react on our body in a way that can break down our organs and bodily systems.

Meditation helps us be calm, and in a relaxed state so that we can ward off the effects of daily life challenges. When we are calm, our body is not producing hormones that can lead to stress-related ailments such as heart attack, stroke, hypertension, headaches, digestive and skin problems. When we meditate we also keep our mind calm. We not only suffer physical illness from stress, but we create emotional and mental difficulties when we are not calm. This can lead to emotional and relationship problems or other stress-related mental disorders. Through meditation we can keep a calm and peaceful mind to help us lead happier lives.

Meditation also helps us develop concentration. When we are stressed out our performance level is not as high as we need it to be. When we concentrate we can get better grades, which reduces our stress as students. Our stress as employees or professionals is reduced because we can perform better at work.

How can we prove the spiritual benefits of being still and meditating? This is one area where meditation fits the scientific model. It is based on experimentation leading to proof. Those who have tried the experiment have discovered that meditation leads to wellness not only of the body and mind, but of the soul.

In meditation, we close our eyes, gaze within, and still our mind of thoughts. When the reflecting pool of our mind is still, we see what lies within us. We see Light within, hear celestial Music, and can soar to regions of Light. Through meditation, we thus achieve physical, mental, and spiritual wellness.

Step 2: Vegetarian Diet

Another key to a healthy lifestyle is living on a vegetarian diet. Research proves that a plant-based diet reduces the risk of many diseases such as stroke, heart attack, diabetes, digestive disorders, and even some cancers, among other illnesses. By cutting out meat, and even fish, fowl, and eggs we can reduce the risk of many ailments.

Vegetarianism also benefits our state of mind and spiritual well-being. Think of the state of the animals when slaughtered. Hormones of fear and stress run through them at the time of their captivity and slaughter. It has been said that we are what we eat. All that was a part of the animal becomes part of us when we eat it. This means we are ingesting their fear and panic hormones, which can contribute to our own state of fear and anxiety when it becomes a part of our body.

We also are taking into our body anything the animal ate. For example, antibiotics fed to the animal become part of us, and if we have too much it can cause bacteria to become antibiotic-resistant. If animals are fed hormones to make them grow faster, they too become a part of us which can lead to problems because now those hormones are in our body. We also are taking into our body any diseases that the animal may have contracted.

There are moral benefits to a vegetarian diet. Most cultures believe in the law that “thou shalt not kill.” There is a recognition in many cultures that even animals have a soul in them. Thus, when we take the life of a creature, we are taking the life of a being who has a soul in it. Those who ascribe to a spiritual way of life and meditate have even witnessed that the same Light of the Divine in us also shines in all other human beings and all creatures. Thus, a thread of divine connection knits all life together.

Today, there are numerous delicious and nutritious vegetarian, plant-based foods that we can eat. Besides a growing number of vegetarian restaurants, most restaurants now offer a wider variety of vegetarian dishes. Mainstream supermarkets have many vegetarian options for customers. Even places where it was hard to get vegetarian foods, such as school cafeterias, hospitals, cruise ships, conferences, and venues for professional gatherings, offer vegetarian choices.

It is now easier than ever to be vegetarian and the benefits are enormous. One can try the experiment of incorporating meditation and vegetarian diet into one’s life. You can see for yourself the benefits you will experience. If you track the changes these two choices bring, you will find that you are healthier — physically, mentally, and spiritually. May each of you make choices to experience the benefits of a healthy lifestyle for your body, mind, and soul.

92,16-2-20,Be your own well-wisher,"Once you do what the Lord expects you to do, and keep faith in Him, you will derive unimaginable benefits, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

There is mounting evidence that if you care to dig deep in your own personality, you will find that you are not really your own well wisher. I realised so myself. Yes, I am improving but this started only after I took shelter in God, who really is everyone’s well-wisher. What can possibly explain our getting in trouble, unknowingly? What explains disliking your life partner for small faults that the person has? Is anyone faultless for that matter? A few faults cannot disqualify anyone. If it was so, everyone without exception will be rejected.

It was upon this realisation that I started to become my well-wisher; I took shelter of God — the best and the ultimate well-wisher of one and all. This is the cosmic design. As you practice, you will agree that once you do what the Lord expects us to do, one will derive unimaginable benefits.

I realised that we, souls, are small. Whatever power or strength we may have is only temporarily with us. Take physical strength, for instance. We feel quite strong in our youth; we can do a lot of things, achieve many feats. But as we age, we are forced to slow down. Likewise, everything material with us is also temporary. It is taken away at some point, surely at death.

Having realised that I felt helplessly small. I turned to God, who is the source of everything opulent, effulgent or even energetic. (Bhagavad Gita 10.41) Now I depend on Him for whatever I need, like ‘atmabala’ — the strength of the soul... And He obliges, especially when I do my part, that is, do the requisite duties like spiritual practices. My Lord guides me on what my duties are at a particular moment. Don’t we frequently get confused about our duties? For example, when we go to attend a social function, our duty is to mingle with people, be nice to them, and so on. Instead, we indulge our senses; mostly the tongue, the eyes, the ears and even our mouths.

This is a small example. As a human being, we are supposed to cooperate with others. This is the cosmic design. Not being our own well-wishers, we tend to become selfish. As a result, we become very lonely. Not only are we supposed to cooperate with one another, but we are expected to make sacrifices for the others. One of the prime examples is a mother’s sacrifice for her child. Bhagavad Gita is full of instructions about various types of sacrifices. That, because God is our best well-wisher.

Now we come to our behaviour. We need guidance in this matter. (Bhagavad Gita 16.24) Whimsical behaviour gets us in trouble. Therefore, we need to be in constant touch with God, who is omniscient. He alone can see the big picture. For example, people argue endlessly about some future event; God knows. Why not seek His guidance; He is prepared to show us the way. We have not been left in the dark.

Turning to emotions, what emotions are natural to us? Lust, greed, anger, hate, ego etc. come to the mind readily. As a result,we come under the influence of the mode of darkness. (Bhagavad Gita 14.13) Our outlook becomes negative. We are easily depressed. Anxiety and fears are common to us. The opposite will happen if we seek shelter of God. He will guide us to embrace the mode of goodness (Bhagavad Gita 14.6), with its enormous benefits. Lastly, we will not lack anything. (Bhagavad Gita 18.75) The Lord provides all kinds of resources, various strengths like atmabala, mental strength, emotional strength and strength to tolerate. He also blesses us with peace, happiness, security, support and help, whenever needed. When we are well and truly dependent upon Him, he manages our lives too. I am getting a taste of it.

93,16-2-20,Scindia-Nath split wide open,"Signs of strains within the Congress top leadership in Madhya Pradesh came out in public yet again with Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Saturday daring senior party leader Jyotiraditya Scindia to hit the streets to live up to his threat in support of agitating guest teachers.

The Congress continues to remain a divided house in Madhya Pradesh with differences between Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia persisting and spilling out into the open.

""Toh utar jayein,"" was Nath's terse reply to media persons who asked him about Scindia's threat. Nath was in Delhi to attend the MP Coordination Committee meeting.

""The manifesto is for five years, right? It's not for five months,"" Nath told a news agency when asked about Scindia's remark.

Addressing a rally at Kudila village on Thursday, Scindia had said, ""The manifesto is our sacred text. Have patience. If all the promises are not fulfilled, do not think you all are alone. Jyotiraditya Scindia will also hit the streets along with you.""

Acrimony between Scindia and Nath has been continuing ever since the party high command preferred the latter for the Chief Minister's post after the Assembly polls in 2018. He also lost his parliamentary seat from Guna in the Lok Sabha elections last May.

On earlier occasions too, Scindia had hit out at the Nath dispensation on the issue of unfulfilled farm loan waiver promise.

The state government is seen to be struggling to fulfil its promise of farm loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh as Scindia , much to the discomfiture of the Nath-headed government, has also been commenting on the issue.

The State Government would need around Rs 50,000 crore to implement the waiver scheme, according to an official estimate.

Guest teachers are also on protest in the state demanding regularisation of services and better pay.

Opposition leaders as well as Scindia and his faction of Congress functionaries have been critical of the administration over a range of issues.

The sniping from both sides is underway as even elections to the state Congress president's post, which Scindia has been aspiring for , is yet to take place.

In the recent past,the scion of Royal family also did not abide by the Congress line of opposing Modi-Government on its act of nullifying Article 370 which protected special status to J & K. He had also welcomed Airforce strike at terror destinations at Balakot in Pakistan.

Former Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh sought to deny any rift in the Madhya Pradesh unit saying Nath is doing his best to fulfill all the manifesto promises.

""All Congress leaders are together. 'Vachan patra' (manifesto) is meant for five years and Kamal Nath is making all effort to fulfill the promises. All of us are together. Scindia is not against anybody,"" said Singh.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/scindia-nath-split-wide-open.html

95,16-2-20,Uddhav dares BJP to pull down MVA,"Rubbishing the talk about the Opposition launching the “Operation Lotus” in the State in April this year, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday dared the BJP to pull down the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government forthwith.

A day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar disapproved his decision to let the NIA take over the investigations into the 2018 Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parishad case, Uddhav shared the platform with Pawar at a joint Sena-NCP-Congress convention at Muktainagar in Jalgaon district of north Maharashtra and slammed the BJP for its talk about launching “Operation Lotus” to bring down the MVA Government.

“I get to hear that the BJP is launching Operation Lotus in April. But, Rs Operation Lotus’ will not serve any purpose. The people of Maharashtra have already shoved the BJP aside and they will do so once again. Our Government will complete its full five year term. If it has guts, why wait till April, it can pull down our government forthwith,” Uddhav said.

Tearing into the BJP, Uddhav said: “We (Sena, NCP and Congress) have come together with the common intention of bringing out development for common man. But, ever since we assumed office in the state, the BJP is constantly criticising us. The BJP leaders have been saying that ours is ruling alliance of three different ideologies, will not last long and they would return to power once in the state. But, the fact remains that we are united and ours is a strong government”.

Without naming senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse in whose home town of Muktainagar the joint Sena-NCP-Congress convention was held, Uddhav said: “Muktainagar has come mukt (free) today. You all know from whom the town has become free from”

Eknath has long been considered a satrap of Muktainagar. His stock has eroded markedly ever since the BJP denied him party ticket and instead fielded his daughter Rohini from Muktainagar to contest the recent State Assembly polls. However, Rohini suffered a humiliating defeat at the the hands of an independent candidate Chandrakant Nimba Patil.

“There is a farmer in both Pawar and Pawar. Farmer is focal point of our government. There are no differences among the constituents in the MVA government,” Uddhav said, while speaking at the Appasaheb Pawar Modern Agriculture Award function at Jalgaon’s Jain Hills locality. Speaking on the occasion, Pawar urged the state government and the Centre to come with a concrete scheme to ensure drinking water supply to all areas in Marathwada and north-Maharashtra where there was considerable shortage of water. “Efforts should be made to change the living conditions of farmers in the state. The Centre should extend its cooperation to the state to implement special schemes for farmers,” the NCP chief said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/uddhav-dares-bjp-to-pull-down-mva.html

He claimed that over 43,000 cases of atrocities were reported against Dalits in 2017 as per the NCRB data.

""Nearly 25 per cent of all such cases were reported to have occurred in BJP ruled state of Uttar Pradesh ... "" Tuki, said."" .

Hillary Clinton, Erdogan, Joko Widodo of Indonesia, Queen Rania of Jordan are other most followed celebrities on Twitter.

During his visit to India, Trump, in addition to New Delhi, will also visit Ahmedabad to address a joint public meeting with Modi at a newly-built stadium.

98,16-2-20,"Wary of Indian reach, Azhar asks ultras to shun allopathy","The chief of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad Maulana Masood Azhar has released a message to its top commanders to avoid allopathic treatment and instead rely on Unani medicines. Azhar, undergoing treatment for renal issues, apprehends allopathic doctors could be compromised by Indian agencies to eliminate him.

Azhar has masterminded a series of terror attacks against India including the Pathankot airbase attack and Pulwama suicide bombing.

In a message released on Wednesday, Azhar has claimed that Muslims are virtually being administered poison in the name of allopathic medicines. Unani medicines were most healthy which are being consumed from the times of the Prophet, Azhar exhorted his cohorts urging them to rely on the traditional form of medicine for treatment of various ailments.

The message indicates that the terror mastermind is apprehensive of the Indian agencies which he suspects were behind him to eliminate him without using any force or arms.

Sources said that the JeM boss is suspicious of even Pakistani military doctors for the continuing treatment of his failed renal surgery due to his apprehension that even the uniformed medical professionals could be susceptible to getting compromised by Indian agencies.

Earlier, reports had speculated that Indian agencies had sought to infiltrate Pakistani military medical corps to target Azhar following a series of attacks on defence installations in India including at Uri and Pathankot besides killing 40 CRPF personnel last year after an explosives-laden vehicle was rammed into a bus of a paramilitary convoy on February 14 last year at Pulwama.

The Pulwama attack propelled India to carry out an air raid at suicide bomber training facility of Jaish at Balakot.

The searches at four locations followed an FIR by the agency against the three accused — Rakesh Tiwari, Raj Kumar Gupta and Vipin Agrawal.

According to CBI, the accused had allegedly intended to take Rs 50-60 lakh from Sudhir Giri, the Chairman of the Meerut-based Venkateshwara Group of Institutions, on the pretext of helping him in a CBI case using purported links with the investigating officer.

Giri, along with former Odisha High Court judge IM Quddusi, is accused in a corruption case filed by the CBI. The searches were conducted at three locations in Delhi, including the Ashram Chowk and Kalkaji residences of Tiwari and Gupta respectively, and at the residence of Agrawal in Ghaziabad, they said.

It is alleged that Tiwari got in touch with Gupta and Agrawal claiming his contacts with the investigating officer of the CBI, following which they entered into a criminal conspiracy but could not succeed to collect money from Giri, they said.

The CBI had carried out a preliminary enquiry which revealed that in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy in order to gain trust and confidence of Gupta and Agrawal, Tiwari told them that CBI had 160 recorded telephonic conversations pertaining to the case against Giri.

He even told them some specific words used in the intercepted telephonic conversations, they said. Tiwari further told them that he could provide a copy of those recorded telephonic conversations, if Giri was interested in obtaining favours in the matter, they said.

100,16-2-20,TDP MP seeks PM’s intervention to stop move in ‘larger public interest’,"TDP Rajya Sabha MP Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s moves to have three State capitals and dissolve the Legislative Council “in the larger public interest”.

In a letter to Modi, Kumar said Reddy’s decision to have three capitals -- at Amaravati (legislative capitial), Visakhapatnam (executive capital) and Kurnool (judicial capital) -- would bring “undesirable consequences” in the country.

He alleged that the AP government was not allowing the Legislative Council chairman to discharge his constitutional functions and sought for formulation of a national policy on legislative councils.

“In view of the undesirable consequences for the country of the move for multiple capitals by the AP government and issues involved in the matter of dissolution of AP legislative council, I appeal to your good self to have the matters examined in detail and do the needful to prevent the same in the larger public interest,” the Rajya Sabha member said in his letter.

Kumar described Reddy’s move to have three capitals as “illogical and ill-considered” and said it would lead to serious implications. He also alleged that the chief minister and the AP government were “insensitive” to the series of silent and peaceful protests being held by the residents of Amaravati region for the past two months against the three-capital plan.

“The earlier State Government after detailed consideration has decided on Amaravati as the capital of the new State of Andhra Pradesh as per the powers conferred on the State Government to establish a new Capital under the provisions of AP State Re-organization Act 2014, which is a Central Act,” he said.

Kumar further described that farmers of the capital Region voluntarily offered 33,000 acres for the development of the capital which is a first of it’s kind In the country. “The Central Government released Rs.1500 crores for the purpose of construction of Amaravati Capital City and the said amount had already been invested for the said purpose. The State Government has been functioning from the Amaravati since 2015 to till date. Accordingly, there is no provision and justification for multiple capitals,” Kumar said.

Sharma, who is popularly known as VD, is a staunch follower of the RSS. He is credited with strengthening the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students' wing of the RSS, in Madhya Pradesh in 1990s.

Sharma, who was the national general secretary of the ABVP, had joined the BJP in 2013.

With Sharma's appointment, the BJP leadership has given yet another key post to a Brahmin leader in Madhya Pradesh after Gopal Bhargava, who is the Leader of Opposition in the state assembly

The post of Kerala BJP president had become vacant after its former chief Sreedharan Pillai was appointed as the Governor of Mizoram in October 2019.

K Surendran,50, a polarizing figure , was already widely tipped as one of the frontrunners for the post.

A native of Kozhikode district, Surendran's stature in the party and among the public rose as he became the aggressive face of Sabarimala protests that rocked the state, following the 2018 Supreme Court verdict which allowed women of all ages to enter the hilltop shrine.

Recently, he had reportedly said that anti-CAA protest in Kerala resembles the Malabar rebellion (armed uprising against British in 1921 in northern Kerala), and also purportedly maintained that a particular community will be attacked during the protests.

As for Sikkim, Chauhan, was appointed as the BJP's State unit president for a second consecutive term. Chauhan's tenure as the BJP's Sikkim unit president will be till 2023.

Chauhan said that he will soon announce the new state executive committee in consultation with the party's top brass.

The BJP emerged as a major political force in Sikkim during Chauhan's first term as the state unit chief, following the defection of 10 SDF MLAs to the party and win in two assembly bypolls.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nadda-appoints-sikkim--mp--kerala-s-bjp-unit-chiefs.html

CPI general secretary D Raja took up the matter of providing security to Kanhaiya Kumar in a letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Kanhaiya Kumar's cavalcade was attacked in Arrah on Friday by a mob opposing his state-wide tour against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), seriously damaging the vehicle in which he was travelling and leaving several people injured.

""The purpose of my writing to you is to draw your attention and seek your intervention to stop the attacks on our comrade Kanhaiya Kumar, who is member of the National Executive of our party and former president of JNUSUS,"" Raja said in a letter to the Bihar chief minister.

""You are aware of the situation in the country today. The BJP led government at the centre has plunged the whole country into a turmoil by passing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),"" he wrote.

Raja said ""it has become very clear by this time that CAA-NRC-NPR are to be understood as one entity"". He said the CAA is discriminatory against one particular minority community and it is violative of the basic tenet on citizenship of the country's Constitution.

107,16-2-20,"Centre, U'khand Govt trying to strike off reservation: Kharge","Claiming that the BJP’s opposition to the Dalits, tribals and people from the backward classes ran in its DNA, senior Congress leader Mallinkarjun Kharge said here on Saturday that the Uttarkhand Government and the Centre were trying to strike off the reservation given to the SC, ST and OBC by the Constitution.

“The BJP Government in Uttarakhand told the Supreme Court that the reservation in jobs for the ST and SC’s is not their fundamental right. And it’s not the responsibility of the Government to give these reservations in Government jobs.

And unfortunately the Supreme Court too has given a verdict saying that giving reservations in Government jobs is not mandatory for the Government,” Mallikarjun said in a statement issued here.

Maintaining that the stand by the Uttarakhand Government in the apex court was the first step towards ending reservation, Mallikarjun said: ”When we raised the issue of BJP's attempt to end the reservation in the Parliament, the Modi Government gave misguiding answers and skirted away from taking the responsibility”.

Alluding to a petition filed by the Uttarakhand Government filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Mukesh Kumar incident on November 19, 2019, Mallkarjun said: “On February 7, 2020 based on the tactful reply filed by the Uttarakhand government, the Supreme Court gave a reply that the reservations were not mandatory.

There is no question of any role of the previous Congress Government in Uttarakand in the issue and by giving false information in the Parliament they Minister tried to misguide us”.

Mallikarjun said that the Congress was standing firmly behind them and any attempt by the BJP will be aggressively opposed by the Congress party. “And for it the Congress party will go to any extent without thinking twice,” he said

“The Narendra Modi government has tried to end the SC, ST sub plan and for which funds have been reduced for the schemes for the Dalits, OBC's and Tribals. The Congress government in fact tried to allot funds to SC, ST sub plan based on the proportion of the population,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre--u-khand-govt-trying-to-strike-off-reservation--kharge.html
108,16-2-20,"Total transparency in project, architect chosen for job: Puri","Amid concerns raised by architects and activists over the Modi Government’s redevelopment plan for the Central Vista in the national Capital, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has sought to put the apprehensions to rest saying there has been ‘total transparency’ in the project and the architect chosen for the job had consulted multiple town planners and experts for it.

“There has been total transparency in the project. Bimal Patel had held a meeting with editors and town planner earlier, and after that many others, and every other town planner in town. Then there was a meeting with journalists later,” the minister said.

He was responding to queries from reporters on Friday over two petitions filed by activists in the Delhi High Court and concerns raised by many other heritage and architecture experts on the proposed revamp.

Puri said one of the concerns raised by a few people is that heritage buildings are going to be torn down. “We have shown exactly that every iconic heritage building will be exactly where it is,” the Union minister of Housing and Urban Affairs said.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs had won the consultancy bid for the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista. HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, based in Ahmedabad, is led by architect Bimal Patel and has developed several projects, including the Sabarmati Riverfront Development where Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently held a mammoth event to celebrate Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary.

Asked about other concerns raised by activists that the revamp project will “take away a lot of public space”, Puri said, “public space will in fact increase”.

The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) is likely to be shifted from its current location as part of the Modi government’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista -- the nation’s power corridor -- in Lutyens’ Delhi, sources had earlier said.

Asked about the IGNCA, he said, “A grander mega cultural centre will be built as part of the new project”.

It will be world-class infrastructure like Sydney Opera House and other such iconic buildings globally are, he said.

“So, for the Central Vista project, the amount of consultation we have done... Bimal Patel has met every conceivable town planner, architect. I have chaired meetings, the secretary has,” he said. So, that doesn’t mean “we are going to allow our project to be derailed,” he added. The revamp also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/total-transparency-in-project--architect-chosen-for-job--puri.html

116,16-2-20,"‘Don’t worry, India will settle it,’ Jaishankar to US Senator on Kashmir","External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday rebuffed a senior US Senator, in a firm repartee, that India will ‘settle’ the Kashmir issue on its own when the American lawmaker brought up the issue during an interaction at the Munich Security Conference.

And asking him to desist from interfering in India’s internal affairs and develop proper understanding of the facts, New Delhi criticised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for raking up the Kashmir issue during his address at the Pakistan Parliament.

In Munich, referring to the Kashmir issue during a panel discussion, Senator Lindsey Graham said the best way to sell democracy will be to settle the Kashmir issue in a democratic way.

“In India, you are moving forward, you got your problems like we do at home, but you’ve chosen the democratic path. When it comes to Kashmir, I don’t know how it ends, but let’s make sure that two democracies will end it differently. If you can prove that concept here, then I think that’s probably the best way to sell democracy,” the Republican leader said.

To this, Jaishankar promptly responded, “Do not worry, Senator. One democracy will settle it and you know which one.”

During the discussion Jaishankar also said that the United Nations is far less credible than it has been in history and ‘something’ should be done about it.

“The United Nations is far less credible than it has been in history, which is not entirely surprising because when you think about it, there are not too many things which are 75 years old and still as good as they were. Clearly there is something that needs to be done there.” The Munich Security Conference, being held from February 14-16, is the world’s leading forum for debate on international security policy.

In Delhi, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kaumar said India rejects all references made by the

Turkish President on Jammu & Kashmir, asserting that the Union Territory is an integral and inalienable part of India.

“We call upon the Turkish leadership to not interfere in India’s internal affairs and develop proper understanding of the facts, including the grave threat posed by terrorism emanating from Pakistan to India and the region,” Kumar said.

Erdogan had in September last year too raised the Kashmir issue during his address at the United Nations General Assembly.In his address at a joint session of Pakistan’s Parliament on Friday, Erdogan compared the “struggle” of Kashmiri people with that of the fight by

An accountability court here has already exempted the 69-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo from appearing before it in the money laundering case on medical grounds and adjourned the hearing till February 28.

""Nawaz Sharif's mother Shamim Bibi left for London to be with her son while he undergoes heart treatment,"" PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb tweeted on Saturday.

Aurangzeb said Bibi had been advised not to travel because of her age, 90, and illnesses but she expressed her wish to be present during her son's treatment.

On Saturday, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) officials raided businesses and properties of the Sharif family in search of evidence related to the money laundering charges.

The accountability bureau has accused Sharif of being a direct beneficiary of Chaudhry Sugar Mills and his daughter, Maryam, who was arrested in connection with the case in August along with her cousin Yousuf Abbas, of holding over 12 million shares in the sugar mills.

The three-time premier is undergoing treatment in London for coronary artery disease. Sharif was on November 4 last year granted bail on humanitarian grounds by the Lahore High Court in the case.

127,16-2-20,Trump's USD 1.5 billion uranium bailout triggers rush of mining plans,"President Donald Trump's USD 1.5 billion proposal to prop up the country's nuclear fuel industry has emboldened at least one company to take steps toward boosting operations at dormant uranium mines around the West, including outside Grand Canyon National Park.

The company, Canada-based Energy Fuels Inc., announced a stock sale late Thursday and said it would use the proceeds for its uranium mining operations in the U.S. West.

The Trump administration asked Congress this week for $1.5 billion over 10 years to create a new national stockpile of U.S.-mined uranium, saying that propping up U.S. Uranium production in the face of cheaper imports is a matter of vital energy security.

Approval is far from certain in a highly partisan Congress.

Some Democratic lawmakers, and market analysts across the political spectrum, charge that the Trump administration's overall aim is really about helping a few uranium companies that can't compete in the global market, and their investors.

Demand for the nuclear fuel has languished worldwide since Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster. U.S. Uranium production has plummeted 96% in the last five years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday.

Energy Fuels Inc., a Toronto-based corporation that is the leading uranium mining company in the U.S., announced it was selling stock and putting the nearly $17 million in proceeds into its mining operations in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, Texas and elsewhere in response to Trump's 2021 budget. Company spokesman Curtis Moore said Friday that could mean opening a mine about 15 miles from the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance.

128,16-2-20,Trump's India visit will be delightful: Experts,"President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to India will be a ""delightful spectacle"" and ""utterly successful"" by many measures, eminent American experts on South Asia issues have said.

Trump along with the First Lady are scheduled to visit Ahmedabad and New Delhi on February 24 and 25, according to a White House announcement early this week.

This would be president's first bilateral visit in the third decade of 21st century and also the first after his acquittal by the Senate in the impeachment trial.

""I think the Trump visit will be a delightful spectacle and utterly successful by many measures,"" Ashley Tellis, who is Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told PTI.

Trump is expected to get a roaring welcome by lakhs of people when he arrives in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

He along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to deliver a historic speech in front of hundreds and thousands of people at the newly build Motera stadium, the largest cricket stadium of the world. One of the most prominent experts on India, Tellis, however, noted

that at the moment, he was unsure whether the trade disputes between the two countries will be resolved.

Senior government officials are tight lipped on this issue, except for making comments in recent past that the two countries are on the verge of a trade package or a mini trade deal.

""Although the GOI (Government of India) has claimed that both sides are close to a deal, I don't think there has been real progress — certainly none that will satisfy USTR (US Trade Representatives). We might get some progress on defense sales, but that's uncertain too,"" Tellis noted.

""Still, both the countries have done well where defense cooperation is concerned under the Trump administration, which is more than can be said for many other US relationships with its allies. I expect this will further deepen in the years ahead,"" he said in response to a question.

""Even if the visit then produces only good optics, I'll take it all the same if it strengthens Trump's perceptions of India as a friend. Given his mercurial personality and policies, that is not a small achievement — and I think PM Modi understands that well,"" Tellis said.

Rick Rossow, Wadhwani Chair in US India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, hoped that the two leaders can finalise an agreement to remove some of the recent trade irritants.

""My own view is that India keeps digging a deeper hole in triggering trade tensions--notably through steep customs hikes in its February 1 Union Budget. So, a short-term deal may simply be a reprieve in our trade fight,"" Rossow told PTI.

Observing that Trump will be the fourth consecutive president to travel to India, and the second consecutive president to visit India in his first term in office, Rossow was of the view that a visit to India is no longer a significant event.

""India is a large and growing market for exports and an emerging security partner for the United States... Particularly important as we consider options to further draw down our forces in Afghanistan and seek a network of burden-sharing in areas where China's rise poses a threat. India will be important on both counts,"" Rossow told PTI.

According to Anish Goel, Senior Fellow at New America and former senior White House official, Trump's upcoming visit is consistent with long-standing policy in both countries to continue strengthening and cementing the bilateral relationship.

""The visit will be a political boon for both the President (Trump) and the Prime Minister (Modi). India is one of the few countries where the President is quite popular. So he can expect a massive turnout for his rally in Ahmedabad.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-s-india-visit-will-be-delightful--experts.html
129,16-2-20,France confirms 1st death outside Asia,"An 80-year-old Chinese tourist has died from the new coronavirus in France, the first death confirmed outside of Asia, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on Saturday.

Buzyn said she had been told about the death of the patient - in hospital in Paris since late January - late on Friday, adding that his condition ""had deteriorated rapidly"" after several days in a critical condition.

Six people with the virus remain in hospital in France, Buzyn said, adding that none were seriously ill.

One of them was the dead Chinese tourist's 50-year-old daughter and the rest were British nationals who were infected by a compatriot at a French ski resort.

The virus originated late last year in China, where it has since infected more than 66,000 people and killed more than 1,500.

Three deaths from the virus have so far been recorded outside mainland China - in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.

The scale of the epidemic ballooned this week after officials in the Chinese province of Hubei - the epicentre of the outbreak- changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to the tally.

Some 56 million people in Hubei and its capital Wuhan are now living under quarantine, virtually sealed off from the rest of the country in an effort to contain the virus.

Away from China, almost 600 cases have been confirmed - roughly 35 of which have been reported in the European Union.

The most concentrated number of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese coast, which is holding at least 285 people with the virus among its 3,700 crew and passengers.

The US embassy has said it will fly roughly 400 Americans on board the ship back their home country and Buzyn said France was ""always ready to repatriate its nationals"", though she made no firm commitment.

There are believed to be four French nationals on the Diamond Princess, where all those on board are mostly confined to their cabins and required to wear masks and keep away from others during brief outings on deck.

""We are following the international situation very closely,"" Buzyn said.

""We need to prepare our health system to deal with a possible pandemic and therefore the circulation of the virus on national territory.""

She said she would take stock of the situation on Tuesday in a meeting with health experts and officials.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/france-confirms-1st-death-outside-asia.html

World No 31 Lakshya dished out a clinical performance to notch up a sensational 21-18, 22-20 win over world No 7 Jonatan in the second singles to keep India in the hunt after B Sai Praneeth retired following a 6-21 thrashing by Anthony Ginting in the opening game of the first singles.

Doubles pair of M R Arjun and Dhruv Kapila then played their heart out before going down narrowly 10-21, 21-14, 21-23 to three-time world champions and second-ranked Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan as Indonesia made it 2-1.

2018 SaarLorLux Open champion Subhankar Dey then shocked world No 20 Shesar Hiren Rhustavito 21-17, 21-15 in the third singles as India once again drew level 2-2.

In the deciding second doubles, Chirag Shetty paired up with Lakshya but they were no match for the world No 1 combination of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, who took just 24 minutes to register a 21-6, 21-13 win and seal their place in the finals.

The chief of the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said it is in the “wait-and-watch mode” and the onus of ensuring telecom companies’ compliance with the Supreme Court order lies with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) under the government.

“If there is a negative impact on any enterprise, it impacts a larger ecosystem, whether it is banks, whether it is employees, whether they are vendors, consumers, so everybody gets impacted. So, that impact, when it comes, we will have to pay the price,” Kumar said, when asked about the impact on banks if telcos move towards bankruptcy.

He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the unveiling of artworks namely ‘Manasvi’ and ‘Tapasvi’ at the Local Head Office (LHO) here. Around 400 computers, more than 2,000 microchips, over 400 keyboards and above 200 discarded credit cards were used to create the two artworks.

132,16-2-20,Telecom dept mulls penal action against telcos,"The telecom department is mulling penal action against telecom operators for failing to pay in time the adjusted gross revenue dues as directed by the Supreme Court, according to an official source.

With Saturday being a holiday in various offices, the Department of Telecom is likely to wait till Monday evening for the payment before sending out the next set of notices with updated penalty and other punitive action as per the licence norms, the source told PTI.

“The DoT has sent five notices to telecom operators with reminders and penalty provisions on October 31, November 13, December 2, January 20 and now on February 14. Telecom operators are bound to pay as per the SC order and the department never gave them any extension. Now, telecom operators are saying they will pay a sizable amount by Monday but action will be taken against them for every delay,” the official said.

The DoT had issued stringent order to telecom operators to pay by Friday midnight after facing the ire of the SC for no action taken by it to recover dues and passing an order to not take any coercive action against the defaulters. However, none of the companies made the payment on February 14.

The DoT source said the order was issued for internal processes to avoid any complication as the matter was sub-judice.

“DoT did not pass any order to telecom operators. Telecom operators filed a modification plea before (the) SC. The SC after admitting the plea and just before the last date of payment listed the matter for a later date,” the source said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/telecom-dept-mulls-penal-action-against-telcos.html
133,16-2-20,"IMG clears BPCL sale bid documents, to be issued after ministerial group nod","An inter-ministerial group has approved sale bid documents for privatisation of India's second biggest oil refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), and a notice seeking bids will be issued after a small group of ministers approves it, sources said.

An inter-ministerial group or IMG comprising representatives from the ministries of finance, petroleum, law, corporate affairs and department of disinvestment has approved Expression of Interest (EoI) and Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for the company.

This will now be put up for approval by 'Alternative Mechanism' which is essentially a very small grouping of key Cabinet ministers, sources privy to the development said.

Once the approval is granted, an EoI seeking interest from potential buyers will be floated, they said, adding the EoI along with PIM was likely to be out in the market within this month.

The government plans to sell its entire 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL that will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fifth of the fuel market share in the world's fastest-growing energy market.

Sources said a two-stage bidding process will be followed wherein request for proposal or RFP in the first stage will be followed by due diligence-cum-bidding by qualified bidders in the second phase.

BPCL has a market capitalisation of about Rs 1.03 lakh crore and the government stake at current prices is worth about Rs 54,000 crore. The successful bidder will also have to make an open offer to other shareholders for acquiring another 26 per cent at the same price.

Privatisation of BPCL is essential for meeting the record Rs 2.1 lakh crore target Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has set from disinvestment proceeds in the Budget for 2020-21.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants.

The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.

Sources said the disinvestment process being followed for privatisation of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) is based on decision-making through inter-ministerial consultations and involvement of professionals and experts.

After in-principle consent by the administrative ministry of the state-owned company concerned, approval of the proposal to disinvest is taken from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).

CCEA approved BPCL stake sale in November last year. Following this, an inter-ministerial group (IMG) was constituted. IMG appointed advisers for the transaction, including merchant bankers, asset valuers and legal advisers.

The 'Alternative Mechanism' approves reserve or base price as well as price bids. Sources said BPCL privatisation process may take six to eight months to complete.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/img-clears-bpcl-sale-bid-documents--to-be-issued-after-ministerial-group-nod-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/img-clears-bpcl-sale-bid-documents--to-be-issued-after-ministerial-group-nod.html

As per the depositories' data, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) pumped in a net sum of Rs 10,426 crore into equities and Rs 14,191 crore into the debt segment between February 3 and 14. This adds up to a total net investment of Rs 24,617 crore.

FPIs have been net buyers in the Indian markets since September 2019, the data showed.

""The recovery in the markets post-Budget has largely been supported by DIIs (domestic institutional investors),"" Ajit Mishra, vice-president (research) at Religare Broking Ltd, said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget proposed to remove dividend distribution tax (DDT) on companies and, henceforth, the tax burden will be shifted to recipients at the applicable rate.

Besides, she also said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent.

However, the buying in equities has been nominal in February so far as ""the subdued FPI sentiments are a result of coronavirus outbreak's impact on global economic growth,"" Mishra said.

Citing reasons for investment in the bonds market, analysts said the investment was largely on the back of the RBI maintaining an accommodative stance in its recent monetary policy review.

On the future course of FPI flows, Mishra said that ""in the medium term, FPI flows should increase as the domestic economy rebounds and global concerns subside"".",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fpis-remain-net-buyers-in-first-half-of-feb--invest-rs-24-617-cr-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/fpis-remain-net-buyers-in-first-half-of-feb--invest-rs-24-617-cr.html

136,16-2-20,Australian bushfires extinguished,"Australia's ""black summer"" of devastating bushfires is finally coming to a close, but bitter arguments over how to tackle climate-fuelled disasters are raging on.

When firefighters announced this week that all blazes in the hard-hit state of New South Wales were under control for the first time since September, the relief was palpable.

In other regions, a few fires are still being contained, but most Australians can finally abandon the grim rituals of the last half-year -morning checks of smog monitors and ""Fires Near Me"" apps, deciding whether the kids can play outside, whether to flee or defend their homes.

But the after-effects will endure, and national soul searching has already begun.

""We know events like these can challenge the way we think about the world, undermine our perceptions of safety, and rupture social bonds,"" said disaster response expert Erin Smith. Dozens of families have lost loved ones, thousands of homes and farms have been gutted, swathes of the east coast are scarred charcoal-black and millions have had their sense of security shaken.

""It will likely take years and a great deal of imagination for us to figure out where we go from here,"" said Smith.

The question of what is next for Australia is already being asked, most of all of political leaders, and it is being met mostly with finger-pointing and recrimination.

While scientists agree climate change created favourable conditions for the blazes, politicians of all stripes are acutely aware how sensitive the issue is in Australian politics.

In an arid nation whose economic strength is intimately tied to the mining and export of fossil fuels, at least four prime ministers have been ousted in part over their climate policies.

In recent weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has seen his ruling conservative coalition threatened by members in rural constituencies demanding funding for more coal-fired power plants.

At the same time, the centrist wing of his party has criticised his climate targets as inadequate.

Meanwhile rebel members of opposition Labor met secretly to steer the centre-left party's leadership toward a more overtly pro-coal stance.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/australian-bushfires-extinguished.html

A frequent critic of China, Esper used an address to an international security conference in Munich, Germany, to give his most comprehensive condemnation yet of a communist country that he said tops the Pentagon's list of potential adversaries, followed by Russia, “rogue states” like North Korea and Iran, and continuing threats from extremist groups.

""The Chinese Communist Party is heading even faster and further in the wrong direction – more internal repression, more predatory economic practices, more heavy-handedness, and most concerning for me, a more aggressive military posture,” he said.

Esper stressed that the United States does not want conflicts with China, and noted that the US Government has provided medical supplies to help China combat a coronavirus outbreak that has infected over 67,000 people.

Still, he said Beijing has made clear its long-term intentions and said Europe and the rest of the world must “wake up” to the threats that China poses.

“The Communist Party and its associated organs, including the People's Liberation Army, are increasingly operating in theaters outside its borders, including Europe, and seeking advantage by any means, and at any cost,” he said.

“While we often doubt the transparency and forthrightness of Beijing, when it comes to their security aims, we should take the Chinese government at its word,” he said.

“They have said that by 2035, the PRC intends to complete its military modernisation, and, by 2049, it seeks to dominate Asia as the preeminent global military power.""",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-defence-chief-slams-china-as-rising-threat-to-world-order.html

England made 204 for seven, with man of the match Moeen Ali hitting 39 off 11 balls as the tourists slammed 79 runs off the last five overs. South Africa made 202 for seven.

South African captain Quinton de Kock blazed to 65 off 22 balls, hitting eight sixes, in an opening partnership of 92 with Temba Bavuma. Mark Wood, bowling at high pace, dismissed both openers and England seemed to have taken control.

But Rassie van der Dussen (43 not out) and Dwaine Pretorius (25) got South Africa agonisingly close. South Africa needed 15 off the last over and Pretorius hit 12 of them before being trapped leg before by a yorker.

Bjorn Fortuin, playing his first innings in a T20I, tried to flick the last ball from Curran to fine leg but was caught by Adil Rashid, running back from the edge of the 30m circle.

As in the first match, which South Africa won by one run, the result hinged on the last few deliveries.

Chinappa, the torch-bearer for Indian women’s squash for close to two decades now, showed why she was the one to beat as she put paid to the aspirations of Tanvi Khanna, (seeded 3/4) in four games to add yet another national title to her kitty.

The top-seeded Chennai player recovered brilliantly after losing the first game to post a 8-11, 11-6, 11-4, 11-7 win to underline her superiority in the finals on Saturday.

She won her first national crown in 2000 and has since lost only two matches, both finals.

In the men’s final, Ghosal showed why he is still the man to beat, with a crushing 11-6, 11-5, 11-6 defeat of young Abhishek Pradhan (No 2 seed) to win the title yet again.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/chinappa--ghosal-win-national-title.html

Duplantis, who won Silver at last year’s world championships in Doha, cleared the bar with something to spare and won a world record bonus cheque for $30,000.

The old record of 6.16m set by French vaulter Renaud Lavillenie had stood since 2014 until Duplantis broke it last Saturday in Torun, Poland.

“There are so many things that go into this, so many years of hard work,” he said. “It’s really complicated but I guess when you’re doing it right it seems simple.

“I feel good on the runway, I feel fast, I feel strong and I feel I am working the poles I have really well. I’m excited for the outdoor season. The Olympics is the biggest thing that a track and field athlete can compete in and that is when I want to have my best competition this season.

142,16-2-20,City’s motivation against Real will be ‘immense’: Zidane,"Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane on Saturday said that he is expecting Manchester City’s motivation to be “immense” when the two sides meet in the Champions League following the announcement of the English side’s two-season ban from European competitions.

Real host Pep Guardiola’s City in their last-16 first leg on February 26, with the return game at the Etihad on March 17.

“For what has just happened, their motivation will be immense,” said Zidane ahead of Real’s match against Celta Vigo today.

“I’m not going to go into what happened, what is going to happen...

“It’s a team anyway, who will be a difficult opponent, knowing also how they have been doing in the Premier League. So they will have extra motivation.”

City lie 22 points adrift of runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool and Guardiola has admitted that his reign in Manchester will be considered a “failure” if he fails to lead the team to the Champions League title.

But Zidane is wary of a City outfit who have won the Premier League in each of the last two campaigns, amassing 100 and 98 points respectively.

“It’s a rival who are going to be very, very difficult, it’s a very big team,” added the Frenchman, who led Real to three consecutive European Cup triumphs from 2015-2018.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/city---s-motivation-against-real-will-be----immense-----zidane.html
143,16-2-20,Man City hit with UEFA ban,"Pep Guardiola faces a huge test of his loyalty to Manchester City after his club were hit with a stunning two-year suspension from UEFA competitions on Friday.

City have been banned from the Champions League and Europa League for the next two seasons and fined 30 million euros (£24.9 million) after UEFA found them guilty of committing “serious breaches” of financial regulations.

The Premier League champions overstated sponsorship revenue in accounts submitted between 2012 and 2016, according to European football’s governing body.

Announcing the ban a UEFA statement declared: “The Adjudicatory Chamber has imposed disciplinary measures on Manchester City Football Club directing that it shall be excluded from participation in UEFA club competitions in the next two seasons (ie. the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons).”

UEFA also said City failed to cooperate with an investigation into the matter launched by its Club Financial Control Body.

The shock punishment will cost City an estimated £170 million in lost Champions League revenue and the club reacted furiously, immediately vowing to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).

“Manchester City is disappointed but not surprised by today’s announcement by the UEFA Adjudicatory Chamber,” a statement read.

“The club has always anticipated the ultimate need to seek out an independent body and process to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence in support of its position.”

But, while City urgently plan their appeal, the football world waits to see how Guardiola reacts to a punishment that could convince the Spaniard to quit the Etihad Stadium at the end of the season.

Guardiola reportedly has a break clause in his contract which means he can depart at the conclusion of this campaign should certain stipulations be met that satisfy the City hierarchy.

City officials were said to be confident that, despite an underwhelming season which has seen them fall 22 points behind runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool, Guardiola would honour a contract that currently ties him to the club until 2021.

But staying with City now European football could be off limits is likely to be a rather more unappetising prospect for Guardiola.

Boost for CL hopefuls

Guardiola’s City outfit currently sit second in the Premier League table, meaning that the fourth Champions League slot available for English teams would likely go to the fifth-placed club this term.

Sheffield United, promoted to the top flight last year, sit in fifth.

It is not the first time that Man City have fallen foul of FFP regulations, having been fined 60 million euros and seeing their Champions League squad reduced in May 2014.

Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain were also fined that year.

Seven-time European champions AC Milan were banned from this season’s Europa League for FFP breaches.

La Liga president Javier Tebas applauded UEFA for their sanctions of Man City, saying: “UEFA is finally taking decisive action.

“Enforcing the rules of financial fair play and punishing financial doping is essential for the future of football... we finally have a good example of action.”

What did City do wrong?

City have been found to be in breach of UEFA’s financial fair play rules, which place restrictions on how much money a club can lose.

Over a three-year period, clubs are not permitted to lose more than 30 million euros with exceptions for some costs such as youth development and women’s teams.

UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body found that City ensured they did not fall foul of those restrictions by overstating their sponsorship revenue between 2012 and 2016.

The case against City was reopened when German magazine Der Spiegel published a series of leaked emails in 2018 that seemed to show how City had manufactured extra sponsorship revenue from a series of companies with connections to the Abu Dhabi United Group, owned by Sheikh Mansour.

City strenuously deny that accusation.

The consequences of a ban

Should City’s appeal fail, there could be repercussions for the futures of manager Pep Guardiola and a host of star players.

Guardiola’s contract runs until the end of the 2020/21 season, but the only major task left for the Catalan in Manchester is to make City European champions for the first time.

Guardiola suggested this week he could even be sacked if his side fail to beat Real Madrid in the Champions League last-16 but while that is highly unlikely, he may not want to hang around for another season if there are only domestic prizes up for grabs.

Similarly, players such as Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are unlikely to want to waste two of their peak years without Champions League football.

It would still take huge fees from rival clubs to tempt City to sell, but they may be forced to downsize to gain re-entry to the Champions League even after their ban is over.

City made 93 million euros from UEFA prize money and TV rights from last season’s Champions League, with gate receipts and extra sponsorship revenue from Europe’s premier club competition added to that tally.

It would be almost impossible for the club to lose that level of revenue for two years and remain FFP-compliant without cutting costs on transfer fees and wages, or selling players.

The sanctions may not even have stopped with UEFA. A Premier League investigation into City’s compliance with FFP is also ongoing and could result in a points deduction.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/man-city-hit-with-uefa-ban-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/man-city-hit-with-uefa-ban.html
144,16-2-20,Johri's resignation yet to be accepted,"BCCI's first chief executive officer Rahul Johri, who had tendered his resignation a while ago, might have to wait a little more before he is relieved of the plum job by the Board.

BCCI sources said on Sunday that Johri, appointed in 2016 to the then newly-formed position, had made up his mind to step down after the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) exited the scene in October last year, paving the way for the Sourav Ganguly-led team to take charge.

""Johri's resignation will be accepted but it might take some time. He is trying to negotiate,"" a source told PTI.

Since assuming the office of CEO, Johri has been working on multiple fronts, playing a key role in selling the IPL broadcast rights to Star India for a whopping Rs. 16,348 crore.

145,16-2-20,India set to play day-night Test in Australia: BCCI sources,"India are set to play a day-night Test during their much-anticipated tour of Australia later this year, BCCI sources said on Sunday.

This comes a little over a month after captain Virat Kohli asserted that his team was ready to play a day-night Test anywhere in Australia.

""India are most likely to play a day/night Test during the Australia tour,"" a BCCI source told PTI on condition of anonymity.

India played their maiden day-night Test against Bangladesh last November at the Eden Gardens, winning the match quite comfortably with plenty of time to spare.

On the eve of India's three-match ODI series opener at home against Australia last month, Kohli had said, ""We're ready and up for the challenge - whether it's Gabba, Perth... It doesn't matter to us. It's become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we're open to playing day-night Tests.""

India declined Australia's offer to play a day-night Test in Adelaide in 2018-19, citing lack of experience.

With day-night match seen as a possible answer to Test cricket's dwindling attendances, Australia had been hoping that India will agree to play one game at the Gabba this year.

146,16-2-20,Paes finishes second best in his last outing at home,"Veteran Leander Paes’ final ATP Tour match on home soil ended on a disappointing note as he and his partner Matthew Ebden lost to Indian pair of Purav Raja and Ramkumar Ramanathan in the men’s doubles final of the Bengaluru Open here on Saturday.

Paes, who is playing his final year of professional tennis, and his Australian partner Ebden were no match for their rivals, losing 0-6, 3-6 in the summit clash that lasted just 56 minutes.

Paes, 46, and Ebden had qualified for the final after beating third seeds Andre Goransson of Sweden and Indonesia’s Christopher Rungkat 7-5, 0-6, 10-7 in the semifinals.

Raja and Ramanathan, on the other hand, entered the last-four round after Saketh Myneni and Matt Reid of Australia conceded the other semifinal contest.

India’s campaign in singles came to an end on Thursday after the likes of Prajnesh Gunneswarah, Sumit Nagal, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Saketh Myneni, Niki Poonacha and Sidhart Rawat — all crashed out.

147,16-2-20,Test C’ship win is bigger achievement than ODI or T20WC title: Pujara,"India Test specialist Cheteshwar Pujara on Saturday said winning the ICC Test Championship will be a much bigger achievement than claiming an ODI or T20 World Cup title.

India have secured 360 points from the first seven Tests to stay on course to reach the finals of the inaugural World Test Championship.

“... When you become Test champions, I would say it is more than winning an ODI or a T20 World Cup. The reason is, this format is the ultimate format,” Pujara, who last played a limited-overs match for India in 2014, said during the latest episode of Inspiration on India Today.

“If you ask any great cricket player from the past, even the present cricketers, they would say that Test cricket is the most challenging format of this game. And when you become world champion of Test cricket, there is nothing like it.”

India had started the Test C’ships with a 2-0 win over the West Indies, before blanking South Africa and Bangladesh 3-0 and 2-0 respectively at home.

Virat Kohli’s men will now take on New Zealand in a two-match Test series beginning on February 21 in Wellington.

“Most of the teams have done well in their home conditions but when they go away, they are always challenged. Especially about the Indian team, we have managed to do well overseas. We have now started winning series overseas,” said the 32-year-old right-handed batsman.

“So, that is the biggest advantage this Indian team has now. Talking about the Test championship, any team who gets into the final, they have to work really hard for over a period of two years and they have to win not just at home but also they have to start winning away from home.”

Pujara also hailed ICC’s decision to introduce World Test Championship, saying it has made the traditional format of the game more competitive.

“To sustain Test cricket, ICC had to come up with something and I think this is one of the best platforms players can ask for. And there is something to play for in each and every Test match. You won’t see many draws now,” he said.

“So going forward, most of the Test matches will produce results.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/test-c---ship-win-is-bigger-achievement-than-odi-or-t20wc-title--pujara.html
148,16-2-20,India’s middle-order can improve: Mandhana,"In-form opener Smriti Mandhana believes India’s top four need to bat long to protect the inconsistent middle-order during the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.

India’s middle-order has been unpredictable and its repeated failures have hurt them.

In the 2017 World Cup final, India had lost seven wickets for 28 runs to go down to England by nine runs, while in the recent tri-series final against Australia, they collapsed to 144 all out after being 115 for three at one stage while chasing 155.

“The middle order could definitely improve,” said Mandhana, who became the third Indian to reach 1,000 T20I runs at the 2018 Women’s T20 World Cup and was also the leading run-scorer in the recent tri-series in Australia.

“There are some things we still have to figure out with our batting and we are trying hard to do that. The best way to support the middle order is for the top order to bat 20 overs. I think we need to try and bat long as a top four.

“We must try not to get out in the 16th or 17th over and the problem will be sorted if we can stay until the 20th over,” added the 23-year-old.

India will begin their T20 World Cup campaign with a clash against four-time champions Australia on February 21.

Australia head coach Matthew Mott believes India have the most feared batting line-up at the T20 World Cup and Mandhana agrees that they have a balanced batting order.

“We can be very unpredictable on our day, but I’d like to agree (with Mott),” she said.

“We have some great batters and our order is very balanced. The top four or five are quite settled. We’ve had the same top five for the last year and that’s been a good thing for us,” Mandhana told ICC.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india---s-middle-order-can-improve--mandhana.html
149,16-2-20,"Ishant passes fitness test, to join team in NZ","Senior India fast bowler Ishant Sharma on Saturday passed the fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru and will now join the team in New Zealand for the two-match Test series starting February 21.

“Ishant cleared his fitness test today and he will be joining the team at the earliest. He is available for selection for the first Test but final call rests with the team management,” a BCCI source said on condition of anonymity.

Ishant is expected to fly to Wellington for the first Test.

Ishant termed the injury phase as a “roller-coaster ride”and thanked NCA physio Ashish Kaushik for helping him during this tough time.

“It was a roller coaster ride for me after the injury on my ankle on the 20th January but with the help of Ashish Kaushik I managed to pull it off! Scans were a little scary, but today I am happy that I am fit ! Thanks Ashish Kaushik! #recoverymode #recovery #postinjury,” the lanky pacer tweeted.

On January 21, Ishant — four short of becoming only the second Indian fast bowler after Kapil Dev to reach the landmark of 100 Tests — twisted his right ankle while playing for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match against Vidarbha at the Feroz Shah Kotla here.

An official from the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association, based upon an MRI scan, had said that the pacer had suffered a Grade 3 tear in his ankle, and been advised six weeks of rest and rehabilitation.

A BCCI source later said that Ishant will again do his MRI to ascertain the degree of tear and decide on his rehabilitation.

150,16-2-20,‘IPL contributed to growth of quality Kiwi players’,"The decision to create a separate window for IPL has played a massive role in qualitative growth of New Zealand cricketers, feels former seamer and current national selector Gavin Larsen.

Larsen and coach Gary Stead (also chief selector) form the two-member panel which looks after the development of the country’s players and the cricket board has ensured that IPL is a part of that plan.

“It’s very clear. Its highlighted in our Master Agreement (MA) that IPL window must be available for our players if they do get picked up by a franchise,” Larsen, who featured regularly in New Zealand’s ODI team of 90’s, said.

“When our players are picked up by IPL franchise, they can only develop their game. We are seeing some of the results that have come in terms of Players’ improvement which has been a fantastic part of cricket growth.”

He does accept that scheduling could be a challenge but not something that is too worrisome at the moment.

“There are small challenges around scheduling, for instance, England tours, which can be packed up close to IPL. So it’s a challenge around players’ availability. But it’s not a common issue generally I am not being negative,” Larsen said.

One part of Larsen’s job is to monitor Black Caps players’ performances in the IPL and it would be more significant in the next two years with back-to-back ICC T20 World Cups.

“Definitely, part of the role to continually monitor the group of players, both guys who are incumbent Black Caps and those who are in the ranks, to make sure they are managed appropriately, they are working on their games. IPL is a part of that.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---ipl-contributed-to-growth-of-quality-kiwi-players---.html
151,16-2-20,How can people question Bumrah’s ability? Asks Shami,"“How can people forget Jasprit Bumrah’s numerous match-winning performances just after a couple of indifferent ODI games?” asked a miffed Mohammed Shami on Saturday to counter the criticism levelled at his new ball partner.

Bumrah went wicketless in all three of India’s defeats against New Zealand with questions being raised over his performance.

“I can understand we are discussing on a topic (after a certain length of time) not just after 2-4 games. Just because he hasn’t performed in two games, you can’t just ignore his ability to win matches,” said Shami after the second day’s play in the warm-up game against New Zealand XI.

“What Bumrah has achieved for India, how can you even forget that or for that matter ignore it? So if you think positively, then it’s good for the player and his confidence also,” Bumrah’s senior partner said.

The veteran pacer didn’t forget to take a dig at critics who he feels have a job to comment, forgetting that Bumrah is coming back from a stress fracture on his lower back.

“As a sportsman, it’s very different. From outside, it is very easy to nitpick as some have a job to comment and earn money. Every sportsman can get injured and one should try and look at the positives rather than harp on negatives. I also got injured in 2015 (knee surgery) but then bounced back,” Shami said

What baffles Shami is how people’s perception changes if a player goes through a sudden slump in form.

“People tend to think very differently and when you do not do well for a few games, their view point about you changes. So on our part, we shouldn’t over-think.”

Easily the most versatile bowler in the current line-up and having been the best Indian bowler on view during the second day of the warm-up game, Shami seemed happy with kind of track that was on offer.

“It was a bit green and the wicket was damp on the first day compared to the second day. Yesterday (First Day) morning, it was challenging and we wanted to take up that challenge. Today it was drier compared to yesterday (Friday), with cloud cover, the conditions became helpful.

“There was good bounce and carry, so felt good bowling on a track. These kind of tracks are a rarity and since we have pacers of that calibre, we reaped its benefits.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/how-can-people-question-bumrah---s-ability--asks-shami.html
152,16-2-20,"Bumrah, Shami make the ball talk","Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami gave an exhibition of high quality fast bowling on day two of India’s warm-up encounter against New Zealand XI, sending a warning signal for the home team ahead of first Test in Wellington.

For the record, New Zealand were bowled out for 235 in 74.2 overs but Bumrah (2/18 in 11 overs) and Shami (3/17 in 10 overs) used the conditions well and in the process added miles to their legs ahead of the two World Test Championship games.

Umesh Yadav (2/49 in 13 overs) and Navdeep Saini (2/58 in 15 overs) bowled more overs but weren’t half as good as the two premier pacers who troubled the batsmen in all their spells.

With the pitch easing out, Prithvi Shaw (35 batting off 35 balls) unleashed a series of cover drives including a six off a ramp shot while Mayank Agarwal (23 batting off 17 balls) got a maximum with a Nataraja Shot to finish the day at 59 for no loss.

For head coach Ravi Shastri, the basic idea was to check out how his pacers got into the groove and Bumrah and Shami hit the straps straightaway in overcast conditions.

While Umesh and Saini in their first spells bowled too full, Bumrah pitched deliveries on back of length generating disconcerting bounce. He bowled in three short spells while Shami bowled two spells.

The crafty Shami, after getting a hang that ball wasn’t jagging around too much despite cloud cover, concentrated on getting the ball to seam both ways.

Bumrah got Will Young (2) with an angular delivery that straightened after pitching to get a nick that landed in Rishabh Pant’s gloves.

The delivery that got right-hander Finn Allen (20) was one that pitched on back of length and the batsman played for the bounce, deciding to shoulder arms. However the ball nipped back and clipped the off-bail much to his dismay.

The second spell that Shami bowled post lunch was the one that troubled the New Zealand batsmen including senior international Jimmy Neesham, who was unable to counter the seam movement and extra bounce.

Before that he removed the set Henry Cooper (40 off 68 balls) with a fullish delivery that the batsman wanted to drive.

Once the they had bowled enough overs, the duo didn’t come out in the final session as they had done their job for the day.

The final half an hour was entertaining as Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner got some serious pasting from both Shaw and Agarwal, who used the pace to get some easy runs.

It did help that the Seddon Park track had eased out considerably making stroke-play easier than expected.

With India sticking to the Shaw-Agarwal opening combination for the second successive day, Shubman Gill may just have to wait for his Test debut.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bumrah--shami-make-the-ball-talk.html

155,16-2-20,"Maha govt ''unnatural, unrealistic'': Nadda","BJP national president J P Nadda on Sunday dubbed the Maharashtra government led by Uddhav Thackeray as ""unnatural and unrealistic"", saying it has put brakes on the state's development.

Addressing the state BJP convention at Nerul in the neighbouring Navi Mumbai township, Nadda said the party needs to be ready to go solo in future elections.

He said despite the BJP getting mandate after the state Assembly polls in October last year, some with ""selfish motives"" parted ways with it and joined hands with those in the opposition to come to power.

The BJP chief, however, expressed confidence that his party will win the next Maharashtra Assembly polls on its own.

""The Maharashtra government is unnatural and unrealistic. Some people have parted ways with the BJP for their selfish gains,"" Nadda said without naming any party or individual.

The BJP should be prepared to contest all the forthcoming elections on its own, he said.

""You should be ready for 'all versus one (BJP)' kind of political battle in future,"" Nadda said addressing the party workers.

The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the state after the Assembly polls in October last year. But, it failed to form government after the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena snapped ties with it over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.

The Shiv Sena later forged an alliance with the ideologically different NCP and Congress to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state.

Nadda said despite the state Assembly poll mandate being in favour of the BJP, ""selfish motives prevailed"" and some went to join hands with the opposition to form government.

159,16-2-20,"We remain firm on decisions on Art 370, CAA despite pressure: PM","Ruling out a rethink on decisions on CAA and Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday asserted that his government remains and will remain firm on the steps, which have been taken in national interest, despite pressure from all sides.

""Be it the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir or the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the country waited for decisions on these for years,"" he told a public meeting here during a day-long visit to his Lok Sabha constituency.

""These decisions were necessary in the interest of the nation. Duniya bhar ke saarey dabaon ke bawjood, inn faislon par hum qayam hain, qayam rahengey (Despite pressure from all sides, we remain firm on the decisions and will continue to remain firm,"" Modi said.

Provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special powers to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, were abrogated by the government in August last year.

The prime minister's tough talk assumed significance in view of protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

Citing certain key decisions of his government, Modi referred to the trust set up for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and asserted that it would work ""rapidly"".

""A trust has been formed for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. This trust will work rapidly,"" he said.

He said that after setting up of the trust, the work on the construction of 'Ram dham' will start with fast speed.

The government had recently set up the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra on the Supreme Court's directive to the Union government to form a trust that can look into the construction and management of the temple.

The prime minister earlier launched or laid foundation of 50 projects worth Rs 1,254 crore in his Lok Sabha constituency.

He also flagged off IRCTC's 'Maha Kaal Express' through video link during his day-long visit to the city.

It will be the first overnight private train in the country to connect three Jyotirling pilgrimage centres of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, and Ujjain and Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh.

The prime minister dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre and unveiled a 63-foot statue of the RSS ideologue -- the tallest statue of the leader in the country.

""The soul of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay give us encouragement. We are working for uplift of Dalits, deprived and others sections. And this is what Upadhyay's 'Antyoday' says - to give all facilities to last beneficiary in the queue,"" Modi said.

He said that in past few years, Rs 25,000 crore worth developmental projects have either completed or were going on in fast speed in Varanasi.

Roadway, highway, waterway and railway have been given top priority by the government and the Purvanchal Expressway work was going on at fast speed in Uttar Pradesh.

The prime minister also laid emphasis on better connectivity of heritage and religious sites, saying that tourism will be the main source of making the country 5 trillion dollar economy.

He said, ""Our behaviour as a citizen will decide direction of the country in future. Country is not made by governments only, but values of people residing here.""

160,16-2-20,50 Dilli ke Nirmata on stage with CM,"Teachers invited, not ‘ordered’, to attend oath event, AAP clears air after facing Opp fury

Teachers, bus marshals, students, sportsman, architects of the Signature Bridge and family of firefighters who lost their lives are among those who will share the stage with AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and other senior party leaders at the oath-taking ceremony on Sunday.

Senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said the party has invited 50 “Dilli ke Nirmata”, including head of schools, auto drivers, bus conductors, metro pilots and experts from various other fields, to attend the swearing-in ceremony. These “special guests” will share the stage with Kejriwal during the ceremony, AAP leader Manish Sisodia said.

The swearing-in which is “open to public” won’t see the usual gathering of political heavyweights, although the AAP has invited the Prime Minister and all seven MPs of Delhi for the event.

Big banners bearing messages like “Dhanyawad Dilli” along with the image of Kejriwal were put up in and around the Ramlila Maidan.

A day before taking oath as the Delhi Chief Minister for the third time, Kejriwal called a dinner meeting of his Ministers-designate to discuss a roadmap for Delhi’s development.

According to party functionaries, Kejriwal will discuss with his Ministers-designate initiatives that need to be prioritised and action items for the Delhi Government in the coming three months. The meeting will also focus on developing a roadmap to make Delhi a global city, they said.

Meanwhile the AAP came under for fire for allegedly making the attendance of teachers compulsory for Kejriwal’s oath-taking ceremony. However, the AAP on Saturday clarified saying the teachers have been “invited” and not “ordered” to attend the event.

“Delhi’s teachers and principals are the architects of Delhi’s transformation in the past 5 years. They deserve to be invited to the swearing-in at Ramlila Maidan tomorrow,” AAP leader Jasmine Shah said in a tweet.

He was replying to former Delhi BJP chief Vijendar Gupta who termed the order as dictatorial.

“The Directorate of Education, GNCTD has issued a dictatorial circular making it compulsory for Government teachers to attend Mr. @ArvindKejriwal’s oath ceremony. By virtue of the order 15,000 teachers & officials are forced to attend the ceremony,” Gupta tweeted.

In another tweet, Gupta said that he has written to Kejriwal to take back the order and termed it as a misuse of the Government machinery.

“I have written to Mr @ArvindKejriwal asking him to withdraw the tughlaqi farmaan to the teachers & officials which is sheer misuse of Government machinery to meet political ends. Education cannot be employed as a tool to launch one’s political ambitions,” he said.

On Friday, Delhi’s Directorate of Education (DoE) issued a circular to its officials and teachers and principals of Delhi government schools to attend the swearing-in-ceremony of the chief minister and his council of ministers on Sunday at Ramlila ground.

The Opposition trained guns at the AAP and slammed the order. The BJP mocked the AAP saying the party has enough MLAs but not public support.

Dr CS Verma, head of School of Kautilya Government Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya and a core member of the Happiness Curriculum committee said, “I can’t explain my feelings in words. I am very happy and honoured to have been called to be a part of the oath-taking ceremony. Everyone at my school is excited as I am representing them as well as the entire community of principals who have worked hard to improve Delhi’s Government schools.”

Ahead of the mega event, a multi-level security arrangement will be in place at the Ramlila Maidan which is scheduled to begin at 10 am and traffic regulations will be in place in the area from 8 am to 2 pm.

Around 2,000 to 3,000 personnel from the Delhi Police and paramilitary forces, including the CRPF, will be deployed as part of the security arrangements, a senior police official said, adding that drones are likely to be used for surveillance.

Manu Gulati, winner of Martha Farrell Award 2019 for women empowerment, one among the invitees, said, “I am honoured to have been invited to the oath taking ceremony of the Chief Minister. I am grateful to be the face of the entire teachers’ community on the occasion.”

“The election result is a victory of those who dream to make Delhi a world class city and work tirelessly for it. Therefore Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to call people from all walks of life as special guests,” Sisodia said.

Vijay Kumar, who is currently studying in IIT-Delhi with the help of Jai Bhim Mukhya-Mantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana of the Delhi Government, said that he would not have done it without the help of this scheme. “For students like me, who hail from poor sections of the society, cannot afford the fees of coaching institutes without the Government help.

“I feel excited to be a part of the oath-taking ceremony. I want to thank Kejriwal ji for having helped me realise my dream of studying in the IITs one day. It would be an honour to represent the students from underprivileged sections of the society who are realising their dreams with the help of the Jai Bheem Yojana”.

Sumit Nagal has studied from a Delhi Government school from Class 1 to 10 where he used to play tennis and the teachers always encouraged him to play. With the scheme of the Delhi Government for the budding players, Sumit is now playing at international level. “I am always grateful to the Delhi Government run by Arvind Kejriwal for supporting me to play tennis. Today when I represent India at the international level I feel proud of Delhi and my school. I hope many players like me will get the support of the Government and represent the nation at the international level,” he said.

Sonu Gautam is a Hotel Management graduate who did a few of the corporate jobs before immersing himself completely in social welfare. He has co-founded an NGO called “Bhaichara Foundation” where a bunch of 6-7 people have come together to help those in need. From blood donation to providing study materials to students, they help everyone who needs support.

He has acted like a true “Farishta” for many people and has already received five certificates from the Delhi Government under the Farishtey scheme. In 2019, he was felicitated by the Chief Minister himself under the scheme. He said that he can never forget that day as his dedication to helping others has profoundly increased after that.

“I am looking forward to see Arvind Kejriwal becoming the Chief Minister for the third time in a row. I hope my story and that of others recognised under Farishtey scheme encourages all the people of Delhi to be Farishteys and help whosoever is in need.”

Kejriwal will take oath as Delhi Chief Minister along with six others at 10 am on Sunday. The six who will take oath as Ministers are: Manish Sisodia, Satyender Jain, Gopal Rai, Kailash Gehlot, Imran Hussain and Rajendra Gautam.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the ceremony, besides BJP MPs and MLAs from Delhi. The AAP had said no chief minister or political leader from other states will be part of the event as it will be a ""Delhi-specific"" ceremony.

162,16-2-20,Jamia committee releases video of paramilitary personnel attacking students in library on Dec 15,"Two months after the alleged police brutality at the Jamia Millia Islamia, a new video has emerged purportedly showing paramilitary and police personnel thrashing students in the library on December 15, drawing sharp reactions from several quarters, including the Congress.

The police said they will investigate the video and two others, which appeared hours later and showed some youths with covered faces entering the library, as part of the ongoing probe into the December 15 incident.

The 48-second video, which appears to be a CCTV footage and was released by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), purportedly shows some seven to eight paramilitary and police personnel entering the Old Reading Hall and beating up students with batons. The paramilitary and police personnel are also seen covering their faces with handkerchiefs.

Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Praveer Ranjan said the videos have come to their knowledge and they will investigate them as part of their ongoing probe.

Sources said the JCC had shared only a 48-second video in which only one side of the story was shown, but they did not show the videos in which the 'rioters' were seen coming inside the campus and some others were shielding them from police.

In the second clip, running around 5.25 minutes, people are purportedly seen entering the university's library in a rush. Some have their face covered. As soon as they enter the library, those present inside the room can be seen pushing tables and chairs to block the main door. However, it does not have details of the timing and date of the incident.

In the third video, running into 2.13 minutes, people are seen in the gangway with some covering their faces, while at least two of them are carrying stones. The footage was captured roughly at around 6.04 pm on December 15.

The first video was released by the JCC, a group comprising Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students and alumni. The group was formed after the alleged police brutality on the campus on December 15.

The university, however, clarified that the first video was not released by it.

The university, on December 15, had turned into a battlefield as police entered the campus to look for 'outsiders' who were reportedly involved in incidents of violence and arson a few metres away from the educational institute during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

A law student of the university had alleged that he lost vision in one eye due to the police action.

The JCC said it received the video from an ""anonymous"" source.

It also said the university has shared video footage of the police action in the library with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which is probing the episode.

Sharing the video on Twitter, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said if no action is taken even after the video, then the government's intentions will stand exposed.

She also accused Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the Delhi Police of ""lying"" that Jamia students were not beaten up inside the library.

""Look at how Delhi Police is blindly assaulting students in the library. A boy is flashing his book but the policeman is continuing to attack him with batons,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi.

""Home Minister and Delhi Police lied when they said students were not beaten up in the library,"" Gandhi said in another tweet.

""If no action is taken even after watching this Jamia video, the government's intentions would stand exposed before the whole country,"" she added.

CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the police's act is ""unconscionable"" and ""unacceptable"".

""Every defence of police action on students in universities, offered by Amit Shah, is untrue, misleading and politically motivated. Delhi police comes directly under Modi-Shah and this is how it treats young students studying in a library. Shame,"" Yechury tweeted.

Meanwhile, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said the investigating agencies must use the video as evidence, adding it was ""good"" of ""rioters"" to identify themselves.

""Students in library with 'masks' - Reading from shut books - Looking anxiously towards the entrance rather than being relaxed and immersed in studies, which is what a library is meant for... Anatomy of Jamia rioters who tried hiding in the library after a stone pelting session?"" he posted on Twitter.

The varsity clarified that it has not released the video put out by the JCC.

""It has come to our notice that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university,"" the institute's public relations officer Ahmad Azeem said.

Azeem said the JCC is spearheading the stir against the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens on the Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar Road outside the university's gate number seven.

""This is to clarify that JCC is not an official body of the university. Any communication from JCC should not be taken as version of the university,"" Azeem said.

The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) also slammed the Delhi Police for their use of force in the varsity and accused them of allowing ""terrorists"" to barge inside JNU on January 5.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jamia-committee-releases-video-of-paramilitary-personnel-attacking-students-in-library-on-dec-15-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/jamia-committee-releases-video-of-paramilitary-personnel-attacking-students-in-library-on-dec-15.html
163,16-2-20,Trump's timely visit to India could open new period in bilateral ties: Verma,"Describing US President Donald Trump's upcoming visit to India as timely that could open a new period in bilateral ties, a former top American diplomat has said that it is important for the leaders of the two countries to embrace and reaffirm common values of commitment to democracy, human rights, diversity and rule of law.

President Trump will pay a state visit to India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi. He would be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump.

""Only six sitting US Presidents have visited India since India's independence in 1947, so President Trump's visit is important, timely and has the chance to open a new period in bilateral ties,"" former US envoy to India Rich Verma told PTI in an interview ahead of the presidential visit.

""The visits of the last three US Presidents have celebrated not only our security and economic potential, but also focused on our deeply held shared values, our commitment to democracy, to human rights, to diversity, to the rule of law and to a more peaceful and open Indo-Pacific. This is the aspect of our partnership that makes it stand out and gives it special significance,"" said Verma, who served as the US Ambassador to India from 2015 to 2017.

Noting that there are threats to that vision, he said that it would be important for both the leaders to embrace and reaffirm those values. ""I hope the President goes even further to reaffirm that America remains a land of immigrants, a welcoming nation committed to diversity and inclusion,"" he said.

""That's the America that my parents came to from India nearly 60 years ago. It's the America that allowed their son to return as Ambassador, and the America that lifted up millions of newly arrived immigrants over our history wanting to pursue the American dream,"" said the first-ever Indian-American to be posted as US Ambassador to India.

Verma, 51, who is vice chairman of the Asia Group, said that President Trump can draw upon this bipartisan traditions to reaffirm these shared values and bring the two nations even closer together.

""If he does, then the world will indeed be a safer and more prosperous place – one where two natural allies defend and advance freedom for hundreds of millions across the globe,"" Verma said.

He said that the previous presidential visits led to new areas of cooperation, demonstrated the appreciation and affection that the American people feel towards India, and reflected the true bipartisan support for a stronger partnership.

President Obama was the only US President to visit India twice during his tenure in office, and the only President to attend India's Republic Day. His visits led to historic progress in defense, energy and trade. ""I was proud to witness that progress first-hand,"" he said.

""We remember President (Bill) Clinton's historic visit in 2000, where in a memorable address before the Indian Parliament he called for a new chapter in US-India ties, one that finally lives up to our desire to be 'natural allies',"" he noted.

He said President George W Bush's visit cemented historic progress on civil nuclear cooperation and in sealing an important strategic defense arrangement with India.

""We cannot forget the words of President Eisenhower, the first US President to visit (India), where he predicted the Indian and American people, not the governments, would show us the way forward. It was a wise observation,"" Verma said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-s-timely-visit-to-india-could-open-new-period-in-bilateral-ties--verma-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/trump-s-timely-visit-to-india-could-open-new-period-in-bilateral-ties--verma.html

166,16-2-20,Modi-Shah not invincible: Raut on Delhi Assembly poll results,"Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the Delhi Assembly poll results indicate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah are not invincible.

In his weekly column in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', its executive editor Raut criticised BJP's ""religion-centric"" political strategy while lauding the developmental works of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government.

He said the BJP, which appeared invincible during the Lok Sabha polls, fell like a ""house of cards"" in Delhi.

""No country is without religion, but religion does not mean patriotism...A follower of Lord Hanuman, Kejriwal brought 'Ram Rajya' in Delhi though the BJP almost fielded Lord Ram in this election,"" Raut said in sarcastic comments.

""The picture of Delhi was of Kejriwal as devotee of Hanuman and people of Delhi became Ram...Ram strongly stood behind Hanuman,"" he said, adding that there are lessons to be learnt from this election.

BJP leaders earlier said those who don't vote for the saffron party would be traitors, so is the entire Delhi going to get that stamp? Raut asked.

""The Delhi verdict indicates that Modi-Shah are not invincible any longer. It also points out that voters are not dishonest. Religious whirlwinds were stoked for political gains, but voters did not get carried away,"" he said.

People should get over the ""myth"" that only Modi and Shah can win elections, the Rajya Sabha member said.

Sharing an experience from a recent international visit, Raut said while he was at the Tashkent airport, two Indians living there for years told him that the ""BJP bubble has started to burst now"".

""Even Lord Ram is not helping the party to win polls. They (those two Indians) shared their views on the day of vote counting (for Delhi polls),"" the Sena leader said.

The common factor between Prime Minister Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is that ""both are self- centered"", but Modi also has ""huge arrogance and pomposity"", Raut alleged.

He said Kejriwal also once wanted to ""conquer the entire country"", but after facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, he soon realised his limitations and built his party and its network in Delhi.

""The BJP has ridiculed Kejriwal's freebies, like free electricity and water. BJP's definition of patriotism comprises waging war against Pakistan, abrogation of Article 370, strong steps against infiltrators and random sloganeering of 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai',"" he said.

But, ""the better form of patriotism"" (referring to Kejriwal) is offering better education, health services and providing electricity, water and shelter to the needy, the Sena leader pointed out.

""Will you (BJP) call it patriotism when two crore people lost jobs in last two years?"" Raut wondered.

He said before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised that Rs 15 lakh will be deposited in every citizen's bank account, but not even Rs 15 got deposited.

The BJP also pushed the Delhi poll narrative towards issues like Ram temple, (abrogation of) Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir, surgical strike and 'Hindutva', but people instead chose Kejriwal, who provided them essential services, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/modi-shah-not-invincible--raut-on-delhi-assembly-poll-results-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/modi-shah-not-invincible--raut-on-delhi-assembly-poll-results.html

The Aam Aadmi Party supremo began his address with 'Bharat Mata ki Jai', 'Inquilab Zindabad' and ended it by singing 'Hum Honge Kamyaab', in which he was joined by the crowd at the Ramlila Maidan here.

In his earlier tenure, the AAP supremo had several run-ins with the Centre.

""Your son has taken oath for the third time as Delhi chief minister. This is not my victory but yours,"" Kejriwal.

Kejriwal said he did not give step-motherly treatment to anyone and has worked for all in the last five years.

""In the last five years, we have tried to develop Delhi in a fast mode and in the next five years, we will continue the same.

""In the recent elections, some people voted for the AAP, and some for the BJP and the Congress... From today itself, I am the chief minister of all,"" he said.

While indicating that political ideologies do not matter to him, he told the crowd that the two crore people of Delhi are ""his family"".

""We have to do a lot of work for Delhi and beautify it,"" he said.

While lauding the people of Delhi for changing the politics of the country, he said the name of India will resonate in the world due to this new wave of politics.

""Delhi's 'nirmatas' (makers) are sitting here... Lakhs of 'nirmatas' run Delhi...Politicians come and go but Delhi's 'nirmata' run Delhi,"" he said.

Around 50 people from different walks of life who are 'Delhi ke Nirmata' and have contributed to the development of the city during the last five years shared the stage with Kejriwal during his ceremony as special guests.

Kejriwal talked about the freebies his government had given in the last five and said it would be a shame if he charged people for the basic amenities.

""Some people say Kejriwal is giving everything for free. Nature has ensured every valuable thing in the world is free, be it mother's love, father's blessings or Shravan Kumar's dedication.

""So, Kejriwal loves his people and hence this love is free...I should be ashamed if I charge those who take treatment in government hospitals or study in government schools,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/want-to-work-with-centre-for-smooth-governance-of-delhi--kejriwal-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/want-to-work-with-centre-for-smooth-governance-of-delhi--kejriwal.html
168,16-2-20,Shaheen Bagh protesters to march to Shah,"After several rounds of meetings, Shaheen Bagh’s anti-CAA protesters on Saturday decided to march to the residence of Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday. The march will start from Shaheen Bagh protest site at noon.

The protesters said they have not taken any appointment as Shah had conveyed via TV channels his willingness to meet the Shaheen Bagh protesters. The Home Ministry has not received any request for appointment from the protesters, sources said.

Talking to The Pioneer, Meraj, a protester, said the protest is leaderless so there will not be any representative but people will march to Shah’s residence. He said soon after the news of Shah’s readiness to meet the protesters reached Shaheen Bagh, several meetings were conducted and a memorandum of understanding was signed. “We all are one and decided to march with Dadis…our concern is one. Thus, we will march together and will meet Shah tomorrow (Sunday),” he added.

Notably, on meeting with Home Minister, Shaheen Bagh protesters were divided in two groups, as a few of them wanted Shah to pay a visit at the protest site as the demonstration belongs to all people.

Protesters said that on Saturday, after an announcement in this regard was made from the dais, suggestions were invited about who and how many people will go to meet Shah.

In the meeting, we received many suggestions, and later on, with the considerations, it was decided that this is time to be united and we decided to support our elderly Dadis (Senior women protesters), said protesters.

We would ask Shah to withdraw the Act and our protest would continue till our demand is met, said a protester.

While the protesters have been staging a sit-in against the CAA, National Register of Citizen (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) for the past two months, the protesters demanded an initiative from the Government to call them for talks.

This may be recalled that in an interaction with a news channel earlier this week, Shah said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to CAA with him can visit in his office and will give time within three days.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/shaheen-bagh-protesters-to-march-to-shah.html
169,16-2-20,"Death toll in coronavirus in China climbs to 1,665","The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic has climbed to 1,665 after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei Province, and the confirmed cases jumped to 68,500, officials said on Sunday, as top WHO experts scramble to assist Beijing contain the virus spread.

China'sNational Health Commission confirmed 2,009 new cases across the country.

Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, reported 1,843 of the new cases. The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in Hubei to 56,249 cases.

Of the new deaths, 139 were in Hubei, two in Sichuan, and one in Hunan, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

The number of new cases, however, appears to have started dropping and a top Chinese health official has said efforts to control the outbreak have reached the “most crucial stage"".

The report said 9,419 infected patients had been discharged from hospital after recovery so far.

The coronavirus has posed a severe threat to the medical staff as more than 1,700 Chinese health officials have been infected by the virus while treating the patients and six of them have died.

Experts from the World Health Organisation are expected in Beijing on Sunday to join Chinese health authorities in containing the virus, which has spread to several other countries forcing them to temporarily stop tourist arrivals from China.

The health commission said a joint mission with WHO experts will pay field visits to China's three provincial-level regions to learn the effectiveness of the epidemic control measures.

One task of the mission will be to come up with standard medicine to cure the disease, according to the health commission.

Several antiviral drugs are under clinical trials and Chinese researchers have narrowed down their focus to a few existing drugs, including Chloroquine Phosphate, Favipiravir and Remdesivir, said Zhang Xinmin, director of the China National Centre for Biotechnology Development.

Experts have asked people to frequently wash hands and face, and wear masks.

Authorities have begun quarantining large quantity of bank notes and coins in the affected areas and sanitising them with UV light before releasing them back into circulation to stop the virus from spreading.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-toll-in-coronavirus-in-china-climbs-to-1-665-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/death-toll-in-coronavirus-in-china-climbs-to-1-665.html
170,16-2-20,Honeymoon ends in handcuffs: Wrong Louisiana woman arrested,"A case of mistaken identity caused a Louisiana woman to leave her honeymoon in handcuffs and spend 36 hours in the New Orleans jail before it was sorted out.

Sara Saucier of Ponchatoula was on a cruise ship returning from a trip to Cozumel with her new husband when US customs agents pounded on her door, accusing her of not returning a leased vehicle in November 2017, according to a report from WVLA-TV.

But officials had the wrong person.

The East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office detective who filed the warrant logged the birth date of the wrong Sara Saucier. The mistake went unnoticed for 36 hours, as Saucier sat in the Orleans Parish Jail.

“I thought they would realize the mistake, and they would let me go,” Saucier said in a Thursday interview.

“At one point when no one was listening to what I was saying, about me being innocent, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm really going to be in here for a while.'” Sheriffs' deputies realized the confusion Tuesday, as they relocated Saucier — and they released her that afternoon. She had been in custody since Monday morning.

East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Sid Gautreaux apologized for the error.

“I will do all I can to put every possible safeguard in place to attempt to prevent this from happening again,” Gautreaux said in a statement.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/honeymoon-ends-in-handcuffs--wrong-louisiana-woman-arrested-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/honeymoon-ends-in-handcuffs--wrong-louisiana-woman-arrested.html
171,16-2-20,NATO chief dismisses Macron nuclear call,"The head of NATO dismissed President Emmanuel Macron's call for a European ""strategic dialogue"" about the role of France's nuclear weapons, saying a ""tried and tested"" deterrent was already in place.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Saturday that thanks to the US and Britain's atomic weapons, Europe was already protected by a longstanding and effective nuclear umbrella.

While a NATO member, France does not make its atomic weapons available to the alliance, but in a major speech last week Macron called for dialogue among EU countries about what role the French nuclear deterrent could play.

Stoltenberg, who last year clashed with Macron over the French leader's claims NATO was suffering ""brain death"" in its geopolitical thinking, gave his latest suggestion a frosty reception.

""We have to remember that we have a European nuclear deterrent today -- 28 allies deliver that every day and it's not only a promise, but it's something that has been there for decades,"" Stoltenberg told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.

""It's tried and tested, we exercise it, and it's institutionalised, and it is the ultimate security guarantee for Europe."" France is the EU's only nuclear power after Brexit and Macron has championed the idea of European ""strategic autonomy"" -- the ability to defend itself without relying on the US -- though he insists on his commitment to NATO.

Stoltenberg said France was a ""highly valued ally"" whose nuclear capabilities contributed to NATO's overall security.

German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer welcomed the French suggestion while insisting it did not mean undermining US nuclear protection.

""If we reinforce Europe, it means above all reinforcing the European pillar of NATO,"" she said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nato-chief-dismisses-macron-nuclear-call-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/nato-chief-dismisses-macron-nuclear-call.html
172,16-2-20,Rocket attack hits near US embassy in Iraq capital: US military source,"Multiple rockets hit near the US embassy in Iraq's capital early Sunday, an American military source said, the latest in a flurry of attacks against US assets in the country.

The assault sent warning sirens blaring across the diplomatic compound but it was unclear exactly what was hit and how many rockets made impact, the US source and a Western diplomat based nearby told AFP.

There were no immediate reports of casualties.

AFP's correspondents heard multiple strong explosions followed by aircraft circling near the Green Zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission is located.

It was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq.

The attacks are never claimed but the US has pointed the finger at Iran-backed groups within the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into Iraq's state security forces.

In late December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one US contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events.

Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq and days later, an American drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair's death, insisting US troops should immediately leave Iraq.

Sunday's attack came just hours after one of the Hashed's Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a ""countdown"" to ousting American forces from the country.

He tweeted a photograph of what he claimed was an American military vehicle, adding: ""We are closer than you think.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rocket-attack-hits-near-us-embassy-in-iraq-capital--us-military-source-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/rocket-attack-hits-near-us-embassy-in-iraq-capital--us-military-source.html

179,16-2-20,Ties between India and US are 'unshakeable': Wells,"The ties between India and the US are ""unshakeable"", a top American diplomat has said, asserting that the Trump Administration looks forward to an even warmer relationship as Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosts President Donald Trump later this month.

President Trump will pay a state visit to India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi.

""The ties between our countries are unshakeable, and we look forward to an even warmer relationship as"" the prime minister hosts the president later this month, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells tweeted on Saturday.

""The US and India enjoy a close partnership that grows stronger day by day. Together, we are breaking records. For example: we welcomed a record number of Indian exchange students to the US last year and hope to receive even more this year,"" she said.

India, she said, is at the heart of the Indo-Pacific region and plays an increasingly prominent role on the world's stage. ""The US looks forward to partnering with India at every step of the way,"" Wells said.

Ahead of the presidential visit, Alyssa Ayres senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, said that Trump appears to be focused first and foremost on the stadium event and the prospect of very large crowds, then on a trade deal.

""So, I am watching most closely what happens with the ongoing trade negotiations - which despite efforts last fall, did not manage to reach an agreement,"" Ayres told PTI.

""I expect whatever emerges on the trade front to be modest as we are not talking about something resembling even a bilateral investment treaty, let alone a more ambitious agreement,” she said.

But any progress would be a positive step forward, given how tough some of these trade issues have been over the years, she noted. ""The resort to tariff increases on the part of both the US and India has made this a moving target, and it can't be easy for the negotiators,"" Ayres said.

According to Aparna Pande, director, Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute think-tank, Trump's visit to India symbolizes how far the two countries have come in their relationship.

""Prime Minister Modi has the honour of welcoming two US Presidents, one Democrat (Obama) and one Republican (Trump) to India,"" she said.

The two countries have a strong strategic partnership, economic and defense, bolstered by people-to-people ties based on shared values of democracy, pluralism and tolerance, Pande said.

""However, the visit will be high on symbols, visuals and optics but low on substantive deliveries. A genuine trade deal is difficult for two populist and nationalist leaders, each of whom had promised 'Make in America'/'Make in India' as their goal. So, we have a combination of defence deals and minor adjustments from each side on the commercial side,"" Pande said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ties-between-india-and-us-are--unshakeable---wells-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/ties-between-india-and-us-are--unshakeable---wells.html
180,16-2-20,Strange & twisted love,"LOVE AAJ KAL

*ing: Kartik Aaryan, Sara Ali Khan, Randeep Hooda

Rated: 5/10

When one goes to watch a love story, they want it to be simple. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they face some roadblocks but all is well that end’s well. May be over the years watching Yash Chopra films and before than movies like Bobby, Love in Simla and Teesri Manzil have probably spoilt us and in our mind, we have a definition of a love story that is so different from what love means in modern times.

While we agree with director Imtiaz Ali that relationships are so much more complex, because we read too much into it, yet real is different from reel. As a Valentine’s Day release the movie is unable to live to the standards of being anywhere near love. Complex relationship? Check. Two people wanting to be together and yet not together? Definitely check. A mother who wants to live her life through her daughter? Check. A boy who wants a complicated relationship with a complicated girl. Check. The list is endless.

In the middle of this somewhat modern-day love story, is another love story which is a much better story however sad it may be. But at least it is relatable. The love story of Randeep Hooda, who plays Raj and Aarushi Sharma, who plays Leena that is told in flashback is so much more in tune with what constitutes love.

There are millions of people out there who don’t get their happily ever after because they made choices and took a wrong turn and lost their way only to realise they had lost the best part of themselves.

Back to our modern-day Gen Z love birds. After doing films like Luka Chuppi and Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety where Kartik Aryan fit the role to a T, in Love Aaj Kal, the role doesn’t sit well on his shoulders. Just because he is a software programmer, doesn’t mean he has to be a nerd, be a stalker and look uncomfortable and shifty. Sara Ali Khan who made her debut in 2018 with Kedarnath has definitely grown comfortable and plays Zoe well. But some of the credit needs to got to Imtiaz Ali to get good work out of her. As a young woman who grew up to be taught that career is everything, she plays the role — that of a person conflicted and torn — rather well.

If one is looking for a film with a conventional love story, there will be a big disappointment. However, one should not forget, that at the end of it, it is a love story — some lose, some win.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/strange---twisted-love-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/strange---twisted-love.html
181,16-2-20,‘I would like to do period movies’,"AVINASH MISHRA, who plays Shantanu in Zee TV’s Yeh Teri Galiyan, speaks with CHANCHAL GOYAL about the challenges that came with the role, how acting happened and his plan of donning a director’s hat

How challenging was it to get into the shoe of the character?

It has been quite challenging as Shantanu Mazumdar is a mature character unlike me in real life. It was difficult to understand the depth of the character. But having said that it is a fun process where I am getting to learn new things everyday.

From Sethji to Yeh Teri Galiyan, how has your journey been?

It has been a learning experience. I have learnt acting in this period. When I came on board Sethji, I had no experience in acting neither I had done any acting course. I learnt how to act and face the camera on the go. Sethji was like a stepping stone for me.

How did acting happen to you?

My mother used to watch a lot of serials. I followed the shows with her and used to try enacting different characters from the shows. During family get togethers, my parents motivated me by saying that our hero has come. It felt nice. Acting always fascinated me. Then, I started taking part in school plays. I took all the opportunities that came my way. Gradually, my interest in the field increased and I decided to take it up as a profession. I came to Mumbai and started giving auditions. That’s how I got into this field.

What kind of rapport do you share with the co-actors?

Everyone is nice and welcoming on the sets. The environment is so positive and comfortable that we don’t feel that we are working. It is more like having fun. As far as my co-actors are concerned, we are more like a family now. We hang out a lot and we fight a lot.

What kind of roles you would like to experiment with?

I would like to do period movies. The old era actors have an aura in them and it interests me a lot. I would like to explore that.

You are interested in writing. Any plans of stepping in direction?

It is a very creative field. I do have inclination towards writing and direction. The field interests me a lot. I have something in the pipeline which I can’t talk about right now. But for direction, I hope it happens soon.

What is your take on TV actors who are making it big in films too?

Gone are the days when people wanted to see more family dramas. Over years, the audience has changed and so is their thought process. Everyone is getting equal opportunities now which is good thing. There is scope for everyone in films. If the audience likes you, you are here to stay on the big screens. So has happened with a lot of TV actors. Cinema has accepted them with open hearts and we cannot ask for more.

Can you tell us about your upcoming projects?

Currently, this show is my only priority. I have invested my heart and soul in this. I don’t want to distract myself right now.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-would-like-to-do-period-movies----2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---i-would-like-to-do-period-movies---.html

Shukla is best known for TV shows ""Balika Vadhu"" and ""Dil Se Dil Tak"".

He made his Bollywood debut in 2014 with ""Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania"", which starred Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt in the lead.

Throughout ""Bigg Boss 13"", the actor stayed in news for his aggressive behaviour towards fellow contestants. His rivalry with Asim was one of the biggest talking points of the Colors TV show and many fans expected the final competition to be between them.

Besides Sidharth and Asim, four other finalists of the show were Shehnaaz Gill (Sana), Rashami Desai, Aarti Singh and Paras Chhabra.

Shehnaaz, who was known for her closeness to Sidharth, was the second runners up while Rashami came fourth. Paras, hailed as a gamer on ""Bigg Boss"", was the first to leave the house during the finale as he took Rs 10 lakh prize money that the show offered the six finalists.

183,16-2-20,Two more Indians test positive for coronavirus on cruise ship off Japan,"Two more Indians on board a quarantined cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the novel coronavirus even as India assured that it will provide all possible assistance to its nationals on the ship to return home after they test negative in the final coronavirus tests that would begin on Monday.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the ship, Diamond Princess, that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month.

The total number of people infected with COVID-19 on the ship rose to 355 on Sunday.

With two more Indians tested positive, the number of Indians infected with virus on the ship rose to five.

The infected Indians have been sent to medical facilities for further treatment and quarantine.

""As per the data released by the Japanese authorities, two more Indian nationals have tested positive for COVID-19 amongst 137 new cases over Saturday and Sunday on-board Diamond Princess Cruise ship (bringing the total number of cases to 355). Both have been sent to medical facilities for further treatment and quarantine. This is in addition to three Indian nationals who tested positive over last few days,"" the Indian Embassy said in a statement.

It said that health conditions of all Indian nationals currently being treated for COVID-19 are stable and improving.

The Embassy is coordinating with Japanese government and ship management company for health, safety and welfare of on-board Indian nationals, it said.

""The Embassy of India in Tokyo is in constant touch with all the Indian nationals, who are successfully braving out the situation,"" the statement said.

The Indian Embassy in a tweet said that the final tests for the COVID?19 on the ship would begin on February 17 and continue over multiple days.

""Hoping our Indian nationals - braving the situation, to test negative, allowing them to travel back HOME. @IndianEmbTokyo stands ready for all possible assistance,"" the mission said.

The Embassy said it was making efforts for early de-boarding of all the Indians from the ship after the end of the quarantine period and was in discussions with the Japanese government and the ship management company for the disembarkation modalities and welfare of Indians.

The ship was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

The Embassy has also sent an email to all the Indian nationals on board the ship, assuring them of all help and assistance.

They are also requested to follow the Japanese government's health and quarantine protocols, the embassy said on its Facebook page.

The Japanese government on Thursday announced that passengers aged 80 or older will be given the option to disembark the ship if they test negative for COVID-19. Those who meet the age requirement and have pre-existing conditions or are staying in rooms without balcony will be prioritised for disembarkation.

No Indian national falls under this category, eligible for early disembarkation, the statement said on Friday.

The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic climbed to 1,665 after 142 more people died, mostly in the worst-hit Hubei Province, and the confirmed cases jumped to 68,500, officials said on Sunday.

The coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries, including India.

184,16-2-20,"Birthday boy Agarwal back among runs, Pant too finds form","Mayank Agarwal found form on his birthday and Rishabh Pant mixed caution with his customary aggression as India's warm-up fixture against New Zealand XI ended in a draw here on Sunday.

The match was called off an hour after lunch with India reaching 252 for four just 48 overs into their second innings.

Agarwal, who had gone through a wretched period since the second Test against Bangladesh, retired on 81 off 99 balls with 10 fours and three sixes to his name.

To the relief of the Indian team management, Pant played in his customary manner to reach 70 off 65 balls, but also showed discretion when the opposition bowlers were in the midst of a good spell.

There were four sixes -- two each off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi and off-spinner Henry Cooper.

While Sodhi was hit down the ground, Cooper was dispatched over extra cover on a couple of occasions. He didn't curb his aggression though; there were times when he was ready defend against the spinners and also leave some of the deliveries that the Kiwi pacers bowled.

Even though Pant is easily the better batsman compared to his senior Wriddhiman Saha, the innings might have come too late in the day considering that the latter is a better keeper and possibly a more responsible batsman in pressure situations.

The biggest positive to have emerged from the New Zealand second innings is Agarwal's poor run coming to an end. The Seddon Park track easing out was definitely a factor but Agarwal's footwork was more assured as he played some glorious on-drives and pull-shots off fast bowlers.

Before this game, Agarwal had played 10 competitive games including first-class, ODIs and List A matches and couldn't cross the 40-run mark in 11 completed innings. He even bagged a pair against New Zealand A in an unofficial Test match.

Once he had got his form back, he didn't come out to bat after lunch giving Saha an opportunity to score an unbeaten 30, his runs coming mostly against non-regular bowlers.

The Agarwal-Pant pair added 100 runs in 14.3 overs and it also helped that part-timers like Cooper was introduced into the action.

In the morning, Prithvi Shaw (39 off 31 balls) was bowled through the gate by Daryl Mitchell as the batsman left a gaping hole between his bat and pad.

Shaw, though, seemed to have done enough during his brisk 72-run stand with Agarwal, which could put an end to the debate around the opening slot even though the tracks in Wellington and Christchurch could be a test of technique for the flamboyant Mumbaikar.

It was a match that Shubman Gill would perhaps like to forget in a hurry as he was dismissed cheaply for the second time in a row. He scored 8 before Daryl Mitchell trapped him leg before.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/birthday-boy-agarwal-back-among-runs--pant-too-finds-form-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/birthday-boy-agarwal-back-among-runs--pant-too-finds-form.html

186,16-2-20,Kunal Kemmu: Taking vanity seriously a part of actor's job,"Kunal Kemmu's act as a sadistic cop in ""Malang"" has become a talking point among Bollywood buffs. If the actor acquired a brawny look with understated sinister edge for the role, he says he builds his body and look based on the requirement of the role.

""As an actor, I have to cater to the need, if the need is to look fit on-screen, I will do that. Yes, I understand that these days, everyone is trying to build their bodies a"" six-pack abs and so on a"" but we also have to understand that our audience gets inspired by actors, how they look, their body, clothes, and hairstyle. That is why we take vanity seriously, because it is part of our job,"" Kunal told IANS.

Citing the example of his character Michael Rodriguez in Malang, the actor said: ""He is a cop, he has a lifestyle, he has a personality. (Director) Mohit (Suri) told me that he wants to see Michael in a certain way. So, as an actor it is important to look the part. Tomorrow if I play a character that demands a lanky look, I will work on that too. Vanity is the need of the hour but it cannot supersede the character I portray in a film.a

188,16-2-20,"I have done monologues in only two movies, says Kartik Aaryan","It's been almost 10 years but Kartik Aaryan's monologues from the ""Pyaar Ka Punchnama"" series continue to be so popular with his fans that the actor says every time he delivers barely three lines people subconsciously think he is going for it again.

Kartik's one-man acts, where he ranted about his love life, played a significant role in the success of Luv Ranjan's ""Pyaar Ka Punchnama"" (2011) and ""Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2"" (2015).

But the 29-year-old actor asserted he has never delivered monologues beyond these two films.

""Monologues were there in just two films. Whenever I say a three-line dialogue, people think that I'm delivering a monologue. The dialogues in 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama' films were actually monologues. They were both six-page long scenes and 12 minutes in length.

""But it is just these two films out of my whole filmography -- 'Akash Vaani', 'Luka Chuppi', 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety', 'Pati Patni Aur Woh' and now 'Love Aaj Kal'. I have never done monologues. So it is wrong to compare,"" Kartik told PTI in an interview.

The actor said today people have a preconceived notion that he is doling out a monologue as a rant or in a confrontational scene in his films.

""Both the monologues went viral, they were a hit on social media. People have really loved them. Now, it comes subconsciously to people that I'm delivering a lot of monologues.

""In 'Luka Chuppi', I barely had any dialogues because it was a situational comedy. But whenever there is a confrontational scene or a scene where I'm ranting about something, you get a sense that a monologue has started or is about to come,"" Kartik said.

But the actor said he is not averse to delivering monologues, which he considers his USP, if it is an important part of the script.

""If it is an integral part of a film, only then it makes sense and everybody understands that as we are all professionals. It's no harm to work on someone's USP, to encash on it. So I wouldn't hide the fact that people want me to deliver monologues in films.

""But the kind of films I have chosen recently, they didn't have situations where you can fit in a monologue,"" Kartik added.

The actor's latest release was Imtiaz Ali's ""Love Aaj Kal"". Also featuring Sara Ali Khan, the film hit the screens last Friday.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-have-done-monologues-in-only-two-movies--says-kartik-aaryan-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/i-have-done-monologues-in-only-two-movies--says-kartik-aaryan.html
189,16-2-20,I don't plan my career: Vicky Kaushal,"From drama, action to horror, Vicky Kaushal has shown range in different films, but the actor says if he starts charting out his career he will start feeling ""rigid"".

Asserting that he is not the one to jump genres by design, the actor begins the new year with horror film ""Bhoot - The Haunted Ship"".

Vicky scored big in 2018 with films like ""Raazi"", ""Sanju"" and ""Manmarziyaan"" and followed it up with last year's blockbuster, ""Uri - The Surgical Strike"", which also earned him his maiden National Film Award.

""I don't plan my career. I won't be able to justify my work if I'm planning and then sticking to it. It'll make me rigid as an actor. It's important for me to be part of good films made by good filmmakers because people are interested in watching good stories,"" the actor said in a group interview.

Vicky believes he will continue to grow as an actor as long as he keeps doing different kinds of films.

""I hadn't explored action before 'Uri', so there was a hunger in me. In 'Bhoot', I did horror for the first time, so I wanted to learn a lot. I don't want to get complacent that 'This is my home ground now'.""

Backed by Karan Johar, ""Bhoot"" is directed by Bhanu Pratap Singh and spins a fictional tale around the true incident where a cargo ship was stranded at Juhu Beach.

The actor will next be seen in Shoojit Sircar's biopic on revolutionary Udham Singh, followed by Karan's ""Takht"".

Vicky said since ""Uri"", he has been on a beautiful journey and feels more confident about his skills.

""You feel good when you get so much love, confidence of producers and get to work with filmmakers you always wanted to work with. You feel more confident that you're on the right track. 'Uri' was made with a debutant director, I hadn't really done a lot of solo lead films before.

""There was a huge responsibility but the film clicked with the audience. Today, people aren't dependent on the packaging of the film. If there's merit in a film, it'll have an audience,"" he added.

""Bhoot"" is scheduled to be released on February 21.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-don-t-plan-my-career--vicky-kaushal-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/i-don-t-plan-my-career--vicky-kaushal.html

191,16-2-20,Samsung Note10 Lite: Perfect affordable flagship killer,"After launching premium flagship Galaxy Note10+ last year that saw a tremendous response in India, Samsung has now brought the 'Lite' version of the same device with the same experience.

Galaxy Note10 Lite is touted as a good attempt by industry analysts to woo users in a price band currently dominated by the Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus.

Note10 Lite is priced at Rs 38,999 for the 6GB variant and Rs 40,999 for the 8GB variant. Both models come with 128GB internal memory.

After using the device (8GB RAM and 128GB storage variant) for a couple of weeks, here is what we think about it.

In terms of the size, the Galaxy Note10 Lite is just as tall as Galaxy Note10+, but there are certain visible differences.

The major change is lack of premium glass design and the company used plastic instead of glass on Note 10 Lite.

Another difference is the presence of a 3.5mm headphone jack.

Additionally, there is a new square-shaped camera module on top right corner at the back, unlike its predecessor.

Just like the Note10+, all the buttons are placed on the right, including volume rockers and side key which acts as a multi-functional button for accessing virtual assistant Bixby.

The smartphone features 6.7-inch ""Full HD+ AMOLED Plus Infinity-O display,"" featuring a centered front-facing camera.A

The display performs pretty well in both indoors or outdoors and there are two modes -- Natural and Vivid. The Natural mode provides colours that are original while the vivid mode adds a punch to the colours. The device is just perfect for streaming content.

The smartphone sports three rear cameras and a single front camera.

The triple rear camera setup has a 12MP main camera with Dual Pixel autofocus, an f/1.7 lens, and OIS. It is assisted by a 12MP wide-angle camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a 12MP telephoto lens with an f/2.4 aperture and OIS (optical image stabilization) for stabilisation.

The triple rear camera produced natural and good amounts of detail in images. In low light, the device managed to capture details without much fuss which would be a delight for your Instagram followers. The Portrait mode or Live Focus worked well too.

The selfie camera features a 32MP sensor and an f/2.2 aperture. The camera app offers a wide selection of shooting modes, such as Live Focus Video, Super Slow-Mo and Pro.

The smartphone is perfect for shooting videos and during the review, videos shot during the 'Auto Expo 2020' came out decent.

The S Pen, that turns the 6.7-inch Galaxy Note10 Lite into a notepad, worked as we expected to. Samsung has added Bluetooth functionality to S-Pen which also supports air gestures.

The Galaxy Note10 Lite runs Samsung's One user interface on top of Android 10, the latest version of Google's mobile operating system.

The smartphone is powered by in-house Exynos 9810 chipset (it's a 10nm 64-bit Octa-core processor) and we were able to run daily apps like Facebook, WhatsApp smoothly. The device also handled games like Call of Duty and PUBG Mobile effortlessly.

Powering the phone is 4,500mAh battery, which keeps the smartphone going for a day with heavy-to-moderate usage. It also comes with fast charging technology, where a mere one hour charge can provide an entire day's worth of use thanks to the 25-watt charger.

Conclusion: Galaxy Note10 Lite is a perfect affordable flagship killer. Those who love a big screen with S Pen will definitely opt for the device as it brings premium Samsung experience in an affordable price range.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/samsung-note10-lite--perfect-affordable-flagship-killer-2020-02-16.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/samsung-note10-lite--perfect-affordable-flagship-killer.html
