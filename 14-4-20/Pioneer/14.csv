1,14-4-20,Wheat procurement to start tomorrow,"



|

Amidst relaxation from lockdown, wheat procurement by government agencies would start across the state from April 15.

The state government has however imposed conditions for enforcing norms of social distancing at procurement centres to prevent spread of coronavirus.

Wheat procurement was earlier scheduled to start from April 1 and end on June 15 but it was postponed to April 15 due to the lockdown.

The UP government has set an ambitious wheat procurement target of 55 lakh MT for the 2020-21 Rabi marketing season.

Government agencies would procure wheat at the rate of Rs 1,925 per quintal, which is the minimum support price.

Despite unseasonal rains and hailstorm this year, Rabi crop has recorded a bumper yield and farmers need the support of official procurement agencies to purchase their agricultural produce.

If the procurement targets are met then it is likely to infuse over Rs 11,000 crore in rural economy, a big boost for the sagging economy.

During the last Rabi season, the state had failed to achieve its target and could log only about 38 lakh MT of wheat as compared to the target of 55 Lakh MT.

Sluggish procurement in 2019-20 Rabi season was attributed to Lok Sabha elections apart from competitive prices in open market.

Following the poor response last year, the government extended wheat procurement window by an additional 10 days to June 25, 2019 to partly achieve its target and keep wheat prices firm in the market to benefit farmers.

Of the target of 55 lakh MT, Food Corporation of India (FCI) will procure 1.5 lakh MT, while the remaining would be purchased by various state government agencies. For this 5,000 procurement centres across UP have been set up. The bulk of 25 lakh MT and 5 lakh MT would be procured by UP Cooperative Federation Limited (UPCFL) which will run 2,516 centres and UP Cooperative Union (UPCU) with 321 centres respectively. The FCI will operate 94 centres and Food department will operate 715 centres.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/wheat-procurement-to-start-tomorrow.html
2,14-4-20,BJP leader held for bootlegging,"



|

Yet another Bharatiya Janata Party leader embarrassed the party brass when a raid exposed his home-run bootlegging operations during lockdown in Jaunpur on Sunday.

The police arrested the erring BJP leader and his kin.

It was alleged that police and excise officials were in cahoots with him in running the illegal operation and ignored several complaints made by locals.

It was only after a complaint was made to ADM (Finance and Revenue) Ram Prakash that cognisance was taken and police and excise officials raided the house.

To cover up his operations, the accused had put up a board of ‘Guru Singh Sabha’ and organised langar (community feast) for the poor outside his house.

As per reports, residents of Kesari Bazaar Punjabi Market in Kotwali police station area found that BJP’s minority cell secretary Manish Sethi and his family were making money by selling liquor for a premium from their house.

The sale of liquor has been banned during lockdown.

After initial complaints failed to stir the lower rung administration, they complained to ADM (F&R) after which a raid was conducted at Sethi’s place on Sunday and three boxes of liquor were recovered.

Subsequently, Manish Sethi, his wife Chhaya and son Anand were arrested.

After the arrests, some local BJP leaders tried to exert pressure on officials to release him but the locals converged on the spot and put a spanner in their plans.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-leader-held-for-bootlegging.html

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh, accusing it of pursuing vendetta politics against SP workers running relief operations in districts.

Akhilesh said that the police registered FIR against Samajwadi Party workers for “committing the crime of distributing food and other relief material to the people in distress”.

He said, “SP workers are being booked by the BJP government for distributing ration and helping people in this hour of crisis. This is inhuman and condemnable.”

“Daily review of relief work by top echelons of the government will make no material change at ground level. The chief minister and Team 11 will have to establish direct contact with people on the streets. Officials should go to areas inhibited by the poor and make on-spot verification of relief work done by government agencies,” the SP chief said in a release issued in Lucknow on Monday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-govt-pursuing-vendetta-politics--alleges-akhilesh.html
4,14-4-20,Corona suspects flee shelter homes due to hunger in Bulandshahr,"The Bulandshahr administrative officers went into a tizzy after 16 coronavirus suspects quarantined at Janata Inter College in Dibai were found missing on Sunday afternoon.

Fourteen of them, however, returned after some time and when quizzed, made the shocking disclosure that they escaped as they were not getting adequate food there.

However, the district administration denied the charge and said that they were looking for the two missing suspects.

Senior Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Singh said that 103 people were put in quarantine at the centre in Dibai and 16 of them broke the window grill on Saturday night and escaped.

Their disappearance came to light on Sunday afternoon and a case was registered.

None of the escapees have so far tested positive for coronavirus.

Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against six persons, including two assistant development officers posted at Dibai block, for negligence in disaster management and disobeying administrative orders during lockdown in Bulandshahr.

District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said that during inspection of three quarantine homes in Dibai on Sunday, ADO Abhilash Batham and Suresh Chand Arya, gram panchayat secretary Jai Pal Singh, Mohit Bhushan, Nrip Singh, Kripal Singh and gram development officer were found not following orders and giving false information and ignoring lockdown and quarantine rules.

Meanwhile in Moradabad, three areas were sealed after being declared as high-risk zones on Monday.

Karula area with dense population was sealed completely after a coronavirus positive case was found there. Besides, Galshaheed, Mughalpura and Nagphani areas were also sealed after being declared high-risk zones.

A Delhi University student and a native of Karula area returned after attending Nizamuddin markaz meet on March 19 and his location was ascertained through a list obtained from Delhi police. After this, he was quarantined at MIT guest house from April 8.

He had been living in a Delhi apartment after classes were suspended from March 8 and he visited Nizamuddin on March 8-9 and later returned to Karula but did not ensure social distancing in his house. Besides, he met several friends too.

His report came in on Sunday in which he was found to be coronavirus positive.

Chief Medical Officer Dr MC Garg said that everyone was alerted after the positive report and the student’s parents, two brothers, a sister, a sister-in-law and three other minors were isolated and their samples were taken.

Nodal Officer for COVID-19 in Moradabad, Dr Dinesh Kumar Premi said that the area and their house had been sanitised.

“Health department officials have collected inputs about his friends and two teams will contact them and they will be quarantined,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-suspects-flee-shelter-homes-due-to-hunger-in-bulandshahr.html
5,14-4-20,Development works all set to start with safety measures,"Pending development works across the state would be started by ensuring social distancing after the first phase of the lockdown concludes on Tuesday.

This was decided in a meeting attended by ministers and top officials of construction-related departments and chaired by Deputy Chief Minster Keshav Prasad Maurya on Monday.

Giving guidelines to officials on ensuring social distancing, Maurya asked the officials at Vishveshariya Bhawan to sanitise machines and gadgets used on sites to prevent spread of coronavirus.

He gave clearance for restarting the work on Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway and other projects taken up by the Yogi Adityanath government.

Maurya directed that local authorities to ensure that workers and their kin got proper and nutritious food.

“Where residential facilities cannot be provided to workers at construction sites, measures should be taken to keep them in nearby places and ensure hygiene and social distancing,” Maurya said.

UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) Chief Executive Officer Awanish Awasthi said that adequate material and work force were available to restart work on these projects.

It was decided to divide the work separately so that proper sanitisation and social distancing could be maintained.

“If desilting of canal has to be taken up for 500 metres, then work should be divided into 100 metre segments so that social distancing could be ensured. Likewise, work should be first started at the place where labourers stay at the same place. Besides expressways, works relating to highways, railway over bridges (RoB), and various other projects would also be taken up,” he said.

Besides Maurya, Jal Shakti Minister Mahendra Singh, Rural Engineering Minister Brajesh Pathak, Urban Development Minister Ashutosh Tandon along with heads and incharges of Nirman Nigam, Bridge Corporation, Jal Nigam, Rural Engineering, UPEIDA, PWD and other departmental chiefs and senior officers attended the meeting.

The deputy chief minister also inspected the community kitchens run by the Public Works Department and directed officials to ensure cleanliness and hygiene while preparing and giving food packets to the needy. He also lauded the efforts of PWD officials in this direction.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/development-works-all-set-to-start-with-safety-measures.html
6,14-4-20,CM: Admn to be responsible if corona suspects found hiding,"



|

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warned district officials that they would be held accountable and punished if people who avoided COVID-19 test and were hiding from police were found in religious places or houses.

“People with symptoms of coronavirus infection should come forward and report to officials, else stern action will be taken against them if they are identified by the administration. This is the responsibility of district officials to ensure no one hides in religious places,” Yogi said during a meeting with Team-11 in Lucknow on Monday.

The direction is aimed at the missing members of Tablighi Jamaat, some of whom have avoided coronavirus tests and were found hiding in mosques and madarasas. Of 550 cases reported in the state so far, 307 are related to Jamaat members.

The chief minister said that all positive cases of coronavirus in the state were in the hotspot areas. “Now, if a new case other than those in hotspots is traced, then it will be considered as negligence of district administration officials and they will face action,” he said.

A total of 146 coronavirus hotspots have been demarcated by the state government in 15 districts so far. Initially the number was 102 but it went up as new cases came to light.

These hotspots have 1.71 lakh houses and are inhabited by 9.78 lakh people. So far, 401 coronavirus positive cases have been reported from these hotspots and orders have been issued to sanitise these areas.

Besides, every district magistrate have marked hotspots in their respective districts and their numbers have also increased.

Yogi Adityanath complimented the Pilibhit district administration after it became the first district in the state to be declared coronavirus free. There were two COVID-19 patients in Pilibhit, and both have recovered after treatment. There has been no new case in Pilibhit since then.

Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi told media persons on Monday that sanitisation and doorstep delivery were being done in a big way across the state so that people did not suffer due to shortage of essentials.

Awasthi said the chief minister had directed Industry and MSME departments to look into opportunities to attract industrial houses to invest in the state as several big companies had announced to shift their units from China.

“It will be a big opportunity for the state to rope in these companies and help them relocate their units from China to UP,” he said.

In another important development, the government decided that people who were quarantined in shelter home in the district of their village could be sent to their homes after medical check-up. However, people from other districts and states would have to stay in the shelter homes till the completion of their isolation.

The additional chief secretary said that the chief minister had appealed to people to download Arogya Setu app to keep abreast about coronavirus infection, incidence and related information. The app has been downloaded by 40 lakh people in UP so far.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm--admn-to-be-responsible-if-corona-suspects-found-hiding.html

8,14-4-20,A blessing for all,"At a time when healthcare-related information can mean the difference between life and death, DD’s programme Kalyani was a trailblazer in its communication strategies

Once, when there was no electricity in a village in Odisha, there was a scramble to get batteries to generate power, so that the whole community could watch its favourite television programme. No, it wasn’t Big Boss that the villagers wanted to see. Neither was it any of the popular serials or music and dance reality shows. It was Kalyani , a pioneering health programme broadcast by Doordarshan (DD) to raise awareness about preventable ailments like malaria, tuberculosis, water-borne and tobacco-related diseases and iodine deficiency disorders. The programme also featured episodes on leprosy, blindness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health.

First broadcast in May 2002, Kalyani ran for 10 years in nine States, making it the longest-running health communication initiative not just in the country but also globally. However, in April 2012, this bi-weekly show was discontinued and replaced by Swasth Bharat, a similar health programme. However, Swasth Bharat has not struck the same chord with the people as Kalyani did.

At a time when healthcare-related information can mean the difference between life and death, Kalyani was a trailblazer in its communication strategies. Even today, chloroquine tablets promoted by the programme as a measure against malaria are better known as “Kalyani tablets” in many villages in Madhya Pradesh, thanks to the popularity of the programme and the awareness it created on the mosquito-borne disease.

Though it may seem unbelievable but Kalyani even garnered profits and TRPs equivalent to news programmes. It also won prestigious international awards, including the Gates Foundation Award for malaria, Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (for the best communication strategy on HIV/AIDS) and the Rose d’Or, popularly known as the television Oscars for its effective health communication.

A brainchild of DD’s Development Communication Division (DCD), the programme was produced in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). Broadcast on Mondays and Thursdays from 6.30 to 7 pm, the half-hour programme was strategically broken into different segments to include quiz competitions, phone-ins, panel discussions with doctors as well as real life stories. With a catchy title song composed by popular music composers Jatin-Lalit, penned by eminent lyricist Naqsh Lyalpuri and sung by famed singer Kavita Krishnamurty, the programme reached out to thousands in the nine States where health indicators were poor. These States included Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttarakhand.

In Kunra, a small village in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, a group of women were so inspired by Kalyani that they decided to get together to spread awareness in their village. But they didn’t know how to go about it. So they approached the producer of the programme who suggested the idea of forming a “Kalyani club” that would carry forward and implement Kalyani’s messages on health. Within four years of the institution of the club, awareness about HIV/AIDS became so widespread that even schoolchildren in the village knew the different modes of transmission. The women dovetailed information on HIV/AIDS with information on other health programmes like diarrhoea, a major childhood illness in the village (and State), malaria, tuberculosis and reproductive health problems.

But first the Kalyani club members discussed these diseases among themselves to ensure that they were well-informed about them. Then the women went from door-to-door to disseminate information about the diseases. By packaging information about HIV/AIDS with other infections, they were able to bring down cases of malaria and reproductive tract infections (RTI) and ensure special care for pregnant and lactating mothers.

When women of neighbouring villages heard about how the club had engendered development and improved health indicators, they were galvanised into forming similar clubs of their own. Consequently, over 300 clubs, each with a membership of at least 25 women, were formed in 16 districts of Chhattisgarh.

The clubs became an integral part of the lives of women. According to Usha Bhasin, then DCD head, the objective of forming Kalyani clubs was to give a platform to women, particularly those who had never stepped out of their homes, to participate in the process of development. This way the gender component was also integrated in the communications strategy. It also meant dedicated partners in the field to keep hammering the health messages home to ensure their sustainability and total recall. This is exactly what the women of the Kalyani clubs did in their own innovative ways. One such novel tactic adopted by Sunita Vishwakarma, president of Kalyani club in village Raveli in district Durg, was to get the health messages printed on the cover of ration cards. Her rationale was that since all club members were housewives like her and used ration cards, it would be a simple and effective way of getting everyone in the house to see the messages. But Vishwakarma did not stop at ration cards. Having heard on the Kalyani programme that her district had the highest prevalence of HIV in the State, her club members knew they had to stop families from following the traditional practice of tattooing. They knew it would be difficult but they went door-to-door explaining how HIV could be transmitted through unsterilised needles used for tattooing. It took several months and repeated visits before the practice completely stopped.

Data showed that three years after the programme was launched, there was rise in the percentage of women who had heard about AIDS as well as those who knew condoms could reduce chances of getting it. Additionally, more pregnant women began to avail of facilities at hospitals for deliveries. This was a big change, as earlier women used cow dung water to induce labour pain and give birth at home.

After the women of Kalyani clubs got into action, this practice came down and the increase in institutional deliveries helped to reduce maternal mortality and infant mortality.

Although the entire credit for these improvements does not go to Kalyani clubs, some part of it can be attributed to them. This was because at least one member of the Kalyani club was a mitanin (community health worker). This was an integral part of the strategy to enable these clubs to provide health services. In villages where there were no mitanins, the club selected one member for training. This way their credibility as well as skills increased.

The local woman sarpanch (head) and anganwadi (rural child care centre) workers also become members of the Kalyani clubs and this added to their clout.

Thousands of Kalyani clubs formed across these nine States, where the programmes were produced and broadcast, strengthening the Kalyani programmes further.

It was the huge network of Kalyani clubs that translated the words of the programmes into action and brought health and sanitation to these villages. Roads were swept by the community, ponds cleaned of garbage and even a primary healthcare centre, that had remained closed because it was in a Naxal-infested area of Jharkhand, reopened.

In village Kandarka, Kalyani club members were seen as equivalent to medical doctors. When 24-year-old Deepmala was in a dilemma whether to ask her husband to use condoms or not, she sought the advice of Kalyani club members. Dhaneshwari Thakur, 21, an agricultural labourer in Raveli village said that if it wasn’t for the persistence of Kalyani club members who ensured timely vaccinations during his wife’s second pregnancy, she may not have been able to deliver a healthy child. In fact, several newborn girls were christened Kalyani and as the name denotes, they were seen as a blessing or a benediction.

During the time the 3,000 Kalyani clubs were active in the nine States, the percentage of fully immunised children doubled. The number of children (under three years) breast-fed within one hour of birth also registered an increase. In a country where pneumonia, diarrhoea and low birth weight kill hundreds of children every day, informed Kalyani clubs were able to make a difference thanks to the well thought out messages shared by the health programme.

Their success also underlined the importance of putting people at the centre of health communications and engaging their active participation and ownership, something which is lacking in the present milieu.

9,14-4-20,We need all hands on deck,"There are no longer allopaths, homeopaths or ayurveds. They are just people with varying levels of competence in medicine that we need

A lot is known about increasing immunity with homeopathy. However, there is some evidence of homeopathic prophylaxis and treatment against infectious diseases. Historically, homeopathy was used to treat and protect against scarlet fever by its founder, Dr Samuel Hahnemann. It was also famously used during the Spanish flu epidemic after World War-I. In fact, Dr Marino published research about homeopathic prophylaxis against swine flu and dengue in 2008 and 2009. One of the most important pieces of research in recent memory is the prophylactic effect of homeopathic medicines on a disease called leptospirosis (is a bacterial infection that humans contract from animals) in Cuba, published in 2010. A whopping 2.3 million Cubans were provided homeopathic prophylaxis and a much lower than expected incidence of the infection occurred that year.

It is irresponsible to suggest that the cure or vaccine for COVID-19 lies with homeopathy. However, at a time when conventional medicine is clutching at straws to treat patients, homeopathy should also be considered. Awareness of the high safety profile of homeopathy, absence of any adverse interactions with conventional medicines and ease of administration should mitigate all reservations regarding deploying homeopathy. This system has anecdotally demonstrated positive therapeutic effects in cases of dengue, swine flu and SARS. Sometimes homeopaths are called in extremely advanced and life-threatening stages of these viral infections which were novel until recently. These are the points which should inform decisions regarding the use of homeopathy for COVID-19.

This is a seminal time for the national health services. Countries are grappling with the possibility or reality of an overwhelmed healthcare system. In England, final year students of medicine and nursing are being graduated as doctors and nurses respectively. A call for 2,50,000 volunteers has been made and vehemently answered, to assist in the national effort against COVID-19. In the US, all manufacturers who can, are being asked to make medical devices and personal protection equipment (PPE). All forms of medical practitioners are being asked to help in emergency rooms of hospitals. Retired doctors and nurses are being asked to report to hospitals. Families are sewing masks at home and sending them to healthcare centres. In the face of paucity, doctors and nurses are using garbage bags as PPE. Every resource which can be made available for the delivery of healthcare is being commandeered in every COVID-hit country.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently published models to predict the possible number of COVID-19 cases. According to this, 26 per cent of the Indian population may be infected and one in 450 infected individuals may die. This means roughly 35.78 crore Indians may be infected and about 7.9 lakh may die. An article by Brookings India estimates that the number and distribution of hospital beds in India is woefully inadequate and disproportionately distributed for the population it serves. Uttar Pradesh (UP) and other densely-populated States have lower than the national average of Government hospital beds. Therefore, they may not be available everywhere. If every single Government hospital bed is utilised for COVID-19 (which is not possible), India will still not be able to hospitalise even the numbers expected to die of the disease.

The sea of patients who will need clinical examination, detailed history-taking, testing, follow-up care and many other auxiliary measures just to identify a substantial fraction of true cases cannot be handled by Government-run hospitals and doctors alone. The private healthcare infrastructure has been roped in. Steps have been taken to ramp up isolation wards and beds towards this end. Every single nurse, laboratory technician, operation theatre technician, doctor, registered medical practitioner, paramedic and anyone with some basic training in the medical sciences will need to be called upon to do their bit. Recently, the health Ministry roped in Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), anganwadi workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and this added 39 lakh pairs of hands to the effort.

India possesses a unique army of doctors in its alternative systems of medicine. The Prime Minister held a meeting with AYUSH practitioners on COVID-19 but not much has come of it. Homeopaths and Ayurvedic practitioners are trained in most subjects taught to students of conventional medicine. They are also trained to conduct a detailed clinical examination of patients and do so daily. If enlisted in the fight against COVID-19, they will require no additional training, save for being kept informed of evolving guidelines for case identification, evaluation and referral.

Senior practitioners of homeopathy occupy a position of influence in the society they serve. Roping them in and using their positions as thought leaders may increase compliance of public health measures. Shedding any biases that may be at play, the health Ministry should rope in all practitioners under the Ministry of AYUSH with expedience. This can add 7.9 lakh trained healthcare workers. Homeopathy and Ayurveda have central councils and State boards. Guidelines, directions and deployment instructions can be communicated through these channels.

There are no longer allopaths, homeopaths, ayurveds or nurses. They are simply individuals with varying levels of competence in medicine. At a time where citizens are being asked to give up their livelihood and continue an incarcerated existence, there will be few who will refuse a call to help in mitigating the impact that this disease may have on our nation.

10,14-4-20,Coronavirus has turned PM into a team player,"Modi has had three meetings with Chief Ministers on the counter strategy and also lockdown exit, trying to emerge as a team leader and a consensus-builder

Has the Coronavirus pandemic altered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s style of functioning? It certainly looks like it. This is because Modi knows that dealing with the pandemic is not only a test of his leadership but also if he succeeds, it will be his legacy, which will be remembered for long.

Hence, the Prime Minister, who till now was known for being a hard taskmaster and for doing his own thing at the risk of offending the Opposition and the people of the country alike (demonetisation and the abrogation of Article 370 in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir) has shown his softer side to the citizens of late.

He has donned the mantle of the head of a family, a firm yet caring father who must take some tough decisions to lead his family of 1.3 billion through difficult times.

He has been apologetic for the inconvenience and hardship caused to the people during the nationwide lockdown, even though his has been a delayed response to the pandemic and the shutdown was a “just in time” decision despite Congress leader Rahul Gandhi stressing on the need for it many weeks ago.

He has long-last shown a team spirit in dealing with the Chief Ministers (CMs) of the States, irrespective of whether they are BJP-ruled or not. What is even more surprising is the fact that the Prime Minister (who has often been perceived to be unfriendly to the media, particularly those who criticise the Government) has of late taken to appreciating the media for their role in disseminating information on the Coronavirus and the nation’s initiatives. For the first time perhaps, Modi also sought the support of the media and briefed the top editors and media barons on the measures taken by his Government.

Modi has even been taking the leaders of the Opposition into confidence before and after announcing difficult decisions, which is far-removed from his usual style of functioning. Even his oratory shows a persuasive tone.

From January onwards, ever since it became apparent that India was not to be spared the scourge of COVID-19, the Prime Minister has held several rounds of meetings and discussions with various stakeholders in order to find ways and means to fight the pandemic. The first thing he did was to work out a strategy. First he eased the people into a one-day curfew to get them used to the concept. When that turned out to be a success by and large, he announced the 21-day lockdown. He imposed it with apologies and addressed the people thrice in a short span to impress upon them the fact that the nation has to make sacrifices to save the lives of people. Then came the tricky issue of continuing the lockdown for another two weeks, as most CMs wanted it and there was also the question of getting the cooperation of the CMs who didn’t. After all, health is a State subject and without their unstinted cooperation, Coronavirus cannot be tackled. Though Modi had advocated cooperative federalism and competitive federalism in the last six years it was not practised in earnest, as mostly all non–BJP ruled States accused the Centre of playing politics. There had not been too many meetings with the CMs in the last six years, too. So taking them all on board was vital. He had three meetings with CMs on the strategy and also lockdown exit, trying to emerge as a team leader and a consensus-builder.

Modi, on his part, praised different States for their handling of the situation and extensive teamwork. To their credit, the CMs, too, understood the nature of the crisis and the need to show their leadership in their States. Now, as they ask for more funds to tackle the virus, it remains to be seen how Central funds will be distributed.

Earlier, Modi never showed much inclination to deal with the Opposition either in Parliament or outside. The Opposition, too, was divided and weak, with the main party the Congress facing a leadership crisis. Despite that, in a rare gesture Modi showed maturity in taking them into confidence and briefed them on the measures taken by the Government and also sought their views for ways to end the lockdown safely.

The Opposition, including the Congress, did rise to the occasion and give support but there was muted criticism on the plight of the migrant labourers the need for financial relief to the affected and so on. Modi even roped in religious leaders in the fight against Coronavirus and asked the CMs to convene a meeting of religious leaders and ask them to convince their followers to follow the Government’s guidelines.

On the global level, Modi revived the SAARC and established his leadership in the region and other members, too, had to come on board, including Pakistan.

Now the crisis is entering a difficult period. The coming months will be a testing time. There is some exit plan but the real problem is livelihood and the sliding economy. The poor need basics like food, clothing and shelter and this is where the Government should deliver in the coming days. Millions of jobs need to be generated. With an expected huge slide in the global and Indian economy, funds need to be injected without any delay. It is not enough just to disburse money to States. Modi must also ensure that they deliver.

For Modi and the CMs, the present crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The country has to battle the worst-ever pandemic. Modi has underlined during his virtual meeting with the CMs that the Government’s earlier stand of “jaan hai to jahaan hai (life is everything)” has now changed to “jaan bhi, jahaan bhi (life and everything with it.” This should indeed become the goal.

11,14-4-20,The Corona apocalypse,"With nations across the world facing a critical test, India’s vibrant democracy and cultural generosity have created the synergy needed to face the challenges posed by COVID-19

Some contours of the post-Coronavirus world are clearly visible. The nation State has regained legitimacy; the case for free flow of refugees/immigrants across a borderless world has collapsed; and Governments are facing the critical test of whether they can rally their people behind them to overcome the disease. India has performed remarkably well so far, though critics may carp that steps taken in February and March could have been taken earlier. Perhaps, or as Maurice Maeterlinck mused: “It is easy for those who are wise after the event to see what ought to have been done when time has brought full knowledge of what was really taking place” (Wisdom and Destiny).

Doomsday accounts of Cassandras in reputed (sic) Western media and their acolytes in India have proved demonstrably false. India’s vibrant democracy and cultural generosity have created the synergy needed to face the challenges posed by COVID-19. Immediately after the lockdown was announced, civil society across the country rose as one to daily feed millions in every city, without discrimination; virtually every mandir, matham, gurdwara is at work. Five star hotels, dharamsalas and guest houses are providing quality accommodation for overworked medical staff. Even migrant labourers, who were misguided to leave Delhi or panicked and left other cities, have been provided for by citizens along the route.

The Indian Railways imaginatively converted unused bogeys into quarantine facilities. Research labs, companies and young engineers are innovating to make ventilators, splitters for ventilators, fumigation chambers, protective gear for medical staff, smart stethoscopes and sanitiser trunks. Households are making and distributing masks to the needy. In Pakistan, NGOs are denying food and rations to poor Hindus and Christians suffering from Coronavirus, an act that has angered even its Muslim neighbours. Long suffering Balochistan complains of neglect; medical staff lack Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and quarantine facilities are disgraceful. The silence of the hyperactive international media is deafening.

What makes India’s response unique is the Union Cabinet’s decision to reduce salary, allowances and pensions of all Members of Parliament (MPs) by a whopping 30 per cent for one year, with effect from April 1, 2020. The President, Vice President and Governors voluntarily took a similar pay cut as social responsibility. The MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) has been suspended for two years (2020-21 and 2021-22); all money saved will go to the Consolidated Fund of India. This scale of personal sacrifice is unmatched in the world so far; even children have been inspired to give their savings (for bicycle, birthday) to feed the needy.

Most noteworthy is the speed with which India evacuated its stranded citizens, first from Wuhan (epicenter of the outbreak) and then from other cities: Milan and Rome; Tehran; Manila and Singapore. Of the 890 people evacuated from COVID-19-affected countries, 48 hailed from the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh, China, the US, Israel, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru. They were evacuated at the request of their Governments.

Special efforts were made to rescue 124 people quarantined on board the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship off the Japanese port of Yokohama, which included five nationals from Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa and Peru. India did offer to rescue Pakistani students from Wuhan but Islamabad rebuffed; seven Maldivians were evacuated.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with leaders of the South Asian nations and launched a fund, with an initial contribution of $10 million, to check the spread of the pandemic in the region. India also responded to requests for emergency medical equipment from Bhutan and the Maldives. The country also participated in the G-20 video conference to discuss containment strategies and the economic impact of the outbreak, especially unemployment.

Our country has already taken the lead in the struggle to develop a vaccine and on April 11, the Department of Science and Technology agreed to fund Seagull BioSolutions Pvt Ltd to develop Active Virosome Vaccine and Immunodiagnostic kits for COVID-19. As the largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), currently considered a life-saving drug for fighting Coronavirus, India is supplying it to 30 countries, including the US, and ramping up production for future needs. However, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used to manufacture HCQ comes from China, which continued supplies throughout the crisis but in the coming days, we will have to revisit our domestic manufacturing strategy.

The anti-tuberculosis BCG vaccine is emerging as another potential cure. India’s low death rate is said to be due to its universal immunisation schedule that includes BCG and a fair amount of population immunity to malaria. An ongoing research at the New York Institute of Technology shows that countries that discontinued the BCG vaccine (the US, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Iran and the UK) have proved very vulnerable to COVID-19.

Comparisons are undesirable at this apocalyptic moment in human history but given the uncalled for attacks on India from some responsible quarters, some points are in order. India saw its first case of Coronavirus in the last week of January, around the same time as Europe and the US. After initially claiming the disease would go away on its own, US President Donald Trump said on March 30 that administration estimates show that COVID-19 could kill 100,000 to 200,000 people in America and such a toll would indicate that his administration has “done a very good job.” Imagine an Indian leader saying such a death toll is acceptable and surviving. At the time of writing, the world had 1,853,327 cases and 114,250 deaths; India had 9,152 cases and 308 mortalities.

The pandemic has inflicted deep pain, disrupting incomes of those dependent on daily wages, creating havoc among small businesses and manufacturing units and triggering mass unemployment. Sadly, India is looking at an extension of the three-week lockdown imposed on March 25 because thousands gathered at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Nizamuddin, Delhi, including 280 from Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan, to attend a meeting on March 13, defied prohibitory orders.

Many left and spread the disease to other States and countries. Police escorted some to the airport after the March 22 janata curfew but they returned surreptitiously; the authorities were called only on March 30 after one person died. Thereafter, the behaviour of many in hospital has been unmentionable. Yet, Indian medical staff have served them with exemplary dedication and moral fortitude; all talk of the “sectoral targetting of a particular community” is invidious and deserves outright condemnation.

12,14-4-20,The education mess,"It is at a time like this that one wishes India had taken full advantage of its educational satellite

No school student in Wuhan missed classes as they were conducted for 76 days online. So, it is not surprising that in the times of COVID-19, India, too, has refused to let education become a casualty of the virus. Though we did flounder in the initial days, once it became apparent that we would have to go into extended lockdowns and the school/college year could be truncated, we got our act together. Hence, most schools, top universities and premier institutes of excellence like IITs and IIMs are conducting online classes via Zoom, Microsoft Teams and so on. Not to be left behind, even the Delhi Government is holding online classes for its students as is Haryana. Not just this, all schools have even created parents’ WhatsApp groups to keep them informed about the day-to-day schedule. Homework/projects are being given and so are notes. But obviously courses which need extensive practical knowledge will suffer. As far as possible, India is taking advantage of technology to keep the academic sessions on track and doing whatever it can to ensure that a school year is not wasted. That’s why in most schools, exams for students from Nursery to class VIII have been nixed and children are being promoted to higher classes automatically. Also, the summer vacation is being brought forward so that there can be early resumption of an academic session. However, education in rural India is certainly suffering as schools here don’t have access to PCs/tablets or internet connectivity. Even if students are promoted to the next class sans examinations, they would have largely lost out on the learning process, which might make it difficult for them to cope with next year’s syllabus. It is at a time like this that one wishes that India had taken full advantage of its Educational Satellite (EduSat). Launched in 2004, it had a life span of seven years but it died out in 2010 and we could not use even 10 per cent of its capacity. Similarly, the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform of the Government, known as SWAYAM, and a bouquet of direct to home (DTH) educational channels, all of which cover content from pre-school to doctoral studies, are not able to fill the gap they were expected to in the present crisis. Although a large number of secondary students are watching Channel 27 — Panini — and senior secondary students are watching Channel 28 — Sharda of the Swayam Prabha DTH channels — the viewership is minuscule in comparison to its potential.

If the current crisis has taught us anything, it is the need to incorporate edu-tech within the mainstream education system. If we had done it earlier, we would have been far ahead right now. However, what is really worrying in the present scenario is what is going to happen to students in the 12th grade, who have to join college/universities and those passing out from higher institutions who either want to study further or have to join the workforce. Till now, there is no clarity on when pending/unfinished exams will be over. The tail-end Board exams became a casualty to the Coronavirus and were postponed till the end of April, leaving parents and students alike on tenterhooks. Even if they are conducted late May, assessment of test papers and compilation of results will take a longer time. Unless that is sped up, there is no way a clearer picture can emerge before July/end August. What of entrance tests for further studies? While a few colleges/universities like GGSIPU, JNU and so on have opened their registration, there is no guessing the date of tests. While some institutions, like Christ University, have given the dates for their entrance tests, others are still to draw up a schedule. Clearly, those at the cusp of career-setting exams and interviews are under a huge shadow. Besides, they will be expected to cram about a two to three-month academic course in far lesser time. As it is, job placements have been badly affected with packages being revised or offers withdrawn by most global institutions, which are under increasing pressure of protectionist Governments to use home-grown human resource. The best brains will get hired regardless, the competitive stress will be higher on young minds and the average performers will be disoriented by this choke on the system. May be every student should develop an extra skill set or vocation to tide over these tough times.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-education-mess-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/the-education-mess.html
13,14-4-20,Distracted from real thing,"China bank’s stake in HDFC shouldn’t set alarm bells ringing. The Govt must be wary of the Chinese industry

Let us be honest, the collapse in the value of several top-notch companies over the past two months has meant that there are some very good value blue chip stocks available in the market. So, one should see the People’s Bank of China (PBoC)’s acquisition of one per cent stake in the country’s largest private home loan lender, HDFC, as a savvy move. In fact, the PBoC only acquired 0.2 per cent of HDFC this time round, to add to the 0.8 per cent it already held. PBoC, which manages the People’s Republic of China’s sovereign wealth fund, must have felt that the 40 per cent reduction in HDFC’s share price represented good value, just like ordinary punters, who are doubling down on blue chips right now. Shouldn’t India be worried about Chinese investments in Indian companies? Yes it should be but not in this particular case. Because China’s sovereign wealth fund isn’t the single-largest holder of financial assets to own a stake in HDFC. That would be Singapore with 3.3 per cent. In fact, the Abu Dhabi Government and the Norwegian Central bank hold larger stakes in HDFC than China. So China’s extra investment should actually be seen as a vote of confidence in Deepak Parekh, the promoter of HDFC, and in the Indian economy, once we emerge from the Coronavirus episode.

That said, there are some worrying trends about China that Indian policymakers should be wary of. The first is that there is a genuine fear among Indian manufacturers, large and small, that Chinese companies will use their head-start in opening from the lockdown to dump products on them. The Indian economy, particularly small and medium scale manufacturing, may take time, perhaps, till the end of the monsoon, to get back to normalcy. And while countervailing duties are anti-consumer, the Government should look long and hard at imposing such duties if for nothing else to protect manufacturing in the country. Then there is the other issue. Chinese firms have an overweight investment presence in several areas that are strategically important, such as in the financial services space with Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group being the largest shareholder in PayTM. Similarly, in educational technology and several other start-ups, India has allowed wanton investment by China. While Chinese money will bail out the world to a great extent after this incident, India is no exception. We should welcome those investments like the recent one in HDFC. But we have to protect industries and sectors, which are strategically important for India, from undue Chinese influence. This requires strategic thinking as well as an understanding of China, which is buying influence across the world. As the saying goes, there’s no free lunch.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/distracted-from-real-thing-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/distracted-from-real-thing.html
14,14-4-20,Bhoomi pujan for Ram temple may be held digitally,"



|

The much-awaited bhoomi pujan for starting the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, slated for April 30, could be held through video conferencing.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat were scheduled to grace the occasion but are now expected to participate in the bhoomi pujan digitally.

Earlier, it was believed that the date of the bhoomi pujan could be extended due to lockdown but now the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust is mulling to organise a small function on April 30 so that the construction of temple could start once the lock- down is lifted.

Trust general secretary Champat Rai said in Ayodhya on Monday that they were considering several options and holding the function through video conferencing was one of them.

“We can go for a small function through video conferencing and when the situation normalises, a grand function can be held in which the prime minister and other prominent persons could be invited. However the blueprint will be finalised in the coming days,” he said.

Champat Rai further said that sadhus of Ayodhya wanted the bhoomi pujan on April 30. “This is an auspicious day as per Hindu calendar as Baishakh Shukl saptami falls on this day and the saints are eager to do bhoomi pujan on that day,” Rai said.

Earlier on March 25, idols of Ram Lalla and other deities were shifted to a new makeshift temple in Ayodhya in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

On November 9 last year, the Supreme Court had delivered a historic judgement, giving the entire Ram Janmabhoomi land to Hindus for the construction of a Ram temple and had asked the government to provide five acres of land to Muslims for construction of a mosque at an alternative place in Ayodhya.

The UP government has already provided the required land to Muslims on the border of Ayodhya district and it has been accepted by UP Sunni Central Waqf Board.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bhoomi-pujan-for-ram-temple-may-be-held-digitally.html
15,14-4-20,No new COVID-19 case in last 5 days in U’khand,"No new patient of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported for fifth consecutive day in Uttarakhand on Monday. The state has so far reported 35 cases of the pandemic which has affected more than 9000 people in different parts of the country. Out of these 35 patients, seven patients have recovered completely and have been discharged from the hospitals.

Addressing media persons on Monday, the additional secretary, medical health and family welfare department, Yugal Kishore Pant said, “We are lucky that no new case of the disease surfaced in the state in last five days but it does not mean that the virus is not in the area. We have to remain vigilant and continue with the practice of social distancing and washing of the hands with soap at regular intervals till we are free from the virus,’’ he said.

Pant said that the 108 emergency ambulance service has been asked to pick up and drop the patients of suffering from critical diseases. He said that the State Government is continuously improving the health system in the State. “In the 16 dedicated COVID treatment centres in the state we have 110 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. We are in process of adding 325 more ICU beds in these centres,’’ he said.

Pant informed that reports of 149 suspected patients were received by the department on Monday and all of them were found negative for the disease. He said that reports of 298 samples are still awaited. The authorities have so far taken swab samples of 1998 suspected patients for COVID-19 test. On Monday samples of 131 suspected patients was taken and sent to the lab for test. A total of 1814 people are under institutional quarantine while 447 suspected patients in hospital isolation. The authorities have sent 53862 people are in home quarantine in different parts of the state.

The Additional Chief Executive Officer (ACEO) of Uttarakhand Disaster Management Authority (USDMA), Riddhim Aggarwal said that the state government is making its preparation for worst has so far identified facilities to keep 20000 people in institutional quarantine. She said guest houses of GMVN, KMVN, sainik kalyan, ITBP and other departments would be used as institutional quarantine centres when needed. A nodal officer in every district has been appointed to check the preparedness of these centres.

She said that the SDRF and NDRF personnel providing training to those who are in frontline of battle against COVID-19 or are exposed to the disease.

16,14-4-20,No new cases in 100 hrs but vital to maintain alertness: CM,"There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Uttarakhand during the past about 100 hours while seven patients have recovered and returned home. The lab report of two-three patients is likely to be negative in the coming few days.

However, future uncertainties cannot be rejected because ymptoms of COVID-19 are either not being seen or being seen after many days in some cases.

Considering this, it is vital to maintain a high level of alertness, said the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

Interacting with the media at the secretariat after discharging various official tasks on Monday the CM exhorted the people to cover their faces in any way.

Using a mask and maintaining social distancing can provide about 80 per cent safety from the virus.

Referring to the incident at Vanbhulpura in Haldwani when a large crowd had created disturbance when a Government team went to administer a health check to a Maulvi in a mosque on Sunday, the CM said that considering the situation he had ordered imposition of curfew in the area. Stressing that the State government will take strict measures for containment of COVID-19, he appealed religious leaders, intelligentsia and social workers to assist the state government in raising public awareness. At a time when COVID-19 pandemic is afflicting the world, long term alertness is required to tackle this problem, he said.

Regarding the lockdown, Rawat said that the Central government had formed a committee for exit plan for the lockdown.

A uniform policy will have to be implemented in the nation to tackle this crisis.

The State government is awaiting the Centre’s exit plan and will take a decision according to it.

The lockdown will have to be eased gradually and Uttarakhand government has also given its suggestions to the Government of India regarding this. In general, the opinion of all the states is same regarding the lockdown, added the CM",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-new-cases-in-100-hrs-but-vital-to-maintain-alertness--cm.html
17,14-4-20,"Decision on reopening Char Dham, other shrines after Central directions: Maharaj","The State’s Tourism and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj said that a decision on reopening the Char Dham and other shrines will be taken on the basis of directions from the Central Government. He said this while chairing a video conference with officials concerned regarding the scheduled reopening of the shrines.

As per religious beliefs and ancient traditions, the Char Dham shrines- Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath along with other important shrines including Tungnath and Bhavishya Badri are closed during the winters and reopened during the summer.

However, due to the nation-wide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, the authorities are in a dilemma regarding the reopening of these important shrines. The reopening of the Char Dham and other important shrines is slated to begin later this month. Maharaj held a video conference with officials concerned to review the possibility of reopening these shrines.

He said that presently there are no COVID-19 positive cases or contagion in Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag districts- where the Char Dham shrines are located. “After reviewing the possibility of reopening the Char Dham shrines, Tungnath and Bhavishya Badri, we are sending this in writing to the Central Government.

Whether these shrines can be reopened or not and if opened will only the necessary priests be allowed or nobody will be allowed to enter the shrines- all this will depend on the Centre’s decision and a decision will taken as per the Centre’s directions.

A decision on opening the Dharmshalas on the Yatra route will be taken after the lockdown is lifted.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, what is being considered presently is how to initiate ritual worship while maintaining social distancing without devotees after opening these shrines. The media will be informed about the decision taken in this regard,” said the Minister.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/decision-on-reopening-char-dham--other-shrines-after-central-directions--maharaj.html

19,14-4-20,Pritam pitches for loan waiver of farmers,"Reminding the BJP of the promise of loan waiver for farmers made by it ahead of assembly elections of 2017, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, Pritam Singh has said that it is high time when the BJP Government of Uttarakhand should fulfil this promise. Talking to media persons at the state headquarters of the Congress party on Monday, Singh said that the lock-down has adversely affected the farmers and in such a scenario, the Government should waive off their loans. “It is very important to keep the morale of the farmers’ high and their economic condition stable as they are bread providers of the country. The State Government should increase the minimum support price of the food-grains and clear pending dues of the sugarcane farmers,’’ he said. Singh added that the crop of wheat is ready in the fields for harvesting so the Government should start procurement centres.

The PCC president said that complaints of Asha workers and sanitation workers non availability of face masks, sanitizers and other equipment are unfortunate. He said that all those who are in frontline in the fight against novel Coronavirus should be provided good quality masks, sanitizers, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and gloves in sufficient numbers. All these corona warriors should be adequately insured.

Singh said that under the prevailing circumstances it is highly unlikely that the world famous Char Dham Yatra would commence on scheduled dates. He said that the shopkeepers, those associated with hotel industry and others would be hit hard by the adverse effect of COVID-19 on Yatra this year. Singh said that the economy would get the battering and it is for the government to make plans so that it comes back on track.

The PCC president also demanded that more ration per unit should be provided to the poor. He said that the ration provided per card is not sufficient. “The daily wage earners and those doing small jobs and business are the hardest hit by the lock-down. Under the prevailing circumstances arrangement for more food grain should be made in the ration shops so that such families tide over the situation,’’ he said.

The PCC president said that all the followers of the Tablighi Jamat who had attended the congregations in Delhi and other areas should come forward and help in fight against the COVID-19. He said that getting tested is the only way of preventing the spread of infection.

On extension of lock-down enforced in the state to break the infection cycle of the disease, Pritam Singh said that he is in favour of extension and the state government too has recommended the same to the union government. He however added that the state government should not remain dependent on the union government and make its own decisions based on the situation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pritam-pitches-for-loan-waiver-of-farmers.html

22,14-4-20,"CM for rabi procurement in MP except Indore, Ujjain","Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the Rabi procurement on support price will be started in all districts except Indore, Ujjain and Bhopal from coming April 15 in the State.

During this time, procurement should be ensured by following social distancing and all other protective measures in the mandis. Chouhan said that this time farmers are being given facility to sell their foodgrain directly to the traders even outside the mandis.

The Chief Minister was reviewing the preparations for Rabi procurement work in the state along with senior officials in Mantralaya. Chief Secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, Secretary Public Relations P Narhari and all concerned officers were present in the meeting. The Chief Minister instructed that farmers should be informed through SMS about the date and in which shift they have to come to the support price centers to sell their crops.

It should be ensured that farmers come and sell the crop on the same day and in the shift. Such arrangements should be made that about 10 to 12 farmers are called daily for procurement.

It was informed that due to the present circumstances of Corona, this time the farmers are being given the facility to sell their grain directly to the traders on support price through ‘Sauda Patrak’. This system lasted till 2009 in the state, after which it was discontinued. In addition, farmers will also be able to sell their produce at ITC procurement centers. It was informed at the meeting that for the purchase of gram, lentil and mustard at support price, procurement centres are being built outside the mandis this year as well.

29,14-4-20,Covid-19 pandemic is far from over; lessons from history can’t be overlooked,"One has been witnessing a sense of déjà vu in social media among some sections of Indian population and few of the people from Uttarakhand--particularly motivated as no new case has surfaced in last five days in the State- about the possible control of deadly novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the not too distant future.

This euphoric feeling perhaps emanates from the fact that our national casualties in comparison to some of the worst hit countries of the developed western world are relatively marginal. We are indeed in the midst of one of the worst crises that the world has witnessed. History will judge us harshly if we do not learn from the lessons of fighting similar pandemic of the past and superficially venture into arriving at any hasty conclusion on the prevailing crises of COVID-19 pandemic.

Spanish flu in 1918 accounted for approximately 1.8 crore deaths in India and 10 crore from various countries across the globe. India lost about 6 per cent of its population and 1/5th of the total death toll was from India. This Spanish flew had destroyed the Indian economy. The pandemic had spread with unimaginable speed and India under the British rule then was highly unprepared to deal with such a deadly pandemic. The healthcare system had completely broken down. Most of the medical efforts then were busy attending to WW I casualties. The Spanish flu came to India through a ship deployed for world war efforts and which berthed at Mumbai port. The deadly disease spread like a wildfire and the overcrowded city of Mumbai became a fertile ground for spread of this pandemic further across the length and width of the nation. As per some accounts, banks of river Ganga were swollen with dead bodies and even shortage of wood was experienced for cremation of the deceased.

Yet another case is that of a fatal pandemic of bubonic plague (1346-1353) also known as black death which accounted for death of more than 10 crore people in Eurasia and north Africa. It is estimated that this plague pandemic had killed more than 30 to 60 per cent of population and took almost 200 years for Europe to recover to the same population level. Black death was terrifying and highly contagious. It could spread by merely touching the clothes of the infected people. The deadly disease could consume even healthiest of persons in a matter of few hours.

This happened in the era when medical facilities were primitive and countries were ill equipped to take care of the seriously ill who needed life support system. In absence of any remedy people even back then were advised to remain inside their houses, not to visit crowded areas and pay attention to personal hygiene.

To control the pandemic of the past, first and foremost important point was that leaders needed to be innovative and proactive in utilising the resources at hand and initiating measures to alter the situation. The efficient and proactive officials of Venetian controlled port city of Ragusa were able to slow the spread of bubonic plague by keeping the arriving sailors through various ships in isolation until the symptoms of the disease completely disappeared. This was a perfect example of social distancing to avoid spread of the plague. The sailors were initially held on board their ship for 30 days (a trentino), a period that was later increased to 40 days or “quarantine”, a term much discussed during the present crisis as well.

During such crisis there is always a trend of receiving various suggestions and solutions from effected populace. Even during past pandemics the solutions which worked during the crisis were decisive leadership, separation, isolation and social distancing. Economic cost in such crises is generally humongous but if weighed against human lives it was a cost worth paying.

The cases of pandemic during centuries ago did not have the modern tracking, tracing and hospital equipment available today. However, use of facilities solely depended on the resourcefulness of the leadership but the issues which remain common with the past pandemic are very much relevant including social distancing in present day scenario.

So far, India has managed the crisis relatively well. The major reason for this has been pre empting the situation, clear/assertive and unambiguous leadership at national and state level followed by proactive government machinery from the centre to state and right up to the village level. Measures institutionalised for prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response are being pursued with unprecedented alacrity in India and with the present system in place, the phases of recovery and reconstruction also are expected to be attended to with equal clarity and proactiveness.

But, we have to be cautious before we start celebrating. These pandemics, even if controlled once, have uncanny knack of resurfacing later. There are waves of recurrence before it finally dies down or some curative solutions are available. The vaccination for the pandemic is likely to take a year more before it becomes effective. Earliest medicine may be available by June/July 2020, as per indications available through various media. The countries which pre-empted well and were decisive and proactive in implementation of the measures like South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany and India have done relatively better than the countries who were laissez faire and had too much of over confidence in fact bordering arrogance on their medical capabilities. We still have a long path to tread and we need to continue to observe the protocol for considerable time ahead so as to get rid of the deadly virus. We should be cautiously optimistic and we have not reached the point where we can start celebrating based on the relative trend the disease is indicating.

30,14-4-20,Steel industries in state doubtful about restarting production,"At a meeting here on Monday, steel manufacturers across the state through a video conference, unanimously expressed their inability in restarting production under the present scenario.

Notable, the state government on Sunday had granted permission to industries for restarting economic activities.

The permission granted was under certain conditions and a consent form had to be filled up by the entrepreneurs.

In wake of the conditional permission to restart economic activities in the state, the industries’ associations called an urgent meeting and discussed the conditions to start their businesses.

President of Urla Industries Association Ashwin Garg told The Pioneer that it was unanimously decided in the meeting that they cannot restart production due to a number of constraints.

“As inter-state transportation was disrupted due to which labourers would not be able to come amid the fear of the spread of the pandemic and as no financial package was given for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) has been declared by the state as well as the Centre, we are unable to restart production,” Garg told The Pioneer.

In the present scenario, only micro and cottage industries could restart production and not the small or the medium scale industry, he said.

“As 90% of the industries are steel-based, and with no likelihood of the nationwide lockdown being lifted, restarting these enterprises will need much more time and a financial stimulus,” Garg said.

“The state and the Centre have to bailout the industries financially in such an economic shakeup due to the coronavirus outbreak.”

Meanwhile, the members of the different associations who were present at the meeting included the Chhattisgarh Steel Industries Association, the Chhattisgarh Rerolling Mill Association, the Sponge Iron Association and the Urla Industries Association.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/steel-industries-in-state-doubtful-about-restarting-production.html
31,14-4-20,NINL executives demand shares transfer,"The Neelachal Executives’ Association (NEA) has urged for resumption of production in the ailing Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) claiming that the plant is capable of achieving more than 100%-capacity utilisation.

NEA president Avijit Koley and general secretary Ajit Pradhan have written to MMTC CMD Sudhanshu Pandey pleading for his intervention in saving the NINL.

Notably, the MMTC is the major shareholder of the NINL, which is at present in dire straits.

The NEA has demanded sufficient infusion of funds for day-to-day operation of the NINL as all the production units of the steelmaking firm have been shut down.

The NEA has said that discontinuation of production has thrown future of the employees and workforces into darkness and contractual workers are losing their jobs. While salary payments of employees and executives have been delayed and irregular, this is a cause of worry.

The NEA has requested the MMTC to impress upon the Union Government for transfer of shares of NINL held by the MMTC to other PSUs like SAIL or RINL. It would be a transfer of shares between two Government entities; and as the NINL is having a rich iron ore deposit, it would justify the transfer as SAIL and RINL require the raw material.

The NINL is having a captive iron ore mine; and it would cater to the requirement of the plant, which can be scaled up to 10 million tonnes per annum.

With the NINL shares transferred to SAIL and RINL, it would allow more investment in future modernisation and expansion plans.

As the Ministry of Steel is setting up a steel hub in Kalinganagar, it would be in synergy with the policy of the Union Government. While the SAIL has set a capacity expansion target of 50 MTPA by 2031 and RINL expansion target of 16 MTPA by 2031, both of the steel PSUs need not go for land acquisition for capacity expansion.

The NINL has 2,500 acres of undisputed land, which is sufficient for a 10-MTPA expansion.

The NINL’s merger with SAIL or RINL would be a step towards the Union Government’s objective of a single public-sector-owned steelmaker to bring efficiency, productivity, profitability, faster investment decision, get cheaper funds for expansion and reducing dependency on Government, said sources.

Over 10,000 people are depending on the NINL directly and indirectly and they pin a lot of hopes on the firm, which has a huge potential.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ninl-executives-demand-shares-transfer.html

36,14-4-20,Lockdown hits fish farmers' livelihood,"The countrywide lockdown in force since March 24, 2020 has drastically affected the normal life and business of people, including fishermen and fish farmers.

Many States have exempted fisheries and aquaculture activities, including transportation of fish, from the lockdown restrictions.

The Odisha Government has also taken such an initiative to ensure availability of fish in the market.

The Fisheries and ARD Depatment has, however, asked to maintain social distancing in the fish markets.

It is learnt that local administrations are providing all cooperation in that regard.

For example, the Nimapara municipality and the BMC here have allowed all the retail and wholesale fish markets to open on daily basis.

To maintain the social distancing among buyers and sellerd, mongers in the fish market, circles have been drawn with 1.5 metre gap between them.

Fish buyers have also been advised to wear mask. Fish vendors and fish buyers are encouraged to have cashless transactions by UPI mobile payment system.

Similar arrangements are seen in various parts of the State.

Odisha is an important maritime State in India with 45 million population equivalent to that of Spain.

Majority of Odia people relish on fish and per capita fish consumption is about 15.50 kg which is higher than national average of 9 kg.

Though Odisha is the 5th largest fish producer in India with annual average production 750,000 metric tonne, still it imports nearly 50,000 MT of freshwater fish every year.

Lockdown and closure of National Highway has stopped transportation of fish from Andhra Pradesh to Odisha.

Due to this, price of locally priduced fish has gone up by about 30%. Prior to lockdown, Catla and Rohu prices were about Rs 170-180 per kg at retail markets and now it is selling between Rs 220 and Rs 250 per kg. The traditional fishermen continue selling fresh fish in markets within 30-50 km distance from fishing points.

But the prices of marine fish in coastal districts have not significantly changed.

However, most of the fishermen with mechanized boats (trawlers, purse seiners, gill netters, etc) have stopped fishing due to non-availability of ice, restrictions on movements of transport vehicles and fisher workers etc.

This has brought down the fish exports to other States and affected the livelihoods of fishermen.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-hits-fish-farmers--livelihood.html

45,14-4-20,Punjab Govt mulling to open liquor shops,"Punjabis may soon have a reason to say cheers. For, the Punjab Government is not averse to the idea of considering the opening of liquor vends locked down during the Covid outbreak period.

Facing a loss of crores of rupees due to closing down of liquor vends, the Government is now waiting for the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday morning — the last day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown to arrest the coronavirus spread.

It has been learnt that the government is seriously considering opening the liquor shops, especially after Assam and Meghalaya have decided to open the vends for seven hours from Monday amidst the nationwide lockdown.

Annually, Punjab earns about over Rs 5,000 crore from the liquor trade. As per the new excise police, released in January this year, the Government has fixed a target of Rs 6,250 crore as against the anticipated collection of Rs 5,676 crore for 2019-20. The Government projected that the excise revenue is expected to go up from Rs 5,150 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 5,676 crore in 2019-20.

“There is nothing so far…But the decision in this regard could be taken in the next few days. There are many queries in this regard and this issue will be discussed in the coming days. The nationwide lockdown period ends on April 14, and we are waiting for the PM’s address tomorrow,” a senior government official told The Pioneer.

The official said that Centre is giving some relaxations considering the situation. “So we are just monitoring the situation and will decide accordingly,” added the official.

It has been learnt that the Government has already prepared a master plan to chalk out the way of opening the liquor vends amidst the corona scare.

Available information suggests that the Government has asked the contractors and dealers to be prepared as the Government may soon announce the decision to open vends.

The main decision for the Government is regarding how many vends would be allowed to open, for how many hours, at what time, and how many people would be allowed at one point of time, among other things.

Only recently, during the lockdown period, stray instances of liquor smuggling and illegal trade of opening vends during curfew restrictions have also come to light.

Initially, Punjab has listed liquor vends under the “essential services”, drawing sharp criticism. After media uproar, the Government took the decision back.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-govt-mulling-to-open-liquor-shops.html

However, on the charges of different offences, around 640 new inmates have also been lodged in jails after the national lockdown imposed on March 24, Haryana Director General (Prisons) K Selvaraj said while talking to The Pioneer over the phone.

Earlier, in pursuance to the directives issued by the apex court, the State Government had decided that convicts will be released on parole for six weeks and undertrial prisoners on interim bail for the same period, to de-congest jails and to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Selvaraj said, “Prisons have suspended visitation and largely restricted the movement of inmates within their jails. We are taking all precautionary measures and have given necessary directions to the jail authorities in view of Covid-19 outbreak.”

Jail authorities have been asked to ensure that anyone who reports fever or flu will be shifted to the isolation ward with the recommendation of the medical officer, he said, adding they have been directed to make an arrangement of sanitisers at the entrance and ensure that no one is allowed to enter without using it. The meeting of inmates with their family members has also been cancelled till the next order and no outsider is allowed in the jail premises.

The DG (Prisons) said that till date, as many as 641 new inmates facing various charges have been lodged in different jails of the State since March 25.

A quarantine ward has been set up in all the jails for the newly lodged inmates. These inmates were being kept under observation for 14 days before being transferred to other wards in the prison after being certified by the jail medical officer.

Selvaraj further said that in accordance with the directions issued by a high-powered committee set up for the purpose, as many as 4198 prisoners were released on parole or interim bail or personal bond or regular bail who were confined in several jails across the State.

Among the other steps taken are the suspension of visits and group activities like yoga. Inmates have been asked to refrain from being in large groups, he added.

Sources in jail headquarters said that in some districts, authorities concerned are spraying sodium hydrochloride for disinfecting their jails. Fogging inside the jail has also been ordered to check the spread of malaria. Sanitiser bottles have been placed outside all barracks and inmates have been directed to use them before entering barracks after meals, they added.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered all states to set up high-level panels which would consider releasing all convicts who have been jailed for up to seven years on parole to decongest jails in an attempt to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.

In Haryana, a high-level committee was constituted, which has arranged for the release of around 4,198, and added that many are yet to be released.

They fear that their condition would further deteriorate as the lockdown period in Odisha has been extended till end of April by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.

Not only the farmers, other people associated with the cultivation and profession, including transporters, are sitting idle having no hope to keep their profession afloat. It may be noted everyday hundreds of tons of betel leaf are transported to several places of India including Delhi, Mumbai, Banaras , Azamgargh etc since the betel leaf demand of Baleswar is high in the market because of its special quality and taste.

The betel leaf is highly perishable and on regular basis they are plucked and then processed before being sent outside. North Baleswar betel leaf has a special demand within the State.

Since there is no scope of transporting betel leaf thesedays, they are not plucked from the yards, leaving them to rot. Sources said hundreds of acres of betel vine yards are facing similar fate.

Betel vine culture is one of the main sources of income of the area. Not only the farmers, but also the people associated with it are bearing the brunt of the lockdown.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/b---swar-betel-vine-farmers-hit-hard-as-leaves-rot.html

58,14-4-20,When teachers can best serve by counselling,"Sir, Namaskar. Kebe amoro exam hebo? (When will our exams be held?)”. I am receiving this question from the students at least twenty times every day. Their voices tremble with fear and anxiety. I can understand their plight as their exams were stopped abruptly and there is uncertainty about their future dates.

I convince them as far as possible and assure them that I will intimate them the exam dates as soon as they are announced. Ours is a remote district of Odisha where literacy rates, transport and communication are very poor and it is difficult to pass on the information to the students at short notice.

Students are the worst hit by the nationwide lockdown unable to adjust with the sudden change in their routines. The uncertainty of the conduct of examination and evaluation is taking an emotional toll on the young minds.

The abrupt closure of the examinations results in restlessness, anxiety and irritation among the students. The Class 12 students are away from one subject for completion of their examination. The second and fourth semester degree examinations scheduled to be held in April are postponed indefinitely. Till now I am convincing the students that soon after the lockdown, i.e., April 14, the authorities will take a decision and by the end of April, their examinations will be completed. Now Odisha became the first State in the country to declare extension of lockdown till the end of April. I am preparing myself how to answer the queries of the students and counsel them not to panic.

The University of Calcutta issued a notification that the Psychology and Applied Psychology Departments will provide free counselling services to all students of the university. It released a list of names of professors and their contact numbers whom the students can contact during a specified time. Many reputed colleges and universities are also following the same in the interest of their students. Even the parents can also avail the counselling services. There is every need to introduce the same thing in Odisha.

No doubt, the lockdown and home stay are in the interest of the public and it is prudent to follow the Government guidelines. But the tender age of the student may not understand the severity of the pandemic. The mental pressure on the young minds can be better understood by the teacher and every teacher should act as a counsellor.

During the lockdown period, it is the best thing a teacher can do and there by contribute for the development of mental health of the students. At the same time, they have to clarify their doubts online, if facilities are available. They must be made academically and mentally strong by injecting confidence and hope.

59,14-4-20,Haryana CM praises NGOs’ role during crisis,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday praised the role of NGOs during the times of crisis and expressed hope that they will contribute in a big way in the fight against coronavirus.

He said that Government and various other agencies are putting in their best efforts to control the spread of coronavirus but whenever there have been natural calamities like floods, earthquakes or this new type of pandemic, the role of NGOs at such times is appreciable.

In a televised address to the people of Haryana, in which he updated them about the

Covid-19 situation in the State, Khattar said as per rough figures, the total number of registered and unregistered “social organisations or NGOs” in Haryana was nearly 30,000.

“During the times of crisis such as the present one they also put in their efforts,” he said, expressing hope that they will contribute in a big way in the fight to eliminate coronavirus.

He said NGOs can get in touch with Deputy Commissioners concerned and will be facilitated in whatever way they want to contribute in the present situation.

Khattar informed that so far the government had distributed 90 lakh food packets and 4.80 lakh ration kits to the needy people during the lockdown period.

He also said that more and more people were coming forward to make their contributions towards the Haryana Covid Relief Fund. So far, donations worth Rs 75 crore have been received, he said.

Haryana MLAs cutting across parties have donated their one-month salary already towards the Fund and agreed to take 30 per cent pay cut for one year. Former MLAs and pensioners are also contributing, he said. Khattar said coronavirus pandemic has affected millions of people globally. “If I talk of our country, we are still in a safe zone where we can manage things. We have to now ensure that it does not spread in community.”

With Haryana so far reporting 182 coronavirus cases, Khattar said that 115 among those were the Tablighi Jamaat members.

Referring to his recent video conference meeting with Prime Minister Modi, Khattar said the nationwide lockdown was expected to be extended by another two weeks and Haryana is prepared to enforce it.

He again indicated that worst-affected Covid districts of Nuh, Gurgaon, Palwal and Faridabad will be placed in the red zone meaning stricter restrictions, while those with fewer cases will be placed in the “orange category” while the places where there have been no or a few cases will fall in the “green category”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-cm-praises-ngos----role-during-crisis.html

61,14-4-20,"10 more cases in Punjab, including police officer","With 10 new cases reported on Monday, Punjab’s tally stood at 180. Among these, a Punjab Police cop was also tested positive.

Maximum six cases were reported from Pathankot taking the district’s total tally to 22. Besides, two positive cases were confirmed from Jalandhar and one from Ludhiana. So far, the state has recorded total 12 deaths.

The media bulletin said that a total of 3,858 swabs of the 4480, sent for testing, came back negative. Authorities are now awaiting the results for 446 suspected cases.

Currently, the State has 139 active cases, with one person who is critical and on ventilator support, while total 25 have been cured, including two on Monday.

Meanwhile, Pathankot reported six more positive cases on Monday evening. While the mdia bulletin, released by the State Government, have count of two cases, the others four are yet to be added to the official list.

While two are the contacts of Pathankot’s newspaper hawker, who tested positive couple of days back, other four were from the secondary and tertiary level contacts of district’s first positive case, who died in Amritsar hospital.

“Two positive cases have been reported from pathankot including the sister and sister-in-law of newspaper hawker of Anandpur Rarra Rajkumar. Out of 17 samples from the hawker, 15 came negative but two are positive. The standard operation procedure of quarantining people and contact tracing is being done,” said a senior government official.

The other four positive cases are “from secondary and tertiary level contacts of Rajrani’s (the original positive case, now deceased) maid and head of another household, which maid used to also visit”.

Meanwhile, a person working at Lovely Professional University in Kapurthala’s Phagwara was brought dead to the civil hospital. Only a day ago, a student from the institution was tested positive.

The health authorities have sent the samples from the patient for testing.

LUDHIANA ACP NORTH, ON DUTY AT SABZI MANDI, TESTED POSITIVE

Ludhiana’s Assistant Commissioner of Police (North) Anil Kumar Kohli has tested positive for coronavirus and is currently on ventilator. The worrying factor is that the cop was on duty at Ludhiana’s sabzi mandi, where people come in large numbers, in the last week of March.

Kohli began to show symptoms of fever and cough in the beginning of April, and was admitted to SPS Hospital on April 8.

His first swabs sent for testing about four days ago were tested negative, but samples sent on Sunday came back positive, said the authorities.

With the new case, Ludhiana now has 11 positive cases.

The officer’s test report has sent alarm bells ringing. The district health authorities are now struggling to identify and isolate the people with whom the cop would have came in contact over the past few days. Besides, the authorities are also taking samples of the people, who visited him in the hospital in the past few days.

“Thirteen close contact of the ACP, including his staff and security, have been quarantined and his wife and son have been sent into isolation and samples have been collected. We are further exploring the contacts of the ACP to know the source of contract. It is too early to say that he got infected from sabzi mandi. We are tracing all the possible contacts and trying to find the source,” said Ludhiana Civil Surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga.

“The 52-year old Gazetted Officer of Punjab Police, posted in Ludhiana, tests positive. He had been unwell for the past week and has been put on ventilator.

62,14-4-20,"Provide succor to 1L migrant workers, CM urged","The Jan Adhikar Manch on Monday urged the State Government to coordinate efforts and action with other State Governments and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to enable migrant workers reach their homes and families. Until then they need to be given two square meals a day along with safe and healthy living arrangements. Equally ensure that they are paid all wages that are due to them by making the necessary arrangements, the Manch said in a letter to CM Naveen Patnaik.

Citing that over one lakh of workers from Odisha are stranded in other States who in utter difficulties are pleading to the Odisha Government to help them reach home, the Manch requested the CM to come to their rescue. It apprehended that the migrant workers may attempt to reach there on foot repeating the odd experience of past if immediate measures are not taken.

""It is extremely concerning that workers are succumbing to depression and anxiety in this atmosphere of fear around the pandemic. They are simply biding time without any work in relief camps and shelters only longing for their families or near and dear ones.

65,14-4-20,Mins seek FIR against Ludhiana MLA for remarks against police,"Four Punjab Cabinet Ministers on Monday sought the registration of a case against Lok Insaf Party MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains for allegedly terming the attack on cops in Patiala a response to the “high-handedness” of police.

A Government release here said the Ludhiana MLA in an interview to a media channel said the Sunday attack was a ""public backlash against the police high-handedness"" over the past a few days.

Assistant Sub-Inspector Harjeet Singh's hand was chopped off with a sword while three other Punjab policemen and a mandi official sustained injuries when a group of Nihangs attacked them after being asked to show curfew passes at a vegetable market in Patiala district.

Terming the MLA's remarks ""provocative and vile"", state ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Aruna Choudhary and Vijay Inder Singla asked the LIP leader to give up the police security if he did not trust the force.

Bains should be immediately booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 as well as relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, the ministers demanded in a release here.

They also demanded an unequivocal apology from Bains for “politicising the issue for cheap publicity” at a time when the entire police force was “putting their own lives at stake” and working round the clock for providing relief to the needy.

“The Punjab Police is doing a commendable job in these critical times and what happened on Sunday is reprehensible. By casting aspersions on our police force, Bains has rubbed salt into the wounds of the bravehearts,” Health Minister Sidhu said. Randhawa said this was time to fight the enemy unitedly and support the frontline warriors.

This is gross disrespect to the great sacrifices being made by our policemen in the line of duty and should be condemned by all, said Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla.

Terming it yet another attempt by Bains to grab the limelight, minister Aruna Choudhary said, ""By giving such statements, he is encouraging anti-social elements to attack police.”

Meanwhile, police on Monday arrested three people for provocative social media messages in the wake of the attack.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mins-seek-fir-against-ludhiana-mla-for-remarks-against-police.html
66,14-4-20,Modi draws global accolades for fighting Covid-19,"Stressful times are the period to test the resolve of a people. I don’t think a nation State, a legal entity, can be tested in the times of dire distress. The legal and constitutional mechanism may fail; the leaders may do just the minimum expected out of them or simply abandon the people to their own fate.

But the resolve, coherence and the collective strength of a people can be tested at the time of war, famine, pestilence and pandemics. A country either rises to its highest values of sacrifice, brotherhood, nationalism and cooperation during the crisis or they simply collapse and recede into the background of history. The recent Corona pandemic offers examples of both.

While diseases, especially unknown ones, can originate anywhere and anytime, the responsibility of the nation where such a disease originates is above all supreme in terms of timely alarm to the world and seeing to it that all efforts are made to contain as well as cure it with full disclosure to the world.

How much China fulfilled this international obligation will be known in due course of time. What is most important now is to contain a virus which seems to go out of control. Well, at least in Europe and the USA, it definitely seems so.

While President Trump hides behind his characteristic bravado despite bodies piling up in New York morgues and Italy, Spain, the UK and France resign to their fate and virtually stop fighting, China after exporting the virus to the world is now poised to export the means of containing it and expecting a hefty profit, both financial and political. However, only one nation stands tall in the fight against the dreaded menace.

India under the visionary Prime Minister Narendra Modi is drawing praises from all around right from the WHO to all the leading nations of the world for its deft handling of the situation. When the USA, also a democracy, refused to impose a lockdown, India, in an unprecedented move brought the nation to a standstill for 21 days in just a matter of 48 hours.

The naysayers this time did not even raise a murmur. Their experience during demonetization and GST roll out solidly behind them, they knew the country would rally behind the wisdom, good governance and charisma of Modi Ji. And exactly that’s what happened. A nation of 130 crore people just followed the sagacity ofModi Ji’s decision and stayed home.

This perhaps saved countless lives as would be clear in the days to come. The redeeming feature is that at the time of writing this article as we enter 18th day of the lockdown, all essential services are functional, all essential commodities are stocked in plenty and the lifeline of cargo movement by train is in full force.

It’s no mean feat to bring the whole railway network to a standstill and yet motivate people to work for cargo shipment. Same with other services such as banking, telecom and cooking gas and oil. The Prime Minister being tech savvy, took to the digital media to extensively monitor and direct the massive operation and ensured that his Cabinet colleagues follow suit.

Most praiseworthy is the complete coordinated efforts of the Centre and the State Governments. It is unprecedented in the country to see a coordinated effort from village to the State capital, from the State capital to the national capital; the same views, the same strategy, the same information is flowing seamlessly. It was possible only because of the ‘India First’ attitude of the Prime Minister. Only the purpose matters irrespective of political compulsions.

A few things stand out in this crisis. The traditional Indian attitude of feeding the needy is in full swing and both Government and individual efforts are showing results. The earlier success of having a Jan DhanAccount of every poor family showed dividends as the Government could send money instantaneously to the poor and needy. It’s the largest DBT operation in the world. The Government tackled the problem from all angles.

Announcing a Rs 1.70 lakh crore package for the needy to easing the financial burden of the business class by making available cheap credit of Rs 3.7 lakh crore and taking care of lakhs of migrant labourers, Modi Ji has not left any stone unturned to come out of this crisis successful.

A salute is due to our health system workers from doctors to nurses to paramedics and health entrepreneurs who left no stones unturned to fight the menace often putting themselves at risk. All because of a greater sense of purpose and sense of sacrifice instilled in them by our Prime Minister.

Above all, the world is now looking up to India as a leader in the fight against the pandemic.

President Trump thanked India; Brazil and Israel followed suit and India showed generosity and consideration when it allowed supply of much needed drugs to the affected countries without any precondition.

The strategy of lockdown, containment and an appeal to the good sense of people along with the symbolism of prayer and thanking the frontline workers is showing results as India is even now at stage two of the pandemic and the absolute number of positive cases as well as fatality is the lowest in the world per million of population.

No doubt, the economy will take a toll and it is a herculean task to restart the economy once the lockdown is eased. But the leadership of Modi Ji will find a way so that the pain of recession and resetting the economy remains minimum.

In true Antodaya principle, he has taken care of the last man in the queue first and will continue to do so till the spectre of the pandemic is over. The nation salutes the visionary leadership of Modi Ji and his core team of Ministers, experts and bureaucrats.

Separate FIRs have been registered against them under Section 115, 153-A, 188, 269, 270, 271, and 505(2) of Indian Penal Code 1860, Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Section 54 of the National Disaster Management Act 2005.

“These men have been indulging in hate propaganda through the social media posts. Bhupinder Singh had posted his inflammatory interview to Apna Sanjha Punjab Facebook TV channel, in which he had defended the Nihang action, but had later removed it,” said Gupta adding that the police was also examining the legal options for taking action against the Facebook channel.

Bhullar and Davinder had also posted inflammatory and vicious statements on Facebook, lauding the Nihang action and provoking the nihangs to come forward to launch more such attacks, said Gupta.

Warning of prompt and strict action against anyone found indulging in such hate propaganda and inciting violence against the police or any other section of the society, the DGP said that nobody would be allowed to spread hatred or disturb the law and order in the state at any cost.

“The entire police force is working day and night to enforce the curfew and also provide relief to the needy in these trying circumstances, triggered by the spread of Covid-19,” he pointed out.

73,14-4-20,First Baisakhi in decades without revelry in Punjab,"This was perhaps the first Baisakhi in decades where the usual revelry and rush of devotees in gurdwaras was missing in Punjab on Monday as people in the state largely celebrated the festival indoors amid a curfew imposed to check the spread of coronavirus.

Baisakhi is one of Punjab's biggest festivals and celebrates the foundation of ''Khalsa Panth'' (Sikh order) by the tenth Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh. It also marks the start of harvest season.

The Golden Temple in Amritsar, one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, saw very few devotees turn up to offer prayers. Normally, nearly two lakh devotees visit the shrine on Baisakhi.

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages gurdwaras in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh, had deployed teams to discourage people from assembling.

SGPC Chief Secretary Roop Singh said the committee has never stopped anyone from coming to the Golden Temple but one should not violate the government orders. Barricades were put up at all roads leading to the Golden Temple to prevent overcrowding, a police official said. Similar scenes were witnessed at the Takht Kesgarh Sahib in the holy city of Anandpur Sahib, where the Khalsa Panth was founded in 1699.

Managements of several other gurdwaras across Punjab and state capital Chandigarh politely refused to let devotees inside. They appealed to them to offer prayers at homes and listen to ''gurbani'' online.

""In the morning, devotees came to pay obeisance but we requested them to offer prayers at their homes and also asked them to listen to kirtan on our YouTube channel. We have shared a link of the video of kirtan with devotees on our WhatsApp group,"" said an official of Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib in Chandigarh.

He said normally, 60,000 to 70,000 devotees visit the shrine on Baisakhi every year. ""It is for the first time that we could not enter the gurdwara,"" a disappointed devotee said. The management of a gurdwara in Ludhiana said it will reach out to those on the front-line of the fight against coronavirus on the occasion of Baisakhi. ""We will distribute langar among front-line workers, including policemen and medical staff,"" a gurdwara official said.

80,14-4-20,Ranchi looks for its own ‘Hart Island' for Covid-19 victims,"As coronavirus cases witness an unprecedented surge in Jharkhand, Ranchi has started looking for its own Hart Island – a historical plot of land where New York City has buried thousands of pandemic victims, right from the days of Spanish Flu to COVID-19.

While the body of Ranchi's first COVID-19 victim was denied place in Ratu Road Kabaristan over fear of transmission among locals on Sunday, the district administration on Monday was still in the process of finalising an area where victims of the lethal virus could be cremated sans public uproar.

""We have identified four places where such bodies can be buried. However, the final call is yet to be taken,"" said Ranchi Sub Divisional Officer Lokesh Mishra. ""These areas are away from residential localities,"" he added without disclosing the spots.

The 60-year-old Hindpiri man, who died on Sunday while undergoing treatment at the Isolation Ward of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), was buried at a graveyard in Hindpiri after locals at Ratu Road raised a ruckus over the administration's decision of burying his body at Ratu Road Kabaristan.

Social distancing went for a toss on Sunday after hundreds of locals took to the streets in protest against the burial of the Coronavirus victim at Ratu Road Kabaristan. Police had to intervene to pacify the infuriated crowd, and eventually, there was calm in the neighbourhood only after the body was taken away.

""We did not expect such backlash from people. The decision of finding an isolated place for burying COVID-19 victims was taken in the wake of the public uproar,"" said a police official who was deployed near the Ratu Road Kabaristan on Sunday.

The Bombay High Court recently ruled that bodies of the victims of COVID-19 can be buried in the city, provided the burial ground is away from residential areas. The court quashed a Bombay Municipal Corporation's circular that said that the bodies of COVID-19 victims have to be buried outside the city.

Although Ranchi has witnessed only one COVID-19 death so far, finding a safe burial ground for future casualties seems to be a daunting task given the rapidly expanding nature of the city, sources said. ""We have to look for baron lands, preferably in places that are unlikely to see constructions in the near future,"" said an official in the district administration, requesting anonymity.

Though Ranchi District Administration assured the people that there will not be scarcity of essential commodities in the market due to lockdown but due to closure of supermarkets like Big Bazar, Reliance Smart and others, the people of cities like Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Bokaro and Hazaribagh are become dependent on local grocery shops as a large number of people living in these cities were buying their grocery items from these supermarkets.

Pandra Krisi Bazar Samiti is one of the biggest wholesale markets of the State for grocery items and food grains but at present it is witnessing less footfalls than before announcement of lockdown.

A local grocery shop owner at Gandhinagar of Kanke Road, Vinod Gupta said that there is huge scarcity of grocery items in the wholesale market due to scarcity of supply. ""Due to closure of supermarkets now most of the customers are coming at local grocery shops but we are not able to meet their demand due to scarcity of the items. The Government has provided online facility system for those consumers who used to buy from supermarkets,"" he added.

""Scarcity of transportation have caused the supply bottleneck of grocery items and another big reason is irregular functioning of wholesale market as most of the grocery items wholesalers are not opening their shops as earlier,"" said Gupta.

A wholesaler at Pandra Krishi Bazar Samiti, Vinay Aggarwal said that there is scarcity of food grains and other grocery items in the wholesale market due to lack of transportation.

""The transporters also want to be safe from the epidemic so in this period they are not running their trucks. The epidemic also created panic among wholesalers as many of them are not opening their shops due to fear"", he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/small-grocery-shop-owners-feel-effect-of-supply-bottleneck.html

95,14-4-20,Child pornography demand spiked since lockdown: ICPF,"Following the 21-day lockdown across the country in wake of coronavirus outbreak, there has been alarming rise in demand for child pornography material, said India Child Protection Fund (ICPF) on Monday. The report has been submitted to the Women & Child Development ministry for further action.

According to Nivedita Ahuja, the spokesperson, ICPF, since the lockdown, online data monitoring websites are showing an increase in demand for searches like ‘child porn’, ‘sexy child’ and ‘teen sex videos’.

“This is a blatant violation of the directions of the Supreme Court, and a violation of national policy. Pornographic websites are playing hide-and-seek with Indian law and judiciary by simply changing their website URLs. The Government of India must urgently crackdown on child pornography and also initiate a global dialogue for an international convention against child sexual abuse material,” she said.

ICPF has released a report titled ‘Child Sexual Abuse Material in India’, a research of child pornography demand in 100 cities in India like New Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Indore.

As per report, the overall demand for child pornography was an average of 5 million per month in 100 cities on the public web during December 2019, which has now spiked. The report reveals up to 200 per cent increase in demand for violent content which shows children “choking”, “bleeding” and “tortured”.

“This suggests that “Indian men are not ‘satisfied’ with generic child pornography and demand violent and exploitative content,” said the spokesperson.

“Metro cities like New Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai, besides many Tier II and capital cities, which are seeing a sharp increase in Coronavirus cases, have been red-flagged by the December study as hotspots for child pornography. The organisation has implored authorities to further step up online vigil in these cities for potential exploiters,” said the spokesperson.

ICPF has also warned that the alarming rise indicates millions of paedophiles, child rapists and child pornography addicts have migrated online, making the internet extremely unsafe for children. “Without stringent action, this could result in a drastic rise in sexual crimes against children,” the spokesperson further added. When asked about increased traffic about child pornography, a senior Delhi Police official said that they haven't reviewed the report yet. Delhi Police cyber cell keeps an eye on such predators as they pose risk to children, the official added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/child-pornography-demand-spiked-since-lockdown--icpf.html

In an attempt to provide relief during ongoing lockdown to poor and needy among women the Center Government had announced that women account holder under PMJDY would get Rs 500 per month for three months in their accounts from the month of April to meet their essential requirements during the ongoing lockdown. There is a total of 1.33 crore bank account holders in the State under PMJDY scheme, out of which 73 lakh are women account holders.

State Level Bankers’ Committee, Deputy General Manager, Sanjib Sarkar said that in order to help fight against the global epidemic COVID-19, the Central Government launched the 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana' (PMGKY) for the poor. He said that till Monday more than 19 lakh women account holders have withdrawn Rs 500 for the month of April in the State and at an average of two lakh account holders per day withdrawing their money from the banks.

""Under this scheme, the account holder under PMJDY will get Rs 500 in their bank account every month for the next three months for the women account holders.

98,14-4-20,"No relation between rising temp, Covid-19 spread: Doctors","With the mercury levels gradually increasing, medical officials claim that there is no established relation between the variations in temperature and the spread of Coronavirus.

Officials also state that the disease COVID-19 which is currently present across the globe is affecting humans in varying local climates. The exact temperature to deactivate the virus is still unknown.

“The hypothesis that rising temperatures will kill the virus has failed. In some states across India where the temperature is being recorded at above 40 degree Celsius, COVID-19 is still prevalent. There are many viruses which are temperature sensitive like influenza. But probably Coronavirus is not so. Although the number of cases in India is less compared to the other countries but the temperature theory is still not valid,” said Deputy Chief Medical Officer (CMO) CCL Hospital, Dr Rajkumar.

Dr Rajkumar further stated that with Coronavirus spreading people should keep themselves hydrated during the summer months. “If an infected person gets dehydrated then the chances of complications increase. The virus spreads through human contact so social distancing and hand hygiene needs to be maintained. Till the time a vaccine is not developed for this virus, social distancing and isolation are the only medications. For all messages on social media suggesting the intake of malaria medicines, lemon juice and the likes, it has not been proven that any such thing can reduce the chances of contracting the infection.”

The frequency of almost all infectious diseases reduces in the summer season but the same cannot be stated for COVID-19.

“It has been observed that Coronavirus has been equally effective in cold as well as torrid countries. The infectivity rate has been constant so it cannot be established that it will reduce in summers. As compared to winter or rainy season, the incidents of all communicable diseases generally reduce in summers but the same cannot be stamped for COVID-19. A reduction in the number of cases can be expected but it cannot be said that the gross incidents of infection is low in summers,” said Dr SS Harsh, CMO, Central Government Health Services. He further emphasised that viruses are very sensitive particles outside the human body and can be easily destroyed with soap water and disinfectants like alcohol. The guidelines set by the government need to be strictly adhered to.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/no-relation-between-rising-temp--covid-19-spread--doctors.html

“The IAS officer, who gave the ‘safe passage” to Wadhawan, was reportedly appointed in the Home department during the previous regime by Fadnavis himself. By giving special concessions to the Wadhawans, the same IAS officer has tried to put the state government in an embarrassing situation. That it was Fadnavis who had reportedly handpicked and appointed as Principal Secretary (Home) explains who must have been behind the IAS officer concerned who asked him to give travel permission to Wadhavans,” the Saamana editorial said.

“We are pretty sure that a conspiracy was hatched to defame MVA government. If the state government were to help out Wadhawans, then why did the Satara district officials apprehend them and put them under quarantine in Mahabaleshwar? Why did the Satara district (in which Mahabaleshwar falls) ignore the travel permission letter given by Gupta and act legally against them?,” the editorial said.

“The Maharashtra government has sent Gupta on compulsory leave. Since he is an Indian Administrative Officer, it is for the Centre to initiate further action against Gupta. One should ask the Centre as to what action it will take against Gupta and who was actually prompted him to issue to travel permission to the Principal Secretary (Home),” the Saamana said.

It may be recalled that on April 10, the Maharashtra government sent Principal Secretary (Home) Amitabh Gupta on ‘compulsory leave’ for allowing the scam-tainted Wadhawan brothers and their family members to travel from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday during the ongoing lockdown period.

The State government instituted an inquiry against Gupta under Additional chief Secretary (Finance) Additional Chief Secretary Manoj Sonic it also registered an offence under sections 188, 269, 270, 34 of IPC and section 51 (B)of Disaster Management Act and section 11 of Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations”.

Twenty three members of Wadhawan family were detained by the police at Panchgani on Thursday night while travelling in five cars from Khandala to another hill station of Mahabaleswar in Satara district of western Maharashtra. They were carrying with them a “To whomsoever it may concern” issued to them by Gupta on his personal head, permitting the Wadhawans and others to cross from Khandala in Pune to Mahabaleshwar in Satara.

“This is to just inform you that following are well known to me as they are my family friends and travelling from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar for family emergency… Hence you are here by informed through this letter to co-operate with them to reach their destination,” Gupta’s letter

read.

The Saamana editorial said that one hand the ordinary people were adhering to the lockdown norms and staying at home, while on the other there could not be different set of rules to the moneyed people. “This proves that the people are vigilant and the government machinery is not corrupt. If anyone in the government is involved in the Wadhawan safe passage incident, they would have stopped the Satara district officials from taking action against the Wadhawans,” the editorial said.

“The Uddhav Thackeray believes in the rule of law. It treats everyone equally. It does not differentiate between the poor and the rich. The people ( Fadnavis and other BJP leaders) who are speaking out now will shut their mouth, if one goes into the details of the party to which Wadhwans donated money to.

No one should stoop this low to malign the Government,” the Saamana editorial said.

Advocating against indulging in politics during this crucial period, the Saamana editorial said: “There will be lot of time for politics in future. On one day on Saturday, as many as 1000 people tested positive for Coronavirus in the country. The Maharashtra government is waging a war against Coronavirus. The Opposition should not indulge in acts like this”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sena-slams-fadnavis-for-safe-passage-of-wadhawans.html

113,14-4-20,Gurudwara Saheb feeds over 500 in Chennai daily,"Even as the number of persons afflicted with coronavirus continues unabated in Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai and Coimbatore, the officials sit back and look skywards in the hope of a decrease in the spreading of the disease.

While the Tamil Nadu Government is struggling hard to feed the poor who have lost their livelihood because of the national lock down, there are organizations in Chennai city which ensure that the helpless and infirm are well fed. Leading the army of warriors who fight disease and hunger in the metropolis is Sri Guru Nanak Sat Sangh Sabha Gurudwara Saheb in T-Nagar, the main commercial center in Chennai.

The Gurudwara Saheb feeds more than 500 persons in the city through the office of Chennai Municipal Corporation. Thrice daily, a mini truck owned by the Corporation could be seen coming to the Gurudwara for collecting the delicacies and nutritious food prepared in the kitchen by experienced hands. The menu include rotti, chappathi, vegetable curries, fried rice and lassi. Since the closure of eateries in the city as part of the lock down, the Gurudwara has started cooking vegetable fried rice as well as sambar rice (staple food of Chennaites) to be served among the beneficiaries.

“We serve food free of cost for all those who come to the Gurudwara for prayers. There is no limit to the number of people who come here for worship and we offer langhar to all. Moreover we provide heavily subsidised accommodation for those who come to Chennai for medical treatment,” said Amandeep Singh Kandhari, president, T-Nagar Gurudwara Saheb.

Even as the priests read from the Guru Granth Saheb and Bhai Joginder Singh Ji Rair’s mellifluous voice resonates the atmosphere with “Wahe Guru Naam..”, the Gurudwara staff (all volunteers from the Sikh community in the metropolis) are busy serving food to the hundreds who have lined up in the dining room. Sardar Kandhari and Sardar Harbans Singh are ensuring that the diners maintain social distance specified by medical experts.

Prof Poojappura Krishnan Nair, literary icon from Kerala, stands with curious eyes watching the goings on in the Gurudwara. “This is the real service to God Almighty and humanity . Our scriptures mention that Annadaanam Mahaadaanam ( Offering of food to the needy is the biggest service). You get a divine feeling here because of Gurbani and the serving of food,” said Prof Nair who is of the view that there never can be an India without the turbaned Sikh community.

Sam Rajappa, veteran journalist , says that Gurudwara and Sikh community members were always in the forefront with their helping hands whenever Chennai or Tamil Nadu was struck by disasters. “I myself was rescued and rehabilitated by the Silkh community during the 2015 floods that devastated Chennai. I stayed at the Gurunanak College for almost a fortnight and the Gurudwra officials looked after us nicely. Ill never forget those days. We always pray that all districts in Tamil Nadu should have Gurudwaras,” said Sam.

Dr S Kalyanaraman, director, Saraswathi Research Centre, said that service and sacrifice are the hallmarks of the Sikh community. “They continue to do it generations after generations. The service they do to the society is unique and serene,” he said.

Sardar Kandhari and members of the Sikh community observed Baisakhi, the day Shree Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the 10th Guru of the Sikhs laid the foundation of Panth Khalsa on Monday. “For us it is Thanksgiving Day -thanking God for the abundant harvest and also praying for future prosperity,” said Kandhari. “

“Let the Sikhs prosper so that they would guard us from all kinds of attacks, attacks from across the borders as well as invasion by species like corona virus,” said Prof Nair.

The Ph.D scholar in the microbiology department of Lucknow's King George Medical University (KGMU) said he was helping his parents in agricultural operations in their fields in their village in Khammam district when he received a call from Doctor Amita Jain, who is the head of the department of microbiology.

She said that he was needed in testing samples for the infection that was spreading rapidly.

Ramakrishna said he immediately packed his bags and even lied to his parents, who were worried about their son travelling during the corona crisis.

""I initially told my parents I will be staying with my friends from the village who are studying in Hyderabad. Now, of course, they know I am working in Lucknow in this fight against coronavirus and they are fine with it,"" he said.

Ramakrishna said he reached Hyderabad on March 22, the day of the Janata Curfew when all routes were blocked. Before daybreak, in the early hours of March 23, he headed to the airport.

Ramakrishna said he was stopped by the police, but when he explained the reason for travel, they helped him get there. He caught a flight to Lucknow and ever since he has been working tirelessly to test more and more samples each day.

The Ph.D scholar had completed his project six months ago and had returned to his village. He was working on his thesis and also helping his parents in farming.

Jain, head of the department of microbiology, KGMU, said she had called four of her students for help.

Two were in Lucknow and joined immediately, while Ramakrishna and one more person were away and returned to help.

Jain said, ""I told him that we need him if he can help. He asked for an hour to convince his parents and within an hour, he said he is coming. These research scholars helping out in testing is a commitment that can be compared to soldiers reporting to their battalions in times of war. This time, these soldiers are wearing masks.""

Ramakrishna, who hit the limelight when Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted about him, insisted he was just doing his duty like all the others in the medical fraternity to fight this pandemic.

The virology laboratory at the KGMU has been testing suspected samples for COVID-19 under the leadership of Jain since February.

According to the report, in existing securitisation transactions, the loans are not considered to be the assets of the originator/servicer which may be NBFCs or banks. “Hence, the servicing NBFCs/ MFIs / banks would not be able to extend the moratorium to the underlying loans in these securitisation transactions unless they have obtained consent from the investors,” the rating agency said in a report.

If the originators or servicers extend the moratorium to the borrowers of the underlying loans in these securitisation transactions without the prior approval of the investors, then it would be considered as a breach of contract, the report said.

The retail inflation, which is factored in by the RBI to arrive at its monetary policy, has been on decline since last month. The previous low was 5.54 per cent in November 2019.

The Government has asked the RBI to restrict the inflation around 4 per cent, with a margin of 2 per cent on the either side. The retail inflation was ruling above 6 per cent since December 2019. As per the data, inflation in eggs was 5.56 per cent during March as compared to 7.28 per cent in the previous month. The rate of price rise in vegetables was 18.63 per cent as against 31.61 per cent in February. The rate was also slower in fruit prices as well as pulses and related products.

However, the inflation in milk and products was slightly higher in March over February. The data also showed that inflation in fuel and light segment was marginally higher at 6.59 per cent in March. This compares with 6.36 per cent in February.

The NSO, in the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), said price data are collected from selected 1,114 urban markets and selected 1,181 villages by the field operations division in a uniform weekly roster.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/retail-inflation-eases-to-5-91--in-march.html

124,14-4-20,Car sales collapse in March,"The total number of vehicles sold (wholesale) in India between April 2019 and March 2019 stood at 21.55 million, as against 26.27 million in the same period the previous year, a decline of 17.76 per cent.

While the numbers for March 2020 are horrendous, this was on expected lines as many showrooms for all sorts of vehicles had shut their doors by the end of the first week of the month. And with factories shutting down a few days ahead of the nationwide lockdown, production tumbled as well.

The country’s largest carmaker, Maruti-Suzuki India Limited saw production down to 91,602 vehicles, a decline of 32.27 per cent in March 2020 compared to the same month last year, but domestic sales dropped 45.98 per cent to 78,344 units.

Across the board the numbers were terrible for the industry, and of all the larger manufacturers only Hyundai Motor India could claim that they did not have as bad a year as the others, with annual domestic wholesales declining just 10.99 per cent to 485,309 cars and the Korean manufacturer could even claim that they might have ended the year even as sales of the second-generation Creta launched just before the lockdown got stalled by recent events.

At the same time, new entrants such as Chinese manufacturer MG Motor could claim to have had a decent 2019-20 with sales of 21,954 units of their Hector SUV but the real winner of the year could be seen as Korean manufacturer Kia which sold 84,903 units of their Seltos SUV.

However, despite some success in the passenger vehicles segment, the true bloodbath happened in the commercial vehicles market. With the rollout of new BS6 vehicles making consumers question the need to buy new trucks as well as the unintended consequence of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) leading to higher efficiencies with existing fleets thanks to smoother border crossings, made even smoother with the widespread implementation of the FASTag at tollgates, saw cumulative commercial vehicles sales decline 28.75 per cent for the year 2019-20 and sales for the month of March collapsing 88 per cent.

The news for India’s large two-wheeler industry was also dismal. Overall sales for the year were down 17.76 per cent at just 17,417,616 units and March 2020 was the first month in almost a decade where total unit wholesales were under one million motorcycles. Every large manufacturer felt the pinch of declining domestic sales. The only silver lining for the entire Indian automotive industry was provided by the 7.3 per cent rise in two-wheeler exports from India to 3,520,376 units on the back of Bajaj Auto which contributed over half the export volume.

Industry sources do not expect sales to recover in 2020 after a dismal run of over 18 months since the last quarter of 2018.

The Federation of Auto Dealers Associations put together another appeal to the Prime Minister with a list of demands including a waiver of interest on loans during the lockdown period as well as interest subvention.

They also demanded that since the virus attack was a ‘health pandemic’ that the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) pay employees salaries. They also made some supply-side suggestions to boost demand in the wake of the pandemic such as a reduction of GST rates for cars, an extension of the depreciation benefits and a scrapage policy.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/car-sales-collapse-in-march-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/car-sales-collapse-in-march.html
125,14-4-20,"Zomato, Grofers deny merger talks as e-grocery enters top gear","Gurugram-based food delivery platform Zomato and e-grocer Grofers on Tuesday refuted reports that they are in acquisition or merger talks after reports surfaced that Zomato may acquire Grofers for nearly $750 million.

Flush with funds, Zomato currently partnered Grofers for the delivery of essential items – along with other FMCG and grocery stores -- to meet the surge in demand amid social distancing and nationwide lockdown that has now been increased till May 3.

In a statement shared with IANS, Zomato said that the company has partnered with Grofers, along with other FMCG companies, local groceries stores and modern retail chains, to pilot its grocery delivery service.

""We are not aware of any other conversation with Grofers,"" a Zomato spokesperson added.

A Grofers spokesperson added: ""The news on the merger is a pure speculation and completely untrue. Grofers is the country's biggest online grocery retailer and has been growing at 2x every six months"".

After initial hiccups, Zomato has started grocery delivery in over 80 Indian cities with supplying essentials like aata, dal, milk, vegetables and items and for this, it has partnered existing players like Grofers.

According to Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group, CyberMedia Research (CMR), companies are looking at creative pivots to stay relevant by pursuing new growth opportunities on the back of the new coronavirus pandemic.

""Expanding into near adjacencies is a given for companies, such as Zomato. From Zomato's perspective, a partnership or acquisition of Grofers would provide it a good leg-up in its competition with Swiggy to win big in the grocery delivery segment,"" Ram told IANS.

Online food and grocery retail is expected to touch $10.5 billion by 2023, according to a recent report by Bengaluru-based market consulting firm Redseer.

Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal who is bullish on online delivery of essential items, has said that their delivery network in the country is only second to India Post.

""We we are putting in every effort to make sure that we put it to good use to serve the community. We'd like to thank the government authorities, grocery stores, FMCG companies & other start-ups that have come forward to partner with us and support the community in this endeavor,"" Goyal said recently.

Zomato is currently valued at nearly $3.2 billion while Grofers' valuation is around $650 million. Menlo Park, California-based Sequoia Capital is a common investor in both the delivery platforms.

Zomato in January acquired Uber's Food delivery business in India – UberEats -- in an all-stock deal for nearly Rs 2,500 crore. Uber has 9.99 per cent stake in the Goyal-led food delivery platform.

Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the largest investor in Grofers, is also likely to pump in around $100 million in Zomato.

Media reports said last week that Zomato has raised $5 million from British investment manager Baillie Gifford's Pacific Horizon Investment Trust. Zomato earlier raised $150 million from existing investor Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba.

The company has also launched the ‘Feed the Daily Wager' initiative to support and ensure meals for workers at construction sites, shops, restaurants, delivery staff, and local transport systems who earn on daily basis.

As part of this campaign, the food delivery giant is providing ration kits to the daily wager communities that are currently unable to support their family's food requirement.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zomato--grofers-deny-merger-talks-as-e-grocery-enters-top-gear-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/zomato--grofers-deny-merger-talks-as-e-grocery-enters-top-gear.html

As part of its commitment, Samsung will donate Rs 15 crore to the PM-CARES Fund and Rs 5 crore to relief funds of state governments of Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, where it operates manufacturing units, the company said in a statement.

Samsung is already providing support to the local administration and community in Noida by equipping hospitals with medical equipment required in the preventive drive against the pandemic along with infra-red thermometers, public addressal systems and air purifiers, it said. Samsung is also providing food packets to local communities in Noida on a daily basis.

In addition, employees of the company across India are contributing a portion of their salaries. The company said it will match the employee contributions and donate the total amount to the PM-CARES Fund in the coming weeks.

According to the latest report from the Union Health Ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases has increased to 10,363, with the death toll at 339. Over the last few weeks, Samsung has also hastened deliveries of digital X-ray and digital ultrasound machines that it provides to government hospitals as part of its Samsung Smart Healthcare program.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3 in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus infection.

Meanwhile, in a BSE filing on Tuesday, OnMobile Global said it is contributing Rs 50 lakh from its CSR fund to the PM-CARES Fund.

127,14-4-20,MEA advises diplomatic community to adhere to lockdown guidelines,"In an apparent reference to an incident wherein a Uruguayan woman threatened the Delhi police personnel when she was stopped for not wearing a mask, the external affairs ministry on Monday said it is regularly advising the diplomatic community to adhere to the lockdown guidelines. The incident had taken place on Saturday evening.

The ministry response on Monday came after reports indicated that the woman claimed her embassy had not informed her about the lockdown restrictions and argued with the police personnel which stopped her. While reiterating that the Government is regularly informing foreign envoys, sources also said the Government has issued a very limited number of curfew passes for essential work adding the restrictions are in their(diplomatic personnel) interest and well-being of each and everyone.

The woman was stopped at Paschimi Marg, Vasant Vihar when she was cycling there without a mask. The Delhi Government has made it compulsory for people to wear face masks when stepping outside their houses in a bid to check the spread of coronavirus.

The Residents Welfare Association(RWA) of Vasant Vihar often complained to the police that diplomats and other foreigners living in the area are stepping out for jogging and cycling without wearing masks.

A senior police officer, along with his team, was patrolling the area when they stopped the foreign national while she was cycling for violating the Government order, the police said.

In a video clip recorded by the police, the woman could be seen arguing with the police when he told her that she was violating a government order by not wearing a mask. The woman continued to argue and also noted down the name of the police officer, a senior police official said.

When asked to show her identity card, she refused to oblige, following which the police noted down her name, officials said. A representative from the RWA was present when the incident took place. He assured the police that they were taking all measures and trying to convince the foreign nationals staying in the area to follow the guidelines. The police later wrote to the embassy of Uruguay about the incident.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mea-advises-diplomatic-community-to-adhere-to-lockdown-guidelines.html

In a statement the Home Ministry said, all those foreigners whose regular visa, e-visa or stay stipulation expired or would be expiring during February 1 (midnight) to April 30 (midnight), would be ""extended till April 30 (midnight) on gratis basis, after making an online application by the foreigners"".

The foreign nationals are stranded in the country due to the 21-day lockdown announced on March 24 to curb the spread of the disease.

In order to remove any kind of confusion, the home ministry had on March 28 granted consular services on gratis basis to the foreign nationals, presently staying in India due to travel restrictions in the context of COVID-19 outbreak, till April 30.

Earlier, the Government had extended the regular and e-visa of those foreigners who are currently in India and unable to leave the country due to the outbreak of coronavirus, till April 15.

The decision to extend the visa exemption till April 30 was apparently taken in view of the near certain extension of the onging lockdown till April 30.

It is also an indication that international flights, cancelled since March 25, will not resume before April 30.

Thousands of foreign nationals are stuck in the country since the imposition of the travel restrictions, and are unable to exit the country during the validity of their visa.

129,14-4-20,People should stay where they are: SC on pleas to evacuate Indians abroad,"The Supreme Court Monday observed that Indian citizens stranded in various countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic should ""stay where they are"" after the Centre said it would not be feasible to ""selectively evacuate"" those who want to return due to various reasons.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said this while hearing through video-conferencing a batch of pleas seeking evacuation of Indian citizens from different countries including United Kingdom and Gulf nations.

""People should stay where they are right now,"" said the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and M M Shantanagoudar.

When one of the lawyers referred to students stranded in the UK, the bench observed, ""Have you seen the affidavit of Union of India? You are secure there. Why do you want to come back?""

In its affidavit filed on a plea seeking evacuation of Indian students stranded in UK, the Centre has given details of the steps taken by the concerned authorities including the Indian High Commission at London to assist Indians there.

Detailing the Centre's position regarding evacuation of Indians from abroad amid coronavirus or COVID-19, the affidavit said the country has a very large Indian community abroad including NRIs and Indian students in foreign countries.

While she welcomed the Centre's decision to provide grain at low prices, she urged that the scheme should be extended till September ""given the chronic economic distress"".

Her party colleague, former Commerce Minister Anand Sharma, suggested that the Centre should remove COVID-19 lockdown in a phase-wise manner and pointed out that there is a necessity to start the economic activity in the country.

""I hope this letter finds you well. Lakhs of vulnerable people across the country face chronic food insecurity due to the lockdown. This is tragic given that India has large buffer stock of food grains precisely for exigencies like the current pandemic,"" she said.

""I welcome your decision to provide free of cost, 5kg grain/person in addition to the entitlements under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) from April-June, 2020. However, given the adverse impact of the lockdown and its prolonged impact of people's livelihoods, I write to you to consider a few suggestions,"" she added.

At a Press conference, Sharma said the lockdown should be lifted in a staggered manner.

""The economy of the country was already in poor condition and after the coronavirus outbreak the crisis has deepened. So it is necessary for the Prime Minister to remove lockdown in a phase-wise manner by making a policy framework. It is necessary to start the economic activity in the country,"" Sharma said at a video conference AICC briefing.

""For the MSME sector, it is important that the government enables the movement of trucks laden with goods. The MSMEs should be given loans at zero per cent interest rate,"" he said.

""Farmers' produce should be purchased on district and sub-division level. As per the report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), 40 crore labourers may go below the poverty line, so the government should review its fiscal policy,"" the senior Congress leader said.

The Vice President urged them to ensure strict adherence to social distancing and isolation instructions given by the Government and health experts.

He advised the students to follow healthy dietary habits, do regular physical exercise and spend time with nature. He also suggested the students to take part in social service activities taken up by NGOs in their respective areas.

On the other hand HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank too conducted a meeting with top HRD officials including HRD Secretary Amit Khare.

The meeting was to review the decisions and initiatives taken to develop an online education ecosystem in the country.

132,14-4-20,SC orders release of detainees lodged for 2 years in Assam detention centres,"Relaxing its earlier conditions in view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Supreme Court Monday directed the release of those detainees who were declared foreigners and have been lodged in the detention centres of Assam for two years or more.

A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices L N Rao and M Shantanagoudar, referring to the top court's May 10, 2019 order, also lowered the personal bond amount from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5,000 while reducing the minimum period of detention from three years to two years.

The top court had imposed certain conditions while directing the release of such detainees including that they should have spent more than three years in detention, and were to be released upon furnishing a bond of Rs 1 lakh along with two sureties.

The order on Monday came on intervention application filed by Justice for Liberty Initiative, a Assam based Public Charitable Trust, seeking the release of detainees lodged in six Assam detention centres in view of coronavirus pandemic.

During the hearing, Attorney General K K Venugopal objected to their release apprehending that they would infect people in villages or where ever they go after their release.

Advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for the applicant, informed the court that the apprehension of the Attorney General was based on an unfounded premise that every such person was already infected by the virus.

The bench observed that the very purpose of framing of guidelines and the release of persons was to prevent these prisons and detention centres from becoming a hotspot of infection.

Alam also contended that the two-year period be dispensed with or further reduced on account of unprecedented pandemic situation.

The bench observed however that at this stage it would release only those who have spent two years or more in the detention and for further reduction it would consider later.

Referring to the orders of the apex court passed on March 16, the plea filed through advocate Talha Abdul Rahman, said that the court has in the present matter already taken a bold and decisive step towards ensuring that prisons do not become breeding grounds of COVID-19 and has ordered a high powered committee to come up with modalities of releasing prisoners on parole.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-orders-release-of-detainees-lodged-for-2-years-in-assam-detention-centres.html
133,14-4-20,Market turns lower as lockdown set to continue,"Market benchmarks Sensex and Nifty suffered heavy losses in a volatile session on Monday as investors anxiously waited for an almost certain extension to the natiowide lockdown amid mounting Covid-19 cases.

The BSE gauge Sensex closed 469.60 points or 1.51 per cent lower at 30,0690.02, while the NSE benchmark Nifty ended 118.05 points or 1.30 per cent down at 8,993.85.

With the 21-day lockdown period ending, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on Tuesday in which he is expected to announce a further extension in the spell.

Indian market will remain closed on Tuesday for Ambedkar Jayanti. Coming back to Monday’s trade, Indian bourses also felt pressure of subdued global equities reeling under the coronavirus crisis.

In the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top laggard, plummetting over 10 per cent, followed by M&M, Titan, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank and Tech Mahindra.

On the other hand, L&T, Bharti Airtel, IndusInd Bank, UltraTech Cements and NTPC were among the gainers. Sensex heavyweights HDFC twins fell as much as 3.12 per cent, while Reliance Industries shed 2.46 per cent. ICICI Bank dropped 3.44 per cent.

Sectorally, BSE realty, consumer durables, finance, auto, bankex, energy and FMCG indices fell up to 4.92 per cent.

In contrast, telecom, capital goods, industrials and metal indices rallied up to 4.82 per cent. In the broader market, BSE midcap and smallcap fell up to 0.93 per cent.

“In Spite of the hope that infections are peaking out in Europe, Indian markets closed negative with virus infections seen to be increasing in some regions of India. The Indian markets are awaiting the decision of the government regarding the current lockdown. Government is expected to announce a plan for a staggered withdrawal from the lockdown,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Any continuation of the lockdown in its current form will put further pressure on economic growth and corporate earnings and will have a negative impact on the markets, he added.

Meanwhile, partcipants will be interested in consumer inflation data due later in the day. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul ended significantly lower.

Stock exchanges in Europe remained closed for ‘Easter Monday’. Meanwhile, the rupee settled for the day on a flat note at 76.27 against the US dollar. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.06 per cent to USD 30.83 per barrel.

134,14-4-20,Top oil producers agree ‘historic’ cuts,"Top oil-producing countries agreed on “historic” output cuts to prop up prices hammered by the coronavirus crisis and a Russia-Saudi price war, sending crude prices soaring on Monday.

The US benchmark WTI climbed 7.7 per cent to $24.52 a barrel in early Asian trade while Brent was up 5.0 per cent at $33.08.

OPEC producers dominated by Saudi Arabia and allies led by Russia thrashed out a compromise deal via videoconference Sunday after Mexico had balked at an earlier agreement struck on Friday.

In the compromise reached Sunday they agreed to a cut of 9.7 million barrels per day from May, according to Mexican Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, down slightly from 10 million barrels a day envisioned earlier. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo called the cuts “historic”.

“They are largest in volume and the longest in duration, as they are planned to last for two years,” he said. The agreement between the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners foresees deep output cuts in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.

Barkindo added that the deal “paved the way for a global alliance with the participation of the G20”.

Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who chaired the meeting together with his Russian and Algerian counterparts, also confirmed that the discussions “ended with consensus”.

US President Donald Trump welcomed a “great deal for all”, saying on Twitter it would “save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States”.

He added he “would like to thank and congratulate” Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince and de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman, both of whom he had spoken to.

The Kremlin confirmed the joint phone call, adding that Putin and Trump agreed on the “great importance” of the deal.

“This is good,” Canadian Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan tweeted. “We welcome any news that brings stability to global oil markets.” Initial reticence from Mexico to introduce output cuts had led to a standoff that cast doubt on efforts to bolster oil prices, pushed to near two-decade lows.

Oil prices have slumped since the beginning of the year due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has sapped demand as countries around the world have put their populations under lockdown.

135,14-4-20,Japan PM slammed over ‘stay home’ virus tweet,"Perhaps the best that can be said about a “stay home” tweet from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is that it’s given bored copycats sitting at home waiting out the coronavirus ample inspiration.

It apparently rubbed many people frustrated by Abe’s handling of the crisis the wrong way. Abe, like US President Donald Trump, has faced accusations his moves to counter the coronavirus were too little, too late. Until late March, Abe’s administration was still insisting the Tokyo Olympics would go ahead as planned in July. It’s now been postponed until July 2021.

Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures deemed at highest risk of an explosion of coronavirus infections just last Tuesday. The government asked people in those areas — later expanded to all of Japan — to stay at home.

But the “stay home” message has incensed many who note that most Japanese cannot remain at home because the government’s social distancing policy is voluntary and doesn’t come with compensation for cash-strapped workers.

The video posted on Twitter, on a split screen accompanied by a guitar-playing popular singer, shows Abe sitting at home looking bored. Abe reading a book. Abe cuddling his dog, sipping from a cup and flipping channels with a remote.

“You cannot see your friends or organise drinking parties, but your actions are surely saving many lives,” says the video’s written message. “Everyone please cooperate.”

The sight of Abe, heir to a wealthy political dynasty, in such genteel surroundings hasn’t resonated well with families being asked to stay cooped up in cramped apartments and with workers still having to commute, since many Japanese companies have been slow to switch to remote work. Some people have lost their jobs or had their salaries cut.

“An elegant tweet despite a national crisis,” blared a headline in the Nikkan Sports tabloid. “Abe the aristocrat!!”

Many on Twitter mocked Abe with their own satirical versions of his poses, including one person who did so in the nude with “stay home” messages written in marker on his bare chest and tummy, his privates camouflaged with props including a Chinese lion dance head he cuddled as if it was a pet.

“Who does he think he is?” said one commentator.

“He is so out of touch.”

136,14-4-20,‘Ghosts’ patrol streets to keep Indonesians indoors,"Kepuh village in Indonesia has been haunted by ghosts recently - mysterious white figures jumping out at unsuspecting passersby, then gliding off under a full-moon sky. The village on Java island has deployed a cast of “ghosts” to patrol the streets, hoping that age-old superstition will keep people indoors and safely away from the coronavirus.

“We wanted to be different and create a deterrent effect because ‘pocong’ are spooky and scary,” said Anjar Pancaningtyas, head of a village youth group that coordinated with the police on the unconventional initiative to promote social distancing as the coronavirus spreads.

Known as “pocong”, the ghostly figures are typically wrapped in white shrouds with powdered faces and kohl-rimmed eyes. In Indonesian folklore they represent the trapped souls of the dead.

But when they first started appearing this month they had the opposite effect. Instead of keeping people in they bought them out to catch a glimpse of the apparitions.

The organisers have since changed tack, launching surprise pocong patrols, with village volunteers playing the part of the ghosts.

President Joko Widodo has resisted a national lockdown to curb the coronavirus, instead urging people to practise social distancing and good hygiene.

But with the highest rate of coronavirus deaths in Asia after China, some communities, such as Kepuh village, have decided to take measures into their own hands, imposing the ghostly patrols, lockdowns and restricting movement in and out of their village. “Residents still lack awareness about how to curb the spread of COVID-19 disease,” said village head Priyadi, “They want to live like normal so it is very difficult for them to follow the instruction to stay at home.”

There are now 4,241 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Indonesia, and 373 deaths, with fears the numbers will rise significantly.

Researchers at the University of Indonesia estimate there could be 140,000 deaths and 1.5 million cases by May without tougher curbs on movement. When Reuters recently visited Kepuh village, the supernatural strategy seemed to be working, with villagers running off in fright when the ghosts materialised.

“Since the pocong appeared, parents and children have not left their homes,” said resident Karno Supadmo, “And people will not gather or stay on the streets after evening prayers.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---ghosts----patrol-streets-to-keep-indonesians-indoors.html

More than 1,897,306 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories of which 438,212 have been recovered. Many countries are testing only the most serious cases.

Covid-19 more deadlier than H1N1: WHO

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that the novel coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than swine flu, also called H1N1, which caused a global pandemic in 2009, calling for control measures to be lifted “slowly”.

“We know that Covid-19 spreads fast, and we know that it is deadly, 10 times more deadly than the 2009 flu pandemic,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from Geneva.

New York toll above 10,000

In the United States, now the epicentre of the pandemic, the death toll stands at 22,948 with 5,57,590 infections. At least 41,831 patients have recovered.

New York’s death toll from coronavirus topped 10,000, with hospitals still seeing 2,000 new patients a day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. The state tallied 671 new deaths on Sunday. It was the first time in a week the daily toll dipped below 700. Still, the governor noted people are still dying at a “horrific level of pain and grief and sorrow.” “This virus is very good at what it does. It is a killer,” Cuomo said during a state Capitol news briefing.

Cuomo said almost 2,000 people were newly hospitalized with the virus Sunday, though once discharges and deaths are accounted for, the number of people hospitalized has flattened to just under 19,000. The governor said the state’s tenuous progress will likely continue as long as people continue to follow stay-at-home restrictions.

“The worst can be over, and it is over unless we do something reckless,” Cuomo said. “And you can turn those numbers on two or three days of reckless behavior.”

Meanwhile, New York City is in danger of running out of swabs for COVID-19 tests and is urging medical providers to continue testing only patients who are gravely ill, the city health department said in a memo to health care providers.

Italy’s virus death toll tops 20,000

Italy’s death toll from the novel coronavirus topped 20,000 on Monday but its number of critically ill patients dropped for the tenth successive day as its rate of infections slowed.

Death toll in Britain rises above 11,000

The death toll in Britain from coronavirus has risen to 11,329, according to health ministry figures published on Monday — an increase of 717 on the previous day’s figures. The daily increase is the lowest for several days, although it is not unusual for numbers to drop after a weekend due to delays in collating data. The numbers only refer to deaths in hospital.

Spain death toll falls as some sectors go back to work

Workers in Spain’s construction and manufacturing sectors cautiously returned to work Monday as the daily death toll resumed its downward trend and new infections fell to the lowest level in three weeks.

Spain is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, and saw the daily death rate fall for three consecutive days last week, only to rise again on Sunday.

But on Monday it fell again, with 517 deaths in 24 hours, putting the overall death toll at 17,489 with the number of cases now standing at 169,496.

139,14-4-20,Screen the lockdown blues,"Will traditional TV overtake OTT when people are confined to their couches, flipping channels for some entertainment amid the Coronavirus pandemic, asks Chahak Mittal

Can traditional TV keep up in times of digital world? This debate has been raging ever since OTT channels cast the first stone and created waves in the entertainment space. It not only catered to the millennials but also made the adults in the house switch from typical saas bahu dramas to some good content with its taut storytelling and snazzy production. However, with most citizens confined to their couches this April due to the nationwide lockdown amid Coronavirus pandemic, there’s a lot more time for the audience to watch television, binge on some new series or engage in movie marathons everyday. Moreover, without live sports, viewers are looking for other engaging content to pass the time. And hence, the never-ending debate has just taken a U-turn.

Well, to match it up to the level of OTT and give the viewers something to hold on to during their time at home, the Information and Broadcast Ministry emerged with an advisory to the DTH (direct-to-home) and cable operators to broadcast the most-liked shows of the 1990s. Some biggest examples being the re-run of Ramayana, Circus, Mahabharata, Khichdi and Dekh Bhai Dekh on Doordarshan and Sarabhai vs Sarabhai on Star Plus. So who will win the war of screens this quarantine — TV or OTT? Here’s a look at the many factors that have ensured a stalemate — as of now.

How fierce is the competition?

A recent Nielson report indicated that the overall TV consumption has risen up to eight per cent over the past few weeks. However, OTT platforms still have an upper hand because if the TV viewership has gone up, the hours spent scrolling through smartphones have also seen a sharp rise during the lockdown. According to an industry survey, users are spending 12 per cent more time on online streaming platforms during the lockdown (between March 20 to April 3) than they did before.

Anirban Chaudhuri, associate professor, Marketing, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Gurugram, says, “Globally, TV viewing has gone up and the genre that has gained the most is TV news as people have been scouting for credible information and announcements in these turbulent times. In India, the overall TV viewership in the second week of lockdown grew up to 37 per cent compared to pre-lockdown period as reported by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC).”

However, it is not just news but other forms of entertainment too that have seen a spike in viewership. Ferzad Palia, Head, Voot Select, Youth, Music and English Entertainment, Viacom18, says, “India is a hybrid market with consumers for both TV and OTT. During the lockdown, the trend that we have observed is an increased family viewership of both TV and OTT content for selective viewing and binge-watching though the latter certainly gives a more personalised experience. When it comes to youth, time spent on both TV and OTT platforms has gone up, too. Looking at the trend, content from different channels must be platform-agnostic, should speak their language and be available to them at any time. And while linear TV serves as a traditional medium for content consumption, many are now subscribing to OTT platforms due to its flexibility across devices and a bigger library to choose from. Well, content is king.”

This can be seen in the increase in the number of subscriptions of OTT platforms, which have seen a steady rise. Ali Hussein, CEO, Eros Now, says, “We have also seen an increase in paid subscribers daily over the past few weeks. We have observed a 78 per cent increase in daily traffic on the platform. We recently launched a global campaign, Eros Now #StaySafe, wherein consumers can access two months free subscription of the channel.”

Tarun Katial, CEO, ZEE5, recently said that the channel’s premium subscribers have gone up by 100 per cent — one of the reasons why it has also made a lot of its premium content free so that customers can stay calm and be entertained. He told a national daily that just like demonetisation made digital payments a hit, COVID-19 will be the turning point for digital video consumption.

As per an industry report, viewers are spending 32 per cent more time watching original series on online platforms. Examples of some popular Indian originals indicated Sacred Games and SHE on Netflix, and Special Ops on Hotstar as the most-watched shows during the lockdown. Anirban argues that even though originals on OTT are highly preferred, the “size of the library still remains a challenge.”

The report also indicated how Disney+Hotstar garnered approximately 80 lakh paid subscribers in India within days of its launch. The number of users watching movies on platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and VOOT has gone up by 56 per cent. For sports series, the number has declined by 98 per cent.

How much are the 90s shows gaining?

As per the data, the re-runs of Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayana (1980s) have garnered Doordarshan record-breaking TRPs for the first time in three decades. On an average, each of its episode has seen 42.6 million tune-ins. Anirban says, “As BARC reports, it garnered 51 million viewers on the Sunday evening of its first week of comeback. Certainly, some nostalgia but it was the Navratri week in India. However, yes, for TV, re-run of old content is the only way to keep connected to its audience. But the chances of them garnering viewership is based on the past equity of these shows.”

Riding on the nostalgia bandwagon, DD became the most watched channel in India for week ended April 3, BARC said. The national broadcaster could achieve the feat, which involved a nearly 40,000 per cent jump in viewership in the evening and morning bands.

Hussein points out that there are pre-defined audiences for different platforms be it TV or OTT. He says, “Re-running of some old TV classics is certainly a good way but we believe that there are different audience sets that consume TV programming and other fence sitters who watch the OTT content.” Not observing any particular bias, he adds that both platforms have seen a significant growth in both viewership and time spent in the last couple of weeks.

Ferzad says, “The lockdown has resulted in the emergence of many unfettered trends with nostalgia seeming to appeal more in television-viewing. Despite there being nearly limitless options across OTT platforms, viewers are often drawn back to TV viewing with family. Some shows are perennial and have a universal appeal across age groups and genres. For instance, the 1990s’ sitcom Friends continues to be one of the best performing and highest-rated shows on Comedy Central, airing on the channel even before the quarantine.”

What about their appeal among the millennials?

Despite favouring OTT platforms for their seamless and mobile-friendly access, millennials are also the most demanding when it comes to the content they consume, believes Ferzad. He adds, “Committing to a new show for them often depends on various factors like ensemble cast, reviews, concept, genre and more. But due to lockdown, they’re becoming more open to experimenting with shows, including re-runs. These shows trigger a nostalgia that gives emotional comfort and also finds room for conversation among family members and on social media. Re-runs reignite many memories associated with those shows among people who had seen them as adolescents. The lockdown has increased the viewership of such shows and it is imperative to maintain a balance between not only content offerings but also platforms as one of the key drivers to sustain. We have brought back our popular episodes of some marquee properties like Roadies, Splitsvilla X, Love School S3 and MTV Ace of Space S1 — some youth-centric shows.”

Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive, Prasar Bharti, earlier pointed out that today’s internet generation has no memory of Doordarshan. Since even younger generations have been watching the re-runs of Ramayana religiously during the lockdown, Vempati said, “This, in a way, is the proverbial first moment of truth for them to experience what DD used to be.”

Interruption of ads on TV a barrier?

In this digital age, a viral video on social media could do more rounds than an advertisement on TV. So what about ads which interrupt TV shows every now and then? Will they still be a barrier amid lockdown?

Ferzad says, “Only subscription-based OTT services are ad-free, which is why it’s a growing market. Hence, consumers of AVoD services are still served ads, making the experience similar to TV viewing. That being said, TV channels are airing ad-free marathons of relevant and top-rated shows and movies on special days. Comedy Central and Colors Infinity often air marathons for some of the most enjoyed and fan favourite series guaranteeing non-stop entertainment to the audience. Currently, we are airing back-to-back episodes of The Big Bang Theory, Mom, Superstore, Mike & Molly in the form of our ‘Quaran-Binge’ bloc to entertain viewers.”

For Anirban, “General Entertainment Channel (GEC) on TV and OTT is not an ‘either’ or ‘or’ concept but clearly a case of flirting with both during this time of social distancing. And they do not mind intermittent ads running at a time where the information from any credible source is welcome. ‘Brand speaks’ have become more powerful to nudge change in behaviour now than ever before.”

Well, while OTT does rule in terms of providing new content to the viewers, TV paves a way for them to revisit memories and have some conversations about the old classics at home.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/screen-the-lockdown-blues-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/screen-the-lockdown-blues.html

141,14-4-20,Notifying you,"Here are a few tips to make your Instagram Live and quarantine more interesting. By Team Viva

Amid the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, people from all around the world are practicing social distancing and are trying to stay safe indoors. Everyone, including your friends and even your favourite celebrities are going live on Instagram these days, and here you are wondering why it’s such a deal? Well, of course it is! Instagram Live is a great way to show your followers the real, authentic you and connect with them like never before. Interestingly, in India, Instagram Live views have increased more than 60 per cent.

So take the leap and go live soon. But before you do that, make sure you know these tricks of the trade to make your Insta live engaging:

Countdown your live

Make sure your followers know well in advance when you will be going live, as it is important to increase visibility. And with the countdown sticker, you can ensure they know very well when your live is about to begin — a day in advance, post a countdown sticker letting your fans know when to count down till the moment you go live.

Test your connection beforehand

The worst thing that can happen during your live is that you drop out mid-way, leaving viewers confused and waiting for you to return. To avoid this, make sure you test your connectivity in advance by doing a random live, or ask a friend to try it out for you to make sure everything’s ready for the session.

Stick around for your fans to tune in

While there will be a set of eager followers who will be tuned in as soon as you begin, make sure you stay on for a while to also share your moment with those who didn’t tune in the moment you started. On Instagram, you can go live for an hour — so make sure you utilise your time to the fullest and reach as many fans as you can.

Question them

Going live is a fun way to engage with your fans in real time and answer their questions in person. Adding the questions sticker to your live is a cool way to engage with followers as you answer them during the live. If you don’t want to do that, you could always do an AMA and source the questions in advance via the questions sticker in stories and answer them during the live.

Invite a friend

Inviting a friend, fellow creator or celebrity on to your live is a turn out to be a cool collaboration. It is a great element of surprise for the people who have tuned in. Doing this will increase your audience base and reach among a wider network.

Share in the moment

A live is all about being natural and in the moment. Your fans tune in because they want to see and connect with the real you. So it’s important to prepare in advance but always remember not to be overproduced. Be your own unique, authentic and casual self, and hold the camera yourself so your fans can see your face. There’s nothing like a dash of you, this will make your live totally engaging.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/notifying-you-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/notifying-you.html

148,14-4-20,Report: China clamps curbs on publication of research papers on coronavirus origin,"China has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research papers on the origin of coronavirus, according to an American media report amidst its public spat with US President Donald Trump for calling it a “Chinese virus” and the growing interest all over the world about how and where the pandemic originated.

CNN reported on Monday that two Chinese universities published on their websites the central government directive stating that under the new policy, all academic papers on Covid-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication.

Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the online posts on Fudan University in Shanghai and China University of Geoscience in Wuhan which were subsequently deleted following inquiries, according to the American news network.

After containing coronavirus in its epicentre, Wuhan, where the virus first reported in December last year, China has firmly opposed to Trump calling Covid-19 as “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus”, saying such allegations amounted to stigmatising the country.

On April 9, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, while replying to allegations of cover-up by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said: “China was the first country to report Covid-19 to the World Health Organization (WHO) that doesn’t mean the virus originated from Wuhan”.

“Epidemic may break out first anywhere in the world. But its origin is a matter of science and we should leave it to science and medical community,” Zhao who earlier created a storm by alleging in a tweet on March 12 that US army may have brought the virus to Wuhan leading to a diplomatic protest by Washington.

Initial reports said the virus reported to have originated from the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan where live animals are sold. It was subsequently shut down and has not been re-opened so far.

The US has accused China of delayed action resulting in the pandemic spreading to other countries, an allegation Beijing vehemently refuted, asserting it was working with the international community in an “open and highly responsible manner” to contain the global crisis. About the new restrictions on the publication of research studies on the coronavirus origin, CNN quoted a Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity as saying that the move was a worrying development that would likely obstruct important scientific research.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/report--china-clamps-curbs-on-publication-of-research-papers-on-coronavirus-origin.html

On a daily basis, cases of societal stigma towards COVID-19 patients and medical professionals who are treating them, are on the rise.

While some doctors and healthcare professionals have been stopped to enter localities in which they stay, others have been attacked for doing their job. The actor is unhappy about the lack of empathy towards patients and frontline doctors who are risking their lives to save people.

She took to social media and voiced her concern on this issue that needs immediate attention. “Deeply disturbed reading some reports about how Coronavirus patients and even some medical professionals, who are in the frontline taking care of such patients, are being discriminated,” she said.

The actor wants all citizens to exercise sensitivity towards patients and medical professionals. She even asked the nation to stand shoulder to shoulder in times like this. “At times like this, it is important that we care for each other and are extremely sensitive to the suffering of others. Let’s not treat fellow citizens with disrespect and stigma.

150,14-4-20,Robot has become Sathiyan's best friend & sparring partner,"A friend in need is a friend indeed, and for India’s top table tennis player G Sathiyan it is his robot which has now become his ‘best buddy’ amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

A three-week lockdown has disrupted daily routines of top athletes like Sathiyan. But a highly advanced robot, which Sathiyan imported from Germany, is not only helping the Chennai paddler as a playing partner everyday but also making him get better technically.

“The robot concept has been prevalent before but this robot was very advanced as it could put 120 balls per minute. That’s like 2 balls a second which is insane. It could vary speed, trajectory and put the ball in any direction,” Sathiyan said from his Chennai residence.

“You can set up lot of exercises. Like a backhand, forehand these kind of exercises can be set. Up to 100 exercises can be set. A combination of exercises can be set. It is very close to a human.

“It can replicate lot of ideas and it can put a short and a long top spin in the same exercise.

“A human can see your body and then give the ball accordingly but I feel this robot is as close to a human as it can be,” added Sathiyan who broke into the top 25 of the ITTF rankings in 2019, making him the first Indian table tennis player to do so.

Called the Butterfly Amicus Prime, the portable robot is easy to handle and a person can also alter the type of shots that he or she wants to practice. “We got it in November last year. This was the idea of my coach Subramanian Raman sir. He insisted we get the robot in special preparation for the World Cup. This is to increase speed, reflexes, technique and everything. We thought this might give us the supporting hand or extra bit of edge in playing a big tournament like a World Cup. So we got this idea by seeing some videos,” Sathiyan narrated.

“So we got it in November and when the lockdown was announced I thought this might be very useful to take it back home. It was at the centre.

“So I got it at home. Now I have a table and a robot. I am trying to hit around couple of hours everyday with the robot. I am playing different combination of sequences and to improve speed and skill and my reflexes. To improve overall technique,” explained Sathiyan who paired up with veteran Achanta Sharath Kamal to win the men’s doubles Silver at the Hungarian Open before opting out of the Oman Open in a bid to stay injury-free and manage his workload in an Olympic year.

“So in this kind of situation the robot has become my best friend and my sparring partner,” he said.

“This is made only for professionals. There are three levels of it. Generally people think robots can put one kind of ball and is for amateurs. But this has gone above all expectations and putting high quality balls with lot of variations especially in a period like this.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/robot-has-become-sathiyan-s-best-friend---sparring-partner.html
151,14-4-20,PL transfer embargo could follow wage cuts: Neville,"Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville believes the Premier League may force clubs who are looking to cut player wages during the coronavirus crisis to accept transfer embargoes.

Clubs in England’s top-flight have requested players take up to a 30 percent pay hit in cuts and deferrals to help soften the estimated £1 billion blow of potentially failing to complete the season.

Neville said Tottenham striker Harry Kane would be the ‘perfect’ signing for his old club Manchester United, but dismissed speculation over the England captain’s future in the current climate.

“The Premier League spent £1.4 billion last summer on transfers and the previous three summers they also spent over £1 billion. If you’re trying to get 30 percent pay cuts from existing players, you may have to put a transfer embargo in place,” Neville told Sky Sports.

“Transfers are things the fans love, and we love players moving around, but it does seem to me to be awry when we’ve got such a behind-the-scenes war going on with respect to players taking cuts, the clubs needing support, and then in the next breath you’ve got a £200 million transfer speculation going on.”

Kane, who has been sidelined by a hamstring injury since New Year’s Day, opened the door to leaving Spurs last month.

“If I don’t feel we’re progressing as a team or going in the right direction, then I’m not someone to just stay there for the sake of it,” said Kane in an Instagram chat with former Spurs midfielder Jamie Redknapp.

Neville and Redknapp believe that Tottenham’s conduct during the crisis will not have sat well with Kane.

“He’s a clever lad and he’s not somebody who would get caught out if he didn’t want to say something. The little opening of the door that he left in that Instagram piece with Jamie was probably something that had something in it,” added Neville.

“In my mind, I think he would have been warning them and saying ‘just be careful because I’m watching you and it’s not something that we do’.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pl-transfer-embargo-could-follow-wage-cuts--neville.html
152,14-4-20,I won’t create false hopes: ABD on playing for Proteas again,"South African swashbuckler AB de Villiers says he doesn’t want to create any “false hopes” of a much-awaited comeback at the T20 World Cup this year, which, he feels, could be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I can’t see six months into the future. If the tournament is postponed to next year a whole lot of things will change. At the moment I feel available, but at the same time I don’t know how my body will see it and if I will be healthy at that time,” De Villiers told Afrikaans-language Sunday newspaper Rapport.

“...I might get to a point where I have to tell Bouch (coach Mark Boucher) I was interested, I would like to play a role but I’m not going to be able to play myself. I’m afraid of such a commitment and creating false hope,” he added.

De Villiers said he does not feel entitled to walk into the South African team as has been alleged in the past.

“If I am 100 per cent as good as I want to be, then I will be available. But if I am not I won’t open myself up to that because I am not the type of person who does things at 80 per cent. Then I have to do trials and show Bouchie I’m still good enough.

“They should choose me because I’m really better than the guy next to me. I’ve never been the type of person who felt I should get just what I wanted.”

The T20 World Cup in Australia in October and November could be a perfect stage for de Villiers coming back but he was mindful of avoiding a repeat of the debacle that unfolded during last year’s 50-over World Cup in England after reports emerged that he casually expressed offer to come back and was rejected.

“I am uncertain about giving a definite answer because I have been very hurt and burned in the past. Then people will again think I have turned my back on our country. I can’t just walk into the team.

“...I have to work for my place and deserve it. It was very hurtful for me last year when people thought I assumed there was a place for me. I feel available and I will give it a go with everything I have, but I don’t want special treatment.”

If de Villiers can make a comeback, the credit would go to South Africa coach Mark Boucher, who convinced him to rethink his retirement decision, taken in 2018.

“I could write a book on Bouchie’s impact just on my life, never mind cricket. I rediscovered that when I played under him at the Spartans (in the Mzansi Super League) in December. He was born to be an instructor. When he talks there’s respect.”

“Bouch asked me why don’t I give it another go,” de Villiers said.

“I’ve always said to him, ‘I’ve never not wanted to be there. I’ve always wanted to be there. It’s just, my life has changed’.”

De Villiers played in 176 of Boucher’s 461 matches for South Africa across the formats.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-won---t-create-false-hopes--abd-on-playing-for-proteas-again.html
153,14-4-20,Break tricky for fast bowlers,"Former India strength and conditioning coach Shanker Basu feels maintaining fitness without running on the field is going to be quite tricky for the fast bowlers and advises the cricketers against too much screen time during the ongoing lockdown.

Basu, who oversaw the fitness transformation of the Indian team between 2015 to 2019, worked extensively with the potent pace attack comprising Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Mohammad Shami, and ensured they don’t break down often.

“In the current scenario (of training at home), the batsmen can still get away but it is tough for the fast bowlers despite them doing the best they can,” Basu, who is now back with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore said.

“This fast bowling unit is very sincere and they will do everything in their capacity to stay fit — nevertheless nothing can substitute the actual running in a field and access to any grounds is not possible now, hence the conundrum.”

The challenge will be to be match ready when cricketing actions resumes.

“When things come back to normalcy they should be aware of the fact that matches will be slotted and in a jiffy the scene will change and you would be required to turn on your performing hat and steam in and bowl fast.

“This sudden change in training loads and spikes in high speed running can be a huge risk factor for fast bowlers.

“They can run on a treadmill but it’s not the same. However, this is the case for all athletes. These are difficult times and current day cricketers are an informed lot and they know how to keep in shape.”

But with every Indian cricketer nowadays taking their fitness “very seriously”, the players will do just fine, said Basu.

Each player is already following a customised workout routine designed by the current strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb.

“It is commendable to see all these boys do their bit at home. Most of them have some sort of gym set-up at home. They work on the strength part but don’t know how much conditioning they need to do. “The boys are mentally very tough but in this case nobody knows where the finishing line is,” said the 51-year-old.

Basu’s advice to all athletes including cricketers is “avoid too much screen time”.

“Train twice in a day — once before first meal and once before your second meal. Try to have a routine and it’s not easy, I understand, but as an athlete that’s the challenge.

“Lying down and browsing channels through the day may not be the right answer. It is a direct invitation for pains and aches. De-training effects starts within 48 hours.

“Planning the day is important. You decide whether to sleep early or sleep late. Based on that you plan the following day. If you want to sleep early, do an activity first thing when you wake up in the morning and then have breakfast. Then do another activity before lunch.

“If you are an owl type (sleep late-rise late) — activity after waking up and first meal and another activity in the evening to get your steam out,” he said.

One also tends to eat more when home all the time.

“Try to limit your big meals to just two in the day and try snacking in a healthy fashion to stay afloat with regards to your fat percent,” Basu concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/break-tricky-for-fast-bowlers-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/break-tricky-for-fast-bowlers.html
154,14-4-20,FIFA VP to AP: International games could be off until 2021,"Most international soccer might not be played until 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic travel restrictions and the need to give club competitions the chance to resume, a FIFA vice president has said.

Victor Montagliani, a Canadian who is president of the governing body for North and Central America and the Caribbean, has been heading a FIFA working group formulating plans to deal with the implications of the world's biggest sport being largely shut down since last month.

FIFA already has called off matches between countries that were due to be played in March and June. Montagliani, CONCACAF's president, believes the September, October and November windows for national team matches could be scrapped.

I personally think that might be a bit of a challenge, not so much because of just the health issues around the world and the various degrees of preparedness, but also committing to international travel as soon as we come back, Montagliani said in an interview with The Associated Press.

I think that domestic football is a priority. September is still in the books, but I would garner to say that I'm not sure it's there on solid ground the way things are trending right now.

The return of fans into packed stadiums could be dependent on a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease being ready -- and that might not be until 2021.

If we get the green light to play a football match. I highly doubt that first football match will be with fans. I just can't see that. I think that would be taken a massive risk, he said in a video interview from Vancouver, British Columbia I'm pretty sure it'll be a phased in approach, just like the rest of society is going to be is then in terms of us trying to get back to normal here.

A full resumption of soccer in 2020 might not be possible in parts of the world hardest hit by the pandemic, including Europe and North America.

If you take that across international boundaries, that's a significant issue, Montagliani said.

And so, yes absolutely, there's always that possibility.

CONCACAF's hexagonal that determines the region's three direct qualifiers is to start in the fall with each nation playing two games each in September, October and November.

The United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Honduras and either El Salvador or Canada will compete.

Scheduling will be discussed further by a working group featuring the six confederations.

I'm fairly confident the March window in 2021 will be fine, Montagliani said.

""The priority is to help our national leagues then look at our events.

The qualifying format for the World Cup in Qatar might have to be curtailed with the time frame tightening to play matches to reach the tournament that starts in November 2022.

We're likely going to be having to seriously look at reformatting some of our events, Montagliani said.

We're committed to our final four (in the Nations League). But we have other events that we have to probably look at reformatting, whether it's some of our youth competitions, even our World Cup qualifying, where we're going to have to, in the balance of probabilities, look at how that would work in a situation where the calendar there is now less than what we expected it to be.""

Montagliani maintains that CONCACAF is in a good financial situation to cope with the disruption to the match calendar.

A lot of the things we can recoup over time. We don't have fixtures every weekend like a league does, he said.

But I think where the financial impact is going to happen in CONCACAF is within the stakeholders, within the leagues and the clubs. That's where I think the biggest financial impact is going to be.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fifa-vp-to-ap--international-games-could-be-off-until-2021-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/fifa-vp-to-ap--international-games-could-be-off-until-2021.html
155,14-4-20,Dhoni can make opposition captain blink first: Hussey,"A finisher of repute himself, former Australia batman Michael Hussey believes India's World Cup-winning former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's ""unbelievable power"" and ""self-belief"" make him the greatest of all time in that role.

""Dhoni is the greatest finisher of all time that the cricketing world has ever produced,"" Hussey told Sanjay Manjarekar on ESPNcricinfo's Videocast.

""Dhoni can keep his cool and make the opposition captain blink first. Dhoni also has unbelievable power. He knows that when he needs to clear the ropes he can do it. He has that kind of self-belief. Honestly, I didn't have that kind of belief in myself.""

The 44-year-old Hussey said he also picked up a trick or two about chasing from Dhoni while playing for Chennai Super Kings.

""I tried not to let it reach 12 or 13 runs an over. And I learnt this from MS Dhoni. He is incredible. He believes that he who panics last wins the game. So Dhoni would keep his cool, and keep it longer because the pressure is on the bowler as well.""

Talking about the traits of great players, Hussey said: ""They don't hang on to a defeat for too long. If they lose, they move on quickly. They don't let a loss or a win hamper their thinking. They are always consistent, and level headed whether it's MS Dhoni or Ricky Ponting"".

Dhoni led the CSK to three IPL titles besides winning the now-defunct Champions League T20 twice.

Asked what is the reason behind three-time champions CSK's consistent run in the IPL, Hussey said: ""Supportive owners who let the coach (Stephen) Fleming and captain Dhoni decide how to run the team, excellent chemistry between the coach and the captain, Dhoni's leadership.

""This has built an excellent continuity in the team. And once you have continuity, you build relationships and trust that otherwise takes time to grow.""

However, Hussey believes it will be more challenging for CSK to build a new team once Dhoni hangs his boots.

""I believe the owners would like to keep Dhoni involved in some way or the other. However, whenever the change of guard happens, CSK might want to start all over again, build a brand new team, and use their existing philosophy as they enter the next decade of IPL. It is definitely going to be more challenging in current times,"" he said.

Dhoni hasn't played any cricket -- international or domestic -- since the 50-over World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July last year.

He was set to play in the 13th IPL but now his future is uncertain with the cash-rich tournament staring at indefinite postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

156,14-4-20,"Raina hails Dhoni's leadership, says it helped CSK become most decorated team in IPL","Veteran Indian batsman Suresh Raina on Tuesday said Mahendra Singh Dhoni's leadership turned Chennai Super Kings into arguably the most decorated franchise in the history of the IPL.

Raina said every move Dhoni made as a captain was ""spot on.""

""Every move he makes is spot on. He knows how to use different bowlers in different situations...Controls everything from behind the stumps. He watches everything closely,"" Raina was quoted as saying by CSK website.

Dhoni has been at the helm of CSK affairs since the inception of IPL in 2008 and led the side to three titles and five runners-up finishes while the team has qualified for play-offs in all the 10 seasons it has participated.

The 33-year-old Raina, a key player for CSK and the second most prolific batsman in IPL with 5,368 runs, said he improved over the years because he got to play with so many left-handers including Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and Stephen Fleming, among others.

""I improved over the years playing for CSK I got to play with so many quality left-handers-(Mathew Hayden), (Michael) Hussey, (Stephen) Fleming, Albie (Morkel), Kepler Wessels (CSK coach in 2008), Ravindra Jadeja,"" Raina said.

He picked his knock of 57 not out in the 2010 final against Mumbai Indians as his best IPL knock, and said ""the wicket was difficult and they were bowling really well"".

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the global sporting calendar resulting in various events being cancelled or postponed. The IPL scheduled to begin on March 29 has been put on hold.

Raina said it was important to stay at home and follow government's guidelines during the lockdown to combat COVID-19.

""It is very important to stay at home and follow government guidelines during the lockdown for us to overcome the pandemic,"" he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/raina-hails-dhoni-s-leadership--says-it-helped-csk-become-most-decorated--team-in-ipl-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/raina-hails-dhoni-s-leadership--says-it-helped-csk-become-most-decorated--team-in-ipl.html
157,14-4-20,Steyn unsure if T20 WC will be held this year,"Veteran South Africa pacer Dale Steyn is unsure whether the T20 World Cup, scheduled to take place in Australia in October, will take place or not amid the coronavirus outbreak in the world.

Steyn was doing an #AskDale session on Twitter and a fan ended up asking about his thoughts on the impending ICC tournament late this year in Australia.

“Is it even gonna happen?” Steyn replied.

Steyn was also asked to name the best batters he bowled to during his illustrious career.

""They all good ey! Ponting was prime, Sachin was a wall, Dravid, Gayle, KP, they were all so good!"" he said.

Steyn also said his seven-for against India in Nagpur and six-wicket haul against Pakistan at the Wanderers remain one of his best bowling spells.

""Nagpur (7 against India) and wanderers (6 against Pakistan),"" he replied to another fan's question.

The 36-year old also said he is honing his cooking skills during lockdown in South Africa.

Steyn also picked his first Test wicket as the most memorable one.

""My first one, I guess I'll always just remember it so it's the winner. ""I loved bowling a batsman when he left the ball, often it came from a set up so I enjoyed that my often silly plans ended up working,"" he added.

One T20 wicket or a spell that is special to Steyn?

158,14-4-20,KL ‘apt replacement’ for Dhoni in T20s: Gambhir,"Former India opener Gautam Gambhir says if IPL is not played this year, it will be difficult for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to make a comeback to the Indian team.

Dhoni last played for India in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in July last year.

Since then he hasn’t played any competitive cricket and was expected to be seen in action at this year’s IPL but the chances of T20 league are remote due to COVID-19.

“If the IPL does not happen this year, then it will become very difficult for MS Dhoni to make a comeback. On what basis can he (Dhoni) be selected since he’s not been playing for the last one or one and a half year,” Gambhir said on Star Sports show Cricket Connected.

The 38-year-old Gambhir picked KL Rahul, who has been keeping in ODIs, as an “apt replacement” for Dhoni.

“Obviously his (Rahul’s) keeping is not as good as Dhoni’s, but if you are looking at T20 cricket, Rahul’s a utility player, can keep and bat at No 3 or 4. If the IPL does not happen, then Dhoni’s chances for a comeback look dim.

“Ultimately, you are representing India, so whoever dishes out the best performance and can win the match for India should play for the team,” added Gambhir.

The southpaw also felt that retirement was Dhoni’s personal decision.

“As far as his retirement plans go by, that’s his personal choice,” said Gambhir.

However, his former teammate and Test specialist VVS Laxman feels that Dhoni can continue playing IPL.

“Not only this IPL, he (Dhoni) will probably play in the next couple of IPLs, and then we will take a call about his future as a cricketer,” Laxman said on the same show.

However, the veteran of 134 Tests, said that the new selection committee, chaired by Sunil Joshi, will have to discuss Dhoni’s future with him.

“Dhoni will be very clear, as far as his plans are concerned, I’m sure he must have communicated that with (captain) Virat Kohli, (coach) Ravi Shastri immediately after the 2019 World Cup in England,” said Laxman.

“The new selection committee will have to sit down with MS Dhoni and understand his future, as far as Indian cricket is concerned. But MS Dhoni will continue to play for CSK and do well for CSK,” said Laxman, who amassed 8,781 Test runs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kl----apt-replacement----for-dhoni-in-t20s--gambhir.html
159,14-4-20,No clarity on Oct-Nov window for IPL: Dhumal,"BCCI is currently not in a position to take a call on the future of IPL and it would be “too premature” to comment on whether the tournament can be slotted in place of the ICC World T20 in Oct-Nov, treasurer Arun Dhumal said on Monday.

The IPL has been postponed till April 15 in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and with the country scheduled to go for another two week extension of the lockdown, it is but natural that the cash-rich league can’t be held during its dedicated April-May window.

“Right now, the picture is very hazy. We don’t even know when the lockdown will end and if we don’t know, how can we even have a meaningful discussion. Once we get a clarity from the government, we can then sit and take fresh stock of the situation. Any speculation about it’s future will be premature,” Dhumal said.

“Everyone wants IPL to happen but let’s have some clarity first.”

The treasurer also provided some practical insight into rescheduling of IPL as speculations are rife about the October-November window.

“Tell me one thing. Firstly, if Australia is under lockdown for six months, how can we conclude that they will allow their players to travel from next month right away? What if the travel restrictions for its citizens are still in place. How will they come to India then? And don’t forget that other boards also need to agree,” Dhumal said.

“Secondly, even if the lockdown ends in India, what if some of the major cities still have those COVID hotspots? Can we risk the lives of our sportspersons? Thirdly, the players are likely to go without training for months.

“Even if we are in a position to conduct a tournament, for international players, we need to give them a bare minimum time to do full-fledged training before we can start a tournament. All these factors can only be clear when we are in a position to discuss,” Dhumal said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-clarity-on-oct-nov-window-for-ipl--dhumal.html

India last hosted the men’s Asian meet back in 1980 in Mumbai, while it conducted the women’s event in 2003 in Hisar. The tournament became a combined event for men and women last year.

“We were awarded the hosting rights in February after a meeting of the Asian Boxing Confederation. The tournament will be held in November-December and the host city will be finalised after things normalise,” Boxing Federation of India’s (BFI) Executive Director R K Sacheti said.

“It is an extraordinary situation no doubt but we are all hoping for this to be brought under control by June. Then another three-four months will go into resuming normal activities,” he said.

The event is usually a biennial competition but has been held in consecutive years in the past.

“Bids were sought in January. The formal announcement by the Asian Boxing Confederation will be made once the COVID-19 situation improves a bit,” Sacheti said.

“The window we have kept for the championship allows us time to plan. The Olympic qualification programme is also likely to resume around November-December, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC),” Sacheti reasoned.

“So, if things can start rolling elsewhere, we can also conduct the championship. That’s why we haven’t zeroed in on a host city right now.

“Unless, of course, Sourav Ganguly, Virat Kohli or Ravi Shastri pick up the phone and tell Dhoni to help the team out in the T20 World Cup. If they tell Dhoni that they want him to play the World Cup, then there is a chance he could return” he said.

Advocate Mihir Desai said Teltumbde reached the NIA office at Cumbala Hill in south Mumbai to surrender.

Teltumbde and several other civil liberties activists were booked under stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly having Maoist links and conspiring to overthrow the government.

The activists were booked initially by the Pune police following the violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima.

As per the police, the activists had made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which it said triggered violence the next day.

The police also said they were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to NIA.

166,14-4-20,"Don't panic, we have sufficient food, medicine: Shah","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday justified the extension of the nationwide lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic till May 3, and allayed panic by assuring that there is enough stock of food and medicine in the country.

Shah's assurance came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday morning announced the second phase of the lockdown till May 3 to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus.

Every city and district will be assessed as part of the lockdown 2.0 measures from April 20 onwards to get the real picture of the Covid-19 affected areas.

""The decision to extend the lockdown till May 3 has been taken to protect the lives of the people,"" Shah said.

Assuring the citizens of the country at this time of crisis, Shah said: ""As the Home Minister of the country, I reassure the public that there are sufficient reserves of food, medicines and other daily essentials in the country. Hence there is no need for any citizen to panic.""

""At the same time, I request the well-off people to come forward and help the poor living in their nearby areas,"" he added.

Shah expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for his decision to extend the lockdown and said that it has set an example for the whole world in fighting the dreaded virus.

Praising the decisions taken by the government to stop the spread of Covid-19, Shah said this was ""evident in all the timely decisions taken by the government and the participation of the people in them"".

Describing the coordination between the Centre and the states as very crucial in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and to meet the need of the citizens, the Home Minister said that the way all the state governments are working together with the Central government is truly laudable.

""This coordination needs to be intensified so that all the citizens follow the lockdown properly and no one faces any problem in accessing essential commodities,"" he added.

Saluting the frontline healthcare professionals and security personnel leading the fight against Covid-19, Shah said that the contributions of doctors, health workers, sanitation workers, police and all the security personnel are indeed touching.

""Their courage and understanding in these tough times inspire every Indian citizen. Everyone should follow the guidelines and cooperate with them,"" Shah said.

The first 21-day nationwide lockdown from March 24 midnight is ending on Tuesday midnight.

167,14-4-20,Aaditya Thackeray blames Centre for protest by migrant workers,"Maharashtra Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday blamed the Centre for the protest by hundreds of migrant workers near Bandra railway station here and sought a road map to facilitate their journey back to their native places.

Hundreds of migrant workers who earn daily wages in Mumbai came out on road on Tuesday afternoon demanding transport arrangements to go back to their native places. The protest took place hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an extension of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown till May 3.

In a series of tweets, Thackeray said, ""The current situation in Bandra, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the union government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home migrant labour.""

""They don't want food or shelter, they want to go back home,"" Thackeray said.

He felt a mutual road map drawn up with the Union government will help migrant labourers travel from one state to another during the lockdown period and reach their homes.

Time and again this issue has been raised with the Centre, he said.

Thackeray said feedback from all migrant labour camps is similar - that these workers want to go back to their native places.

""Many are refusing to eat or stay in these camps,"" he said.

Currently, more than six lakh people are housed in various shelter camps acrossMaharashtra, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aaditya-thackeray-blames-centre-for-protest-by-migrant-workers-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/aaditya-thackeray-blames-centre-for-protest-by-migrant-workers.html
168,14-4-20,Airlines decline refund to customers for cancelled tickets as lockdown extended,"With the central government extending the lockdown to May 3 and subsequently suspension of all commercial passenger services till then, domestic airlines have again decided not to refund the customers in cash for their cancelled flights and instead offer them rescheduling of tickets for a later date without any additional fee.

India had imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, all domestic and international commercial passenger flights were suspended for this time period.

However, most of the airlines had been taking bookings except national carrier Air India for domestic flights for the period beyond April 14.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of lockdown till May 3, the aviation regulator DGCA issued a circular stating all international as well as domestic flights will remain suspended during the lockdown.

""Following orders from the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued to all airlines, we have extended the suspension of our operations until May 3, 2020.

""We are in the process of cancelling the affected bookings and we will offer customers free of charge rescheduling to another date until December 31, 2020,"" a Vistara spokesperson told PTI in statement.

The customer, however, will have to pay the fare difference, if any, at the time of rebooking, the airline said.

A GoAir spokesperson said that it has already ""factored in"" these type of scenario and that the airline will review its earlier scheme of providing rescheduling free of cost at a later date while protecting their existing bookings for one year.

""In accordance with the Prime Minister's instructions and the DGCA's circular, GoAir has suspended all its flights till May 3,"" GoAir said in a statement on Tuesday.

The airline also said it is extending its 'Protect Your PNR' scheme till May 3, 2020 wherein customers are eligible to reschedule their flight by May 3, 2021.

The airline had on Monday announced that it was extending the “Protect Your PNR” scheme till April 30, 2020.

Aviation consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation had last week termed the sale of tickets without a clarity on lockdown as ""unfair to consumers"".

""The decision to allow opening of advance bookings from April 14 without a decision on lifting of the lockdown and likely structure of the transition period post the lockdown needs to be immediately reviewed as this is unfair to consumers,"" Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said in a statement.

Citing examples of erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines and now-defunct Jet Airways, CAPA said that the closure of these two carriers has ""already resulted in massive losses to passengers as refunds couldn't be processed resulting in crores of losses to passengers"".

It may be mentioned here that the then customers of the erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways could not recover their money which the two airlines had amassed on account of advance bookings only after their going belly up.

CAPA in its March 18 report had stated that amid COVID-19 and in the absence of government support ""several Indian airlines may shut down operations by May or June due to a lack of cash.”

Announcing that all its flights are cancelled till May 3, IndiGo said, it is in the process of cancelling the reservations.""Your ticket amount is protected in the form of credit shell in the PNR, which can be utilised within one year of the issued date.""

Gurugram-based spiceJet also said the amount from the cancelled ticket will be maintained in a credit shell.

""We are cancelling the reservation of those who booked tickets for travel till May 3, 2020. Upon cancellation your entire amount will be maintained in credit shell and the same may be used for fresh bookings and travel till February 28, 2021, for the same passenger,"" it said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/airlines-decline-refund-to-customers-for-cancelled-tickets-as-lockdown--extended-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/airlines-decline-refund-to-customers-for-cancelled-tickets-as-lockdown--extended.html

Shah stressed that such events weaken India's fight against coronavirus and the administration needs to stay vigilant to avoid such incidents.

""The home minister spoke to the Maharashtra chief minister and expressed concern over the large gathering of people in Mumbai's Bandra area,"" a home ministry official said.

171,14-4-20,PM’s balancing act at 10 am,"All eyes on how Govt restarts economy with extended lockdown

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to address the nation at 10 am on Tuesday to throw light on how the Government proposes to keep the country under lockdown and reopen the industry and business activities in the country.

A day after the Commerce Ministry proposed opening up most of the industries with safeguards, Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said the Government is seeking ways to resume construction of highways and arterial roads in districts least impacted by the coronavirus outbreak as it charts out a plan to revive Asia’s third-largest economy.

Even as there is gradual rise in the numbers of cases affected by coronavirus, the Central Government is considering easing some restrictions during the likely extended duration beyond April 14 and a revival plan for economy may also be on table.

The Modi Government will run special train and bus services for agricultural labour and farm industry workers. Special package is being worked out for the labourers working during the lockdown period in the wake of Covid-19 threat, according to Government officials.

Essential industrial sectors would also be opened for ensuring that the key economic sectors are also kept running. PM Modi has directed all Ministers and officials above Joint Secretary rank to resume work from this week to work towards a post-lockdown economic revival.

The Government has allowed inter-State movement of trucks and States like Odisha and Punjab have given permission to harvesting, irrigation, transport of seeds and agriculture products, agriculture machineries and cold storage.

In some States, construction of highways may also be exempted from the total shutdown. Districts which are away from the urban centres and where there have been zero Covid-19 cases may be exempted from the lockdown and construction activity of roads should be allowed as it is essential for any economy.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) are also in discussions with various States to evaluate the situation on the ground.

Some States and districts had sought permission to start road construction work where the density of population is low. They had also said the guidelines of social distancing would be followed to commence the project.

The view in the Government is it needs to move fast and introduce some fiscal measures that can assure money will still flow into the bank accounts of those affected individuals and small businesses and keep them afloat with cash flow happening even during lockdown on a daily basis, sources said.

According to sources, leeway would be given to unorganised sector that constitutes 65 to 70 per cent of country’s economy where workers have lost their wages and jobs during the ongoing lockdown. Relaxation will be accorded to small-and-medium enterprises too.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm---s-balancing-act-at-10-am-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pm---s-balancing-act-at-10-am.html

The message by the Congress president came shortly before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to address the nation to chart out the next course of action after the 21-day lockdown, which is to end on Tuesday midnight.

Gandhi also thanked people for maintaining peace and patience while staying indoors and adhering to the lockdown stipulations.

""Today, when the country is fighting such a big battle, every Congress worker understands his responsibility and is always ready to help every warrior in this fight.

These warriors, she said, include doctors, health workers and NGOs.

Sanitation workers, police personnel and government officers too are working hard and round the clock to control the deadly virus, she added.

""This fight will weaken without your support, and we should not allow this to happen.

""At some place, I hear reports about ill-treatment meted out to doctors. This is wrong. Our culture and tradition does not allow this and we should support them,"" she said.

She also lauded the work done by some people at individual level in supporting the poor in providing them food, ration and sanitisers.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked where is the country's roadmap to fight coronavirus.

He said leadership does not mean making people realise their responsibilities but to fulfil the government's duty of accountability towards the people of the country.

""A lot of talk has taken place. But, where is the roadmap to fight corona,"" he asked.

Eating fat and oil is important. It helps us absorb the oil soluble vitamins like A, D, E, as well as lubricate our joints and decrease inflammation. They also make our food tasty. However, there is always a phobia as well as confusion around which oils to use for what. If there is an imbalance between saturated and unsaturated fats, we end up increasing our inflammation and hence of the risk of getting deadly lifestyle diseases including cancer. So it is not that some oils are good and others are bad, it is the balance that we must keep to ensure that we can enjoy the taste of our food as well as keep our minds and bodies healthy.

Always remember the smoke point of an oil and use it below the smoke point. If you use an oil above it's smoke point, it becomes cancerous. Here are the oils and fats and their mysteries unravelled:

Sunflower, rice bran & mustard oil: These can be used for high flame cooking and deep frying. All of them have a smoke point of 227 degrees celcius. When we deep fry something, the temperature reaches around 177 degrees Celsius. This makes these three oils safe for deep frying and Indian cooking where a lot of masalas all sauteed on high flame and our typical tadka for the dal is put. Use them sparingly as the benefits of these for heart health and lowering inflammation are limited. They are neutral except for rice bran oil, which has heart protective qualities, as long as we consume them in limited quantities.

Extra virgin olive and flaxseed oils: A lot of people say that they do all their cooking in extra virgin olive oil. This is the most hazardous thing anyone can do from a health perspective, because extra virgin olive oil has a smoke point of 160 degrees. When we cook in extra virgin olive oil, we are way above its smoke point, hence making this wonderfully anti-inflammatory oil inflammatory and cancerous in nature. The same applies to virgin flaxseed oil. Hence, extra virgin olive and falxseed oils should be strictly used raw, for salads or smoothies only. They should come in a glass bottle, not plastic, and should say cold press/extraction somewhere on the bottle. Extra virgin olive and flaxseed oils are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, making them ideal for reducing bad cholesterol and inflammation inside the body. One should aim at 25-30 ml per day of these raw oils in salads every day.

Saturated oils: These include coconut oil, butter and ghee and their smoke points are 177 degrees. They should be used very sparingly as saturated fat can increase our triglycerides and cholesterol as well as the risk of stomach-related cancers and prostate cancer. A lot of people use butter, ghee or coconut oil for tempering spices on high flame, however, the smoke point for these oils is 177 degrees Celsius. This means that we are dangerously close to converting them into carcinogenic oils as they have already reached their smoke point of 177 degrees. A good measure is not more than 5 per cent of the total fat you consume.

A great way to balance your fat and oil intake is to use minimal oil for cooking.

They are an excellent source of Vitamin C and other antioxidants which may help protect your body against cancer. Consuming tomatoes daily may help keep your body hydrated during summers. They also support normal bowel movement and reduce constipation.

They also support heart health and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Tomatoes also contain folate. This helps to balance homocysteine levels. Homocysteine is an amino acid that results from protein breakdown. It is said to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The management of homocysteine levels by folate reduces one of the risk factors for heart disease.

Tomatoes are a rich source of lycopene, lutein, and beta-carotene.

183,14-4-20,Say no to alcohol and smoking,"To beat stress and anxiety, people resort to unhealthy coping strategies like smoking or drinking. However, it can do more harm and can expose the body to the virus. ARCHANA JYOTI tells you more

Liquor, cigarettes and other tobacco products like gutkha and khaini may give you temporary relief from stress during the COVID-19 lockdown, but doctors say that giving in to such temptations may hit your immune system and increase the chances of getting infected with the deadly pathogen.

Smoking is known to weaken the body’s ability to respond effectively to infections. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase the risk of serious illness.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDCP) have warned that smoking can expose people to serious complications from COVID-19 causing pneumonia which is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.

Cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect the lungs, instead of just small parts.

Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, deputy director, Center For Cancer Epidemiology at Tata Memorial Center in Mumbai cites the findings of a study published in the Chinese Medical Journal which undertook research among patients affected by the coronavirus.

“It found that those with a history of smoking were 14 times more likely to develop pneumonia than who did not smoke at all,” he says.

He adds that early evidence shows that the ACE2 gene expression which the novel coronavirus uses to infect cells, is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers, thereby suggesting a higher susceptibility among smokers. Therefore, the entire cellular alteration that happens because of chronic smoking predisposes the body to infection and subsequent mortality.

The mode of transmission of the COVID-19 infection is through the respiratory epithelium which is the lining of our breathing tract, explain experts. This breathing tract is lined by a certain barrier called the ciliary epithelium which is known to get damaged in chronic smokers. “Now, when this immunological barrier is absent, the virus has a free entry into body’s circulation leading to infection and subsequent damage,” says Chaturvedi.

Yet another study of more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020 found that smokers — both past and present — fared poorly, with smokers comprising more than 25 per cent of those that needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or who died.

In fact health experts have advised the smokers to dump the butt as this is the absolute best time to quit smoking.

“Quitting during this pandemic could not only save your life, but by preventing the need for your treatment in a hospital, you might also save someone else’s life,” says Dr Smita Deshpande, professor of the psychiatry department of the Delhi-based RML hospital.

Doctors tells you that the virus seems to attack the body by attaching to a binding receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, or ACE-2. Tobacco use may increase the expression of ACE-2. That is why doctors and researchers speculate that smokers may become infected with more copies of the virus than other patients. Consuming alcohol too can be risky. The WHO has warned that alcohol is an unhelpful coping strategy to combat stress during lockdown which has been introduced by various countries worldwide to contain the spread of the Coronavirus which has taken toll of over one million lives.

In fact experts as also the WHO have cautioned against turning to alcohol to cope with the coronavirus lockdown as it can have severe implications on mental and physical health.

It recommends that people should be minimising the unhelpful coping strategies.

Dr Aiysha Malik, technical officer for the WHO’s department of mental health, said: “For people without addictions, using substances will not help to manage the stress of self-isolation. They can make things worse.”

She said that the WHO wanted to ensure people look after their mental wellbeing by eating healthily, exercising and sleeping properly.

Dr Malik added: “When we’re staying at home routines are very important for creating a sense of structure.

Experts also points out as WHO also mentions, people who smoke are likely to touch their fingers to the lips and, therefore, the risk of transmission from the fingers to the mouth is high. Also, if a person already has a smoking-related disease such as the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, then the chance of developing Covid-19 is also high say the experts.

They assert the importance of healthy habits such as eating healthy diet, getting regular sleep, managing anxiety, exercising and strengthening one’s immune system.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/say-no-to-alcohol-and-smoking-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/say-no-to-alcohol-and-smoking.html
184,14-4-20,Mediterranean diet sharpens your brain too,"The mediterranean diet which is high in vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil not only helps you live longer but also keeps the brain sharper, say researchers, adding that those who followed the diet had the lowest risk of cognitive impairment.

According to a recent analysis of data from two major eye disease studies published in the journals Alzheimer's & Dementia, adherence to the Mediterranean diet correlates with higher cognitive function.

Dietary factors also seem to play a role in slowing cognitive decline.

Researchers at the National Eye Institute (NEI), part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), led the analysis of data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and AREDS2.

""We do not always pay attention to our diets. We need to explore how nutrition affects the brain and the eye"" said lead authors of the studies Emily Chew, director of the NEI in the US.

For the findings, the research team examined the effects of nine components of the mediterranean diet on cognition.

The diet emphasises the consumption of whole fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish, and olive oil, as well as reduced consumption of red meat and alcohol.

AREDS and AREDS2 assessed over the years the effect of vitamins on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which damages the light-sensitive retina.

AREDS included about 4,000 participants with and without AMD, and AREDS2 included about 4,000 participants with AMD.

The researchers assessed AREDS and AREDS2 participants for diet at the start of the studies.

The AREDS study tested participants' cognitive function at five years, while AREDS2 tested cognitive function in participants at baseline and again two, four, and 10 years later.

The researchers assessed diet with a questionnaire that asked participants their average consumption of each Mediterranean diet component over the previous year.

Participants with the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet had the lowest risk of cognitive impairment. High fish and vegetable consumption appeared to have the greatest protective effect.

At 10 years, AREDS2 participants with the highest fish consumption had the slowest rate of cognitive decline.

The researchers also found that participants with the ApoE gene, which puts them at high risk for Alzheimer's disease, on average had lower cognitive function scores and a greater decline than those without the gene.

The benefits of close adherence to a Mediterranean diet were similar for people with and without the ApoE gene, meaning that the effects of diet on cognition are independent of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the study said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mediterranean-diet-sharpens-your-brain-too-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/mediterranean-diet-sharpens-your-brain-too.html

186,14-4-20,Signs of flattening of COVID-19 curve in US: Trump,"Asserting that America was making ""critical progress"" in the war against the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide over the weekend, sending clear evidence that the ""aggressive"" strategy to combat the deadly disease was working.

On Monday, as many 1334 died in the US because of coronavirus and 24,895 new cases were reported. The number was far less than the fatalities hovering around 2,000 for the past several days and over 30,000 new cases being reported daily.

""America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide; hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana, Trump told reporters during his White House press conference on coronavirus on Monday.

""This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It has been incredible what they have done,"" Trump told reporters at the top of his news conference.

So far 5.8 lakh Americans have tested positive with coronavirus, which is almost equal to the next four countries taken together: Spain (170,099), Italy (159,516), France (136,779) and Germany (130,772).

The United States, which has emerged as the hotspot of the coronavirus globally, has so far reported 23,352 fatalities.

""This was really a bad week they are still going to be a lot of deaths but we are starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening particularly in a place that was a hot spot like New York, said Dr Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health and a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.

New York City, which has been the epicenter of coronavirus in the US, with 10,017 deaths and 195,459 cases, now has been registering fewer deaths and new cases than had been the case till last week.

On Tuesday 6,765 new cases were reported from the city as against near and over 10,000 every day and fatalities were 722 as against nearly 1,000 on an average daily last week.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters during a separate news conference that the worst is over. I believe the worst is over if we continue to be smart, and I believe we can now start on the path to normalcy, and we can have a plan where you start to see some businesses reopening understand -- understanding the delicate balance, he said.

New York and New Jersey metro areas alone account for more than 250,000 cases, said Dr Deborah Brix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus in Washington DC.

This level of new cases and fatalities has been prevented in other metropolitan areas of the country, including Chicago and Detroit areas because of the strict implementation of the social mitigation measures and ramping of the health preparedness including hospital beds, she said.

Early this month, members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, based on various models had projected between one lakh and two lakh deaths, even with the implementation of the social mitigation measures, which has now been extended till April 30.

We are going to be hopefully way, way below that number so that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it is still just a horrible thing all over the world, he said.

Trump told reporters that a new social mitigation guideline would be brought out soon. He asserted that the death toll in the US is far less than in Europe, mainly because of the measures his administration took beginning a travel ban on China in the last week of January.

So far the United States has conducted nearly three million tests for the virus, he said, adding that the per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat were scheduled to grace the occasion but were now expected to participate in it digitally.

Earlier, it was believed that the date of bhumi pujan could be extended due to lockdown but now Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust is mulling to organise a small function on April 30 so that the construction of the temple could start once lockdown is lifted.

Trust general secretary Champat Rai said in Ayodhya on Monday that they were considering several options and holding the function through video-conferencing was one of them.

“We can go for a small function through video-conferencing and when the situation normalises, a grand function can be held where the Prime Minister and other prominent persons could be invited. However the blueprint will be finalised in the days to come,” he said.

The trust secretary further said that sadhus of Ayodhya want bhumi pujan done on April 30.

“This is an auspicious day as per Hindu calendar as Baishakh Shukl Saptami falls on this day and the saints are eager to do pujan on that day,” Rai said.

Earlier on March 25, idols of Ram Lalla and other deities were shifted to a new makeshift temple at Ayodhya in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

On November 9 last year, the Supreme Court had delivered its historic judgment giving the entire Ram Janambhoomi land to Hindus for the construction of a Ram Temple and asked the Government to provide five acres of land to Muslims for the construction of a mosque at an alternate place.

It said that if the Governor has reasons to believe that the Government has lost confidence of the House, constitutional propriety requires the issue be resolved by the trust vote. The top court however expressed concern over the trend that legislators are taken away by rival political parties .

“The spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations does little credit to the state of our democratic politics. It is an unfortunate reflection on the confidence which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of politics,” said the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta.

192,14-4-20,"US approves sale of missile, torpedoes worth USD 155 million to India","The Trump administration on Monday notified the Congress of its determination to sell Harpoon air-launched missiles and lightweight torpedoes worth USD 155 million to India.

The sale of 10 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II air launched missiles is estimated to cost USD 92 million, while 16 MK 54 All Up Round Lightweight Torpedoes and three MK 54 Exercise Torpedoes are estimated to cost USD 63 million, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in two separate notifications to the Congress.

The US State Department made this determination following a request for these two military hardware made by the Indian Government, the Pentagon said.

According to the Pentagon, the Harpoon missile system will be integrated into the P-8I aircraft to conduct anti-surface warfare missions in defense of critical sea lanes while enhancing inter-operability with the United States and other allied forces.

""India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces,"" the Pentagon said.

While the Harpoon missiles will be manufactured by Boeing, the torpedoes would be supplied by Raytheon, the notification said.

The proposed sale, it said, will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats from enemy weapon systems. The MK 54 Lightweight Torpedo will provide the capability to conduct anti-submarine warfare missions.

""India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. India intends to utilize MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes on its P-8I aircraft. India will have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed forces, it said.

In both the notifications, the Pentagon said that the proposed sale of these equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.

According to the Pentagon, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.

Difference between cleaning and disinfecting.

These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public.

Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection.

Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.

Can the virus go up to eight metres?

Many people believe the novel coronavirus can be transmitted only short distances in respiratory droplets from a sneeze or cough. But a National Academy of Sciences letter and papers published in The New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA suggest it’s possible that the novel coronavirus can hang in the air for hours and remain infectious. This means people could spread the virus just by breathing normally, and the virus could even be propelled as far as eight metres by a sneeze. However, some skeptics remain unconvinced that the respiratory particles can transmit infection.

When hydroxy chloroquine and azithromycin combination should not be given?

Withhold the drugs in patients with baseline QT prolongation or with known congenital long QT syndrome; monitoring cardiac rhythm and QT interval and withdrawing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin if QTc exceeds 500 msec; correcting hypokalemia to levels greater than 4 mEq/L and hypomagnesemia to more than 2 mg/dL; and avoiding other QTc-prolonging agents when possible.

Can one have unilateral pneumonia in COVID-19?

No.Asymmetrical lung involvement is common, but it is rare for only one lung to be affected.

What are two patterns of oxygen requirement?

First, those with mild-to-moderate hypoxia, who improve slowly over time. Second, those with rapidly escalating oxygen needs, who proceed quickly to intubation.

How do we know the status of asymptomatic infections?

A new study has begun recruiting at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, to determine how many adults in the United States without a confirmed history of infection with SARS-CoV-2, have antibodies to the virus.

The presence of antibodies in the blood indicates a prior infection. In this “serosurvey,” researchers will collect and analyze blood samples from as many as 10,000 volunteers to provide critical data for epidemiological models. The results will help illuminate the extent to which the novel coronavirus has spread undetected in the United States and provide insights into which communities and populations are most affected.

What is blood purification device to treat COVID-19?

The US FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for a blood purification system to treat patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure.

The authorised product works by reducing the amount of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, i.e. small active proteins in the bloodstream that control a cell’s immune response by filtering the blood and returning the filtered blood to the patient. The FDA added that the proteins that are removed are typically elevated during infections and can be associated with a cytokine storm that occurs in some COVID-19 patients. This leads to severe inflammation, rapidly progressive shock, respiratory failure, organ failure and death.

After lungs which is the main organ involved?

Kidney is one of the other major organs involved.

A Negative Ultrasound Is the Most Useful.

There are situations where lung ultrasound can be considered definitive.

For instance, if we see a patient with mild signs of the disease, just fever, and lung ultrasound shows nothing, lung ultrasound rules out pneumonia.

This patient may have COVID-19 of course, but they do not have pneumonia, and they can be treated at home, awaiting the result of the swab test. And this is useful because you can reduce the burden in the emergency department.

On the other hand, there are patients with acute respiratory failure in respiratory distress. If the lung ultrasound is normal, you can rule out Covid-19 and you need to use other diagnostic procedures to understand the problem.

What are lung ultrasound scores?

A score of 0 is given when the pleural line is continuous and regular, with the presence of A-lines, denoting that the lungs are unaffected.

An area is given a score of 3 when the scan shows dense and largely extended white lung tissue, with or without consolidations, indicating severe disease.

Intermediate cases: On the Butterfly algorithm, the suggestion is to look for B-lines, caused by fluid and cellular infiltration into the interstitium, and to weigh that against the need for supplementary oxygen.

The Italian team, in contrast, says a score of 1 is given when the pleural line is indented, with vertical areas of white visible below.

A score of 2 is given when the pleural line is broken, with small to large areas of consolidation and associated areas of white below.

Can covid cause GBS?

Physicians in China are reporting what they believe is the first case of COVID-19 initially presenting as acute Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The patient was a 61-year-old woman returning home from Wuhan during the pandemic.

GBS is an autoimmune neuropathy, which could be triggered by various infections, corresponding author Sheng Chen, MD, PhD, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China,

It may be an association and not a causal relationship.

The case study was published online April 1 in Lancet Neurology.

Can COVID 19 present as acute hepatitis?

A woman presented to the emergency department with high liver enzyme levels and dark urine. She developed fever on day two of care, and then tested positive for the new coronavirus, researchers at Northwell Health, in Hempstead, New York, report.

The authors say the case, published online in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, is the first documented instance of a patient with Covid-19 presenting with acute hepatitis as the primary symptom before developing respiratory symptoms.

194,14-4-20,"China's imported coronavirus cases climb to 1,464","China is grappling with increase in imported coronavirus cases after stamping out the disease from its epicentre Wuhan as it has reported 89 new infections and the rise in asymptomatic patients, posing a serious concern for the authorities, health officials said on Tuesday.

The COVID-19 cases have been increasing again after China managed to contain the first wave of infections as hundreds of Chinese nationals returned home from various countries, including European nations, the US, Russia and Iran to escape the fallout of the pandemic.

China's National Commission (NHC) in its daily report on Tuesday said that 89 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, including three local infections, were reported in the country on Monday.

All three new locally transmitted cases were reported in Guangdong Province, it said.

The officials said 2,000 Chinese nationals were brought home in 16 chartered flights.

All of the new arrivals are being screened in different cities other than Beijing. China has banned the entry of foreign nationals by cancelling all existing visas.

As of Monday, China has reported a total of 1,464 imported cases of which 905 are still undergoing treatment.

Worrying proposition for Chinese health officials are the growing number of asymptomatic cases which climbed to 1,005 with 54 new cases.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the novel coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

The overall confirmed cases in China had reached 82,249 by Monday, including 3,341 people who died of the disease, 1,170 patients still being treated and 77,738 people discharged after recovery, NHC said.

By Monday, 1,009 confirmed cases, including four deaths, had been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in the Macao and 393 in Taiwan, including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Considering the increase of the recurring COVID-19 cases, a high-powered committee to control the virus headed by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday called for stringent measures to control the spread.

Noting the recurring sporadic cases in certain localities, the meeting called for keeping up community-level containment, an official statement said.

""It required that all control measures be enforced down to each household and individual and applied to Chinese and foreigners in the same way, to avert the further spread of infection,"" it said.

Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has killed 119,666 people and infected almost two million people, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

195,14-4-20,Covid tests at pvt labs free only for poor: SC,"Ayushman Bharat to cover such tests at pvt hospitals/labs

The Supreme Court on Monday modified its April 8 order in which it had directed that free testing should be undertaken by the Government as well as private laboratories, saying such a facility would be available only to the people covered under the ‘Ayushman Bharat’ or any other scheme.

In its modified order, a Bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Ravindra Bhat said private labs can continue to charge the payment for testing of Covid-19 from persons who are able to make payment of testing fee as fixed by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

The ICMR has fixed Rs 4,500 for coronavirus testing.

The apex court said the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare may issue necessary guidelines for reimbursement of cost of free treating of Covid undertaken by private labs and necessary mechanism to defray expenses and reimbursement to the private labs.

The Bench left it to the Centre to decide whether any other categories of the weaker sections of society should also be given the benefit of free testing. The Bench passed the modified order in an application filed by Dr Kaushal Kant Mishra, who said direction for free testing will affect the functioning of private labs.

Earlier, the ICMR in an affidavit stated that the Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana, popularly known as Ayushman Bharat scheme, covered 10.74 crore families, meaning 50 crore people.

The ICMR has urged the Supreme Court to withdraw its free coronavirus test order, as it is aiming to scale up the tests in association with private labs, from 10,000 to 15,000 per day to one lakh per day. The ICMR insisted the free-of-cost interim order passed on April 8, may work to the detriment of the cause the country is fighting.

The ICMR said the decision to involve private labs in the process of testing was taken after extensive deliberation with the national task force on all aspects.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-tests-at-pvt-labs-free-only-for-poor--sc-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/covid-tests-at-pvt-labs-free-only-for-poor--sc.html

The portal We Got This Covered, who first broke the news about Batman's reported love story in the upcoming movie, claimed to have got the news from reliable source, reports aceshowbiz.com.

According to the source, the first film in the planned new trilogy will establish Batman's romance with Catwoman, played by Zoe Kravitz.

Apparently, the sequel to the Matt Reeves movie will feature its version of the Jokertaking center stage, along with the beginnings of a full-on love story.

The portal also added that the future sequels will see the pair getting married and having a baby.

It also said that the plot will be familiar to readers of the comics, though it remains to be seen if this will adapt the storyline directly from the comics, in which their first rooftop wedding plans were ruined when Catwoman jilted Batman.

In the comicbook, Batman #85, which was released in 2019, the pair eventually tied the knot in a low-key ceremony.

In the 1992 film ""Batman Returns"", the caped crusader's romance ended with Catwoman apparently dying in order to get revenge on her former boss.

199,14-4-20,Don't think anyone will venture into cinema halls till next year: Tisca Chopra,"Actor Tisca Chopra believes it is unlikely that people would be willing to step into a cinema hall for at least a year in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

The actor said in the coming days, a lot of the content will be heading directly to the streaming platforms, with the exception of the big ticket films.

""A lot of the content will go direct to OTT platforms. It is the best time for OTTs because everyone is on some or the other app or platform. I think the smaller, mid-level films will go direct-to-OTT.

""Those who can't sustain, who borrowed money to make films and are paying interest on that money, will necessarily have to encash the films they have made,"" Tisca told reporters over Zoom call.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced the extension of the nationwide lockdown for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease.

So far in India, there have been 10,363 confirmed cases with 339 deaths due to COVID-19, as per the Union health ministry data.

Tisca said under the current circumstances, people will be scared to converge at a public place and theatres will be definitely facing the brunt as a result of this.

""The big ticket experience films, that can wait for six months or a year and a half, might release after a year. I don't think anyone is venturing into a cinema hall for the next year at least... Right now no one knows enough about the disease.

""So, I am not putting myself in a situation where I am in a closed room with 500 people, where there might be a huge virus load in the air. Till such time as there isn't a vaccine found for this, no one is going to enter a theatre,"" she added.

The actor currently stars in the web series, ""Hostages"", which made its TV debut on Star Plus.

Tisca, who plays a doctor in the Sudhir Mishra-directed Hotstar Special, said the dilemma faced by the healthcare workers today is similar to what her character encountered on the show.

""I see the doctors today doing exactly that. So many haven't even met their families, they are staying in hotels, putting themselves at risk everyday. I can't even imagine their condition.

""In 'Hostages', my character was confronted with a choice right on the centre of her being: endangering the life of a patient and choosing between the life of her family. Strangely, the doctors today face a similar situation. If they go back home, they endanger their family, if they don't go to work, they won't be able to take care of the patients,"" she added.

220,14-4-20,Lockdown extended till May 3: PM,"New Delhi, Apr 14 (PTI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced that the lockdown across the country will be extended till May 3 to fight the coronavirus pandemic, saying the measure has produced a significant outcome in containing the infection.

In a nearly 25-minute televised address to the nation, Modi said implementation of the lockdown will be strictly ensured in its second phase and detailed guidelines will be brought out on Wednesday to ensure that outbreak does not spread to new areas.

Some relaxations may be allowed after April 20 in places where there are no hotspots, he said.

""Follow the rules of lockdown with full devotion till May 3, stay where you are, stay safe,"" the prime minister told citizens.

Modi said India has managed to contain the pandemic well compared to many developed countries due to its holistic approach in dealing with the crisis and sacrifices made by people of the country in the fight produced tangible results.

The prime minister sought the support of the people in seven areas, including taking care of elderly people, maintaining social distancing and helping the poor and downtrodden.

""If India would not have adopted a holistic approach, if an integrated approach was not initiated, India's situation would have been different (compared to many developed countries). It is clear from the experiences of the past few days that the path we have chosen is right,"" the prime minister said.

India, he said, received huge benefits from the 21-day lockdown in checking the pandemic, adding that the country has dealt with the situation better with ""limited resources"".

The lockdown that came into effect on March 25 was to expire at midnight on April 14.

The prime minister said some relaxation may be allowed in some areas and the scope of coronavirus testing will be expanded significantly.

""Till April 20, every town, every police station, every district, every state will be tested on how much they are adhering to the lockdown; how much the areas have protected themselves from coronavirus. It will be observed.

""Some necessary activities may be allowed in areas that will pass this litmus test; areas which will not be among the hotspots and are less likely to turn into hotspots,"" he said.

The prime minister said India may have paid a big economic price, but there can be no alternative to saving human lives.

""India's fight against coronavirus is going on very strongly,"" Modi said, adding that there is adequate stock of medicines and rations in the country.

The fight against COVID-19 will be made more stringent in next one week, he said, asserting that new hotspots will create new crises.

India has reported 10,363 cases of the virus infection and 339 deaths so far.

The drastic pan-India lockdown had shone the spotlight on the miseries of lakhs of migrant workers whose journeys on foot from several urban centres to their villages hundreds of kilometres away grabbed headlines for many days last month.

The catastrophic effect of the lockdown on the overall economy and livelihoods of migrant and daily wage workers triggered severe concerns following which a number of chief ministers in their video conference with Modi on Saturday sought some kind of relaxation for a number of sectors.

Late last month, the government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package aimed at providing relief to those hit hard by the lockdown as well as an insurance cover for healthcare professionals handling virus infected people.

Modi said India has done well in containing the pandemic compared to many other countries.

""You are fulfilling your duties like a disciplined soldier,"" Modi said, hailing the people for their support in stemming the spread of the virus.

However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Tuesday evening showed at least 10,986 cases and 365 deaths.

There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of deaths announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

According to the ministry's data updated in the evening, the highest number of confirmed cases in the country are from Maharashtra at 2,337 followed by Delhi at 1,510 and Tamil Nadu at 1,173. COVID-19 cases have gone up to 879 in Rajasthan followed by 730 in Madhya Pradesh, 657 in Uttar Pradesh and 624 in Telengana.

Gujarat has 617 cases, followed by Andhra Pradesh at 473 and Kerala at 379.

The number of novel coronavirus cases has risen to 270 in Jammu and Kashmir, 258 in Karnataka, 199 in Haryana and 190 in West Bengal. Punjab has reported 176 infections so far.

Bihar has reported 66 cases, while Odisha has 55 coronavirus cases. Thirty-five people were infected with the virus in Uttarakhand, while Himachal Pradesh has 32 cases followed by Assam and Chhattisgarh with 31 cases each.

Jharkhand has 24 cases, Chandigarh has 21 cases and Ladakh has 15, while 11 cases have been reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Goa and Puducherry have reported seven COVID-19 infections each, Manipur and Tripura have two cases each, while Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya have reported a case each.

225,14-4-20,"IMF projects India's growth rate at 1.9% in 2020, forecasts global recession due to COVID-19","The IMF on Tuesday projected a GDP growth of 1.9 per cent for India in 2020, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s due to the raging coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities across the world.

With this subdued forecast, India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation. But the International Monetary Fund, in its latest edition of the World Economy report, has placed India as the fastest-growing emerging economies of the world.

It is among the only two major countries, which will register a positive growth rate in 2020. The other being China, for which the IMF has projected a growth rate of 1.2 per cent.

""We project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 per cent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period,"" Indian--American Gita Gopinath, the IMF Chief Economist said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic will severely impact growth across all regions.

The Great Depression was the worst worldwide economic downturn that lasted for 10 years from 1929, beginning in the US when the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street crashed and wiped out millions of investors.

Most countries, in the advanced economy group, are forecast to contract this year, including the United States ( 5.9 per cent), Japan ( 5.2 per cent), the United Kingdom ( 6.5 per cent), Germany ( 7.0 per cent), France ( 7.2 per cent), Italy ( 9.1 per cent), and Spain ( 8.0 per cent), the IMF report said.

Even with a sharp rebound in the remainder of the year and sizable fiscal support, the Chinese economy is projected to grow at a subdued 1.2 per cent in 2020.

The IMF said several economies in the region were forecast to grow at modest rates, including India (1.9 per cent) and Indonesia (0.5 per cent), and others are forecast to experience large contractions (Thailand, 6.7 per cent).

The IMF said that other regions are projected to experience severe slowdowns or outright contractions in economic activity, including Latin America ( 5.2 per cent) with Brazil's growth forecast at 5.3 per cent and Mexico's at 6.6 per cent; emerging and developing Europe ( 5.2 per cent) with Russia's economy projected to contract by 5.5 per cent.

The Middle East and Central Asia ( 2.8 per cent) with Saudi Arabia's growth forecast at 2.3 per cent, with non-oil GDP contracting by four per cent, and most economies, including Iran, expected to contract; and sub-Saharan Africa ( 1.6 per cent) with growth in Nigeria and South Africa expected at 3.4 per cent and 5.8 per cent respectively.

This is a crisis like no other, and there is substantial uncertainty about its impact on people's lives and livelihoods, Gopinath said.

A lot depends on the epidemiology of the virus, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the development of therapeutics and vaccines, all of which are hard to predict.

In addition, many countries now face multiple crises a health crisis, a financial crisis, and a collapse in commodity prices, which interact in complex ways, she said.

Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, Gopinath said the IMF projects global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 per cent.

India's growth rate in 2021 is projected at 7.4 per cent, while that of China at 9.2 per cent. The United States has been projected to grow at 4.5 per cent and Japan 3 per cent, the IMF report said.

This is a truly global crisis as no country is spared, Gopinath said.

Countries reliant on tourism, travel, hospitality, and entertainment for their growth are experiencing particularly large disruptions, she added.

The emerging markets and developing economies face additional challenges with unprecedented reversals in capital flows as global risk appetite wanes, and currency pressures, while coping with weaker health systems, and more limited fiscal space to provide support. Moreover, several economies entered this crisis in a vulnerable state with sluggish growth and high debt levels, the IMF chief economist wrote.

According to the World Economic Report, the rebound in 2021 depends critically on the pandemic fading in the second half of 2020, allowing containment efforts to be gradually scaled back and restoring consumer and investor confidence.

Significant economic policy actions have already been taken across the world, focused on accommodating public health care requirements, while limiting the amplification to economic activity and the financial system.

The projected recovery assumes that these policy actions are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, it said.

India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation this fiscal year as the coronavirus outbreak severely disrupts the economy, the World Bank said on Sunday.

India's economy is expected to grow 1.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal which started on April 1, the World Bank said in its South Asia Economic Focus report. It estimated India will grow 4.8 per cent to 5 per cent in the 2019-20 fiscal that ended on March 31.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf-projects-india-s-growth-rate-at-1-9--in-2020--forecasts-global-recession-due-to-covid-19-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/imf-projects-india-s-growth-rate-at-1-9--in-2020--forecasts-global-recession-due-to-covid-19.html
226,14-4-20,'Transmission chain broken if no case is reported for 28 days from an area',"The Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday that if no Covid-19 case is reported for 28 days from a specific area, only then we can say that we have been successful in breaking the chain of transmission of the dreaded virus.

In response to a query on the logic behind extending the nationwide lockdown till May 3, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary at the Health Ministry, said ""Our major effort is to break the chain of transmission. If there are no cases reported for 28 days from a particular are or the last negative case is reported 28 days ago, then we believe that the chain of transmission has stopped as cases have stopped coming.""

He insisted that the extension of the lockdown, coupled with social distancing as a behavioral change, is important to break the chain of transmission.

The 28-day period has originated from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's containment plan. According to this, the containment plan would only be scaled down if no Covid-19 case confirmed by a secondary laboratory is reported from the geographic quarantine zone for at least four weeks after the last confirmed case has been isolated and all his contacts have been traced for up to 28 days.

""The containment operation shall be deemed to be over 28 days from the discharge of the last confirmed case (following negative test as per the discharge policy) from the designated health facility, i.e., when the follow up of hospital contacts will be complete,"" said the ministry in a strategy document.

The Cluster Containment Strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection of cases and breaking the chain of transmission.

Responding to a query on India lagging behind on the testing front as compared to other countries, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official said that if somebody is eligible for testing, then he/she will certainly be tested.

""If we are not able to find people to test for the disease, it shows that the number is falling or the number is low. It is difficult to say. We don't say no to anybody for testing,"" the ICMR official said.

Agarwal added that tests are done in accordance to the sampling criteria.

""If we test randomly, then our testing kits would not be utilised for the people who need to be tested. We have also increased our sampling zone -- patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) have been included. We have also introduced rapid diagnostic kits in the field. We have expanded the overall process of testing,"" Agarwal said.

The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday reported another 1,211 confirmed cases and 31 deaths in the last 24 hours. The ministry also said that India has 602 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals having 1,06,719 isolation beds and over 12,000 ICU beds.

It said that advanced screening procedures prior to January 30 have played a major role in managing the deadly infection in the country.

Agarwal said the total number of confirmed cases in India is now at 10,363, while 1,035 have been cured and 339 succumbed to the dreaded virus. Currently, there are 8,988 active cases in the country.

""We are also expanding testing through rapid diagnostic kits,"" added Agarwal.

The ICMR official said that 2.31 Lakh samples have been tested for coronavirus so far with 21,635 testing being done in the last 24 hours.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-transmission-chain-broken-if-no-case-is-reported-for-28-days-from-an-area--2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/-transmission-chain-broken-if-no-case-is-reported-for-28-days-from-an-area-.html
227,14-4-20,"COVID-19: US allows H-1B visa extension, relief for stranded Indians","In a big relief for thousands of stranded Indian professionals in America due to the coronavirus pandemic, the US government has decided to allow applications by H-1B visa holders for an extended stay in the country.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a new notification has said it recognises that there are immigration-related challenges as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The announcement comes at a time when countries around the world have closed their borders and all international passenger flights have been suspended globally.

The travel restrictions have left a number of H-1B visa holders stranded in the US with their visa permits soon to expire. However, the DHS will shortly start accepting applications for the extension of expiring visas.

""We recognise that non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to COVID-19,"" the DHS said.

""We continue to carefully analyse these issues and to leverage our resources to effectively address these challenges within our existing authorities. The DHS also continues to take action to protect the American people and our communities, and is considering a number of policies and procedures to improve the employment opportunities of US workers during this pandemic,"" it said.

Generally, non-immigrants must depart the United States before their authorised period of admission expires, it said.

Non-immigrants could apply for an extension of stay (EOS) or change of status (COS) permit. Without a visa extension, thousands of students and professionals in the US would have suffered.

If applicants put in their forms within the specified time frame, their presence will not be taken as ""unlawful"" and where applicable, ""employment authorization with the same employer, subject to the same terms and conditions of the prior approval, is automatically extended for up to 240 days when an extension of stay request is filed on time,"" the notification said.

The US Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) added that it ""reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances.""

According to rules, if an employer terminates the contract of an H-1B holder, the employee needs to find new employment within 60 days, in order to retain the visa status. Indian IT workers have been seeking an extension of this 60 day grace period to 180 days.

According to the USCIS, Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19--us-allows-h-1b-visa-extension--relief-for-stranded-indians-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/covid-19--us-allows-h-1b-visa-extension--relief-for-stranded-indians.html
228,14-4-20,"14,000 'Covid-19 foot warrior teams' formed across Delhi","To fight the coronavirus pandemic on the ground level, the Delhi government has formed about 14,000 'coronavirus foot warrior' teams which will go from door-to door to check for cases and create awareness about the dreaded virus.

Speaking to the media, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the teams will go from door-to door in every area, including the containment zones, and create awareness about the infection and isolate the potential cases.

Kejriwal said a lot of work is being given to the teams to ensure that awareness and preventive measures about the infection reach each household.

The ""Corona foot warriors Containment and Surveillance Teams"" -- to be formed at booth levels -- is ""multi sectoral"" and includes booth level officials, one civil defence volunteer, one Asha/Anganwadi worker, one MCD sanitation worker and one Delhi police beat constable -- all residing or working in a particular area.

They are responsible for screening, alerting the authorities about suspect cases, taking them to medical facilities, enforcing social distancing and ensuring supply of essential items.

Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev had on Monday directed the District Magistrates to form the corona foot warriors' teams to ensure the well-being of the locals.

The order directed the DMs to form the teams immediately.

""The team members must be fit and healthy,"" the order said.

It said the team members will make phone calls to various households in the area to ensure the well-being of their family members and regarding availability of all essential items.

""They shall also inquire with the concerned households whether they know of any suspect case in their neighborhood,"" the order said.

The team members will have to make field visits to enforce social distancing in their respective areas, particularly JJ Clusters and unauthorised colonies to ensure compliance of government guidelines.

Also, the teams will play a crucial role in identifying the suspect cases, their transportation to isolation centres and disinfection of the area.

""Once a containment cluster is identified, the team should ensure that the containment plan made to manage the cluster is followed scrupulously,"" the order said.

The team will have to submit a daily report at 6 p.m.

The order said that Sanjay Goel, a 2004 batch IAS officer, will be the overall coordinator for the teams and will report to the Principal Secretary (Revenue)-cum-Divisional Commissioner.

229,14-4-20,That's the spirit! Japan hospitals find way to beat sanitiser shortage,"Strong alcoholic drinks can be used ""when absolutely necessary"" instead of hand sanitiser in Japanese hospitals, authorities said, as supplies run dry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Spirits with an alcohol proof of between 70 and 83 percent can be substituted to sterilise hands under new rules set out in a health ministry document obtained by AFP on Tuesday.

Some vodkas are that strong, but traditional Japanese tipples such as sake and shochu do not make the grade -- at a maximum alcohol proof of roughly 22 and 45 percent respectively.

But some sake makers have begun producing stronger alcohol products to meet the demand for sanitiser.

Japan beverage giant Suntory is already manufacturing sanitiser in the United States, the country hardest-hit by the outbreak.

Under Japanese regulations, liquids designed for disinfection should contain between 76.9 and 81.4 percent alcohol content.

Any more than this is less effective and should be diluted, officials say.

Welcoming the collaboration, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday tweeted, “As we prepare for an extended lockdown, we are proud to work together with @GoogleIndia Maps in ensuring easy accessibility of all our food and night shelters. We are committed to do everything possible to make life easy for those most affected by the lockdown.”

The city government had announced relief measures for the people whose livelihood means were affected by the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

It had initially opened all 223 night shelters run by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board for providing food and shelter to the affected people in the city.

Later, the government started over 1,500 free food distribution centres along with temporary shelters for migrant workers who were trying to leave the city for their native states.

“The AAP-led Delhi government, with the support of a team of volunteers and researchers, mapped all such relief shelters. The government has partnered with Google to display the locations of 1,047 food and night shelters initially on Google Maps, with more being added every day,” the government said in a statement. Anyone can now easily search for their nearest Delhi government food centre on Google Maps application by typing in 'food shelters near me' in the search box, it said.

“Food and night shelters can now be found in #Delhi and 32 other cities to help those in need. Please spread the word and help this message reach them,” Google India said in a statement on Twitter.

231,14-4-20,IMF: Global economy will suffer worst year since Depression,"Beaten down by the coronavirus outbreak, the world economy in 2020 will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund says in its latest forecast.

The IMF said Tuesday that it expects the global economy to shrink 3% this year — far worse than its 0.1% dip in the Great Recession year of 2009 — before rebounding in 2021 with 5.8% growth. It acknowledges, though, that prospects for a rebound next year are clouded by uncertainty.

The bleak assessment represents a breathtaking downgrade by the IMF. In its previous forecast in January, before COVID-19 emerged as a grave threat to public health and economic growth worldwide, the international lending organization had forecast moderate global growth of 3.3% this year.

But far-reaching measures to contain the pandemic — lockdowns, business shutdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions — have suddenly brought economic activity to a near-standstill across much of the world.

“The world has been put in a great lockdown,'' the IMF's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, told reporters. “This is a crisis like no other.” Gopinath said the cumulative loss to the global gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of economic output, could amount to $9 trillion — more than the economies of Germany and Japan combined.

The IMF's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook was prepared for this week's spring meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings, along with a gathering of finance ministers and central bankers of the world's 20 biggest economies, will be held virtually for the first time in light of the coronavirus outbreak.

In its latest outlook, the IMF expects economic contractions this year of 5.9% in the United States, 7.5% in the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, 5.2% in Japan and 6.5% in the United Kingdom. China, where the pandemic originated, is expected to eke out 1.2% growth this year. The world's second-biggest economy, which had gone into lockdown, has begun to open up well before other countries.

Worldwide trade will plummet 11% this year, the IMF predicts, and then grow 8.4% in 2021.

Last week, the IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that the world was facing “the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.'' She said that emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at especially high risk. And on Monday, the IMF approved $500 million to cancel six months of debt payments for 25 impoverished countries.

The IMF cautioned that its forecast is shrouded by unknowns. They include the path that the virus will take; the effectiveness of policies meant to contain the outbreak and minimize the economic damage; and uncertainty over whether, even many months from now, people will continue to isolate themselves and depress spending as a precaution against a potential resurgence of the virus.

On a hopeful note, the IMF noted that policymakers in many countries have engineered what it calls a “swift and sizable'' response to the economic crisis. In the United States, for instance, the Federal Reserve has intervened aggressively to smooth lending markets. And Congress has enacted three separate rescue measures, including a $2.2 trillion aid package — the largest in history — that is meant to sustain households and businesses until the outbreak recedes and economic life begins to return to normal.

That package includes direct payments to individuals, business loans, grants to companies that agree not to lay off workers and expanded unemployment benefits. And Congress is moving toward approving a possible fourth economic aid measure.

Gathering at their own virtual meeting, finance officials of the Group of Seven major industrial countries, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, pledged to “use all available policy tools” to achieve a strong recovery.

Meghan Clem, CEO of the wedding and party-planning company Intertwined Events, says she is hoping that some government loans come through so she can continue to pay her staff. The next two to three months will likely be the worst of the crisis for Intertwined Events.

“All events have been canceled or postponed to the fourth quarter, so we are seeing a full stop of revenue for May, June and likely July,” said Clem, whose company is based in Irvine, California.

In Europe, the sudden downturn has spotlighted the vulnerabilities of the shared euro currency. The 19-country bloc lacks a powerful central treasury. And it's struggled to settle on a unified fiscal response, with northern European countries like the Netherlands and Germany blocking proposals for shared borrowing backed by all countries. The member countries did agree on what could amount to a half-trillion euros in stimulus. But conditions on part of the package mean that some of the money may never be tapped.

Italy, which has been deeply hurt by the crisis, is expected to suffer a 9% drop this year in its gross domestic product, and its debt load could soar from an already high 135% of GDP. Fears have arisen of a renewed debt crisis, though for now stimulus from the European Central Bank has calmed lending markets.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf--global-economy-will-suffer-worst-year-since-depression-2020-04-14.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/imf--global-economy-will-suffer-worst-year-since-depression.html
