0,03-2-20,"Long on vision, short on means","The credibility of the fiscal consolidation glide path has been dented which is also reflected in the Sensex falling by over 1,000 points after the Budget announcements

The Union Budget for 2020-21 presented to the Parliament by Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 confirms apprehensions that the actual fiscal deficit (FD) for 2019-20 would exceed the Budget Estimate (BE) by a significant margin. Sitharaman puts it at 3.8 per cent of the GDP against the target of 3.3 per cent. However, she has justified this deviation in terms of the recommendation of the NK Singh Committee on review of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 which permits breach of the target in case of “far-reaching structural reforms with unanticipated fiscal implications.”

For 2020-21, the FM has provided for a FD of 3.5 per cent as against 3.0 per cent as stipulated under the FRBM Act. Here also, she has justified the deviation of five per cent in terms of the “unanticipated fiscal implications”. One wonders whether this could be a credible justification considering that there is no major announcement in the Budget which could qualify in the category of structural reforms.

However, she has candidly acknowledged the existence of so-called off-budget liabilities and extra-budgetary resources (EBRs) — a euphemism for borrowings by agencies and PSUs made on behalf of the Government — and mentioned these in an annexure. She has also stated that it is the responsibility of the Government to service these liabilities. Having done so, logically these should have been brought on to the balance sheet and accordingly, revised the FD upward. In essence, the projected health of the Budget continues to be misleading.

The credibility of the fiscal consolidation glide path has been dented, which is also reflected in the Sensex declining by over 1,000 points or 2.5 per cent. Going through an unusually lengthy speech, one fails to come across any major reform measure that would either have the effect of bringing about drastic reduction in any of the major subsidies viz. food, fertilisers, fuel, electricity and so on or indicative of any major dilution in Government intervention or boost to market forces (as alluded to in the Economic Survey: 2019-20).

Even as the Budget is replete with welfare schemes being implemented under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode to prevent pilferage, there is no mention of implementing DBT in the above-mentioned areas wherein subsidies guzzle over Rs 300,000 crore every year. The recommendation of the Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) for attempting some reduction in food subsidy by limiting coverage (over 800 million people are covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA)) and increase in the issue price — currently Rs 1/2/3 per kg for coarse cereals, wheat and rice — remains unheeded.

In electricity, the proposal for smart meters, pre-paid meters and giving choice to consumers to choose their suppliers as a way forward to address the issues facing power distribution companies (PDCs) does nothing to deal with fundamental ailments afflicting the sector. These arise due to supply of electricity to a certain category of consumers viz. poor households and farmers either at a fraction of the cost of purchase and distribution or even free; large-scale theft (very often abetted by political brass) and inflated tariff allowed to generators under power purchase agreements (PPAs). One wonders whether these would be addressed under New Tariff Policy (NTP).

In this backdrop, the proposal to allow a lower corporate tax rate of 15 per cent to existing power generation companies on par with that applicable to new enterprises (this was announced under the package of steep reduction in the corporate tax last year) will be of no consequence. A concession in tax rate helps only when the generator makes profit. But in a situation wherein it does not even get paid for its supplies (courtesy, mess in discoms), this won’t be of any use.

Meanwhile, the FM has revealed the Government’s decision to accept the interim recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) for 2020-21. This may not be good news for the States already facing stress on their balance sheets (due to shortfall in their own revenue and pending dues from the Centre under the GST) as the FC has recommended a significant cut in devolution of Central taxes even while proposing greater help through grant-in-aid. The Budget talks about giving a big boost to the agriculture and rural sector and reiterates the Government’s overarching commitment to doubling farmers’ income by 2022.

A number of innovative steps are suggested under a 16-point agenda — comprehensively covering almost every area that has an impact on farmers’ ability to increase income. These cover inter alia adoption of flexible laws in sync with the model legislations passed by the Centre, creation of warehousing and cold storage facilities in the supply chain (including at the village level), setting up of solar power units on barren land, plan for use of proper manure (reducing dependence on chemical fertilisers) and minimising use of water, strengthening and expanding scope of Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs) to include fisheries, increase in credit availability, increase in piped water supply to all households and so on. Agriculture being a Concurrent subject under the Constitution, all of the above is sought to be achieved by giving incentives to the States plus involvement of agencies like the Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC), Food Corporation of India (FCI), viability gap funding plus financial support from organisations like NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) and so on.

When viewed in the backdrop of States continuing with archaic laws such as Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) under which millions of farmers and even FPOs are held hostage to politically-backed intermediaries/traders at the mandis, these would remain as pious declarations as always in the past. Even so, the allocation for agriculture and allied sectors and rural development at Rs 283,000 crore for 2020-21 is just about Rs 23,000 crore higher than the allocation for 2019-20 which is “modest” for the intended gigantic transformation. Curiously, the provision includes Rs 60,000 crore for PM - KISAN which is essentially consumption oriented; it can’t be deemed as augmenting the income-raising ability of farmers.

The lack of demand and investment are identified as two major constraints to growth. Continuing with a spate of stimulants provided during August/September 2019, this Budget has attempted to leave extra money in the pockets of salary earners by creating a highly differentiated slab structure. Under the new scheme of things, the highest tax rate of 30 per cent kicks in at an income of Rs 15 lakh against the current threshold of Rs 10 lakh. So, a person earning Rs 15 lakh will save about Rs 75,000 (as per the FM’s calculation).

For the corporates, the dividend distribution tax (DDT) has been abolished, sparing them the double whammy of taxing profit first at the distribution stage and then in the recipient’s hand. The Budget contains a spate of concessions for MSMEs, start-ups, exporters and the real estate sector, given their importance from the perspective of employment generation. A number of innovative steps are envisaged for MSMEs to help with the timely payment of their dues from large enterprises and increase in financing (especially through “invoice financing” by NBFCs).

The Budget reiterates the Government’s commitment to continue with consolidation of public sector banks (PSBs), giving tax incentives under their mergers and amalgamations, effective use of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for recovery of NPAs, recapitalisation for adequate provisioning and credit growth, improvement in the quality of lending and so on.

There will also be greater focus on continuous monitoring of loans and creation of a data bank to detect early signs of delinquency. The building of infrastructure commensurate with making India a $5 trillion economy has received much attention. A comprehensive roadmap for projects to be taken up under the National Infrastructure Project (NIP) scheme is laid out. This is welcome but there remains a big question mark over funding it which entails a mammoth investment of Rs 100 lakh crore over the next five years.

The Budget seeks to give a boost to “Make in India” with emphasis on consolidating its lead in the digital revolution and propping up industries involving labour- intensive technologies. However, from the way the FM has made changes in customs duties, it would appear that the Modi Government could be in for “over-protectionism.” This won’t be in the long-term interest of India wanting to derive a good slice of its growth potential from increasing participation in global trade.

The FM has attempted a detailed blueprint of what all needs to be done to pursue the three themes viz. “Aspirational India”, “Economic Development”, “Caring Society.” But, in the absence of credible plans for arranging resources (without destabilising the fiscal applecart) and garnering necessary political will for execution, it is doubtful whether the results will match the intent.

1,03-2-20,Marketing new perspectives,"The overarching dominance of the Planning Commission and then the NITI Aayog have blurred the focus on regional development

The change in nature of markets has created several universes within its fold, so as to almost require an interpreter to talk from one segment to another. Yet in a country like India, all marketing instrumentalities, from hawking to internet communication, seem relevant. Their pertinence in the social segment in which they operate determines the robustness of that economy. Each segment has its own significance and it determines to a large extent the prosperity of the region where it operates. This economic growth is central to the community’s welfare because livelihoods depend on that. However, there remains a catch-22 situation as each marketing method in a socio-economic segment can and does evolve. Leaving it frozen at a given level is unwise for the overall well-being of that division. Nature, being what it is, will induce change and its own evolution does not need a policy decision. But this progression may be slow and may be excluding migrant segments of that given economic division from returning to it for their livelihood and with a level of comfort. Thus it is that remaining migrant groups are reluctant to go back to where they originated from and settle down where they have moved to. Thereby they almost delink themselves from the base community from which they emerged. Marketing methods are a major determinant of this process.

Just as it is difficult to visualise a so-called avant-garde marketing method in a remote village cluster which does not even have proper amenities for food and shelter, so also the marketing methods have to be at peace with lifestyles and communities. The catch-22 referred to above, can be worked out by resolving this dilemma. Instruments of change have to carry out the upgradation of the affected communities without disrupting their livelihoods. This requires thought and proactive designs of intervention. Unfortunately this is a perspective which many social interventionists seem to miss altogether. The crescendo of modernisation does not help the case of graduated and gradual change. People often mistake the toolkit for substance. In the course of participation in many planning processes, it becomes evident that the interventionist paradigm of the leader, especially if he is a powerful one, gets smoother endorsement with the powers that actually control that segment. The result is many square pegs in round holes. In view of the competitiveness, India is often seen to adopt a method which appears prima-facie acceptable but undoable with immediate effect in many contexts in which it is attempted.

India is not the only country where periodically such interventions have been attempted in different pockets. Turkey, under Kemal Ataturk, attempted mediations which were not confined to economics and livelihood but also covered social engineering, where the national leader attempted to catapult the country into European social norms from the more conventional Middle Eastern ones. In many cases these intrusions did not take root and created a self-defeating environment where social practices lapsed into the original mould from where the political intervention had sought to leverage the community. In-built levels and echelons of hierarchy which were going to be affected by the changes, fought hard against them. It would be useful to remind ourselves that in a country as large as ours, it is possible and even desirable to have a certain degree of economic modeling, common at a pan-India level. At the same time, the economic diversities are so large that regional models of development will have to be crafted, evolved and practiced. Work in that direction is yet to begin in earnest. The overarching dominance of the Planning Commission and subsequently the NITI Aayog, coupled with the penchant of continuously highlighting emotive issues like caste, religion and language, have blurred the focus on regional development. It is difficult to conceive how a river valley culture of say West Bengal could be the receptacle of the same kind of economic philosophy which would work in the woodlands of Mizoram. The limited ability of economists to visualise a sociogram good enough for our agro-climatic realities and the wealth of soil and land, had high prices to pay. It is true that there are literally millions of people below the poverty line but the definition of poverty line alone reflects an overarching emphasis on the monetised version of economic development. There are substantial parts of India where forest produces are the primary resource of livelihood and where the money economy has still to make its entry in a significant enough manner to affect and create social interventions which result in positive change.

A window on the whole process can be created by extensive fieldwork in trying to understand what it is that moves livelihoods in a given agro-climatic zone. The first step towards the initial documentation of the ground realities is to smoothen and strengthen the conventional process in a manner in which wastage is reduced, longevity of the products is increased and the awareness of its availability is universalised in a relevant social segment where it can be bought. Socio-economic engineering based on the fulcrum of the local productivity process can move the world quicker. The lever has to be the intention and the will to give this alternate economics, rooted in local conditions, a chance to prove itself.

2,03-2-20,No statement of accounts from the FM,"Allocations and numbers don’t synchronise with the projections. This Government keeps on talking of long-term solutions for every problem but should we all starve and wait in the short-term?

The biggest problem with the longest Budget speech is there was no comparative on allocations to any scheme with that of the previous year. The Budget, which is called “Book of Accounts”, has no meaning without numbers. Let’s try to decode the Budget on some hits and mostly misses.

The Government proposed new tax slabs for individuals. Old slabs and tax rates were as follows — Rs 2.50 lakh at NIL, Rs 2.50-5 lakh at five per cent, Rs 5-10 lakh at 20 per cent above Rs 10 lakh at 30 per cent. But if you had income up to Rs five lakh, then the tax was zero through a rebate. The new slabs and rates proposed are as follows Rs 2.50 lakh at NIL, Rs 2.50-5 lakh at five per cent, Rs 5-7.5 lakh at 10 per cent, Rs 7.5-10 lakh at15 per cent, Rs 10-12.50 lakh at 20 per cent, Rs 12.50-15 lakh at 25 per cent, above Rs 15 lakh at 30 per cent. But in the new regime, there are no exemptions and deductions. The common man has an option of going with the old regime or switching over to the new one. Thus, every person has to calculate his income in both regimes and then choose one that works for him best. Thus, when the Government talks about simplification of income tax laws and return filing mechanisms, such a tax regime just ties us down to deeper complications.

In order to boost the manufacturing sector, new provisions were introduced in September 2019, offering a concessional corporate tax rate of 15 per cent to the newly-incorporated domestic companies in the manufacturing sector, which intend to roll out by March 31, 2023. This concessional tax rate benefit of 15 per cent has now been extended to new domestic companies engaged in the generation of electricity. But is the power infrastructure ready?

This Budget allocates Rs 22,000 crore for power, renewable energy sector, discom reforms. Gas grid is proposed to be extended to 27,000 km (which is 16,000 km now) and gas price discovery will also be reformed. The Budget also intends to promote smart metering with all the State and Union Territories to replace conventional electricity meters by pre-paid smart meters in next three years. Pre-paid meters are against the vision of the Government. Taking electricity to every household has been a major promise but now they are moving towards pre-paid meters and privatisation of electricity. In a country where many people are still below the poverty line pre-paid electricity meters will make electricity a luxury item whereas it is a basic necessity.

The FM has proposed to sell the balance Government holding in IDBI bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange. Certain specified categories of Government securities would be opened fully for non-resident investors, apart from being available to domestic investors as well. The Government now proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC by way of Initial Public Offer (IPO), ostensibly to keep it transparent. Sale of stake in LIC is a one-off event and it is important to note that on an ex-LIC basis, the fiscal deficit may be well above four per cent next year. As LIC has stakes in almost every company in India whether private or PSU, selling its stake can also be termed against “national interest.” Already there is huge stress on the economy and by selling stakes in LIC, one thing is clear. That the company that till now bailed out many PSUs will bail out the Government itself.

Any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the administration. To improve trust between the taxation department and the assessee, the Government will amend the provisions of the Income Tax Act to mandate the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to adopt a Taxpayers’ Charter. This is a welcome step towards enhancing investor confidence and trust.

The zero-Budget natural farming, which was mentioned in the July 2019 Budget, was explained further in this Budget. Integrated farming systems in rain-fed areas will be expanded. Multi-tier cropping, bee-keeping, solar pumps, solar energy production in non-cropping season will be added. The portal on “jaivikkheti” — online national organic products market — will also be upgraded. The PM-KUSUM scheme to provide loans to farmers for setting up stand-alone solar pumps, will be expanded. Further it is also proposed to help another 15 lakh farmers solarise their grid-connected pump sets. In addition, a scheme to enable farmers to set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow/barren lands and to sell it to the grid would be operationalised.

For the sector comprising agriculture and allied activities, irrigation and rural development, an allocation of about Rs 2.83 lakh crore has been made for the year 2020-21. The problem with such an approach is that most of it is just repackaging and rewording of existing schemes.

To connect farm with markets it is proposed that railways will introduce a Kisan Express and Ministry of Civil Aviation will launch Krishi Udaan to help farmers transport perishable goods quickly. The Kisan Rail will be set up through PPP arrangement to transport perishable goods across the country at a faster pace. Further the Railways will also build cold supply chain for milk, meat and fish by setting up train services for the purpose. However, an amount for the same has not been allocated and the Government has simply expressed its intent to move in this direction but done nothing concrete.

To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic industry and also to generate resource for health services, the Budget imposes a nominal health cess, by way of a duty of customs, on imports of medical equipment, keeping in view that these goods are now being made significantly in India. Further it is proposed that the proceeds from this cess shall be used for creating infrastructure for health services in the aspirational districts. Given the fact that the generic drugs are yet to take off and patient trust is hard-earned, there is no mention of how India-made equipment can be pushed in terms of quality and volumes.

To achieve higher export credit disbursement, a new scheme, NIRVIK, is being launched, which provides for higher insurance coverage, reduction in premium for small exporters and simplified procedure for claim settlements.

The best thing about this scheme is that it proposes to digitally refund to exporters, duties and taxes levied at the Central, State and local levels, such as electricity duties and VAT on fuel used for transportation, which are not getting exempted or refunded under any other existing mechanism. Electricity Duty and VAT on Petroleum goods constitutes substantial part of costs.

This Budget is full of promises with dreams for the future. But how these dreams will be achieved has not been explained. Also, allocations and numbers don’t synchronise with the projections. This Government keeps on talking of long-term solutions for every problem but should we all starve and wait in the short-term?

State Revenue and Transport Minister, Govind Singh Rajput, inaugurated the competition. Public Relations Minister P.C Sharma, Minister of Sports and Youth Welfare Jitu Patwari, former Union Minister Arun Yadav and Padma Olympian archer Deepika Kumari were also present. Attractive fireworks were also performed on the occasion.

Along with the spectacular presentation of Mallakhamba players at the function, players from ten divisions of the State made an attractive march past. In the ceremony, medal winners of Khelo India Youth Games were honoured by providing incentives.

Jitu Patwari encouraged the players and also said that various schemes are launched by Government for the players. Addressing the function, Public Relations Minister P.C. Sharma told the players not to be afraid of the struggle because to win they also have to face defeat.

While addressing the function, Padmashree Olympian archer Deepika Kumari commended the Madhya Pradesh government for the excellent facilities being provided to the players, while she gave tips for the players to make a career in sports. She said that when she started the archery game in the year 2007, there were not so many sports facilities and equipment but she did not give up. She said that players must take advantage of the opportunity.

Director Sports and Youth Welfare Thoussen said in the welcome address that the vision of governance for the provincial Olympic Games is to prepare the talent of the state for the Commonwealth, Asian and Olympics apart from traditional sports and provide them maximum opportunities for talent performance.

He informed that from February 1 to 7, a state level Gurunanak Dev Ji Provincial Olympic Games competition is being organised in which players from ten divisions are participating in ten sports.

Under the competition, the first group competed for volleyball, football, wrestling, badminton and kabaddi from 1 to 3 February and first day knock-out matches were played.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-level-gurunanak-dev-ji-provincial-olympic-sports-competition-inaugurated.html

7,03-2-20,No growth in this story,"The Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved. The FM has not acknowledged these two challenges

This budget was meant to increase consumption, encourage spends among the middle class, stimulate growth and primarily put the economy back on the road to recovery. Yet the reality is that far from being memorable, it is a damp squib without any sense of urgency to mean business. The story can be summed up easily. The GDP growth is the lowest in 11 years. The government estimates nominal GDP for 2020-21 at 10 per cent. It is lower than the 12 per cent that was projected in 2019-20, which turned out to be only 7.5 per cent. Private consumption is at its lowest in seven years. Investment growth is at its slowest in 17 years. Manufacturing is the lowest in 15 years. Tax growth is the lowest in 20 years. Food inflation is the highest in six years.

The government has done very little to revitalise the economy, stimulate growth rate, promote private investment, increase efficiency, create jobs or boost the rapidly shrinking exports. In a nutshell, this budget has nothing to address the problems the country faces. I am totally confused with the multiple themes, segments and programmes. Ongoing programmes have failed but still this government is throwing more (and in some cases less) money into them. Will that change anything? There is no clear vision or articulated plan for market economy, competition or higher trade intensity. This government is in complete denial that the economy faces a grave macro-economic challenge and the growth rate has declined in six successive quarters. Show me one thing in this Budget that will revive growth in 2020-21. The claim of 6 to 6.5. per cent growth next year is shocking.

It seems to me that the government’s main source of revenue will be through the disinvestment of PSUs. The remaining government stake in IDBI Bank will be sold off. Also, a part of the government’s stake in LIC will be sold through an IPO. This explains the doubling of the disinvestment target from the current fiscal to the next one — from Rs 1 lakh crore in FY20 to Rs 2.1 lakh crore in FY21. Even the disinvestment target for the current fiscal has not been met — with only Rs 65,000 crore raised.

The Finance Minister (FM) stated that the government debt came down to 48.9 per cent from 52.2 per cent. This may be in part due to the unprecedented transfer of surplus from the RBI to the Central Government, to the tune of Rs 1, 76, 051 crore (0.8 per cent of GDP), in August 2019. This “quasi fiscal deficit” practice is against the basic principles of prudent fiscal management.

The FM claimed that “Inflation is well contained.” Yet inflation was 7.4 per cent in December 2019, a record high since July 2014. It is higher than the upper limit of the target inflation rate set by the RBI. (Target of four per cent, with upper tolerance level of six per cent, for the period between June 2016-March 2021).

The Minister claimed that the Government’s policy of Make in India has yielded “great dividends.” The scheme has not yielded its target dividends. Its first target was to increase the manufacturing sector’s growth rate to 12-14 per cent per annum, but the sector has only grown, on an average, at half of the targeted growth rate. In FY20, the manufacturing sector growth plummeted to a paltry two per cent. The second goal of increasing the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent by 2020 has also not been met since this figure has remained only around 15 per cent. The government is also clearly unable to meet its third target of creating 100 million additional jobs by 2022 in the manufacturing sector, given its refusal to provide numbers on how many jobs were actually created as a result of the scheme and the devastating figures provided by the NSSO, estimating the unemployment rate in 2017-18 at a 45-year high of 6.1 percent.

The Budget emphasises the importance of building a statistical system that has strong credibility and supplies data in real time. Yet, this Government has triggered the dismantling of statistical institutions in India — from mass resignations by statisticians, to leaked reports which the government refuses to acknowledge.

Five newer smart cities will be created. This is a meagre increment from the 100 designated already. Further, the Smart Cities Mission has been proceeding at a slow rate. At present, only 25 per cent projects proposed have been completed (1296 out of 5151) and a corresponding 11 per cent of funds have been spent on these completed projects out of the total proposed investment in the Mission.

And for all the bluster about development in Kashmir, the Minister made just a token reference to it, reciting lines from a poem by Pandit Dinanath Kaul. This is a mockery of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who cannot even hear the FM because of the communications blockade still present in many parts of the region. Of course, she conveniently omitted his full name, which is Pandit Dinanath Kaul ‘Nadim.’ Clearly, the honorific was politically inconvenient.

With the Budget’s focus on wealth creation and a “caring society” and “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas,” the question remains for whom? According to last month’s Oxfam report, the top one per cent richest people in India owns 42 per cent of the wealth of the nation, which is more than four times the wealth of the bottom 70 per cent. The rhetoric of compassion and caring has no real world implications as the BJP has launched a campaign of vitriol against peaceful anti-CAA protestors, often provoking violence against them.

The Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved. The FM has not acknowledged these two challenges. Consequently, she has proposed no measures or solutions to those two challenges. If the twin obstacles remain, the economy will not turn around and there will be no relief to the millions of poor and the middle class. This government has done nothing to get us out of the financial crisis we are in. Our past track record with this government shows it failed miserably on attaining any key targets — nominal GDP growth, fiscal deficit, net tax revenue collection, disinvestment revenue or total expenditure. What is the assurance that it will meet the targets set for 2020-21? It looks like the FM has outright rejected every reform idea contained in the Economic Survey.

8,03-2-20,A road to nowhere,"Some lower rate income taxpayers might be happy but what else exactly did this budget achieve? Nothing really

The Bombay Stock Exchange dropped nearly 1000 points a couple of hours after Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman finished delivering her Budget speech. As far as percentage drops go, there have been worse single-day collapses in the Indian capital markets but this time even corporate titans and financial experts were far from divided on the Budget. There was a universal feeling that it had missed the opportunity for big bang structural reforms that could have given a sense of direction and purpose to the economy. Of particular irritation was the sense that the Government did not acknowledge that India is in the midst of an economic crisis and it was telling to hear even talking heads sympathetic to the government feeling a bit down after the speech. And what a speech it was; even with the standard deduction for couplets by classical poets, it was just short of three hours. Possibly that was the biggest disappointment with the Budget, a lot of talk but not all that much action. The headline that almost everyone will concentrate on is the rejig in personal income taxes, a slight reduction in income tax slabs which will help those Indians who earn less than `15 lakh a year. But there is a massive rider there, the old income tax regime remains because the new tax slabs allow for fewer exemptions. So effectively, older taxpayers who make tax-linked investments will most likely not shift away from the existing tax regime. In fact, while the FM spoke about “simplification” of the income tax system, it is likely that most taxpayers, other than those in the lower slabs, will have to sit down with professionals and work out how best to structure their taxes. The Government has long spoken about the need to rationalise income taxes and reduce exemptions and that is an achievable ideal. If that needed to be done, a more radical change in tax slabs would have been in order than having a confusing and parallel income tax system in place. Removing exemptions, including most under Section 80, medical insurance and house rent allowance among others, will almost ensure that few, if any, Indian tax payers will move to the new regime. That said, the abolishing of dividend distribution tax is a net positive for investors, albeit resident Indian promoters and high net-worth individuals might be desperately unhappy as their dividends will now be taxed at their regular tax rates. Then there is the fiscal deficit, with several economic experts openly questioning the Government’s maths. It is very possible that it can mop up funds from divesting its share in several public sector units. The FM said that the Government would divest a portion of its holding in Life Insurance Company of India (LIC) but given that the overall disinvestment process has been haphazard under the Narendra Modi government, there are open questions about how this will be done.

While negativity will take us nowhere, this is the first budget in several years where Indian industry has been so highly critical of the Government. Of course, several industrialists and bankers realise that Sitharaman has to walk a tightrope between maintaining fiscal prudence and the profligacy of overspending. The latter has been relatively constrained. There are some interesting new spends such as investment in clean air, which are welcome. However, as we close the chapter on yet another budget, there is this overwhelming sense that this could have been so much more. This is not just a bad budget, it is a disappointing one.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-road-to-nowhere-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/a-road-to-nowhere.html
9,03-2-20,Social message,"Without a result-oriented revamp, the social sector allocations end up being plain vacuous

Just as we are left confused as to whether the Budget is a vision document meant for a conclave or indeed about fund allocations for sectoral growth, many would find the announcements and the length devoted on the social sector encouraging. But just as we are finding the god of deliverance in the small things, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman offered some to both the health and education sectors, albeit in the nature of a summary dole than pondering on the practicalities of implementation. She announced an outlay of Rs 69,000 crore for healthcare, up from Rs 62,398 crore last year and still short of the 2.5 per cent of the GDP promised by the Government. This is way off the Rs 1,50,000 crore that health industry bigwigs had sought to drive the sector forward. And way lesser than what other emerging economies, BRICS and even Afghanistan and Nepal are spending. For a nation that has an increasing disease burden and a rapidly ageing population, a fact we disregard as we obsess over our young productive age group, there is no major policy overhaul that is indicated. That probably has got to do with the fact the Ayushman Bharat Yojna, which provides a cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per poor family, has yet to overcome hurdles of execution. Private hospitals are yet to rationalise their packages with the subsidised costs and at the micro-level are turning away applicants who do not understand the fine print of medical conditions and what makes them eligible for entitlement and what not. There’s a question hovering over the number of marginalised people it has managed to shield. So the Government has played safe by just apportioning a part of the total allocation, Rs 6,400 crore, for the scheme. Instead, it would have been far more prudent for the Government to route some funds to smaller hospitals in Tier II and III cities and net them in as providers of Ayushman Bharat. Of course, the Government has been responsive in addressing the gaps in the public health delivery system by provisioning for local medical colleges to be attached to district district hospitals in the private-public partnership (PPP) mode, with some exemptions on land to be acquired for this purpose. The FM also announced a special bridge course for medicare professionals. India’s doctor to patient ratio is 1:1,445, against the WHO benchmark of 1:1,000. Duties on imports and special incentives for using medical devices “Made In India” may sound good but what really needs to be addressed are their quality and standardisation. Neither is there any mention of insurance, which experts have been suggesting should be tiered, for employees, the self-employed and elders, and backing them up with increased tax deductions.

The FM has allocated Rs 99,300 crore to the education sector, Rs 3,000 crore for skill development and even proposed FDIs. Clearly responding to criticism that our teaching modules fall way behind employability indices, she has announced apprenticeships at 150 higher education institutions and urban local bodies. The degree-level online education programmes to be offered by 100 top institutions would work only in terms of outreach at best. But what our education sector really needs is standardisation, quality and dynamic evolution of teaching systems. Some reports say that 63 per cent of school students will be unemployable when the fourth industrial revolution takes place and our universities, except IITs, do not even make it to the global top 100 list. Without a result-oriented revamp, the social sector allocations end up being plain vacuous.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/social-message-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/social-message.html

13,03-2-20,Randhawa stressed on mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation,"Punjab Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Sunday maintained that mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation, specifically in planting and harvesting, is need of the hour in view of the labour problem as well as to get higher yield

Randhawa, after inaugurating the exhibition regarding latest techniques in sugarcane cultivation and modernisation of sugar mills at Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI), Pune, in the presence of former Union Minister and VSI president Sharad Pawar, said that there was a dire need to make efforts to increase per acre yield of sugarcane to augment the income of farmers and all concerned States should make joint efforts for the same.

At the same time, Randhawa sought special assistance from the Government of India for modernization of sugar industry so as to turn these into sugar complexes producing various byproducts like Ethanol, Bio CNG, Cogeneration of Power and Bio Fertilizers etc. “This will not only help sugar mills to become viable from financial point of view but also save the colossal amount of money being spent on import of crude oil in the country,” he added.

The exhibition regarding latest technological developments in sugarcane cultivation and modernization of sugar industry was held on the sidelines of the three-day second International Conference held at VSI Pune.

Randhawa appreciated efforts being made by Pawar for raising the economic standard of the sugarcane farmers.

He expressed his desire that Punjab and Maharashtra should jointly make efforts for welfare of sugarcane growers and approach Central Government to provide special incentives for sugarcane farmers to adopt drip irrigation, mechanization in planting and harvesting of sugarcane which will not only help in the conservation of water but would also come in handy for the farmers to overcome labour shortage.

Sharad Pawar, thanking Randhawa for attending the conference, also appreciated the concerns shown by him for welfare of sugarcane farmers of Punjab and development of cooperative sugar mills in the State.

Pawar further assured that besides full assistance from VSI, Pune, he will be ready personally also for any assistance required for welfare of sugarcane growers of Punjab.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/randhawa-stressed-on-mechanisation-in-sugarcane-cultivation.html

The Sammilani opposed this at a meeting held here under the chairmanship of its president Basant Kumar Tripathy in the presence of general secretary Dr Radhananth Praharaj.

“If English-medium schools are opened and Spoken English introduced, it will be taken that the Government’s move will weaken glorious Odia language and culture,” the Sammilani said.

The Sammilani suggested that the Government introduce a unique syllabus in all schools, including Government-aided and recognised schools, till the secondary level and teach students in English in all English-medium schools with Odia as a compulsory subject. Besides, the Government should appoint more teachers to enhance English knowledge of students in schools.

“The Government should give up the idea of introducing Spoken English and, instead, ensure that children read “Aa Jahna Mamu Sharad Shashi” and “Dhore Baya Do” songs as “Nana Baya Geeta”.

Singh had received many awards for his immense contribution to Odia literature. He had penned finest literary works through which he had voiced against old values and degrading morality in the society.

‘Patha Prantara Kabita’, ‘Charama Patra’, ‘Lal Pagoda ra Preta O Anya Kabita’, ‘Bhrukuti’, ‘Bidirna’, ‘Padatika’, ‘Apritikara Kabita’, ‘Bishabani’, ‘Durgama Giri’, ‘Jhada’, ‘Sarbahara’ and ‘Banya’ were among the collections of his poetry.

He was conferred with the Atibadi Jagannath Das Samman for the year 2017. Earlier, he had also received the Odisha Sahitya Akademi Award in 1961.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik declared state funeral for Singh for his remarkable contribution to the freedom movement and Odia literature.

Expressing deep grief over Singh’s death and conveying his deep sympathy to the bereaved family, Patnaik described him as a very talented poet, prolific writer and a true patriot.

The Chief Minister said Singh’s death has created a great void in modern Odia literature. His poems were remarkable in carrying the values of socialism, human rights and equality of classes, he added.

Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan too mourned Singh’s death and said this has created an irreparable loss to Odia literature.

“Investor confidence is important for fresh investments to come in, to spur growth which is the biggest challenge now. This will have a huge impact on job creation and livelihood options for youth,” observed Patnaik.

Since the State Government wants to create jobs for its youths in industries, the Union budget may not help Odisha to attract more investment.

Five people are currently under the scanner in the State as they recently returned from China, the epicentre of the virus. While one person has been admitted at the SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack, four others have been advised home isolation. Officials are keeping a watch on the health conditions of the four people in home isolation.

Health department officials said the State is vulnerable to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) through two routes. The State has direct air connectivity with Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur while the other route is the Paradip Port.

Keeping in view the large number of ships coming to Paradip, the port authorities apprehend that crew members of the ships from China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore may have been exposed to nCoV. “Therefore, the crew members have been told to stay on the ships,” a senior port official said, adding that there is no restriction on loading and unloading of ships coming from China and the other three countries.

The official clarified that there is no restriction on crew members of ships from other countries as they can freely come down to the port township. “We have made elaborate screening of crew members from other countries at gate Number 4 itself. Persons showing signs of cold, cough or running nose are put to screening,” said Port Trust Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr Prahallad Panda.

He said a special isolation ward has been set up at the hospital to provide immediate treatment if required. “There has been no such suspected case of nCoV so far,” he added.

Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy took stock of the situation on Saturday and alerted all Chief District Medical Officers and asked them to submit daily reports on the situation at the ground.

Notably, the State Government has constituted a taskforce headed by the Special Secretary (Public Health) to handle the situation.

26,03-2-20,Capt hits out at Sukhbir for lauding Union Budget,"Ridiculing SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s remarks welcoming the Union Budget 2020-21 as pro-farmer and pro-poor, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday termed it a case of brazen sycophancy with nothing to substantiate Akali leader’s tall claims.

The Chief Minister wondered what Sukhbir had found to be positive for the farmers in the Budget, which even agriculture experts and farmer bodies had rejected as totally bereft of any initiative to save the agrarian sector.

“While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is blinded by power and could not see the problems faced by the farmers, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president is apparently so blinded by his sycophant love for the ruling party that he could see nothing wrong in their actions,” said Capt Amarinder.

Despite having three ministers in the Union Cabinet from the State, the BJP-Akali combine have failed to secure a debt relief scheme for the farmers, who continue to reel under massive debt burdens, not just in Punjab but across the country, he remarked.

Questioning Sukhbir’s reaction hailing the Rs 15 lakh crore budgetary allocation for the agriculture sector, Capt Amarinder asked how the Akali leader thought the mere 10 percent increase over last year for agriculture and allied sectors to be sufficient to tackle the grave crisis faced by the debt-ridden farmers.

“With this measly allocation, which comes nowhere near meeting the needs of the farmers, how does Sukhbir hope to see the farmers’ income getting doubled in the next two years,” he asked, adding that without farmer uplift, there was no possibility of rural consumption going up, which would naturally scuttle economic growth even further.

Sukhbir’s refusal to acknowledge and admit that there is a serious crisis prevailing in the agriculture sector is symptomatic of the Akalis’ totally non-alienation from the grassroots, which, along with their greed, was the root cause of their political demise in Punjab, the Chief Minister said, asking, “How else can one explain Sukhbir’s complete failure to accept that his own state’s farmers are crying for help, which only the Central Government can provide?”

Capt Amarinder said that while his government was doing its best in Punjab, a holistic national policy, encompassing debt waiver, MSP for all crops and diversification etc was the only long-term solution to the problem.

Nothing has, unfortunately, been proposed in the Budget to encourage crop diversification, despite the fact that buffer stocks of food grains are already putting the states and farmers under extreme stress, he pointed out.

Further, said the Chief Minister, there was nothing in the budget to ensure the procurement of alternative MSP crops, which was critical to promoting diversification and breaking the vicious wheat-paddy cycle that alone could alleviate the farmers’ woes and boost their income.

Even the landless farmers had been completely ignored in the budget, that offers nothing to rectify the hugely flawed crop insurance scheme, which Punjab did not find workable or beneficial, pointed out the Chief Minister.

What is more, under the garb of changes in the incentive scheme for chemical fertiliser, the Government of India seemed to be getting ready to introduce DBT for urea, which Punjab had already opposed as it will put the farmers under the burden of unnecessary paper work for the use of 25 lakh tonnes of urea annually.

It will also add the financial stress of meeting and servicing requirements of more cash credit for fertilizer to pay producing companies upfront, he added.

Pointing to the exclusion of the water-stressed areas identified by the central government for its water conservation schemes, Capt Amarinder said that it was time for Sukhbir and his colleagues to open their eyes to these problems, and to stop sacrificing Punjab and its people to their own political interests.

As for what the budget offers for the poor, the least said the better, said the Chief Minister, adding that the Centre had failed to come out with any meaningful schemes for the marginalised and financially weaker sections of the society.

From education to health, there has been no significant increase in budgetary allocation, nor are there any far-sighted plans for the betterment of the people, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-hits-out-at-sukhbir-for-lauding-union-budget.html

28,03-2-20,Hry: 17 accused convicted for rape and sexual offence in Jan,"The impact of effective ‘parivi’ being conducted by Haryana Police for ensuring speedy justice to rape victims is yielding positive results as the conviction rate in the rape and sexual offences continues witnessing an upward trend in the State, said Director General of Police (DGP) Manoj Yadava.

Giving details, the DGP said that in the month of January 2020, Police had secured conviction of 17 offenders booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC). Of these, one convict was awarded capital punishment, one sentenced life imprisonment, six awarded 20 years imprisonment, six got 10 years imprisonment, one sentenced 7 years jail and one each offender was awarded 4 years and 2 years imprisonment, he said.

The DGP said that Police has not only arresting rape accused within the earliest possible time after the report of such heinous crime, but also securing conviction of such offenders through concerted efforts, efficient investigations and presentation of evidences before the concerned courts. Our all out efforts resulted in corresponding improvement from prosecution to early convictions of sex offenders, he added.

Yadava further said that State government put in place a slew of measures to improve security for women and girls to prevent such heinous crime. As a result of these, the number of rapes and other sexual offences reported to the police has also been increasing, which shows that victims feel more confident in coming forward to report the crime in police

stations.

At the same time, both the Centre and State Governments had also enacted laws that provided for tough punishment. In addition, setting up more fast-track courts also helpful to speed up the delivery of justice to the victims, he added.

30,03-2-20,Budget again exposes anti-Punjab face of Modi Govt: Jakhar,"A day after the presentation of the Union Budget 2020, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar on Sunday said that the anti-Punjab face of the Narendra Modi Government was exposed “once again”.

“Union Cabinet has got three Ministers from Punjab but they failed in getting any major allocation earmarked for the State that faced fiscal debts due to 10-year-long SAD-BJP misrule,” said Jakhar while asking if they were in New Delhi only to protect their own berths in the Cabinet.

Jakhar said that the Central Government had ignored the State Government’s request to make provision for funds to celebrate Guru Teg Bahadur’s 400-year Gurpurb. Earlier, the Centre did not help Punjab in celebrating Guru Nanak Dev’s 550th birth anniversary,” he said.

The budget presented in the Parliament by the Modi Government missed plans to improve the condition of farmers, labourer and other weaker sections, no attempt has been made to bailout economic slowdown, he said.

Jakhar said that the country was reeling under severe economic crisis at present but there was no policy or intention to address these issues in the Budget. “Rural India has been left unattended. Only flimsy talks were offered for the farmers, they have nothing to cheer about,” he added.

He said that the Modi Government was showering concessions only on the big entrepreneurs which will neither increase production, nor reduce unemployment or recession.

Criticising the plan to sell Government stake in a profit-driven institution like LIC, Jakhar said that the BJP was running the government by selling assets. The Government should give a modest waiver in direct taxes, closing the other exemptions will bring the situation back to the same stage, he said.

Jakhar further said that the Union Government has made the Direct Tax regime as difficult to understand as it made earlier GST regime, and the taxpayers were unable to understand the new tax regime.

“Once again, the Union Finance Minister has promised to double farmers’ income in the next two years, but nothing was actually done for the farmers. While talking about the solar pump scheme announced in the budget speech, Punjab was one way out of this scheme by adding condition of barren land with solar pump scheme,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/budget-again-exposes--anti-punjab-face-of-modi-govt--jakhar.html

34,03-2-20,"IT, social media now game changer in Indian politics","Over the years, technological advancements have redefined many aspects of our society, including politics. Smart phones, tablets, and computers equipped with new technologies are used by politicians and parties to communicate with the masses and influence them more effectively. Social media has a great role to play in this context, which is only a portion of what IT in broad sense is.

Earlier the political parties and politicians relied on speeches, print and electronic media, radio, etc to pass on their message to people. Because, these mediums helped them reach larger audiences, provide information when it is most needed, easy way to shape up the PR of a party and politician.

With the advent of technology and smart phones, the social media has evolved rapidly and information is readily available than before and very fast. This means any new details, strategies, and objectives will reach the masses almost immediately, so posting the newest information online to keep voters updated is crucial to the success of any politician and/or party. Apart from this rapid information flow, politicians can now use media-rich content, like videos, podcasts, and interactive contents on their web pages, allowing them to boost engagement and have more reach than traditional static content.

The biggest challenge a politician ever has is reaching out to target audience and send their message across to them. Keeping one’s supporters engaged with interesting content and winning new followers is pertinent. One solution is Web Tracking Technology, by which the political parties are targeting the potential voters on the borderline. Apart from personalized email communications, web content & targeted paid ads, the political parties are resorting to building and delivering different digital marketing campaigns with customized information send to supporters and undecided voters that suits them in order to convert them to followers.

The biggest success of a political party is to have a good campaign and have better social influence and how the political leaders interact with general public. IT and social media has made it possible now with politicians reaching out to masses through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

In India, this revolution started well before the 2014 general elections and which has seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rise to power. There was a general notion that Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister in the first term majorly due to social media. But, in 2019, it was something more.

With 900 million people casting their votes for 543 Lok Sabha seats over a period of one and a half months is definitely a big celebration and termed as the festival of democracy around the world.

Unlike 2014, this time the challenge was manifold for Modiji & BJP. By now, all major political parties had access to IT and social media. Everyone has their own large pool of teams to reach out to people with content. Indian voters are always inconsistent, spatial and of varied social divides. Reaching out to them needs the deployment of newer technology in the campaigns. From 250million social media users in 2014 the rise was almost 108 percent with around 520 million in 2019.

In 2017, PM Modi had said that 2019 elections will be fought on smart phones. Well he obviously meant it when the results came.

“My First Vote For Modi” “Swachh Bharat” “Main Bhi Chowkidar” and “Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai” turned out to be the game changers

As per AdLift, with more than 142million combined followers of BJP’s various social media platforms in comparison to 23million of Congress, the upper hand was with thr BJP.

Just a couple of days before the general elections 2019, an YouTube video hit the social media platforms with youngsters dancing to the tunes of the video as to why they will vote for Modi being a first time voter. The video talked about development, Ujjwala, Digital India and Skill India. This was an instant hit and went viral.

“Swachh Bharat” introduced by the Modi Government has taken up the internet and social media by storm and became a mass movement to engage millions of people and brought the sense of cleanliness by relating to their daily chores. “Main Bhi Chowkidar” was another super hit that brewed a sense of nationalism along with safety and security among the masses.

Wonderful personalised content like short videos, GIFs, Memes, Infographics, Ring Tones, etc. made on various leading Indian languages spread across social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and most importantly WhatsApp groups (BJP has a wider share of such groups and users) to reach out to public. And, the people loved them, shared them and swayed with them.

Another social media game changer was the mobile app called “NaMo App” which connected the user directly with Modiji, what with the various volunteers and social media evangelists who run their own campaigns in favour of BJP and Modi. Most social benefit schemes were launched by Modiji through social media and a lot of hashtag movements were ran in Twitter by the IT Cell of BJP that were trending well.

While Akshay Kumar interview video made Modi acceptable and related to common man, his fitness video did the trick of his physical and mental strength to lead India. Also, “Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai” “Soch Badlo Tabhito Badlega India” and “How’s the JOSH”, to name a few, are some of the social media slogans that not only changed the mindset of people but also converted many millions as followers of Brand Modi.

It’s not that other political parties didn’t use the IT and social media. One can see the campaigns of Congress like ‘Acche din aaye nahi, par apna time aayega. Register nahi kiya, toh vote ka chance jayega’, while a Valentine’s Day message to Modi read, ‘Are you Anil Ambani? Cos I want to be your chowkidaar’ that has wooed public to great extent. Even Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Samajwadi, BSS, CPI had their own share too in social media.

There is lot of hue and cry over data theft through WhatsApp while allegations are that some social media channels customizing their applications suiting to particular group and so on.

Day to day, technology is evolving and with it social media platforms are evolving. Artificial Intelligence has already forayed into social media. OTT (Over The Top technology) is revolutionising SmartTV and phones. No one knows what will be the next, but it’s for sure IT and social media are going to outsmart traditional media communication tools in near future.

35,03-2-20,Discipline of the Intelligence,"Buddhi, the intelligence, is not only a process of thinking but also the rationale behind that thinking. It is the seat of understanding and wisdom.

‘The senses are said to be great, but mind is greater than the senses ; and intelligence is greater than the mind. And that which is greater than even the intelligence, is the self’ (Shloka 3.42).

The buddhi, thus, works as a bridge between the senses and the mind on one hand ; and the soul on the other. When, instead of being guided by the buddhi, the mind becomes a slave of the senses ; one is driven by the desire for the objects of those senses. His actions are determined by such desires. Hence, he is subjected to the bondage of works.

In shlokas from 2.39 to 2.53, Krishna explains as to how, through buddhi yoga, one can free himself from this bondage.

Buddhi is not merely the power to frame and retain concepts ; but it has also the function of recognising, comprehending, reasoning, judging ; and discriminating.

When illumined by consciousness of the self, buddhi is cleared of the ignorance. The wisdom so revealed enables one to discriminate between good and evil, between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood ; and between the self and the non-self.

Whereas the one whose intelligence is disciplined, has a firm determination and a clear aim ; the thoughts of others are scattered and endless. Singlemindedness is a great asset for the achievement of one’s goal.

The work done only for the fruits is far inferior to the work done under the discipline of intelligence. The one who is established in his intelligence casts away, in this very life, both good and evil. Since he has overcome selfishness, he is not attracted towards evil. He rises to an ethical status which transcends both good and evil.

It is important not only as to what one does, but also as to how one does. The spirit behind one’s actions is equally important.

The wise who have united their intelligence with the Divine, free themselves from the bondage of repeated births by renouncing the fruits of their actions. In this manner, they attain that blissful state which is beyond any sorrow. When one’s intelligence crosses the muddy waters of delusion, he becomes indifferent to enjoyments in this life or the next.

Those with superfluous knowledge get unduly influenced by the flowery words of the religious texts. Immersed in material desires, such people aim only at the heaven and good life in the next birth. They always remain bound by rituals. Intelligence of such people is not well-established in the self. They do not focus their mind on the God.

By the practice of buddhi Yoga, one understands that for the one whose intelligence has been illumined by consciousness, ritual observances are not very important. Instead of being led by the letter, he follows the spirit of the scriptures. He renounces all selfish desire and lives life like a sacrifice, offered with true devotion.

He undertakes any work with the understanding that he has right only to action, and never at all to its fruits. Therefore, he performs his prescribed duty without any attachment to the results of his actions. For the one who is so established in buddhi yoga, impending results of the past actions are neutralised and one is freed from the compulsion of future actions and their binding results. Intelligence of such a doer of work gets purified and remains established in the self. He then attains the divine consciousness. Even while remaining ever engaged in the performance of his assigned work, his mind always rests in the Supreme.

Buddhi yoga is the foundation for attaining perfection in all other paths of self-realisation ; because it is not possible to achieve success in any sphere of life, without proper self control and adequate discipline of mind. Krishna has assured that no effort is ever lost on this path of self-improvement. No obstacle on it lasts for long. Even a small move on it saves one from great dangers. In other words, even if one practices yoga only for some time and later abandons it for whatever reason, he still reaps its benefits. Moreover, no negative impact ever accrues from the practice of such yoga.

Krishna has advised that one should be free from all dualities like pleasure and pain, be firmly fixed in purity ; and be free from anxieties of gain and safety. In this manner, he can rise above the three modes of material nature ; and thus be established in the self.

To conclude, when one spontaneously follows the discipline of buddhi yoga, his intelligence gets more and more illumined and touches higher and higher levels of consciousness. As a result, bonds of the egoistic desire are broken. One realises the self, which is his true nature. The false ego dissolves and the sense of separateness vanishes. A vision of harmony is created in which one sees One in all and all in the One.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/buddhi-yoga---discipline-of-the-intelligence.html
36,03-2-20,Capt orders probe into jailbreak by 3 inmates,"Three undertrial prisoners escaped from the high-security Amritsar Central Jail by scaling the boundary walls, prompting Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to order a review and revamp of prison security across the State.

The three — one accused of rape and the other two (both brothers) of theft and dacoity — escaped on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday by making a hole in the wall of their barrack by removing about 10 bricks, the officials said.

They then appear to have scaled the inner wall — which is about 16-feet high — by standing one atop the other. While the outer wall — approximately 21-feet — was crossed by them using a hook made of a steel bar and the cover of a quilt to make a ladder.

“They escaped the jail complex from a point near Tower no. 10, which was not under CCTV cover,” said the state Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta.

The DGP said that there was no evidence of any outside help, according to preliminary investigations, which suggests that the trio, among 61 prisoners in barrack no. 7, Ahata no. 2, had planned their escape on their own.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder ordered a magisterial inquiry which will be led by Jalandhar Commissioner. The Chief Minster has also directed the Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to immediately suspend, pending inquiry, all those responsible for prison

security.

The Chief Minister also asked the ADGP Jails to review and further strengthen prison security not just in this jail but in jails across the State.

A State-wide hunt has been launched for the trio, said the officials.

The jail authorities came to know about the incident at 3.20 am, almost two hours after the prisoners broke their barrack and escaped by scaling the inner and outer walls of the jail, as per the CCTV footage from the prison, the officials

said.

The prison guards were alerted about the escape by other inmates, who included a brother of one of the escaped prisoners, according to initial information.

One of the escaped prisoners has been identified as Vishal, aged about 22 years of Ara Colony, Majitha Road, Amritsar. He is accused in a rape case registered last year.

“He was lodged in the jail on April 5, 2019. The other two are brothers, identified as Gurpreet, aged 34, and Jarnail, aged 25, residents of Chandigarh road, Khadoor Sahib, Tarn Taran,” said the DGP.

He said that the two brothers were accused of theft and dacoity and were brought to the prison in July last year.

Vishal’s brother Gaurav, also in the same barrack, chose not to flee with them, said the DGP.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-orders-probe-into-jailbreak-by-3-inmates.html
37,03-2-20,"Baleswar villagers stage protest, cry for relief","As a herd of jumbos continued wrecking havoc in the Raibania area, villagers have been staging a dharna since Saturday near an electrical structure at Shyamnagar seeking relief from the menace.

The agitating villagers led by local elected representatives alleged that they were facing a huge loss due to their standing crops being damaged by pachyderms and woes of prolonged power cut resorted by Nesco due to presence of elephants in their area.

As many as 14 gram panchayats including Shymnagar, Kalika, Khuada, Kalama and Sardarbandh of Raibania area of Jaleswar block were experiencing load shedding for days as the herd of elephants having 13 members including a tusker was moving in patches after it snaked into the pockets in search of food and fodder.

The agitators alleged that although they were assured by the Nesco officials that power supply would not be affected in the patches where there were no pachyderms, yet it was not done.

However, when asked, Executive Engineer, Jaleswar, Harish Chandra Panda said that the power, henceforth, would be cut only in the affected pockets.

Sources said that the herd entered in the Raibania area after straying from Rangamatia. They were roaming in Shyamnagar by resting in the forest of Bagabuda. During their stay, they had pulled down at least four dwelling houses, besides damaging agriculture fields and devouring stored grains and vegetables grown in the field.

In the meantime, Jaleswar MLA Aswini Patra urged the district administration to evacuate the residents from the genuinely affected patches and lodge them in safer places.

“The Amritsar jail break has come in the wake of various other incidents taking place in Punjab jails which has shaken the confidence of the people in the government,” said the SAD leader and the former minister Daljit Singh Cheema.

Cheema said that besides ordering an independent probe into the incident, the Government should also tell what action it had taken in other such cases and why the jail administration had collapsed.

Asking the Chief Minister to fix accountability at the very top, Cheema said that the Jails Minister should be asked to resign immediately till the pendency of the probe.

“Prison security is the primary responsibility of the Jails Minister. He cannot shirk away from this responsibility especially since his role is already under a cloud,” he said.

Rejecting the magisterial inquiry ordered by the Chief Minister into the incident, Cheema said that a magistrate could not do justice in the case.

“The magistrate will not be able to probe the role of the Jails Minister in weakening prison security. Since this incident has exposed prison security and comes in the wake of the earlier incident of mass uprising in the Ludhiana central jail besides several incidents of use of mobile phones in prisons, it is necessary to hold an independent inquiry into the functioning of Punjab jail administration,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-asks-cm-to-dismiss-jails-minster-randhawa-immediately.html

40,03-2-20,"‘Unemployment major challenge, Govt taking steps’","Second -time MLA from Nalwa, Ranbir Gangwa who is a Deputy Speaker of Haryana Vidhan Sabha, termed unemployment in the State as a major challenge, but said his government is taking steps to overcome the problem.

He says that the ground water in most of the areas in Nalwa constituency is salty. People are facing here problems of drinking water as well as irrigation water. The State government is working on effectively to provide drinking water to the people and irrigation water to farmers in Nalwa Constituency.

The 56- year- old Gangwa who was elected for Rajya Sabha on Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) ticket from 2010 to 2014 joined the BJP in March, shortly before the Lok Sabha election-2019. He has been representing the Nalwa Chaudhry seat which is a part of Hisar Lok Sabha constituency since 2014 and defeated Randhir Panihar of Congress in 2019 Assembly election.

In an interview with The Pioneer, Gangwa reveals his political journey and priorities as an MLA and Deputy Speaker. Excerpts from the interview:

How did you feel when you were elected as Deputy Speaker unanimously?

I feel proud that the House entrusted me with the responsibility. For this, I thank Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and party high command and the voters of my Nalwa constituency.

How did you come in politics?

I was not having any political background when I joined politics. I left my graduation due to financial constraints and got involved in farming activities. I had never thought of joining politics during my college life. Along with agriculture, I was involved in social activities in my village having population of around 8,000. There was an election of district panchayat member. No one had filed nomination from my village. As I was involved in social activities so my friends and villagers asked me to contest. Without joining any party, I contested election and won the election of district panchayat member as an independent candidate. Later I joined INLD in 2000.

How has your political journey been so far?

I was a great admirer of former Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhari Devi Lal and followed him since College time. After winning election of district panchayat member as an independent candidate, I was offered to join the party by the leaders of different political parties. But I chose to join INLD. Later, I was made backward class INLD district president. I contested Assembly election on INLD ticket in 2009 but lost. In June 2010, I was made Rajya Sabha member from INLD. Being a Rajya Sabha member, I contested election on INLD ticket in 2014 and won the election by defeating Chandra Mohan of Haryana Janhit Party. In 2019, I contested election on BJP ticket and won the election and I am now serving the people as Deputy Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha in the State.

INLD had sent you in the Rajya Sabha after you lost the Assembly election in 2009. Why did you quit INLD? Do you think you betrayed the party (INLD) by joining BJP?

Being a true solider of the party (INLD), I tried a lot to unite the Chautala family but failed to do so. I met closed family members and party office bearers on several occasions to resolve the differences in the family and the party. Under such circumstances, I had no option but to take a big decision. I met people from my constituency, friends and relatives and with their decision, I joined BJP.

Congress MLAs say they are facing difficulties to address people’s concern. For the development of the Constituency, there is no provision of MLA local area development fund for MLAs in Haryana. You may be facing same problem. What do you say?

On developmental front, there is no shortage of funds in the State. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar recently asked all the MLAs to send a list of proposed development works in their Assembly constituencies through Deputy Commissioner (DCs). As per the state government’s decision, development works worth Rs 5 crore are to be carried out in each constituency as per MLAs’ proposal in the financial year.

What are the issues in your Constituency? How will you address?

Farmers in my constituency face shortage of irrigation water. We have met the chief minister and raised this issue. To complete the work related to roads, school buildings, community centres among others, there is no shortage of funds in the State for the development of the constituency. I will soon send developmental projects of the Constituency at CMO for its completion.

You were earlier in INLD and now in BJP. Opposition says BJP and JJP fought election against each other and now they have formed the coalition government. Do you think this government will complete its five year tenure?

BJP-JJP coalition government is stable and will complete its five year term. This government is working to eliminate corruption. Competitive examinations are being conducted locally and free and fair in the State. Transparency is being maintained in government jobs and people have liked it. There is no threat to this coalition and will complete its five year term.

Being a deputy Speaker, what are your priorities?

It is honour for me to become deputy speaker of the Assembly. I will keep interest of all legislators irrespective of parties they belong to. I will not make any discrimination for any MLAs to give chance to speak or raise the issue. I only appeal to legislators to raise issue based discussion as well as people’s pertinent issues at the forum of Vidhan Sabha.

What are the issues people raise before you as an MLA?

It is public perception that welfare schemes are being launched by the governments but not being executed effectively. People are also raising the same issue. All government benefits must reach the last person in the queue and I will continue to work in this direction.

You must have made promises during Assembly elections for your constituency. What are priorities for your constituency?

The officers have been directed to speed up the completion of the ongoing development works for the betterment of the people. Instructions have also been given to the officers to ensure that all the public related complaints are taken seriously heard apart from taking necessary actions. There has been shortage of teachers and doctors in my constituency. We would like to provide adequate teachers in government schools and doctors in primary health centres and other hospitals.

Unemployment is a big issue. What are steps your government being taken to create employment?

It is true that youth are struggling to get jobs. People of my constituency are asking for jobs. Unemployment is a major challenge. But the government is taking many steps to tide over the challenge. The private sector is being encouraged to invest in the state and entrepreneurship is being promoted among the youth to generate more job avenues. Moreover, vacant posts in the government departments are being filled transparently with new appointments. To ensure ‘equal distribution' of government jobs, this government is giving 5 per cent extra marks to candidates if no member of their family is in a government job. Priority is being given to those areas which increase employment avenues.

Many areas of the State especially sharing boundary with Rajasthan are facing with shortage of water for drinking purpose and for irrigation. What do you have planned for this?

Many areas of my constituency share boundary with Rajasthan. People here get salty ground water. In the constituency people are also facing problems of drinking water and irrigation water. I would like to work on providing drinking water and irrigation water to farmers adequately. For this I met the Chief Minister and this issue will be addressed on priority basis.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---unemployment-major-challenge--govt-taking-steps---.html

46,03-2-20,Termination Govt ploy to break down ongoing protest: Workers,"The services of more than 200 protesting Anganwadi workers have been terminated. The Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) Anju Badola said that due procedure was followed and notices were served to the protesting Anganwadi workers before their services were terminated.

However, the State Anganwadi workers association president Rekha Negi alleged that this is a ploy of the government to break down the protest of Anganwadi workers which has been going on for about two months now.

According to Negi, “What is the sense behind terminating the services of only a few Anganwadi workers when around 500 workers are protesting in each block? If they want to terminate the service of protesting Anganwadi workers then they should terminate all from service at once. This step is politically driven to suppress us and our protest.”

However, the CDPO justified the step taken by the department. According to her, “We issued notices to them thrice and also called the president of Anganwadi workers association to return to their job as I myself have received multiple letters from the department but the protesting Anganwadi workers refused to return to their work. So we served the notice of terminating the service of 242 Anganwadi workers in Kalsi. Initially, I had the total number at 275 Anganwadi workers but few of them returned to their work so only the remaining workers were served the termination notice.”

Negi further averred that MLA Harbans Kapoor had earlier told them that no termination notice would be issued to Anganwadi workers till February 4 as the chief minister will then meet them. Reacting to the allegations, Badola said, “I don’t have any information regarding this; we took action on the basis of the letter we received from the department and directorate.”

About the process of terminating the service of Anganwadi workers, Badola said that Anganwadi workers are muster roll employees and their services can be terminated after issuing three notices.

“Besides the Anganwadi centres are also not running for more than one month when the High Court has clear guidelines that we have to provide supplementary nutrition to children, pregnant women and lactating mothers for 300 days. However, no such procedure including distribution of Take Home Ration (THR) is followed by Anganwadi workers which is the violation of High Court guidelines. Therefore after they refused to come back to their work, we served them termination notice around 5.30 pm on Saturday. There are chances that many Anganwadi workers will return to the job after the served notice. We are already getting many calls from Anganwadi workers who want to come back but the actual numbers will be known only on Monday,” added Badola.

Meanwhile, concerning the initiation of communication with Chief Minister Negi said, “We were given the date of February 4 and if no initiation will be made by the Government on that day, then wait and watch for the kind of protest we can do. They lied to us to save their vote banks in Delhi election but if this Government will keep doing injustice with us, our Anganwadi association will be opposing them in each and every election while supporting the Opposition party.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/termination-govt-ploy-to-break-down-ongoing-protest--workers.html

49,03-2-20,Himachal's Pong sees 68% rise in bar-headed goose population,"Flying thousands of miles from their native habitat in high-altitude lakes in Central Asia to avoid the extreme winter, the bar-headed geese, an endangered migratory bird species, regularly descend wetlands across India.

The Pong Dam wetlands, one of the largest man-made wetlands in northern India, are one their preferred wintering grounds.

This time their number in the Pong wetlands has spiked by 68 per cent compared to previous year, state Chief Wildlife Warden Savita told IANS on Sunday.

At the annual two-day waterfowl estimation coordinated by the state wildlife wing along with specialised institutions from January 31 in the Pong Dam wetlands, spread over 307 sq km, a 49,496 bar-headed geese were recorded.

She said the bar-headed geese were the largest influx of any winter migrant in the Pong wetlands, some 250 km from state capital Shimla.

In 2015, a staggering 71,800 bar-headed geese were recorded by the wildlife wing, a new mark till date.

Over 1,15,701 birds of 114 species have been spotted in the Pong wetlands, among them are the bar headed goose, the northern pintail (12,881), the Eurasian coot (10,860), the common teal (7,334), the common pochard (3,988), the northern shoveler (2818), the great cormorant (2,121), the Eurasian wigeon (1,350) and the ruddy shelduck (1,028).

Wildlife officials said the influx of the bar-headed geese, known for two distinctive black bars across their neck, could be spotted in the Pong dam's Nagrota Suriyan and Rancer Island areas.

The gregarious goose, which start arriving in October and stay till March-end, feeds at night in grasslands on riverbanks and breeds in high-altitude lakes in Central Asia, was also in Tibet and Ladakh.

Listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the global population of the bar-headed geese is believed to be around 130,000, wildlife experts told IANS.

According to the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the Pong wetlands are the one wintering grounds in the globe to hold such a large congregation of bar-headed geese.

Most of the wetlands in India have been regularly getting bar-headed geese every winter. But Pong is the only habitat that holds the largest influx of bar-headed geese every winter, a BNHS ornithologist said.

Even their breeding grounds spread over Tibetan plateau do not support such a large number of the geese at one point in time.

Barring 2001, when only 5,500 birds were spotted, numbers have ranged between 28,000 and 23,000 in the past few years.

The other bird species recorded in the Pong during the waterfowl estimation were the common shelduck (75), the northern lapwing (32), the common ringed plover (20), the pied avocet (nine), the osprey (five), the black-bellied tern (five), the common merganser (four), the Sarus crane (two), the Eurasian curlew (two) and one bird each of the white-tailed lapwing, the water pipit, the lesser white-fronted goose and the buff-bellied pipit.

A few noticeable species are the great crested grebe, the red crested pochard, the ferruginous pochard, the mallard, the tufted duck, the Eurasian spoonbill, the curlew sandpiper and many other species of larks & Pipits.

The total population of birds as well as species of birds have shown an increase over last year.

The population has shown marginal increase from 1,15,229 to 1,15,701 where as species have increased from 103 to 114.

The number of migratory water dependent species as well as resident water dependent species have also show an increase over the last year from 58 to 60 species and 29 to 30 species respectively, said the wildlife wing.

The 307-square km Pong wetlands are also home to many native birds like the red jungle fowl, large Indian parakeet, Indian cuckoo, bank mynah, wood shrike, yellow-eyed babbler, black ibis, paradise flycatcher, crested lark and the crested bunting.

A total of 425 species of birds, both migratory and local, 18 of snake, 90 butterfly, 24 mammal and 27 of fish have been recorded so far in Pong.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/himachal-s-pong-sees-68--rise-in-bar-headed-goose-population.html

53,03-2-20,Plastic Use and Public Health Menace,"Chemicals like BPA which breakdown from plastics upon being heated up or frozen have the potential to imitate effect of oestrogen hormone in the body. These are therefore called as endocrine disrupters. From health concerns like diabetes, thyroid malfunction to infertility in young population, such chemicals are responsible for creating a health havoc. Polystyrene which is used in making cutlery and foam packaging of many eatables, is also a well known neurotoxin. Most plastic cups and glasses also contain the notorious chemical called styrene. This is a dangerous carcinogen which has been linked to gastrointestinal traumas and cancers

It is a moot question that whether more lives in India are lost annually due to lack of access to basic health care facilities or due to the compromised standards of the medical care which is available. Specifically in the rural regions and the suburbia, many people still resort to informal medical care providers for motley health conditions. It is ironical that while sophistication in specialised medicine attracts thousands of foreign patients to India each year, there are major gaps in the medical facilities available for financially stronger and the poor.

Despite expansion in the ambit of health care system provided by the government, public investments in preventive health facilities such as sanitation and waste management are still insufficient. It is a matter of regret that the non-communicable diseases have now become a leading cause of terminal illness as well as deaths in the country contributing to roughly 55 per cent of the total mortality instances.

More than internationalisation of infections and disorders it is usually individual behaviour, environmental factors, social factors and lack of information which culminates in illnesses. The most critical avenue for investing in health by the Government therefore becomes disease prevention and health awareness.

Across the developing economies it is usually the food and water borne illnesses which end up becoming epidemics. However even these have been traditionally linked to ingestion of parasite infested foods and fluids. It was only two to three years back that an unparalleled and unique physical contamination of water was discovered globally. This ironically was only a testimony to the already existing speculations throughout the world. Scientists discovered billions of people globally were directly consuming or using tap water contaminated with micro plastics.

Another surprising element of the study was the finding that few US cities had the maximum concentration of plastic fibres tricking down through taps. The data on plastic pollution has been taking the world by a storm for more than a decade now. However this far the research being conducted and the data being generated was focusing on sea and river water resources. It was also believed that its impact on human health was largely through sea food consumption. The realisation that people are drinking micro plastic infested water opened a new Pandora’s box demanding urgent intervention.

Questions like in what ways has plastic found inroads into our water cycle and food chain are extremely complex and require a thorough intervention of a global nature. However have we learnt any lessons? Have we made a committed endeavour to effectively dispose off all plastics at our disposal? The answer is dismaying obviously.

Like many European, African and some Asian nations, the Indian Government has time and again reiterated its commitment to completely phase out single use plastics from public use. This was promised in 2019 as an initial ban on six Single Use Plastics (SUPs) utilities to prepare groundwork towards a total plastic ban from 2022 onwards.

However to much dismay of environmentalists and conscious citizens alike, the ban was later deferred citing its negative impact on business in an already recessing economy. The only promise which came alongside was that the government would continue its efforts to curb plastic use. More than withholding of the ban what has really been detrimental to us is the lack of sensitisation among people even now. This lack of awareness and initiative among people emanates from an insufficient knowledge of the immediate harms inflicted by plastics on health.

When we talk of preventative health care the most cardinal concern becomes generating effective public awareness on agents that are detrimental to human and ecological health. The harmful effects of plastics on our health are as profound and deep as their involvement in our lives in the contemporary world. Despite their being synonymous with toxicity, the use of plastics for water and food packaging as well in kitchen ware is rampant.

The hundreds of plastic mineral water and juice bottles shelved in cold and hot conditions across retail stores is a testimony of our indifference to the health disorders plastics can create on human health. Several plastic products ooze chemicals from the bottles into the fluids which they contain.

These have been known to upset the delicate hormonal makeup of human physiology. Chemicals like BPA which breakdown from plastics upon being heated up or frozen have the potential to imitate effect of oestrogen hormone in the body. These are therefore called as endocrine disrupters. From health concerns like diabetes, thyroid malfunction to infertility in young population, such chemicals are responsible for creating a health havoc. Polystyrene which is used in making cutlery and foam packaging of many eatables, is also a well known neurotoxin. Most plastic cups and glasses also contain the notorious chemical called styrene.

This is a dangerous carcinogen which has been linked to gastrointestinal traumas and cancers. In fact several brands of plastic products which are touted as chemical free by manufacturers have been known to contain polycarbonate. This again leaks micro plastics in food and beverages. Unfortunately children who still have immature immune system are also being exposed to plastic lunch boxes, bottles, stationery and toys. It is disheartening how our entire human resource base gets maimed owing to our insurmountable dependence or addiction for plastics.

Today various communities across the planet are battling challenges like climate change, forest fires, economic and civil upheavals. The more critical issue of plastic impact on human life often gets pushed to the back burner. It is ironic however that people are ossifying themselves from within by not refraining from using plastic commodities and by not learning how to safely dispose the plastics which are already in use.

MK Gandhi believed that “you must be the change you want to see in the world”. By not bringing about a transformation in the societal patterns of manufacturing and consumption we cannot expect the rising health challenges to be mitigated.

Ecology and human life are two sides of the same coin. Preventive action has far more promising results than mitigative action. For a more productive channelising of our national resources it is important that physical and psychological health of people gets prioritised. Once preventive public health care is the centre of focus for a country then entire education system also becomes wired to sensitise people right from the primary stages. Plastics are the root cause of all health and environmental problems which the world is confronting at present.

Joint efforts for eradication and systematic disposal of plastics seems the only solution to this menace. It is not the nature which depends on humans but it is the humans who are cradled by nature. It is human actions which ultimately decide how the nature reacts and responds.

55,03-2-20,"Awareness on CAA & NRC needed before staging protest, opine Doonites","While the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) is going on for about a week in Dehradun, many citizens feel that one should first learn the correct facts about the issue before staging protests. On the other hand, there are some who consider the CAA to be detrimental considering the few aspects of the Act known to them.

According to Garhwal University faculty member Purna Varma, “The major issue is that people have lots of misunderstanding regarding CAA. One should understand that no existing citizen of India will face any kind of threat to citizenship due to the amendment. People need to be aware of such Acts and amendments before supporting or joining any kind of protest. One should get the correct information first and stop believing anything blindly.”

According to Kunal Rawat, a bank employee, “I completely support the statement of our chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat who said that 80 per cent of the people who are protesting against CAA and NRC do not even know the facts about it. The powerful people are using innocent and uneducated people to target the government for their politically driven agendas. I completely support CAA and hope the government does not withdraw it because of a few uninformed people in the country.”

“If the Muslims are protesting peacefully then there is nothing wrong in it. We live in a democratic country and people have the right to show disagreement against any decision taken by the government. I personally support CAA but I understand that some are sceptical about it because the government has mentioned certain religions in it. If the government could have used the word ‘minorities’ in our neighbouring countries instead of mentioning religions, I am sure no such protest would have been there in India,” said Sarojni Khandelwal, an editor in a publishing company.

On the other hand, school teacher Prakash Grewal said, “I don’t think that people protesting across the country are wrong. Of course, people lack the complete knowledge of CAA or NRC but can we really blame them? We all know that the current government is biased, so some communities will definitely feel insecure if the government will bring an Act based on religion. India is a secular country. You can’t be biased to the citizens on the basis of their religion.”

Medical student Rukaiya Bano opined, “Honestly, I have not read thoroughly about CAA or NRC but all I know that introducing an Act while mentioning certain religions is not acceptable in a secular country.”

It is pertinent to mention here that an anti-CAA protest on the lines of the one in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi has been going on near the Parade Ground here for about a week now. The protest in Dehradun is organised by senior advocate Razia Beig and Rais Fatima. According to Beig, CAA and NRC are destructive for the whole nation and if the government will introduce such laws in the country, the citizens will stand together against the Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/awareness-on-caa---nrc-needed-before-staging-protest--opine-doonites.html
56,03-2-20,Cement price hike during slowdown surprising: BJP,"Cement industry is one such industry in state which flourishes in the state here owing to the abundance of its raw material. The issue of hike in cement price nowadays amid ongoing economic slowdown is baffling everyone.

Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik slammed the move of state government to hike the price. He sees it as a kind of levy as an election fund during ensuing rural polls.

While talking to The Pioneer Kaushik alleged the present move of the state government will certainly hamper the need of reviving the real estate sector and the commitment of it of providing affordable houses especially to homeless.

The state government is taking away money from pockets of common people indirectly, he said while referring to recent rise in cement rise in the state.

However, a senior official in cement industry on the condition of anonymity said presently the cement industry is in jeopardy and a few companies are on the verge of closure or selling off which might have an impact on the employment sector.

“The cement industry is a capital-intensive industry, and without adequate capital infusion the industry can’t flourish. In the current business environment, it might not make business sense to make large investments that might be required”, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cement-price-hike-during-slowdown-surprising--bjp.html
57,03-2-20,Dumka turns green on JMM’s Foundation Day,"A sea of supporters carrying green flags with pictures of Dishom Guru Shibu Soren and raising slogans in glory of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) thronged the Gandhi Maidan in Dumka on Sunday as the pro-tribal party turned 41. The celebrations came hardly a month after a thunderous and rather unexpected victory of the party in the Assembly elections here.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who also happened to be the Executive president of JMM began the celebrations of Foundation Day by garlanding the statue of tribal heroes Sidhu and Kanhu. JMM Yuva Morcha Chief and Hemant’s younger brother, Basant Soren, MP Rajmahal, Vijay Hansda, Littipara MLA, Dinesh Williyam Marandi and other party leaders came to Dumka from various part of the State for the celebrations on Sunday.

There was a historical participation of common people and overwhelming enthusiasm among the party workers during the programme. The huge crowd braved heavy cold in the evening to hear the voice of their leaders. A memorial letter was also issued by the party on the occasion. Almost all party Ministers in the Soren Government and all MLAs were present on the occasion.

The Chief Minister led the processions on Sunday. After garlanding statue of Sidhu-Kanhu, he garlanded the Statue of Tilka Manjhi and paid homage at Municipality Chowk of Dumka.

The procession culminated in to public meeting and social gathering at Gandhi Maidan in Dumka where almost all senior leaders of the party gathered to celebrate the Establishment Day.

Heading the procession, Soren talked to media. He said that the day was historic and the huge gathering of people was indeed overwhelming. “I will try to fulfill hope and aspiration of every person of the State as after a long struggle they got their own Government,” he said, adding that since a very long time the emotions and aspiration of the people have been ‘crushed’ by a former Government.

The atmosphere was festive and every person of the crowed was cheering for the CM.

The supporters beat drums and danced to the tunes of Santhali songs as the CM marched through the sea of supporters oozing with energy and zeal.

The Chief Minister further said that the Government will work for the integrated development of the State where people from every section of the society will get benefits.

On December 29, Hemant Soren took oath as Chief Minister of the State. The party contested the State Assembly election under coalition with Indian National Congress (INC) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). JMM contested on 43 seats, INC on 30 and RJD contested on 7 seats out of total 81 seats. JMM won at 30 seats, INC at 16 seats and RJD won one seats.

JMM was founded by Binod Bihary Maht on February 2, 1973. The party was officially created on the birthday of Birsa Munda, the 19th century tribal warrior of Jharkhand, who fought against the British rule in present-day Jharkhand. The State of Jharkhand also came into existence on Birsa Munda’s birthday in 2000.

On 4 February 1973 Binod Bihari Mahto became the President and Shibu Soren General Secretary of the party. The prominent party leaders at that time were: Comrade former Dhanbad MP Late AK Roy, Martyr Nirmal Mahto and Teklal Mahto among others. The party celebrates its Establishment Day every year in Dumka.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dumka-turns-green-on-jmm---s-foundation-day.html
58,03-2-20,Increase numbers of beneficiaries under anti-malnutrition drive: CS,"Under Mukhyamantri Suposhan Abhiyan, women and children are being provided freshly-cooked nutritious food. As per the vision of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Chief Secretary RP Mandal has given instructions to all the district collectors to benefit maximum number of people under this campaign. He has asked the district collectors to make their special contribution to ensure success of this mega-campaign to eradicate malnutrition and anemia in children and women.

Chief Secretary stated in the letter that under Mukhyamantri Suposhan Abhiyan, maximum number of beneficiaries should be provided hot-cooked nutritious food for eradication of malnutrition and anemia. He said that during state-level review, it was found that number of beneficiaries receiving the hot-cooked food is less than expected. Freshly-cooked nutritious food is one of the most effective measures for eradication of malnutrition and anemia.

This is the reason why district collectors have been directed to ensure that maximum number of eligible beneficiaries should be provided freshly-cooked nutritious food under the campaign, and action taken in compliance to these instructions should be reported within a week.

Chief Secretary said that strict action will be taken if any case of negligence or irresponsibility is found in implementation of this campaign.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/increase-numbers-of-beneficiaries-under-anti-malnutrition-drive--cs.html
59,03-2-20,"CM meets Dumka residents, listens to their concerns","Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Sunday met hundreds of commoners at his residence in Dumka and assured to address the issues they were faced against – a practice that has made Soren a popular face on social media and rendered him the tag of ‘People’s Chief Minister’.

“This is your Govt. With your help the Govt can transform its ideas and intentions into reality,” said Soren, adding that it was the Govt’s priority to understand the pain of commoners and come up with necessary measures to address their issues.

During the public meeting, representatives of District Disabled Rehabilitation Center of Dumka met Soren and sought his support in providing a better life to the differently-abled people of the district. The representatives told Soren that they have been working without any assistance from the Government for the past one decade. Soren assured to take necessary steps to facilitate their work.

Around 269 fourth-grade policemen who were sacked in 2016 also met Soren on Sunday with a request of reinstating their duties. Besides, about 1200 watchmen, who complained of being removed after working for five years, also met the Chief Minister and put forth their demands.

The people of Sona Doga village of Dumka block met the Chief Minister and told that a person named Suniram Murmu grabbed about 350 bighas of land by declaring the owner dead. On this, Soren said that the whole matter will be investigated and then appropriate action will be taken.

Apart from this, many people made the Chief Minister aware of their problems regarding land dispute.

In less than a month since taking charge as the Chief Minister, Soren has won hearts across the country for his affability and simplistic approach towards his job. He has been arguably one of the most easily accessible Chief Ministers in the State so far. This is the second time that Soren has occupied the chair of the CM here, and the beginning of his second term has unveiled version 2.0 of Soren, say political experts.

Since taking charge as the Chief Minister of the State, Soren has not shied away from meeting commoners at his residence. Even on Sunday, commoners formed a beeline at his residence in Dumka to meet Soren. While most of them congratulated him for his achievements, some shared their problems and sought his help in addressing them. One of the visitors on Sunday gifted him a copy of Bhagwad Gita, while others gifted books on freedom fighters and revolutionaries. Soren has earlier requested people to gift him books instead of bouquets.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-meets-dumka-residents--listens-to-their-concerns.html
60,03-2-20,BJP hails Budget gift of tribal museum,"Hazaribag parliamentarian and senior BJP leader, Jayant Sinha has hailed the union budget claiming that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget has tried to address the concern of all sections of society. Sinha, the former minister of state for finance said that a State such as Jharkhand will be largely benefitted with the union budget.

Highlighting slew of benefits Jharkhand is going to reap from union budget, he said, “The budget announcement to set up tribal museum in Ranchi will help the State in making a mark in tourist map of the Country. With coming up of tribal museum in Ranchi, Jharkhand will become an epicenter of tribal culture and society.” Sinha said that the tribal museum will be on lines of Bihar Museum in Patna which is a world class museum.

The Bihar Museum is spread across 13.5 acres along Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, better known as Bailey Road, and has been built at a cost of Rs 500 crore. The Bihar Museum which is brainchild of chief minister Nitish Kumar has eight blocks, all inter-connected and having seven galleries which includes Orientation, Children's, History, Visible Storage, Historical Art, Regional Art, and Bihari Diaspora.

However, chief minister Hemant Soren who is unhappy with centre’s gift of tribal museum quipped, “Adivasiyon ko museum mein rakhne ki taiyari hai (Preparation to keep tribals in museum).” He said that he had asked the Prime Minister for a tribal university in the state, not a museum.

Reacting on Soren’s demand, Sinha said, “The Union Government is ready to give even tribal university to state provided the State Government provides land for setting up tribal university in State.” Soren last month on his visit to New Delhi after becoming Chief Minister met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and requested him to set up a tribal university in State.

Sinha also said that apart from Centre’s gift of tribal museum to state, the Modi government has allocated a sum of Rs 53,700 crore for tribal welfare. He said, “The fund will be used in social, educational and economic development of tribals. As Jharkhand is tribal state with large chunk of population being tribals, people of state will be largely benefited.”

Sinha said that finance minister’s announcement to develop 100 more airports by 2025 under UDAN scheme will benefit Jharkhand. He said, “The Airports in Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Hazaribag and Dumka will be developed in coming years, while the Deoghar airport will start operation soon.”

He said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had presented an all-inclusive budget with the view to double the income of farmers.

61,03-2-20,"Security forces, Maoists exchange fire at Chatrochati","Bokaro police along with the 26th battalion of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) confronted the CPI (Maoist) on Sunday at Rajderwa forest area in Jhumra under Chatrochati police station of Bokaro district. The CRPF and the local police exchanged 200 to 230 rounds of the fire with CPI (Maoist) rebels near the Chatrochati area while conducting anti-naxal raids. However, there was no casualty on either side.

Following a tip-off about the presence of insurgents in the Jhumra region, the CRPF along with the Bokaro police personnel launched a combing operation after getting input from vigilance that at least 30 rebels, including women Naxal contingents of Santosh Mahto’s dasta, were camping at Chatrochati near Rajdeewa village area.

On the directive of Bokaro superintendent of police P.Murugan, a task force was constituted for the purpose.

As the police team approached the Chatrochati hills, the Naxals camping atop it happened to stop the forces. Seeing the police forces the Maoist opened fire. In retaliation when the CRPF and local police opened fire, the Naxals taking advantage of forested and hilly terrain escaped. The encounter lasted for a couple of hours and over a dozen rounds of bullets were fired from each side.

This too did not cause any casualty on the side of the police, Bokaro SP,P.Murugan. Jhumra is a Naxal-hit area which falls exactly between Jhumra and Chainpur. An MHA report released in February 2019 said that 19 of 24 districts in Jharkhand were LWE-affected and 13 of them were extremely sensitive. Perhaps the presence of banned rebel outfits here was one of the major reasons for the ECI to stretch the voting process to almost a month during the Assembly polls.

According to figures with the State police, there are at least 17 splinter groups active in Jharkhand apart from the CPI (Maoist). A majority of rebels running the splinter outfits are nothing more than hired guns and thugs who have unleashed a reign of terror on innocent villagers, say police.

Many of these groups are involved in trafficking children, abducting businessmen for ransom, growing and smuggling opium and killing for sport, police say.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/security-forces--maoists-exchange-fire-at-chatrochati.html

The event took place on the second day of RUSH, the annual sports and cultural fest of IIM Ranchi.

The Chief Guest of honor on the occasion was Dr.Randhir Kumar, National President, National Human Rights Crime Control Bureau. Along with Ravindra Nath Bhagat, President, National Games Khelgaon Housing Complex, Prof. Rohit Kumar, professor, Strategic Management at IIM Ranchi, and Satish Kumar, Senior Administrative Officer of IIM Ranchi participated in the event.

In his opening speech, Dr.Randhir Kumar said, “We need to know why trafficking is still prevalent in the country; perhaps the reasons can be attributed to unemployment and improper education that provoke people to undertake such heinous measures. We need to know the real reason behind the occurrence of events and then do our share in order to solve the issue.”

On the other hand, Ravindra Bhagat said, “Child trafficking is the third most significant organized crime after drugs and smuggling. We Indians do not look for the root-cause – it's a part of our DNA, but it's going to change today.”

Addressing the students of IIM, he said, “You understand the world better than most, you see the world through a different lens. You are entrepreneurs, and you must take the next big step to root out the problem of child trafficking.” Prof. Rohit Kumar said It was important for young students to collaborate and involve with institutes that work towards sustainable development and, in the process, learn many things.

Satish Kumar was present at the ceremony, and he also reiterated to the students and the residents of Khelgaon about the challenges of life and society as a whole. ”Life is stressful for people of all ages and all sections of the society, an insidious mental strain that prevails like a pandemic. The initiative of UNGC-PRME is a retreat from the day-to-day life and spend some time to device the roadmap to tackle the real problem, which is to ensure that companies perform the corporate social responsibility, and contribute to our society by giving something back,” he said.

After that, the Forest Department and Public Works Department constructed safety walls on the mountain. Large scale tree plantation had also been carried out along with elaborate fencing work.

These measures had helped in considerably controlling the landslide problem on this mountain.

However, the landslide witnessed amidst rain and snowfall on January 29 has once again caused concern among the local residents. During the past 10-15 years a considerable number of buildings have been constructed in this area. Builders have also constructed flats and sold the same in the area from the polytechnic college to the Sainik School.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stones-still-falling-from-landslide-site-on-naina-peak.html

The trend is that information is manipulated to influence people’s voting behaviour. It confuses people and hinder decision. Due to fake news, media has a difficulty in reporting the truth. Indian media consumption is very big.

Now, time has come for the people to be media-litereate.

Every country should have a digital policy and the digital policy should be at par with the latest technology. Parents need to educate children regarding the truth and fake aspects of social media and how to differentiate between the true and false information present on social media platform. Social media literacy should be spread in society and parents should learn technology gadgets so they can keep vigil on their children’s activity on social media.

While addressing an anti-CAA rally in Indore, Bhaskar said that there has been so much talk on nationalism these days and the people have forgotten that their prime duty is towards the constitution and not towards the government.

Quoting a couplet from noted urdu poet Rahat Indori, Bhaskar claimed the Hindustan belongs to everyone. “The citizenship has been offered by soil of this country, blood flowing in our veins and the constitution, you can’t snatch it, even if you want to.”

Bhaskar who is highly critical of citizenship amendments slammed the BJP government in the Centre saying it (govt) is addicted to hatred.

While praising the erstwhile ruler of Indore-Ahilya Bai Holkar, the actress claimed that it was Indore’s good luck that it had a ruler like her who kept the princely State integrated while present day rulers in the country have turned into tormentors.

“With high hopes, we elected a government with majority but it’s now ridiculing the constitution,” said the actress alleging that is someone questions the government, then police lands at his/her doorsteps.

The Government’s mind has been taken over the phobia of intruders, said the actress adding the government chants Pakistan’s name more number of times her grandmother remembers the god. “This government seems to have fell in love with Pakistan,” said Bhaksar.

She underlined the fact that an act already was there in the country under which the government extended citizenship to singer Adnan Sami and later felicitated him with Padma Shri.

Also present on the occasion, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh affirmed, “I won’t show our documents to prove my citizenship do whatever you want to.”

The country would be run by ideologies of Gandhi and Ambedkar, not that of Godse and Golvalkar, claimed the Congress veteran. “Understand the chronology, first a union minister raised slogan of shooting traitors, then a youth comes and fires shot,” said Singh. They are spreading hatred and weakening the constitution, added Singh.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bollywood-actress-swara-bhaskar-slams-bjp-rss-over-caa.html

89,03-2-20,Maoists-locals poster war sparks tension,"After unrest over the killing of a Maoist by villagers and subsequent confrontation between pro-development groups and Red rebel sympathisers, now fresh tension has gripped the Swabhiman Anchal of Malkangiri district in the form of a poster war between the ultras and local residents.

As per reports, a number of posters put up by the Maoists’ Andhra Odisha Border Zonal Committee warning the locals to desist from going against them have been found in many places of the region.

The Maoists have threatened the people of Jodamba and Janturai of dire consequences if they don’t stop cooperating with police and security forces and pass on information about them.

However, unperturbed by the threats, the Malkangiri District Tribal Development Council has urged the locals not bow down to the diktat of the Maoists and have also started issuing posters against the ultras in the area.

With the conflict now leading to a poster war between both groups, the villagers are caught in a difficult situation.

While the threatening letters from the Maoists found in many places including the boats operating between the cutoff area and Chitrakonda have scared the locals, on the other hand a call from the Tribal Development Council not to yield to the oppression by Maoists has provided them with a slight glimmer of hope.

It may be noted that for the first time after the inauguration of the Gurupriya Bridge in 2018 which has brought development in the cutoff tribal dominated region, Chitrakonda has been witnessing continuous unrest due to conflicts between Maoists and local people for last few months.

Recently, some villagers killed a Maoist and critically injured another at Janturai which sparked a retaliatory torching of houses by the ultras in the region. Following the incident, more than 1,000 security personnel were deployed in the area to foil Maoist designs for creating further unrest in the area.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maoists-locals-poster-war-sparks-tension.html

93,03-2-20,Yogi reiterates resolve to develop Naxal-hit areas,"Reiterating his government’s commitment to developing Naxal-affected areas, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said all efforts would be made for the development of the most backward areas of the state and a policy was on the anvil to set up medical colleges in districts which do not have one.

“In the next one year, one medical college each will be set up in these districts on public-private partnership (PPP) model. The state government has approved a medical college for Chandauli district and its foundation stone will be laid soon,” the chief minister said at a function held on Maharishi Valmiki Seva Sansthan campus in Devkhat village of Naugarh in Chandauli district where he unveiled the statue of Maharishi Valmiki on Sunday.

“Through health fairs, it is our endeavour to bring health services to the doorsteps of the general public, especially the poor, the exploited and the deprived,” Yogi said.

Earlier, the chief minister inaugurated the Arogya Mela in Amdaha village. He said: “I am happy that we are simultaneously launching the biggest collective health scheme, — the Mukhyamantri Arogya Yojana’ — in more than 4,200 primary health centres in Uttar Pradesh today.”

94,03-2-20,HCL Lucknow set to increase its workforce,"Information technology major HCL Technologies is looking to increase the workforce at its Lucknow facility by 50 per cent by the end of next financial year (2020-21).

To the current headcount of 4,000, the company plans to add 2,000 employees to cater for its business expansion roadmap.

HCL is the promoter of the Shiv Nadar University in Noida.

A HCL official said, “Our employees count is expected to hit 4,500 by the end of March 2020 from the current strength of 4,000 professionals. The Lucknow facility continues to grow fast and gain traction in the market.”

The employees count of the HCL Lucknow stood at nearly 3,300 in March 2019. HCL in 2013 had set up a 100-acre IT City in Lucknow, which is targeted to create job opportunities for about 25,000 people.

“We are currently serving 103 global clients from the Lucknow centre, of which nearly 70 per cent are based in the USA. More projects are in the pipeline,” the official added.

HCL Lucknow is the largest HCL campus in North India. It offers a spectrum of services, including infrastructure management, application development, product engineering, BPO and HCL internal enabling functions.

HCL Lucknow started its operations in October 2016 and it is part of HCL’s strategic vision to expand and create job opportunities in smaller cities across India.

The HCL has so far made investments to the tune of Rs 500 crore in Lucknow centre and more funds would be invested as and when required. Nearly 95 per cent of the employees in the Lucknow facility hail from Uttar Pradesh.

Besides, the company is also aiming at achieving gender diversity with almost 23 per cent of the current employees being women professionals.

The HCL official said when the company’s Lucknow facility was being developed, sceptics were rather apprehensive if the venture would succeed in a non-metro city like Lucknow, yet the state’s human capital had contributed to its continues progress.

HCL Lucknow comprises Arya Bhatt Training Centre to train and cross-train 500 individuals simultaneously. A second training centre with an additional capacity of training 500 people is also complete and expected to start functioning soon.

The Yogi Adityanath government in UP is also promoting the IT and new age sectors in the state, especially in the eastern and central regions, for balanced growth beyond the National Capital Region (NCR) hubs of Noida and Greater Noida.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hcl-lucknow-set-to--increase-its-workforce.html
95,03-2-20,CAA: BSP at wits end to formulate its strategy,"Even as the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is completing two months, the Bahujan Samaj Party is at its wits end to formulate its strategy to position itself as a political formation opposed to the new citizenship law.

The aggressive campaign by the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, to win over Dalits by telling them that the Dalits from Pakistan and Bangladesh who faced persecution would be the major beneficiaries of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has added to the discomfiture of BSP supremo Mayawati.

The BJP move has made Mayawati defensive, as seen in her replacing Danish Ali with Ritesh Pandey, the MP from Ambedkar Nagar, as the party leader in Lok Sabha. She had tweeted: “In order to maintain a social balance, since both the leaders in Lok Sabha and BSP UP unit president Munquad Ali are from the same community, some changes have been made.”

The BSP attempt to maintain a ‘social balance’ and avoid any stereotyping has not gone down well with the Muslim supporters of the party who question why it is okay for two upper caste men to be in high positions but not two Muslims.

The BSP had boycotted the meet convened by the Congress to decide a strategy on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. The BSP had argued that lending support to the Congress would hurt the morale of BSP workers in Rajasthan as the grand old party had earlier “poached” some BSP workers.

Calling the CAA “divisive and unconstitutional”, Mayawati directed her party members to protest not with the Congress on the streets but through “posts and mail and by handing over memorandum”.

For the BSP, opposing the CAA and the NRC is a strategic move. When the party abstained from voting on the triple talaq bill and supported the repeal of Article 370 that gave special status to he state of Jammu and Kashmir, the Muslim supporters of the party were angry. Sensing this displeasure, the BSP took steps to gain the trust of the community. First, Mayawati reappointed Danish Ali as BSP leader in the Lok Sabha in November 2019. Then she opposed the CAA and NRC.

The CAA is largely opposed by a section of people in the North-East where the BSP has no political stake. The CAA is opposed largely by the Muslims across the country and regional parties, Congress and Left parties.

At the same time, the BSP also does not want to be seen as aggressively pro-Muslim, which is why it has launched a ‘soft protest’ against the CAA and NRC.

Among the supporters of the BSP, there is already some identification with the BJP’s Hindutva ideology. The campaigns of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its allied organisations among various Dalit communities over the years have succeeded in mobilising Hindus against political parties that display a pro-Muslim image.

The BSP’s ‘soft protest’ is also rooted in another concern. Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who is a charismatic leader and has the ability to attract large crowds, has mastered the art of street protests. The BSP is worried that if its supporters come out on the streets, they will become part of his popular protest movement.

A BSP leader said, “Launching a soft protest is not going to help the party. By refusing to lead from the front, Mayawati has lost an important opportunity to project herself as a strong opposition leader. It is Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi who has occupied this space instead.”

He added, “It is true that the BSP has always shied away from participating in mass protest movements. The party will have to revisit that strategy this time.”

A former Muslim MP of the BSP said, “When Kanshi Ram visualised the Bahujan movement in north India, he defined Muslims as one of the constituents of the Bahujan population. Mayawati has tried to form Dalit-Muslim alliances in electoral politics but failed to respond to the aspirations of a larger section of Muslim communities and other social groups who are opposing the CAA and the NRC.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/caa--bsp-at-wits-end-to--formulate-its-strategy.html

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had in 2014 laid foundation stone for establishment of a medical college and hospital.

Surprisingly on Saturday night, a private organisation ‘Mahaveer Company’ engaged some people to construct the compound wall on the said land. Knowing this, local people rushed the spot and vehemently stopped the construction work.

The people seized the construction materials, including trucks, and handed over the same to the Kuarmunda out-post. The locals said that the land was occupied from tribals for establishment of a dairy farm. But later in 2014, it was decided to set up a medical college in 20 acres of land and, subsequently, the CM had laid the foundation-stone.

“Instead of establishing a medical college, the Idco has conspired to allot the same land to a private company for a sponge iron plant which is no way acceptable by us,” said locals.

103,03-2-20,Nadda accuses Kejriwal of insulting purvanchalis,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Sunday accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of ""insulting"" the people from the purvanchal region and wondered if he can do any good to them when he cannot respect them.

In his tweets targeting the AAP leader, Nadda posted a brief video of Kejriwal, who is heard saying that poor people from Bihar come to Delhi by spending Rs 500 and avail of medical treatment of over Rs 5 lakh here free of cost.

The BJP has often cited these comments to accuse Kejriwal of insulting migrants but the AAP has asserted that the chief minister was making a point about the quality of medical facilities being offered in the national capital.

Nadda said people from poorvanchal have played a big role in the development of Delhi but Kejriwal does not ""realise"" it.

""The way you have often insulted brothers and sisters from poorvanchal, is unbecoming of a Chief Minister,"" he said.

The BJP president also attacked Kejriwal over the issue of drinking water, saying the AAP leaders has been making the promise of delivering piped water to every household since 2014 and then claimed in 2019 that it will take another five years.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nadda-accuses-kejriwal-of-insulting-purvanchalis.html
104,03-2-20,Alka Lamba confident of victory,"It is not freebies but always targeted developmental work with intention to create employment and bringing in overall changes by transforming the existing rooted system and by addressing concerns related to civic services. Combating pollution, providing drinking water, constructing roads and hospitals, laying sewer lines and good transportation are some of the issues, the Government has failed to tackle, Congress candidate and sitting MLA from the Chandni Chowk Alka Lamba said.

In an Interview to The Pioneer, Lamba, who quit AAP in September last year after differences with AAP leadership to join Congress, said ""During the Sheila Dixit term as a Chief Minister, people had to pay electricity bill once in every two months. Making everything free is a sign of weak leaders who intend to gain political advantages and by doing so he thinks that people can forget his failure,""

Criticising Delhi CM, she said the condition of roads here is pathetic, no new hospital was constructed in last five years, people are forced to drink dirty water, Delhi has become a gas chamber but nothing was done to address the issues that has been haunting people for years.

Lamba won from the constituency in 2015, defeating Suman Kumar Gupta of the Bharatiya Janata Party by 18,287 votes. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded Parlad Singh Sawhney, a four-term former Congress MLA from the seat.

On whether freebies can impact poll result she said, certainly not as the government has exposed themselves by announcing freebies before election and spending a huge money in subsidy instead of carrying out developmental works that can take the economy further and created new scope of opportunities.

""Our girls do not want to roam in the city taking free bus ticket in Rs 10 but they want a system where overall development is ensured. You can people here and no one will advocate the freebies but they keep saying develop the city and create jobs and they will take care of their electricity and water bills themselves,"" she said.

The Chandni Chowk constituency comprises of Dariba Kalan, Fateh Puri, Jama Masjid, Kashmere Gate, Chandni Chowk, Khyber Pass, Lal Quila and Yamuna Bridge, Khari Baoli, Darya Ganj, Faiz Bazar, Kinari Bazar, Nai Sarak and Naya Bazar.

When asked about issues of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Shaheen Bagh protest, Lamba attacked the BJP saying that they have nothing to show that is why they are asking votes by dividing people. ""Inflation is on all time high. Rtes of vegetables are touching a new height. There are other issues like massive unemployment but the BJP is all busy in cashing by polarizing voters on the basis of religion. This is an example of cheap politics. The BJP leaders should ashamed of them for asking votes on Hindutva. If you do not have anything to show to people you started using students to polarize voters,"" she added.

Asked whom she considers her strong opponent in the constituency, she said no one is even near me in terms of popularity. ""AAP candidate Parlad Sawhney was elected four times from the seat but did nothing to improve the basic facilities in the areas except besmirching the good name of Congress party.BJP is a communal party and seeks votes dividing people on the basis of religion,"" she added.

Lamba said she is getting an overwhelming response from public and was confident to retain the seat. When asked why star campaigners and party bigwigs like Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi have yet to come in support of their campaign, Lamba said she was asking voters to vote on development work done by her in the area being an MLA in last five years.

AAP candidate Sawhney won the seat consecutively in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013 on Congress ticket. Lamba won in 2015 from the seat on AAP ticket and got 27.39 per cent more vote than that of she got in 2013.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/alka-lamba-confident-of-victory.html

People entering the country from Bangladesh would be screened at these important checkpoints, as some among them might have visited China in the recent past, he said.

117,03-2-20,Meghalaya Guv calls Didi Govt the vilest,"Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy has lashed out the Mamata Banerjee Government for its alleged contemptibility in dealing with Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. This, while the Trinamool Congress leadership has faulted the Narendra Modi Government for its ‘barbaric ways’.

Speaking to newsmen Roy on Sunday said that he had “never seen such a mean Government” in his life. Referring to the way the State administration conducted itself when Dhankhar was being humiliated by the students of Jadavpur and Calcutta Universities, Roy said “this is absolute vileness which does not go with the great Bengali culture.”

The Governments had come and gone but none had misbehaved with a Governor like this Roy said. “I have never seen such a wicked and dirty behavior from any Government earlier… The way he was humiliated at the Calcutta University convocation programme is really reprehensible … One cannot conceive of a Governor who is also the chancellor of the University being blockaded and humiliated by students in presence of the State police … so that he had to abandon the programme” and retire from the venue,” he said.

Dhankhar had been in loggerheads with the State Government ever since he ignored the State Government’s advisory and personally went to the Jadavpur University to secure the release of Union Minister Babul Supriyo who had been blockaded by the agitating students there.

Subsequently he had repeatedly complained against the State Government for refusing to cooperate with him whenever he tried to visit the districts to take stock of administrative situations there.

On the other hand Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other senior ministers repeatedly attacked the Governor for crossing the line of political decorum and interfering in the State’s administrative affairs.

The TMC leadership even went to the extent of calling the Governor a spokesperson of the BJP while Banerjee charged the Central Government with “trying to run a parallel administration in the State through the Governor’s office.”

Meanwhile, senior Bengal Minister and TMC general secretary Partho Chatterjee on Sunday said BJP was running a barbaric regime in the centre.

T

hey (BJP) are inhuman. India has never seen such a barbaric and inhuman Government. They are insensitive to all kind of tragedy. I don’t think sit-in demonstrations will move them.”

He was referring to the death of a woman who fell ill amidst the Park Circus dharna against CAA and later succumbed to her ailments.

Confusion and high drama had prevailed on Saturday at the sit-in demonstration being held by women against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Morland Road in Nagpada after a section of the protesters decided to call off the protest as the police told the volunteers to vacate the area saying they did not have permission for it.

However, soon after the announcement was made that the protest was being called off, a huge crowd came to the site and started raising slogans. Following this, the plan was given up and the protest continued.

Talking to PTI on Sunday, Feroze Mithiborwala, organiser of the protest, said, “Despite the attempts to sabotage the 'Mumbai Bagh' protest by certain inside elements as well as by the police, the protest continues. We are now stronger and more resolute than before.”

“The all-women protest, which began on the night of January 26, entered the eighth day on Sunday. We request to the Mumbai Police to cooperate with the organisers of this peaceful protest,” he said.

“Mumbai Bagh has become another Shaheen Bagh and it has successfully resisted all attempts to end the protest,” he added.

Mithiborwala appealed to the citizens to join the stir in large numbers and show solidarity with the protesters.

Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, who visited the protest site at 10.30 pm on Saturday to give a speech, was stopped by the police from using a megaphone saying the use of loudspeaker or public address system was prohibited after 10 pm. Ghosh addressed the gathering without the megaphone.

“When Ghosh arrived there, police told the organisers that they cannot use loudspeakers or public address system as the 10 pm deadline has ended. They were also asked to remove the sound boxes as well,” a police official said.

Mithiborwala said, “Police refused to let Ghosh use the megaphone. So she addressed the gathering without it and inspired the people.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/day-after-confusion-----mumbai-bagh--protest-continues-on-day-8.html
119,03-2-20,Stalin launches signature campaign against Act,"DMK president MK Stalin on Sunday launched a 'one crore signature campaign' against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register here.

Launching the drive in which his party-led coalition partners, including the Congress, Left parties, IUML and MDMK are also taking part, Stalin slammed the Centre for “beginning work” for the NRC and NPR like it passed the CAA in Parliament.

“Sometimes we are confused about our own date of birth. When this is the case, a situation has now come about in which details about older generations like our father and grandfather are sought,” he claimed.

Though Opposition parties had all along opposed the CAA and other aspects like the citizenship register, the Central Government has, however, turned a deaf ear to it, he said.

Home Minister Amit Shah ‘autocratically’ declared that the Citizenship law will be implemented and Prime Minister Narendra Modi too echoed the view, the DMK leader said.

“CAA must be repealed and initiatives related to both the NPR and NRC must not be taken up and these are the campaign objectives and this drive will emerge victorious,” he said.

Stalin, also the leader of opposition in the Tamil Nadu assembly, strongly criticised the ruling AIADMK for supporting the CAA and said the signature drive has been launched following several forms of protests like demonstrations.

Wearing a “No to CAA NPR NRC,” tag, the top DMK leader affixed his signature to kick start the campaign in his Kolathur Assembly constituency here.

The drive, with participation from his party and allies will be held across the State and volunteers will go door to door and get people's signatures after explaining the reasons, he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/stalin-launches-signature-campaign-against-act.html

128,03-2-20,"Bringing end to human trafficking State’s top priority, says Soren","Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Sunday said that bringing an end to the menace of human trafficking was one of the top priorities of his Government. In the wake of the recent rescue of six minor girls allegedly trafficked from Gumla, Soren took to microblogging platform Twitter and said that removing the infamy of human trafficking from Jharkhand was a priority for the Government.

“Bringing an end to the menace of human trafficking is our top priority. Please investigate the matter and nab the traffickers involved in the matter,” he said, attaching a cutout of a vernacular daily that had reported about six recently rescued Gumla girls who were tortured by their employers in New Delhi and were now being threatened by traffickers.

The Chief Minister also directed Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police in Gumla to identify vulnerable girls who were prone to fall prey to trafficking agents and educate them. “Provide education and skill development trainings to such girls,” his tweet further said.

Jharkhand has been one of the worst-affected States in India in terms of human trafficking in the past decade. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data says that at least 131 incidents of human trafficking were reported in Jharkhand in 2018 – fourth highest in the country.

However, activists claim that several thousand children, especially tribal girls, are trafficked from the State to metro cities every year on the pretext of jobs, marriage and even education.

A majority of these children, they say, are often subjected to physical and sexual tortures leading to fatal ailments or even suicides. The Crime Investigation Department of Jharkhand police says the number of children who went missing from the State since 2005 stands at 3,838 and 1,281 children remain untraced since the same year.

Many cases of trafficked Jharkhand girls being tortured, raped and brutally beaten up by employers in Delhi have been reported in the past.

The Chief Minister on Sunday directed Gumla police to prioritize the case of rescued girls and ensure speedy investigation in the matter. According to media reports, families of the rescued girls have sought police’s intervention in the matter after traffickers allegedly threatened them. The families have also asked the police to ensure that the girls’ due salaries were paid by the Delhi employers.

Soren on Sunday also asked Child Welfare Committees (CWC), District Child Protection Officers (DCPO) and Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) to be cautious and sensitive towards such matters in order to prevent recurrence of such incidents in Jharkhand.

The CID too has written to the State Home Department for setting up four new AHTUs – one each in Sahibganj, Godda, Latehar and Pakur. Only eight out of 24 districts in the tribal state have AHTUs, while the remaining 16, including a few that have turned havens for modern day slave traders, entirely rely on the local police for checking, combating and investigating cases of human trafficking.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bringing-end-to-human-trafficking-state---s-top-priority--says-soren.html

131,03-2-20,Farmers in Tamil Nadu not getting MSP announced by Centre,"There is no end to the woes of the Tamil Nadu farmers. It ranges from non-availability of water for irrigating the paddy fields and scarcity of fertilizers and labour to work in the farms. The frequent interactions with farmers in most of the districts across the State yielded information which is not music to the ears of the authorities concerned.

Even as they expressed their gratitude to the Union Finance Minister who has set apart Rs 15 lakh crore exclusively for farm loan, farmer leaders live RV Giri, president, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) ask the authorities to ensure that the farm loans reach the hands of the needy farmers. “There is no system as on today, at least in Tamil Nadu, to ensure that the loans reach the needy farmers,” said Giri.

But the most shocking disclosure made by Giri as well as Kattamannarkoil Kannan, secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Association, is that farmers in Tamil Nadu do not get the Minimum Support Price announced by the Centre. Though the Centre had declared a MSP of Rs 1,815/- per quintal for paddy for the year 2019-2020, Tamil Nadu farmers have not received any figure in the close vicinity of the Government rate. “The Direct Purchase Centres set by the State Government are far away from the villages and the paddy fields. The farmers do not have the transport mechanism to carry the paddy to the DPCs. Even if they manage to do it, the bureaucrats and employees manning the DPCs ask money ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 100 per bag per person. What we get is far below the price announced by the Government,” said Kannan and Arupathi Kalyanam, another farm leader from Nagapattinam.

The State Government officials, as usual, denied and dismissed the ‘charges’ and ‘allegations’ as ‘baseless’ made by the farmers and farm leaders. But the farmers were unanimous in their contention that the MSP was meant for reading in news papers and the reality was something different.

According to Kannan and Giri, the DPC officials churn out a number of reasons not to accept the paddy brought to them. “They say that the moisture content in the paddy bags are more than prescribed by the government agencies and hence not acceptable. The poor and illiterate farmers are left helpless by these arguments,” said Kannan.

Kalyanam said that unless the Centre has a fool-proof mechanism for disbursing the MSP, the farmers would continue to be at the mercy of government employees as well as traders.

“The hike in amount set apart for farming sector would yield the results only if the government has the technical knowhow to monitor whether the farmers are benefitted individually.

We have been pleading with the Government for the implementation of the MS Swaminathan Commission Recommendations which had asked the Government to incorporate the cost of production and a fifty per cent profit in the final Minimum Support Price of the commodities. This would have helped the farmers to double their income. The Swaminathan Commission Report was submitted to the Centre in 2006,” said Kalyanam who has launched a new movement by name Self Sufficient Green Villages Movement which focusses on ‘swadeshi self reliance economic policies’ to make India a Five trillion Dollar economy soon.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/farmers-in-tamil-nadu-not-getting-msp-announced-by-centre.html

133,03-2-20,Pune: 50 vehicles damaged as vandals go on rampage,"In an apparent effort to terrorise people, some unidentified hoodlums went on a rampage in three different areas of Pune, vandalising at least 50 vehicles, including cars, autorickshas, tempos and two-wheelers in three separate incidents that took place from Friday night to Sunday morning.

The incidents have taken the police by unawares and left the affected Punekars shell-shocked. The police have registered cases against some unidentified persons made a few arrests and are trying to ascertain if the three incidents are inter-linked.

In Pune’s Sahakar Nagar locality which bore the maximum brunt, saw hoodlums— armed with some sickles, iron rods and sticks targetted and damaged at least 30 vehicles at around 2 am on Sunday.

The miscreants went on a rampaging spree, smashing the glass panes and damaging vehicles indiscriminately parked on the road. In a few cases, the miscreants have deflated the tyres of vehicles. They also set ablaze damaged vehicles, including a car, auto rickshaw and bicycles and set them on fire.

In Pune’s neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad area, five to six unidentified gangsters vandalised at least 13 vehicles including autorickshaws, tempos and a four wheelers at Nigdi’s Ajanta Nagar locality at around 4 am on Sunday.

In a complaint lodged with the Nigdi police, an eyewitness Rajesh Popat Kamble — who was robbed of Rs 1,600 from his pocket—said that five to six miscreants had damaged at least 13 vehicles using iron rods, sickles and stones.

In the first incident that took place at Warje’s Sahyog Nagar locality in Pune at 10.30 pm on Friday, some goondas vandalised at least seven vehicles, including four two-wheelers, a school van and two auto rickshaws.

The Warje police have registered a case against seven persons and arrested persons in connection with the incident that took place on Friday night. The police are investigating the motive behind the incident.

The Sahakar Nagar police have detained some persons for questioning in connection with the incident that took place in the early hours of Sunday. Like in the earlier incident, the police have not established as yet as to what the motive behind the incident. Eyewitnesses have told the police that there were miscreants behind the incident.

No arrests have so far been made in connection with the incident that took place at Nigdi.

There have been similar incidents of vandalism in Pune in the recent past. On the night of June 12, 2019 some unidentified miscreants went on a rampage near Kamla Nehru Hospital area in Pune’s Mangalwar Peth area, damaging at least six vehicles including two-wheelers and four-wheelers. In another incident that took place on the night of October 10, 2019, six vehicles —four autorickshaws, a tempo and a car — were damaged by some unidentified miscreants in front of the office of a local corporator at Pune’s Ramtekdi locality coming under the Wanowrie police station.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pune--50-vehicles-damaged-as-vandals-go-on-rampage.html

The group has been carrying out this activity under the #RostoGoa campaign.

Activist Cecille Rodrigues, who is leading the campaign, said, “The speed breakers had turned blind spots, causing road accidents. The RostoGoa initiative began from my own Taleigao constituency and spread to other areas, including Calangute, Baga which are prominent tourist spots.”

135,03-2-20,K’taka Cabinet expansion on Feb 6: CM,": The much awaited expansion of the Karnataka cabinet will take place on February 6 with Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday saying that 13 MLAs would take oath of office.

“The Cabinet expansion will take place on February 6 with the oath-taking ceremony at the Raj Bhavan at 10.30 AM,” he told reporters here. Thirteen MLAs, including 10 who had joined BJP from parties, including Congress and the JD(S), will take oath, he said. Yediyurappa had received the nod from the BJP central leadership on January 31 for the expansion of his six month old cabinet.

The exercise has been on the cards for nearly two months ever since BJP won 12 of the 15 seats in the December 5 2019 bypolls, helping the Yediyurappa Government retain majority in the Assembly.

There are 18 Ministers, including the Chief Minister, in the Cabinet that has a sanctioned strength of 34. Sixteen berths are vacant.

The Chief Minister had said that barring one or two, most of the disqualified JDS-Congress MLAs who got re-elected in the bypolls on BJP tickets would be made Ministers, but that there would not be additional deputy chief ministers.

Though he had given an assurance to all 11 re-elected legislators that they would be made ministers, he said on Sunday that 10 of them would be made ministers.

137,03-2-20,HM commander Babu also BAT’s hitman,"Hizbul Mujahideen commander Naveed Babu, arrested along with Jammu & Kashmir Police Deputy Superintendant of Police Davinder Singh, had also worked for Pakistan’s special force Border Action Team (BAT) since 2017 and specialized in hitting security forces’ personnel and camps, according to probe into the case so far.

Naveed, who carried a reward of Rs 20 lakh on his head, was also on the hit list of the Army. Davinder Singh was facilitating Naveed and his accomplice Rafi Rather for their travel to the national Capital and the agencies are probing if they had plans to carry out attacks here, sources said.

Babu and Rather along with Singh were arrested by the Jammu & Kashmir Police on January 11 at Mir Bazar in Kulgam district of the Valley following a tip off from the Intelligence Bureau just in time.

Singh, posted in the anti-hijacking unit of the Jammu & Kashmir police at the Srinagar airport, was spotted behind a team of 15 envoys, including US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster, who visited the capital of the newly created Union Territory just ahead of Singh arrest.

Naveed Babu and Rather are suspected to have carried out hits against the security forces as part of their involvement with the Pakistani BAT and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is expected to probe this aspect in detail as the national capital is home to a host of VVIPs and diplomats, sources said.

Naveed and Rather’s plans to visit the national capital before their arrest with Singh has come as a major concern for the security agencies especially since both the terrorists were specially trained by the Pakistani agencies before associating them with the BAT, sources further said.

BAT has been known carry out brutal actions against the security forces’ personnel along the border and Singh’s role in providing information on troop movement and deployment is also under the scanner of the agencies.

Following the arrest of Singh, various agencies including the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have conducted detailed security audit of their installations in the Valley as also screening of the entire work force.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hm-commander-babu-also-bat---s-hitman.html
138,03-2-20,Kerala CM: Colonisers' strategy of dividing people being used today,"Hitting out at the Centre over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said the “communal elements” today were using the British colonisers' strategy of disrupting people's unity by dividing them on communal lines.

He also said that the CAA must be rejected as it was “against the Constitution”, ‘divisive’ and “seeks to impose the philosophy of Hindutva”, due to which the country's secular fabric was facing a ‘profound crisis’.

According to him, the amended citizenship law has pierced the secular mind of the people and rekindled the spirit of nationalist movement.

Vijayan, who heads the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) Government in the southern state, was speaking at the 'Mumbai Collective' here on 'National struggle against communalism'.

“In the past, our movement was against the colonisers, but presently our struggle against communalism is a movement against those who stood with the colonisers,” he said.

“In the past, the colonisers tried to disrupt people's unity by dividing them on communal lines. Today, the communal elements are using the same strategy experimented by their masters,” he added.

The fact that so many of us are out there on the streets, and gatherings such as this are happening across the country, are indicators of what our nation thinks at this point of time, Vijayan said.

“We do not have an iota of doubt that India's secular structure is facing a profound crisis, that out Constitution is under threat, and that out democracy itself is sought to be fundamentally undermined by the communal forces,” he alleged.

“While a series of interventions with a communal agenda have been made by the ruling dispensation, it is the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 that has proved to be last weapon which has strongly pierced the secular mind of our people. It has rekindled the spirit of out nationalist movement,” he

said.

He also defended the anti-CAA resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly.

“The Kerala Legislative Assembly has passed a resolution demanding the central government to repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act. Constitutionally, a state assembly can do so; it is well within its constitutional powers,” he said.

Kerala was the first state to pass a resolution against the CAA, followed by Punjab, Rajasthan and West

Bengal.

“The CAA-2019 has imperiled the nation's constitutional values, and it must be rejected for three reasons,” Vijayan said.

“First of all, it is against the letter and spirit of our Constitution. Secondly, it is divisive, deeply discriminatory and violative of human rights. And third, it seeks to impose the politics and philosophy of Hindutva, with its vision of a 'Hindu Rashtra' on our entire people and on the basic structure of our polity,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kerala-cm--colonisers--strategy-of-dividing-people-being-used-today.html

The Left party will launch a door-to-door campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the proposed countrywide National Register of Citizen and the National Population Register across the state from Monday, CPI(M) state committee secretary Gautam Das alleged.

“The CAA, NRC and NPR are the part of an agenda the BJP and the RSS to convert India into a Hindu Rashtra by driving out all non-Hindu people from the country. We strongly oppose this and will launch a door-to-door campaign till March to build up a strong opinion against it,” Das told a press conference.

He claimed that no party other than the BJP is supporting this programme as it would destroy the secular fabric of the country.

“If the BJP and RSS can implement these three (CAA, NRC, NPR), the secular fabric would be destroyed. Besides, poor people, mainly from the reserved categories, would bear the brunt of it,” Das said.

He alleged that the NPR and the proposed nationwide NRC are entwined and the final agenda of the saffron party is to act against the people belonging to the poor and minority communities.

Addressing a gathering after participating in a yoga camp organised by the Patanjali Yogpeeth of Yoga Guru Baba Ramdev here, Naidu emphasised the need to transform movements such as Fit India and yoga into peoples movements and make the country a healthy and happy nation.

Naidu said the nation was poised to realise a huge demographic dividend with about 60 per cent of the population below the age of 35.

“However, the need of the hour is for the youth to be healthy in a holistic manner, said Naidu adding that yoga is the cheapest medicine for health. On the impact of yoga, Naidu said the massive participation of people from all over the world during the International Yoga Day celebrations annually was testimony to its global popularity.

“Yoga is Indias greatest legacy and its most glorious gift to the world, he said.

Maintaining that practising yoga should not remain limited to International Yoga Day alone, he advised people to practise yoga regularly.

This would help in maintaining a balanced attitude in all situations, he added.

Observing that the ever-mounting pressure, wayward lifestyle and changing food habits have resulted in youth suffering from physical and psychological disorders, Naidu said, We need a transformation in the way we live, in the way we think and in the way we interact with our fellow human beings and Mother Nature.”

“I believe that yoga will be a powerful tool to bring about the desired transformation in people who practise it regularly,” he said.

Speaking after inaugurating the new global headquarters Kanha Shantivanam of Ram Chandra Mission in Rangareddy district of Telangana, the President said that in a world full of anxieties, uncertainties, insecurities and hostilities, the responsibilities of organisations like Ram Chandra Mission have increased manifold.

It is only such organisations which can provide the reassuring touch of a healer, the president was quoted as saying in an official release. “Spirituality is India's most precious gift to the world. From the teachings of Vedanta, Teerthanker Mahaveer and Gautam Buddha to the messages of Nanak and Kabir there is a grand flow of eternal spiritual wisdom which was transmitted to the modern world by Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and many others of India's spiritual force, Kovind said. Today, Gandhi is revered all over the world for his message of truth, compassion and non-violence, and he was essentially a seeker of spiritual truth, he said.

“I am glad to see that Ram Chandra Mission has been promoting individual change as well as social change. The mission has been promoting the great ancient tradition of Raja Yoga system of meditation in the modern world,” he said.

151,03-2-20,Political parties not behind Shaheen Bagh protest: Yechury,"Senior CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury on Sunday said that political parties were not behind the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest in Shaheen Bagh.

Yechury said it was in fact a case of the protesters “leading us and we are walking behind them”.

He said the Shaheen Bagh protest, which has captured the imagination of the country since it started over a month ago and has spawned several replicas, reminded him of his days during Emergency.

Yechury was speaking at the Mumbai Collective here. He was accompanied by NCP Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule.

“There is no political party behind such protests. In fact they are leading us and we are walking behind them,” he said.

The senior Left leader said such (Shaheen Bagh) protests are taking place in at least 50 places and it is happening like in the case of civil disobedience.

Speaking further, Yechury said every religion may have one holy book, and Hinduism may have several, but for the patriotic Indian, “the Constitution is the only holy book”.

Supporting the protests, Yechury said such strident opposition to the National Population Register (NPR) will automatically affect the rollout of the National Register of Citizens.

Sule said issues like CAA and NRC are being used to divert attention of the people from “core factors such as the crumbling economy of the country”.”India is scared while police is living on the edge. We call ourselves representatives of the people in the Lok Sabha but this (Modi) government and the Parliament is not responsive,” Sule said. Taking a swipe at the Narendra Modi government, Yechury said, “At least 10 times, ministers in the Lok Sabha have said the NRC will be the basis of NPR.” Sule said CAA and NRC would hurt the poor of the country, including Adivasis and banjaras (nomads) among others.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/political-parties-not-behind-shaheen-bagh-protest--yechury.html
152,03-2-20,NRI tax not to apply on bonafide workers in West Asia,"The Government on Sunday clarified that the proposed tax on NRIs will not apply on bonafide Indians working in tax-free foreign countries and is intended to tax only those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2020-21 had proposed to tax Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who do not pay taxes in any foreign country.

This provision raised anxiety in minds of those working in the Gulf region where countries don’t tax income earned by individuals.

First Sitharaman clarified that only Indian income of NRIs is proposed to be taxed under the new provision, and later the tax department issued a statement to say that “the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries”.

The Union Budget for 2020-21 presented on Saturday had tightened the screws on those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status. While earlier it was possible to be classified as a non-resident by staying out of the country for 183 days or about six months in a year, this has now been, in effect, enhanced to 245 days.

In an interview to PTI, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the new rule was “an anti-abuse provision planned to plug loopholes in the system and not intended to tax income earned by those working overseas”.

He said the wording in the Budget document may have created confusion and so a clarification has been issued now.

“What we are doing now is that the income of an NRI generated in India will be taxed here. If he’s earning something in a jurisdiction where there is no tax, why will I include that into mine that has been generated there,” Sitharaman told reporters here on Sunday.

She said Indian earnings of NRIs such as rental income from property in the country is what was intended to be taxed by way of the new provision.

“Whereas if you have a property here and you have rent out of it, but because you are living there, you carry this rent into your income there and pay no tax there, pay no tax here ... Since the property is in India, I have got a sovereign right to tax,” she said in a post Budget interaction with media.

“I am not taxing what you’re earning in Dubai but that property which is giving you rent here, you may be an NRI, you may be living there but that is revenue being generated here for you. So, that’s the issue.”

Pandey said Indians working in the Middle East, as well as those in Merchant Navy, will not be taxed using the new provision.

“Somebody who is a citizen of India and sitting in a tax haven and not paying taxes then he has to pay tax,” he said. “By issuing clarification, we have kept them (workers in the Middle East) out. Same for merchant navy because their income is also not arising out of India.”

Asked if raising the duration of overseas stay to qualify for NRI status would not deter Indians from making visits home, he said:

“These are anti-abuse provisions. If someone faces any difficulty because of this, we will see what can be done. The policy that you make, you have to see that a larger section of people is benefitted because of this. If he is a non-resident, he has to live substantially out of India. Now, substantially out of India means what? Earlier it was 50:50. Now we have made 2/3rd: 1/3rd.”

He said the new provision was brought in because people were taking advantage of the existing one. “These are the anti-abuse provisions, and not to inconvenience any genuine persons.”

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in a statement said the new provision is not intended to include those Indian citizens in the taxation net, who are bonafide workers in other countries.

An “Indian citizen shall be deemed to be resident in India if he is not liable to be taxed in any country or jurisdiction. This is an anti-abuse provision since it is noticed that some Indian citizens shift their stay in low or no tax jurisdictions to avoid payment

of tax in India,” it said.

“The new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries,” it said.

It stated that it was not correct to say that those Indians who are bonafide workers in other countries, including in the Middle East, and who are not liable to tax in these countries will be taxed in India on the income that they have earned there.

“In order to avoid any misinterpretation, it is clarified that in case of an Indian citizen who becomes deemed resident of India under this proposed provision, income earned outside India by him shall not be taxed in India unless it is derived from an Indian business or profession. Necessary clarification, if required, shall be incorporated in the relevant provision of the law,” it added.

At present, if an Indian or a person of Indian origin managed his stay in India such that he remained a non-resident in perpetuity, he was not liable to pay tax on his global income in India.

The Union Budget has proposed to introduce a deeming provision that every Indian citizen who is not liable to tax in any other country, by virtue of his domicile or residence, shall be deemed as a resident of India. Consequently, his global income would be taxable in India.

Tightening the residency provisions, the Budget also proposed to reduce the period of stay in India to 120 days from 182 days earlier for persons of Indian origin (PIOs) to be categorised as non-resident Indians (NRIs).",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/nri-tax-not-to-apply-on-bonafide-workers-in-west-asia.html

The apex court had, on January 13, asked four senior lawyers to convene a meeting to decide on the issues to be deliberated by it in the matter.

On November 14 last year, while referring the matter to a larger bench, a five-judge bench had said the debate on the constitutional validity of religious practices such as a bar on the entry of women and girls into a place of worship was not limited to the Sabarimala case.

It had said such restrictions were there with regard to the entry of Muslim women into mosques and dargahs, and Parsi women, married to non-Parsi men, from entering the holy fire place of an agiary.

It set out seven questions of law to be examined by the larger bench. They include the interplay between freedom of religion under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, need to delineate the expression “constitutional morality”, the extent to which courts can enquire into particular religious practices, meaning of sections of Hindus under Article 25 and whether “essential religious practices” of a denomination or section thereof are protected under Article 26.

While the five-judge bench unanimously agreed to refer religious issues to a larger bench, it gave a 3:2 split verdict on petitions seeking a review of the apex court’s September 2018 decision, allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala.

A majority verdict by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and justices A M Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra decided to keep the pleas seeking a review of its decision regarding entry of women into the shrine pending and said restrictions on women at religious places were not limited to Sabarimala alone and were prevalent in other religions as well.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sc-to-frame-issues-about-gender-inequality-at-religious-places.html
154,03-2-20,Open display of equipments raises security concerns,"Open display of protection parameters and resistance of personal protection equipment like bullet-resistant vests and headgears besides armoured troop carriers in billboards and literature for the upcoming Defence Expo at Lucknow has raised alarm bells ringing in the security establishment as such specifics can potentially compromise the safety of security personnel in counter-terror and anti-Naxal operations.

“Showcasing vital and sensitive information related to protection systems should be stopped forthwith and necessary directions be issued by Defence Ministry that only the finished products should be displayed without dishing out specific details of protection level,” a serving official in a lead counter-terror force said..

Intelligence insiders conceded that information collected from such expositions by the sleeper cells of terror organisations and over ground workers of Naxal outfits have in the past been exploited by the insidious groups to target the troops.

The billboards and literature of the defence equipment manufacturers display the level of armour resistance from different kinds of bullet fires and area weapons like grenade and the impact of firing from different distance. Terror groups as also Naxal outfits can suitably strategise to nullify the resistance provided by the armour by tweaking the distance of their fire on the target or increasing quantity and quality of explosives for ambushing the protective gears and vehicles of the troops, another official engaged in counter-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir.

During the last Defence Expo in Chennai, Laboratory reports of reputed Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory (TBRL) and Gujarat State Forensic Univerity were displayed by the private players engaged in manufacturing and marketing defence systems, including personal protection gears and troop carriers.

Government regulations prohibit displaying specific details of sensitive items even while issuing tenders for procurement of such items. The regulations clearly postulate that such details should not be displayed on the websites or otherwise in keeping with national interest.

Strategic interests of the security forces should not be undermined by the private players in the Defence industry or the Defence Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) or Ordinance Factory Board (OFB) to further their commercial interests as they can defeat the whole purpose of acquisition of protective equipment and vehicles, another senior official of an Central armed force said, adding complete confidentiality should be maintained while dealing with such equipment or systems.

Any protection system or equipment whose vital details have been leaked in open domain by the equipment manufacturers or suppliers should not be inducted in the forces as they can be compromised by the inimical elements, counter-terrorism expert Dr Rituraj Mate said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/open-display-of-equipments-raises-security-concerns.html

This connection has brought them together to set up India Climate Collaborative (ICC), a network to solve the country’s climate crisis with the support of the local as well as international climate community.

“Our collective leadership through the ICC will indicate to the world that Indian philanthropy is ready to be a leader in climate action,” Ratan N Tata, Chairman, Tata Trusts, said, commenting on the launch, in a statement here.

The ICC seeks to build a collaborative platform for diverse voices, innovative solutions, and collective investments, inspiring and connect governments, businesses, impact investors, research institutions, scientists, and civil society to work together.

“Scientific research tells us that the next decade will be critical in dealing with the global climate crisis,” said Anand Mahindra, Chairman, Mahindra Group, as per the statement. “It is clear that the world cannot continue to pursue a business-as-usual approach and nobody can solve the problem on their own… Together we will find solutions that will make climate action effective and impactful.” Nadir B Godrej, Managing Director of Godrej Industries added, “There is a lot that businesses can do, and are doing, to tackle the climate emergency at a cost that is not significantly high. Government can playa role in providing incentives and disincentives to ensure lower carbon emissions. We have to look at localised solutions that can solve global problems, and this will need businesses, governments, academia, and individuals to work together to identify and scale up solutions.”

157,03-2-20,Former AIADMK MP Sasikala Pushpa joins BJP,"Expelled AIADMK leader and Rajya Sabha member Sasikala Pushpa Ramaswamy joined BJP on Sunday. Sasikala is among the Rajya Sabha members whose term comes to an end this April. She joined in the presence of the BJP’s national secretary, P Muralidhar Rao, and former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan. Between 2011 and 2014 she served as Thoothukudi’s Mayor following which she served as an AIADMK MP in the Rajya Sabha.

At the press conference at the BJP office, Rao made the announcement of Pushpa’s joining, saying it would be advantageous for the party in Tamil Nadu and described her as a “very aggressive, vocal leader in Tamil Nadu”. “With the joining of Sasikala, the party’s capacity to fight the coming Assembly election will definitely gain further advantage. Sasikala is a Rajya Sabha member and she has been a very aggressive, vocal leader in Tamil Nadu. Coming from south Tamil Nadu, she has also been a mayor of Thoothukudi, a port town, and has worked as the chief of the AIADMK’s women’s wing for the State ,” he said.

BJP’s decision to induct Sasikala into the party highlights its efforts to strengthen its base in Tamil Nadu, ahead of the Assembly polls in the southern state next year. Despite its rise across the country under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the party has been unable to make much of a mark in the Dravidian state so far.

Following an altercation with DMK MP Tiruchi Siva at the Delhi airport in 2016, it was believed that Sasikala Pushpa was expelled from AIADMK. Subsequently, the then AIADMK supremo and former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa had expelled her from the party.

“In Tamil Nadu, the BJP is gaining in strength day by day. Our membership and penetration have increased in every district of the state. The appeal of Narendra Modi is enhancing the party’s spread.

“A number of leaders, who have worked in different parties, have been joining the BJP and expressing their willingness to strengthen it under the leadership of Modiji,” Rao said.

Welcoming Sasikala into the BJP, Radhakrishnan, the former Union minister of state in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Shipping, said it will strengthen the party in Tamil Nadu.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/former-aiadmk-mp-sasikala-pushpa-joins-bjp.html

The iconic garden at the heart of the President’s Estate will be opened to public from February 5, Superintendent, President’s Gardens, PN Joshi announced on Sunday.

Over 10,000 Tulip bulbs, 138 types of roses and 70 different kinds of about 5,000 seasonal flowers will welcome the visitors to the garden.

Known for its exotic and rare rose varieties, the garden this year boasts of “Grace de Monaco” rose, which was planted by Prince Albert II of Monaco last year.

Part of the fragrant exhibit are variety of roses named after eminent people, including former president Pranab Mukherjee, Mother Teresa, former US president John F Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth and first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Apart from the roses commemorating renowned personalities, there will be roses with unconventional names as “Christian Dior”, “American Heritage”, “First Prize”, “Kiss of Fire” and “Double Delight”.

The visitors can also see some of the very rare types of roses such as “Green Rose” with thin and long green petals, “Oklahoma” and “Bonne Nuit” with their almost black texture, and “Blue Moon” and “Lady X” with a definite blue hue to them.

The garden is also covered by a variety of bulbous flowers like “Narcissus”, “Dahlia”, “Sparaxis”, “Ranunculus”, “Hyacianth” and “Asiatic Lily”.

The teacup-shaped Tulips are another attraction at the Mughal Gardens, especially “Jammu Pink” Tulip, which stands low yet distinguished with its rich pink petals edged with white, giving it a shiny texture.

The Mughal Gardens saw 5.18 lakh visitors last year and has received 3-6 lakh visitors every year since 2003. “The large number of visitors also pose some issues when they don’t adhere to guidance and let their children pluck flowers or create disturbance for others,” Joshi told PTI. “There will be security, barricades where necessary and our garden staff will keep an eye on anyone ruining the plants. It’s a difficult task to maintain the garden if we don’t take care, it takes a long time to bring it to its original shape,” he added.

Inspired by the Mughal Gardens of Jammu and Kashmir, the garden around the Taj Mahal as well as Persian and Indian miniature paintings, the Mughal Gardens was designed by Edwin Lutyens and includes many elements of British garden art.

162,03-2-20,"3.8% fiscal deficit target looks ambitious, says SBI research","The revised 3.8 per cent fiscal deficit for FY20 looks ambitious as it is based on projected 18 per cent rise in tax collections against a paltry 5.1 per cent higher realisaition so far, and around Rs 65,000 crore mop-up through disinvestment in the last two months of the current fiscal, SBI Research said in a report on Sunday.

The revised deficit target is propped on the belief that the divestment will fetch Rs 65,000 crore through the next two months. As against the Rs 1.05 lakh crore budgeted target, the divestment proceeds has been one of the lowest in recent years at a paltry Rs 17,800 crore.

“After adjusting for the expenditure rationalisation of around Rs 88,000 crore, the revised fiscal deficit for FY20 comes to around Rs 63,086 crore over the budgeted numbers.

“We are studying the details, and will reach out to the government for clarifications. We hope the tax regime is simple and uniform so that millions of small and medium businesses can go online, digitise their operations and continue to contribute to growing the economy,” an Amazon India spokesperson said in response to an e-mailed query.

Flipkart also said it was going through the proposal.

“We are studying the details, particularly how it impacts the MSMEs and Sellers on our marketplace platform. We will discuss further with our seller partners, and engage with government and other stakeholders in due course,” Flipkart said in its response.

The government on Saturday proposed a new levy of 1 per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) on e-commerce transactions, a move that could increase burden on sellers on such platforms.

“In order to widen and deepen the tax net by bringing participants of e-commerce (sellers) within tax net, it is proposed to insert a new section 194-O in the Act so as to provide for a new levy of TDS at the rate of one per cent,” according to Budget 2020-21 documents.

The amendments will take effect from April 1, 2020.

164,03-2-20,India's manufacturing sector activity hits near 8-year high in Jan on sharp demand recovery,"The country's manufacturing sector activity climbed to a near eight-year high in January, driven by sharp rise in new business orders amid a rebound in demand conditions that led to rise in production and hiring activity, a monthly survey said on Monday.

Following a sharp improvement in demand, January saw growth of new business, output, exports, input buying and employment. At the same time, business sentiment strengthened and there were softer rises in both input costs and output charges.

The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI rose from 52.7 in December to 55.3 in January, its highest level in just under eight years.

""Manufacturing sector growth in India continued to strengthen in January, with operating conditions improving at a pace not seen in close to eight years,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit.

This is the 30th consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

Companies noted the strongest upturn in new business intakes for over five years, which they attributed to better underlying demand and greater client requirements.

The rise in total sales was supported by strengthening demand from external markets, as noted by the fastest increase in new export orders since November 2018.

On the employment front, hiring activity improved in January, with firms increasing employment at the quickest rate in close to seven-and-a-half years. New business growth and projects in the pipeline were cited as the main reasons for job creation.

Meanwhile, Indian manufacturers were more upbeat about the year-ahead outlook for production. Optimism stemmed from forecasts of better demand, new client wins, marketing efforts, capacity expansion and new product releases.

""To complete the good news, there was also an uptick in business confidence as survey participants expect buoyant demand, new client wins, advertising and product diversification to boost output in the year ahead,"" Lima said.

On the price front, there were slower increases in both input costs and output charges, the survey noted.

""Companies also benefited from subdued cost pressures, which enabled them to restrict increases in their fees to some extent,"" Lima said.

The Minister said the Government in 2015 had issued ‘Framework for timely detection, reporting, investigation relating to large value bank frauds’ for PSBs to deal with suspected frauds involving sums of money in excess of 50 crore.

It had also instituted wide-ranging structural and procedural reforms through the framework and other steps to check fraudulent banking practices. She said systematic and comprehensive checking, including legacy stock of PSBs’ non-banking assets (NPAs), for frauds under the framework has been taken note of by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its Financial Stability Report in December 2019, where it has observed that this has helped unearth frauds perpetrated over a number of years.

“This is reflected in the increased amount involved in frauds of 1 lakh and above, reported by scheduled commercial banks and select financial institutions, from 23,934 crore in the financial year 2016-17 to 41,167 crore in 2017-18, 71,543 crore in 2018-19, and 1,13,374 crore in the first half of the current financial year,” she said.

The Minister further said that while improved “detection” and “reporting” has increased the reported amount involved in recent years, the comprehensive steps taken to check bank frauds have resulted in the amount involved by year of occurrence of fraud showing a declining trend.

She said amount involved in frauds that took place in the reporting year reduced sharply from 38,548 crore in 2016-17 to 16,084 crore in 2017-18, increased slightly to 18,893 crore in 2018-19, and declined again to 3,010 crore in the first half of the current financial year.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/banks--select-financial-institutions-report-frauds-involving-1-13l-cr-in-h1-of-fy20--says-sitharaman.html

The Philippines on Sunday reported the first death outside China from the deadly virus that has spread to 25 countries, including India, taking the total toll to 305.

The victim, a 44-year-old Chinese man, was the companion of a 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived in the Philippines on January 21 from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

So far over 140 coronavirus cases have been reported from abroad, including India where a second case of virus was reported from Kerala on Sunday.

By the end of Saturday, a total of 304 people had died of the disease in the country, China’s National Health Commission said.

The state-run CGTN reported that there were 14,411 confirmed cases of virus. However, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said that the virus has infected 14,562 people.

The commission said 19,544 people were suspected of being infected with the virus of which the condition of the 2,110 patients remained severe.

Chinese health experts have been saying that the casualties will increase sharply for the next two weeks before they start declining.

This is so because millions of travellers especially those from Wuhan and Hubei province who travelled to China and abroad during the New Year holidays are returning home.

A top Chinese official said that about five million residents of Wuhan have travelled out of the virus-hit city before it was locked down on January 23.

China is bringing back by charter flights hundreds of its citizens who had travelled abroad during holidays. They are directly being flown to Wuhan.

The commission also highlighted that number of virus affected patients are recovering, saying that 328 people have been discharged.

Since the virus is transmitted human-to-human, over 1.63 lakh close contacts had been traced of which 1.37 lakh are still under medical observation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China has intensified measures to contain the virus by isolating the patients. Wuhan health authorities announced that people suspected of infection will be isolated in designated areas effective immediately.

Wenzhou city in Zhejiang Province regulated that only one family member is allowed to step out of the house every other day for grocery shopping from Saturday to February 8, amid efforts to contain the epidemic, state-run Global Times reported.

The National Health Commission also directed that bodies of coronavirus victims should be cremated close by and immediately. Burials or transfer of the bodies are not allowed, the Commission said.

168,03-2-20,LIC public offer likely in 2nd half of FY21: Finance Secy,"Listing of insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) may be done in the second half of the next financial year, Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget 2020-21 on Saturday proposed to sell a part of government stake in LIC through an initial public offer next fiscal.

There are a number of processes which have to be followed and some legislative changes would also be required for the listing of LIC, Kumar said.

“We will follow the extant procedure for listing and for other things including the legislative changes it requires in consultation with the Ministry of Law and that process we already started ... Listing in the second half of FY21 seems logical,” he said.

Listing of LIC will help bring in greater transparency, public participation and also deepen the equity market, he told PTI in an interaction.

Asked about the quantum of dilution, Kumar said, it could be 10 per cent but no decision has been taken so far.

Later speaking to media, the finance minister assuaged concerns of policyholders of any breach of sovereign guarantee as ownership stays with the Government.

“We have only said an IPO (initial public offer). We have not given complete ownership to somebody,” she said.

The Government aims to garner Rs 90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake dilution in IDBI Bank in the next fiscal out of total disinvestment target of Rs 2.10 lakh crore.

The government currently owns 100 per cent in LIC, while it holds around 46.5 per cent stake in IDBI Bank.

“Listing of companies on stock exchanges disciplines a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created. The Government now proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC by way of Initial Public Offer (IPO),” the Finance Minister had said in her Budget speech.

Market participants are quite bullish about LIC and said it could be “IPO of the decade” akin to the Saudi Aramco listing.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lic-public-offer-likely-in-2nd-half-of-fy21--finance-secy.html

Of the total allocation, maximum of Rs 75,000 crore has been allocated for the government’s flagship scheme PM-Kisan for the 2020-21 fiscal, followed by Rs 15,695 crore for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Rs 2,000 crore for Price Stabilisation Scheme (PSS).

That apart, the government has allocated Rs 600 crore for promoting farm mechanisation, Rs 500 crore each for PM-Asha scheme and setting up of 10,000 Farmers Producers Companies (FPOs), while Rs 220 crore for PM Kisan Samman Nidhi (farmers pension scheme) for the next fiscal.

The allocation for the ambitious PM-Kisan scheme, under which Rs 6,000 is given in three equal instalments to each beneficiary farmer annually, has been kept at Rs 75,000 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal, higher than Rs 54,370.15 crore provided in the revised estimate for this year.

The allocation has been trimmed for the current year from the initial estimate of Rs 75,000 crore in view of implementation hurdles and lack of interest shown by some states like West Bengal.

In case of PMFBY, the government has allocated higher funds at Rs 15,695 crore for the next fiscal compared to the revised estimate of Rs 13,640.85 crore for the current fiscal.

For agriculture and research development, the government has provided Rs 8,362.58 crore budget for the 2020-21 fiscal, up from Rs 7,846.17 crore in the revised estimate.

Realising the potential of the allied farm activities like dairy can help provide supplementary income to farmers, the Government has increased the allocation for Animal Husbandry, Livestock, Dairy and Fishery Ministry to Rs 4,114.13 crore for the next fiscal from the revised estimate of Rs 3,490 crore.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/govt-provides-30--higher-budget-allocation-for-agriculture-sector.html

171,03-2-20,Stock market’s reaction on Budget surprising: Niti Aayog vice chairman,"Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar expressed surprise over the stock market reacting negatively on the Budget proposals, saying investors probably expected some big bang reforms and ignored the initiatives towards investment and growth.

Kumar in an interview to PTI said the Budget has done nothing wrong, and it has “ticked all the boxes”.

Giving a thumbs down to the Budget, the market benchmark Sensex logged its biggest single-day plunge in more than a decade, wiping out Rs 3.46 lakh crore investor wealth.

“I am actually quite surprised by the market’s reactions yesterday, going down 1,000 points. I was trying to understand why did that happen,” he wondered.

Kumar added that “... The Budget does nothing wrong, it has got nothing anti-private investment or anti-private sector or anti-growth, the Budget is ticking all the boxes”.

Probably, the market was expecting some big bang reforms that are associated with huge push for consumption as was witnessed in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008.

“So my own thought was that market expected so called big bang reforms and by big bang reforms, normally everybody understands in India, a huge impetus for consumption. And I think the best example of that was in 2008 Budget which preceded the Lehman Brothers crisis,” he said.

Pointing out that the UPA-1 gave lot of sops in 2008 Budget because elections were due, Kumar said it had resulted in ballooning of the fiscal deficit to 6 per cent in 2009 from 2.5 per cent.

“If the market had expected that kind of consumption boost without any regard to fiscal discipline, it was not possible,” he said adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very clear that Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) target should not be breached.

“Therefore, if you notice, we used 0.5 per cent escape clause (under FRBM) and remained within that,” Kumar stressed. The Niti Aayog vice chairman said the Budget has given a big boost to the investment.

“Many steps are announced to improve the investment sentiments.. Both foreign and domestic,” he said.

Asked if it is still possible to achieve $5 trillion target by 2024-25, the eminent economist said it is not an unreal goal and will be achieved.

“In the next 5 years, there is no reason to believe that you can’t achieve that unless rupee depreciates out of the blue etc. If you do 6-6.5 per cent (growth) now(2020-21), and jump up to 7-8 per cent (growth) in remaining four years, you will achieve that, that’s not an unreal target,” he said. Moreover, Kumar said, the Prime Minister has mentioned it as a inspirational target, more to drive the people together.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/stock-market---s-reaction-on-budget-surprising--niti-aayog-vice-chairman.html

173,03-2-20,Huawei 5G troubles to test Nordic competitors’ bandwidth,"Tougher UK and EU rules restricting 5G network supplier Huawei should be a golden opportunity for competitors Nokia and Ericsson, but the companies may struggle to meet the increased demand, analysts warned.

On Tuesday, Britain imposed a 35 percent cap on the role of “high-risk vendors” in building the country’s next-generation communications network, over security concerns. The change will hit Chinese giant Huawei, whom critics accuse of being ultimately under the control of Beijing, an allegation it strongly denies.

The EU followed by releasing guidelines urging member states to avoid dependency on “high risk” suppliers, though the bloc stopped short of naming Huawei or calling for an outright ban. On the face of it, the biggest beneficiaries from this week’s announcements appear to be the Chinese firm’s two largest competitors, Nokia and Ericsson.

“BT in the UK thinks it’s going to cost it ?500 million ($660 million) to switch out Huawei, so a good chunk of that will now be going to Nokia and Ericsson,” analyst Matthew Howett of Assembly Research told AFP.

On Friday, Nokia welcomed the EU’s guidelines and commitment to cybersecurity, saying in a statement that “5G starts and ends with trust and security.” Ericsson greeted the “comprehensive approach” agreed by the EU countries. “Ericsson stands ready to support this process to ensure a high level of protection for European citizens and business”.

But industry watchers claim that fulfilling the increased demand left by market leader Huawei may not be straightforward.

Huawei is widely seen as providing the most advanced 5G for the super-fast data transfers, necessary for self-driving cars and remote-controlled robots in factories or operating theatres.

“A discussion needs to take place about Huawei’s perceived leadership position, and how ready Nokia and Ericsson are to step up to that over the next three year period,” Howett said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/huawei-5g-troubles-to-test-nordic-competitors----bandwidth.html

175,03-2-20,Herbal remedies for virus spark debate in China,"A claim by Chinese scientists that a liquid made with honeysuckle and flowering plants could help fight the deadly coronavirus has sparked frenzied buying of the traditional medicine, but doubts quickly emerged.

As the death toll from the SARS-like pathogen sweeping the country continues to rise, shoppers have swamped pharmacies in search of “Shuanghuanglian”. The rush came after influential state media outlet Xinhua reported Friday that the esteemed Chinese Academy of Sciences had found the concoction “can inhibit” the virus.

Videos shared online showed long lines of people in surgical masks lining up at night outside drug stores, purportedly in hope of snapping up the product, despite official advice that people avoid public gatherings to prevent infection.

It quickly sold out both online and at brick-and-mortar stores, but responses to the remedy’s supposed efficacy have ranged from enthusiasm to scepticism on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media platform.

And state media sounded a more cautionary note on Saturday, with broadcaster CCTV publishing an interview with Zhang Boli, one of the researchers leading outbreak containment efforts, who warned of potential side effects from the medicine. The People’s Daily newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said experts advised against taking traditional remedies without professional guidance.

But the claim comes as Beijing looks to incorporate traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into its nationwide fight against the virus, which has killed more than 300 people and infected over 14,000 in the country. On Sunday the Philippines reported the first death outside of China.

Researchers at the state-run academy, a top government think tank, are also studying the potential use of a plant commonly known as Japanese knotweed to alleviate symptoms.

The National Health Commission on Tuesday said TCM practitioners were among nearly 6,000 reinforcement medical personnel being sent to Wuhan in Hubei province, ground zero of the outbreak.

The strategy has reignited fierce and long-running debate about the efficacy of TCM, which has a history going back 2,400 years and remains popular in modern-day China.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/herbal-remedies-for-virus-spark-debate-in-china.html
176,03-2-20,Dozens in Lebanon protest Trump’s West Asia plan,"Dozens protested near the US embassy in Lebanon Sunday against US President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan.

The demonstrators, both Palestinian refugees and Lebanese, chanted slogans and flew flags as security forces blocked off a road to the diplomatic compound.

Some protesters tried to dismantle a razor-wire barrier but no major clashes took place, an AFP reporter said.

“The ‘deal of the century’ shall not pass,” read a huge banner in the colours of the Palestinian flag, referring to the plan unveiled by Trump last Tuesday.

A call to protest circulating on social media dubbed the plan “the deal of shame”.

“I came here to defend my rights and those of my children as Palestinians,” said Etab, a Palestinian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley.

“We will not accept handing over our land,” she told AFP.

Palestinians began taking refuge in Lebanon with the creation of Israel in 1948, setting up camps that have since transformed into bustling urban districts. Abdullah Mahmud, an 18-year-old Palestinian, criticised the “failed” plan.

178,03-2-20,...And the ship sailed,"While Ratna Chadha, chairperson and co-founder, Tirun, talks about the status of the cruise industry, Apple Woo, director of Asia, Celebrity Cruises, shares about India’s contribution in the overall market. By Sakshi Sharma

What would you say about the status of cruise tourism in India?

Ratna: I with my husband pioneered the concept of tourism in 1993. There were only 200 people then, who had sailed on any cruise ship with an Indian address. Things were very different then, not only in India but in the international scenario as well. We might think that we have come a long way now but it’s not in terms of the number of passengers that have cruised until now. Only 2,20,000 passengers have cruised out for vacations. It is quite evident that the industry is very nascent and underdeveloped. We haven’t even scratched the tip of the iceberg. But having said that, we understand that there’s a huge potential. Indians have a high standard of living, we have the ability to pay higher rates and want to experience the best, especially during travelling.

The cruise industry hasn’t yet flourished in India. Why do you think so?

Ratna: This is because international brands are not represented well in our country. When you see a Mercedes on an Indian road, you would want to buy that. When you have a four season hotel, a Sheraton or the Hyatts all over the world, you will want to stay in the same hotels because there is membership, royalty programmes and you are familiar with the brands. It is very important for people to get familiar with the cruise lines. The industry want to come to India but is not able to because it has its own issues. This is the biggest challenge.

We have a vast coastline, if we clear the waters for international cruise lines to come why wouldn’t they come? They can’t keep plying in the same area. How much can North America or Europe allow? Those destinations are already covered. They have to move the equipment because these are mobile assets. And the cruise lines can move them to different parts of the world on the basis on seasonality. But we are too occupied with our own challenges to let them in.

What steps need to be taken to help the industry grow?

Ratna: The only way to up the quotient or bring India on the tourism map is to welcome the international cruise lines into the country because we don’t have the capacity to build our own ships at the moment. These are already readymade ships. All we have to do is to include India as a part of their itinerary. The business environment also has to be such that it’s viable for them to come.

What are your expectations from the Government of India?

Ratna: The government is positive. They have understood the potential of the industry. They need to use the 7,600 km of our coastline. If the ocean cruising transportation develops then the internal waters and river cruising will also develop. Our own heritage sites will gain an impetus.

How is India’s economic decline affecting the industry?

Ratna: As various businesses and exports are down, it is impacting the industry largely. For tourism industry or hotels, it is very important for the environment to facilitate their business. After all, tourism works on disposable income. And ours is such a small market. If the share market is down and people don’t have a disposable income, we won’t be able to do well. It is quite obvious that when onions are Rs 100 a kg then how will people think about planning a holiday. Even the upper segment is holding back. It is high time we get India up and going. The sooner we do it, the better it is for us as more cruise lines will invest.

How can the cruise industry generate employment opportunities?

Ratna: It is a matter of concern that there are lot of young people graduating every year. Where are they going to go? The cruise industry will have a multiplier effect on the economy as the employment will increase and hotels will make money. Heritage sites and domestic tourism will also get a huge impetus as we offer multi destinations. I was also on the task force instituted by the Ministry of Tourism and shipping to bring India on the tourism map.

We also need to focus on the fact that it is a mobile industry, our equipment can be moved. This acts as an advantage for us. You can’t move a hotel or a brick and mortar thing but a cruise can be. This feature helps us to switch to a different destination if there are any unfavourable conditions in any destination, which in turn will always facilitate employment opportunities in different locations.

What is the overall growth of celebrity cruises?

Apple: We have seen a significant growth over the past three years. Even now we see huge potential because of our new ship. We expect a 35 per cent growth in the sector, especially where the ship is sailing in, the Euro as well as in the Western and Eastern Mediterranean.

What are the emerging industry trends for 2020?

Ratna: There will be newer destination and ships, very high on design. There will also be more of variety, something to suit everybody’s budget. Entertainment, spa, wine is open for everybody. The broadway shows are not ordinary ones and they are even cost effective. Now there are even no language barrier or food issues on a new ship, Indian foods are there on the ship. The only challenge is that India has many states and each state has its own requirement. We are hopefully going to personalise that too as more Indians start travelling. At the moment, we have common Indian selection as Indian cuisine is getting popular, especially the vegetarian food. I see other nationalities pouncing on our palate. Infact, 60 per cent of our staff are Indian because we have trained professionals.

Now the cruise lines are also investing huge amount of money to build newer ships. We have got a ship making a debut this year in April — Celebrity Apex. We have also planned to introduce new ships, atleast for the next two years.

What was the overall scenario of the industry in 2019? What is India’s contribution in the overall market?

Ratna: It was not a very good year because there were a lot of challenges in the country. Elections took place, couple of airlines crippled, economy slowed down, automobile industry was hit adversely. However, the previous year was a rocking one. And that’s what we would base ourselves on.

Apple: Overall contribution for Asia Pacific stands at 10 per cent. India would stand a good five per cent for it.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---and-the-ship-sailed-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/---and-the-ship-sailed.html
179,03-2-20,Invest in knowledge,"Students in Khodasgaon village joined hands to make sure that families don’t neglect their children’s education during seasonal migration. By Dipak Kulkarni

Archana Vijay Padvi from Khodasgaon village, Nandurbar, is in 10th grade. She studied in the local Zila Parishad School up to the seventh grade and went on to study further at the Kamla Nehru Kanya Shala in Nandurbar. Her parents have studied only up to second grade and hence, Archana is the first generation in her family to push the boundaries and go for higher education. Going beyond her own aspirations, during the last three years, Archana has encouraged, if not pushed, more than 40 families in Nandurbar to ensure that their children’s education doesn’t suffer because of seasonal migration.

More than 70 per cent of the Nandurbar district comprises tribal communities. With about 2,000 hamlets and more than 900 villages, the district still experiences severe systemic failures in the education system. Sure, government has invested in education there. If one was to count, there are more than 2,000 schools in the district — including Zila Parishad schools, boarding schools, Ashram schools, and middle level schools. However, there aren’t enough means to earn a livelihood, with no big industry in the district. Therefore, agricultural labour is the main source of income. Locally, wages are extremely low but if people of Nandurbar migrate, they stand a chance to earn slightly better wages. Therefore, this district has been linked to large-scale seasonal migration. Thousands of families in the district migrate to the nearby state of Gujarat for a period of six months after Dussehra and sometimes even to Kolhapur or Solapur in Maharashtra. To understand complexity of the story, one needs to understand the complexity of this distress migration.

A family which doesn’t have enough money will pick up an advanced loan from a money-lender, who also happens to be a labour contractor. This money is raised for marriage, death and sickness in the family. Owing to abject poverty, this money generally cannot be paid back. The contractor then asks the family to act as agricultural labour for the next six months. There is a condition that their loan’s repayment will be wage compensation. The contractor then provides labour for various companies and sugar factories. That’s where these labourers get their jobs — sugar cutting being the largest source. Somehow, there is no written agreement or payment slips and the contractor always claims of even bigger dues. This cycle has been going on for years. Workers and their families migrate for this purpose. These migrant families, who travel right after Dussehra, also take their children along. Children miss school for more than six months. Therefore, children do not enjoy education and automatically drop out.

Archana worked to ensure that no child from such a migrant family dropped out of school. In the local context, she is one of the most educated girls from the village, where out of 300 families, only two people have gone for graduation. While one of them got an agricultural studies degree and a job in the respective department, only one girl has completed 12th grade. With Archana’s intervention, more than 40 children are set to go to Nandurbar to complete their ninth and 10th standard, an unprecedented occurrence in this area.

So how exactly did this happen? A local NGO and UNICEF worked hand in hand to dissuade families from taking children with them for migration. District coordinator Sachin Dada spoke to the children. He took two girls and three boys to Nandurbar for a one-day training. Along with Gram Panchayat’s cooperation, the children, who acted as local advocacy leaders, led efforts to ensure that the education of the children will continue. Archana took the lead in this. She went from house to house to address families before Dussehra. Being a small area, everyone knows each other. She said, “You go to Gujarat for work but don’t take your children along.” Villagers questioned as to who would take the responsibility of the child in their absence. Archana encouraged children’s grandparents to take up the responsibility and ensure that children have maximum attendance in school. She told families, “Let them learn. You have no money in your pocket, so you can go. But how long will this work? How will the family go ahead if the children don’t receive their education properly? You work because you haven’t learned. If they learn, they will be sahabs one day.”

Gradually, her work had a positive impact on the village. Now without exception, all the children from class 1 to 10 go to school. Around 40 students are on their way to Nandurbar for post-seventh grade education. Archana and her friends have also campaigned for a bus service from Nandurbar to Khodasgaon. The bus plies for five days a week. However, children still miss school on Saturdays because there is no means of commuting.

Archana Padvi has also worked to promote the use of toilets and de-addiction from tobacco and alcohol in her village. Slowly, she’s finding success in those endeavours too.

180,03-2-20,In search of universal truth,"We need to create a religion of spiritual love and brotherhood that can inspire men, women and children to build a new world full of peace, amity and spirit, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

The ongoing communal or religious disharmony in various parts of the world reminds us that there has been a vast discrepancy between what religions have preached and what most of their followers have actually practised.

Going by the frequent confrontation happening between two east Asian countries as well as unresolved conflicts between two gulf nations, brings one to the conclusion that religious preachers and believers have done more harm to the meaning of religion than its opponents. Blind faith, meaningless and tiresome rituals, needless physical austerities, dryness and dogmatism, unbridgeable gulf between religious preachers on such vital topics as true identity of god, their rigidity of views, narrowness of outlook and intolerance are some factors responsible for repulsion in people’s minds. As a result, religion has become uninspiring. Though there is no dearth of temples, mosques, synagogs, vihars and churches in the East as well as in the West, the number of devotees visiting these places has considerably dwindled, which clearly indicates that religion has increasingly been losing its appeal.

Off lately, it has come into observation of the common man that most religious preachers do not have any reliable experience about god nor is there any unanimity among them even on fundamental subjects such as the soul. They can neither explain the religious truth logically nor inspire others from their own practical examples. All this has naturally led people to distance themselves from religion as well as spirituality. This, however, does not mean that religion has lost its utility or is unnecessary. If religion loses its influence on the minds of scientists, politicians and men in general as it has been losing, the world will soon face an unprecedented catastrophe.

It was not very long ago when Swami Vivekananda reflected on the concept of universal religion and its necessity in society. He realised the nature of man, which is making the world look for more in the quest of reaching god. Therefore, the world is today expecting a religion, which is acceptable to all, is universal in its scope and teachings and which works as a unifying force. The need of the hour is to have a religion of spiritual love and brotherhood that can inspire men, women and children to build a new world full of peace, amity and spirit.

Looking at various problems in society, it is clear that spirituality can tackle them with ease. For instance, problems like over-population, eve-teasing, criminal assault and adultery, are a result of man’s desperation and lust. Economic exploitation, bribery, adulteration, etc., are a result of man’s greed. All wars and acts of violence are due to man’s anger. Many countries are backward in the comity of nations because of sloth or laziness. All these basic evils are recognised by religion but there are a number of ways to eradicate these only if man cares. In fact, it has been found and thoroughly researched that easy yoga is the only solution which can eradicate man’s mental pollution. And if man does not follow spirituality and wisdom, purity and yoga even during such a critical time, gradually, a number of wars and nuclear weapons will clear the dominating evil in this corrupt society and destroy the world. Now its up to us which way we choose.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/in-search-of-universal-truth.html
181,03-2-20,Time to take a chill pill,"Plants in winters need to bank a certain number of hours in chilling temperatures

Outdoor plants in cold climate need to bank a certain number of hours being chilly during the winter for their buds to awaken in the coming months. And that’s not the same thing as being cold. To a plant, “chilly” generally means a temperature between about 32 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

Lack of enough chilling time is why it might be a waste to try to force forsythia blossoms indoors now. The bushes have been exposed to frigid temperatures but not enough chilling temperatures. Spring-flowering bulbs also need some chilling before they will flower, which is why we keep them in a cool spot for a few weeks before bringing them indoors for forcing. And lack of chilling is why you can’t grow most apple varieties in Florida. Without chilling, the trees either don’t leaf out or they just cough forth a few, low-quality fruits.

Once any plant has accumulated enough hours in its chilling “bank,” it will grow as soon as temperatures warm.

HOW MUCH CHILL DO THEY WANT?

Plants vary in just how many hours of chilling they need before they’ll awaken, with most needing between 500 and 2,000 hours. Plants originating in colder climates are usually at the higher end of this range. Forsythia hails from eastern Asia, and the yellow blossoms of a plant originating in the southern part of that range would welcome spring here earlier in the season than would a plant originating in the northern part of that range.

The need for less chilling is not always an asset: With fruit trees, earlier blossoms are not welcome because they are more likely to get frosted, and frosted blossoms don’t go on to become fruits.

Chilling requirements are not directly related to latitude in all cases. High-altitude northern plants have low chilling requirements because temperatures there stay reliably cold through winter, and then growth needs to begin quickly for the ensuing short season. Conversely, high chilling requirements where winter temperatures fluctuate frequently keeps plants adapted to those regions from starting growth too soon.

EFFECTS MAY VARY

Chilling can influence how a plant performs in your garden. Imagine a gardener in Portland, Oregon, who is growing the same variety of kousa dogwood as another gardener in Vermont. Buds at the tip of any plant’s branches need less chilling than do buds lower down, so where climates have mild winters, as in Portland, tip buds start growing first, as soon as their chilling requirement is met. Getting an earlier start, those terminal shoots can suppress, to some degree, growth of buds lower down along the stems.

In Vermont, however, frigid weather holds back tip buds even after their chilling requirements are satisfied. Once weather warms in spring, all the buds grow pretty much together. So, a kousa dogwood in Vermont will become bushier than the same plant grown in Portland.

For the same reason, frigid winters coax particularly spectacular spring flower shows from trees and shrubs. In Vermont, flower buds on many different plants that have been chilled by midwinter sit tight waiting for warm weather. When warmth finally arrives, all those buds burst open almost at once.

Portland, on the other hand, gets weeks and weeks of bloom, the mild winter weather letting each tree’s or shrub’s flowers awaken as its chilling requirement is met.

We can’t really do much about chilling of outdoor plants. We can’t even be too exact in figuring out just when to bring branches or bulbs in for forcing or how far south we can grow a McIntosh apple tree. That 32-to-45-degree definition of chilling varies somewhat from plant to plant, and warm temperatures in winter can take hours out of the chilling bank.

One part of plants is unaffected by chilling: the roots. They will grow whenever temperatures are above about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is why mulching in fall, which keeps the ground warmer longer, is good for plants. More root growth makes happier plants.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/time-to-take-a-chill-pill-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/time-to-take-a-chill-pill.html

“We ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum for those seeking to flee China,” Pompeo said at a press appearance with Kazakh foreign minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi.

“Protect human dignity, just do what is right,” Pompeo said.

Pompeo was meeting top officials in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan as he rounds off a five-nation tour in two countries where Russia and China enjoy privileged interests.

His visit to the Kazakh capital Nur-Sultan also saw him meet with Kazakhs who say their family members are detained in Xinjiang, where over a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities are believed to have been incarcerated as part of an unprecedented security crackdown in the region.

Kazakhstan has allowed several ethnic Kazakhs of Chinese citizenship who fled the region to stay in the country, but has not given any of them asylum — a reluctance local activists attribute to Chinese pressure.

Pompeo also commended Kazakhstan’s “quick action” over the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 in mainland China and beyond, forcing governments around the world to take drastic measures.

Kazakhstan has presently hospitalised over 40 people that returned to the country from China with flu-like symptoms, but has yet to confirm any cases of the disease.

On Sunday evening Pompeo will fly to Uzbekistan, a country of 33 million that is emerging from nearly three decades of isolation.

Pompeo also visited two other ex-Soviet countries -- Belarus and Ukraine -- as part of a trip that began with a stop in Britain.

Ahead of the visit, Pompeo stressed that the Central Asian countries on his itinerary “want to be sovereign and independent”, and Washington had “an important opportunity to help them achieve that”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pompeo-condemns-china---s-xinjiang-crackdown-during-central-asia-tour.html
187,03-2-20,Twenty killed in Tanzanian church stampede: Official,"At least 20 people in Tanzania were trampled to death at an open-air evangelical Christian church service in the north of the country, officials said on Sunday.

Government official Kippi Warioba, District Commissioner in the northern town of Moshi, said he feared the number of dead could still rise from the accident, which took place on Saturday afternoon.

“So far, 20 people have died, but the death toll could increase as there were also wounded,” Warioba told AFP.

At least 16 others were injured in the crush, he said.

The tragedy happened when a crowd of worshippers was attending a prayer ceremony on Saturday led by the popular preacher, Boniface Mwamposa, who heads the Arise and Shine Ministry Tanzania.

The stampede occurred when Mwamposa, who calls himself the “Apostle”, poured what he said was holy oil on the ground and the crowd surged toward to touch it in the hope of being cured of sickness, witnesses said.

188,03-2-20,Japanese warship heads to West Asia to protect tankers,"A Japanese warship departed Sunday for the Middle East to ensure the safety of the country’s oil tankers in waters where tensions between the U.S. And Iran are high.

The destroyer Takanami with some 200 sailors left Japan’s main naval base in Yokosuka, near Tokyo. Its main task is primarily to gather intelligence in the Gulf of Oman and nearby waters.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the waters “a lifeline that supports the lives of the Japanese people.” Thousands of Japanese ships ply the route every year, transporting 90% of the country’s oil supply, he said.

“Your mission of information gathering is an extremely significant one that directly affects people’s lives,” Abe told the troops in a televised sendoff ceremony at Yokosuka.

Sending warships to areas of military tension is a highly sensitive issue in Japan because its pacifist post-World War II constitution limits the use of force by the military strictly to self-defense. Abe has gradually expanded Japan’s military role since he took office in late 2012.

Under the plan, the destroyer and some 200 Maritime Self-Defense Force troops will join a pair of P-3C reconnaissance aircraft that were operating in the same area from a base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

The Abe government is expected to authorize troops to protect Japanese commercial ships in case of danger, a plan that has faced opposition from pacifist groups.

Despite being a U.S. Ally, Japanese troops are not part of a U.S.-led coalition protecting Middle East waterways, because Tokyo wants to maintain neutrality in a show of consideration to Iran.

Japan, which has friendly ties with Iran, seeks to serve as a mediator between the Washington and Tehran and play a greater role in restoring regional stability.

In June, a Japanese-operated tanker was attacked in the Gulf of Oman.

189,03-2-20,Somalia declares locusts a ‘national emergency’,"Somalia on Sunday declared a locust infestation sweeping the Horn of Africa to be a national emergency, as insects devastate food supplies in one of the poorest and most vulnerable regions in the world.

“The Ministry of Agriculture... Has declared a national emergency in view of the current desert locust upsurge, that poses a major threat to Somalia’s fragile food security situation,” the ministry statement read.

Experts say the locust swarms are the result of extreme weather swings, and Somalia’s declaration -- the first country in the region to do so -- is aimed at boosting national efforts in tackling the hungry insects.

The locusts -- part of the grasshopper family — have led to what the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has termed the “worst situation in 25 years” in the Horn of Africa.

“Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk,” the agriculture ministry added.

“The desert locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.” The emergency declaration was made to focus efforts and raise funds, because it was critical to contain the locust swarms before harvests are due in April, the ministry said.

Desert locusts — whose destructive infestations cause major crop damage and hunger — are a species of grasshopper that live largely solitary lives until a combination of conditions promote breeding and lead them to form massive swarms.

“Given the severity of this desert locust outbreak, we must commit our best efforts to protect the food security and livelihoods of Somali people,” said Minister of Agriculture Said Hussein Iid.

“If we don’t act now, we risk a severe food crisis that we cannot afford.” According to the regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group, East Africa is already experiencing a high degree of food insecurity, with over 19 million people facing acute hunger.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/somalia-declares-locusts-a----national-emergency---.html
190,03-2-20,An ode to the master,"A watch company launched the latest collection of high-tech ceramic watches, which pays tribute to the legend of design, Le Corbusier, at the IAF

Swiss watch brand Rado joined forces with India Art Fair 2020 for the second year as the official timekeeper. The brand announced the launch of the latest collection of full high-tech ceramic watches, which pay tribute to a true legend of design — Le Corbusier. The True Thinline Les Couleurs Le Corbusier celebrates the work of the father of modernism. Le Corbusier’s Architectural Polychromy theory of colour is just one of the achievements he is known for. Also known as an artist, architect, master of materials, he is a legendary name in design.

Created in 1931 and 1959, Architectural Polychromy was ahead of its time, using 63 colours with architectural significance that help to create space and depth as well as having a profound physiological and psychological impact on the viewer. The colours are classified in nine groups of different shades and tones. The palettes are still used widely today by architects and designers. Each has a special case back design, which includes all 63 colours. Each piece is durable, scratch-resistant, light and comfortable to wear, thanks to the full high-tech ceramic and monobloc case construction.

Matthias Breschan, President of Rado since 2011, had earlier said in an interview with a watch magazine, “Design is absolutely essential at Rado. There has been no change in our strategy. Since 1957, we have been focused on materials, innovation and design.” This collection is based on delivering the best watches that fit those three criteria. “Our work with external designers in our designer collaborations is vital to our research and development. We challenge them to bring their unique design to a product on a micro scale and they challenge us to deliver on their vision,” said he.

The True Thinline is perfect to showcase the brand’s ability to create bold and dynamic colour and to pay tribute to Le Corbusier.

191,03-2-20,High 5,"Bumrah led pacers share seven wickets to help India win final T20 by 7 runs

India choked New Zealand yet again to turn it around for a seven-run win in the fifth T20 International, giving them a rare 5-0 series whitewash in the shortest format here on Sunday.

The Indian pacers, led by ever-reliable Jasprit Bumrah, shared seven wickets among them for 25 runs in match-changing 7.2 overs to restrict the Kiwis to 156 for nine while defending 163 for three.

Bumrah conceded just 12 runs in his four overs and got rid of three batsmen, bowling block-hole deliveries during death overs.

India’s total was built around stand-in skipper Rohit Sharma' 60-run knock after they elected to bat.

Tim Seifert (50) and Ross Taylor (53) kept the Black Caps in hunt for a consolation win but the hosts again fell near the finish line.

This is only third time that India have whitewashed opponents in away T20 series and first time in a five-match rubber. India had blanked the West Indies 3-0 in 2019 and beat Australia 3-0 in 2016.

New Zealand got off to a poor start and were quickly reduced to 17 for three in the fourth over. Bumrah had Martin Guptill (2) lbw, and Sundar bowled Colin Munro (15). Tom Bruce’s run-out didn’t help the situation either.

Taylor and Seifert came together at that juncture, putting on 99 runs for the fourth wicket, raising vision of an improbable win.

Seifert reached his half-century off 29 balls, including five fours and three sixes. While Taylor got to his half-century in 42 balls. He hit five fours and two sixes.

They took 34 runs off Shivam Dube in the 10th over, after which KL Rahul, who led in absence of inured Rohit Sharma, had to take corrective measures. He brought back his frontline pacers and they both etched out wickets.

Navdeep Saini (2-23) dismissed Seifert and then Bumrah bowled Daryl Mitchell (2) with a searing yorker.

New Zealand’s chase was all but over when Mitchell Santner (6) holed out of Shardul Thakur (2-38) and Manish Pandey held a fine running catch at long on.

Ish Sodhi smacked 16 off 10 balls to provide some fireworks at the end but it was not enough.

Earlier, Rohit, batting at number three, was retired hurt after injuring his left calf whilst hitting a six and walked off the field in discomfort. He faced 41 balls and hit three fours as well as three sixes.

Virat Kohli was expectedly rested, with Rohit coming in, and it was the only change for India from Wellington. Rishabh Pant was ignored once again.

For New Zealand, Kane Williamson didn’t recover on time and Tim Southee led the side once again.

Despite Rohit’s return, Sanju Samson (2) continued to open the innings and it didn't work again. Yet another opportunity went abegging as he hit straight to extra cover and was out for two runs.

KL Rahul (45) and Rohit added 88 runs for the second wicket, providing vital momentum to the Indian innings.

The in-form duo dominated the Black Caps’ attack and put on 50 off just 35 balls. Rahul hit four fours and two sixes in his 33-ball stay.

He fell in the 12th over against the run of play and finished with 224 runs in the series, the most for an Indian batsman in any bilateral T20I series.

Sharma scored his 25th T20I half-century off 35 balls. He looked to accelerate but then injured himself in the 17th over and retired.

The loss of both Rahul and Sharma impacted the Indian innings, and they lost all momentum on a slowing wicket.

Shreyas Iyer smacked 33 off 31 balls, including a four and two sixes, but couldn’t push the score past the 170-mark.

Manish Pandey scored 11 not out off four balls, with a four and a six.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/high-5-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/high-5.html
192,03-2-20,Gr8ness,"Novak lessons Thiem in five-set to win Eight title at Melbourne park

Novak Djokovic battled through a five-set thriller with Dominic Thiem to maintain his dominance at the Australian Open Sunday, claiming a record eighth title and returning to world number one in the process.

The indomitable Serb stretched his unbeaten streak this season to 13 but he had to rally from two sets to one down to beat the courageous fifth-seeded Austrian 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a nearly four-hour marathon.

It was his 17th Grand Slam title, moving him within two of Rafael Nadal and three of Roger Federer on the all-time list.

“Definitely my favourite court, my favourite stadium in the world and I’m blessed to hold this trophy once again,” said Djokovic.

Victory put him alongside his fellow legends as only the third man in history to win eight or more titles at the same Slam after Nadal (12 at the French Open) and Federer (eight at Wimbledon).

It also ensured he will once again be world number one when the new rankings are released on Monday, usurping Nadal. Federer remains third with Thiem moving up a place to a career-high fourth.

But it wasn’t easy with the Serb looking lethargic and out for the count in sets two and three before regaining his mojo after a medical timeout to grind down the talented Thiem.

Djokovic had never before won a Slam final in seven previous attempts when finding himself two sets to one down.

“You and two other guys (Nadal and Federer) brought men's tennis to another level. I am happy I can compete in these times,” said Thiem.

“I fell short today but I hope soon I can compete with you again.”

Nerveless start

The Serb, 32, was the overwhelming favourite, but the supremely fit and fast Thiem, 26, always had the weapons to trouble him, which he deployed successfully for much of the match, taming his serve and unleashing some explosive groundstrokes.

It was a nerveless start from Djokovic, who comfortably held then put big pressure on the Austrian’s serve, with a forehand into the net giving him an immediate break and a psychological edge after some monster rallies.

Thiem, though, is as strong mentally as he is physically and he finally got on the scoreboard after another tough service game.

And against the run of play, with Djokovic seemingly in control, he broke back, unleashing pinpoint groundstrokes to make the most of some loose Djokovic shots.

But the world number two was unrelenting, breaking again as Thiem served to stay in the set, with the Austrian sending down his first double fault of the match at the crucial moment.

Remarkably, a rare Djokovic double fault handed Thiem a break to go 2-1 up in set two with the courageous Austrian refusing to go away.

The Serb was getting frustrated, looking at his coaching box and pointing at his head.

He refocused and once again began attacking the Thiem serve, breaking back for 4-4, pumping his fists when the fifth seed sent a backhand wide.

But two time warnings on his serve in the next game rattled Djokovic and he was broken again, with the Serb losing his cool by patting the umpire's foot at the changeover and telling the official: ""Great job... You made yourself famous.""

‘Tough luck’

With Djokovic still looking distracted, Thiem served out the set — the first the Serb had dropped in an Australian Open final since 2015.

Djokovic appeared dejected and was immediately broken twice in set three as Thiem raced to a 4-0 lead, having won six games in a row with Djokovic imploding.

The Serb was heard telling a trainer he was tired and after losing the set, he went for a medical timeout.

He came back and the fourth set went with serve until a Thiem double fault handed the Serb two break points and he converted to regain control, serving out the set with an ace.

Djokovic drew on all his experience to force another break in the deciding fifth set to take a 2-1 lead and kept his foot on the gas to claim an eighth crown from the last 13 Australian Opens.

“It wasn’t meant to be tonight,” Djokovic told Thiem. “Tough luck. It was a tough match. But you were very close to winning it.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gr8ness-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gr8ness.html

195,03-2-20,Berg wijn for Spurs,"Steven Bergwijn’s debut goal helped Tottenham to a remarkable 2-0 win over 10-man Manchester City on Sunday to breathe new life into their challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.

Jose Mourinho’s men had been completely outplayed for the first hour, but were kept in the game by City’s profligacy and Hugo Lloris's first-half penalty save from Ilkay Gundogan.

However, Oleksandr Zinchenko's sending off changed the course of the game as Spurs scored with their first two shots on goal through Bergwijn and Son Heung-min.

Victory lifts Spurs up to fifth, just four points off fourth-placed Chelsea.

A sixth league defeat of the season for City sees Liverpool remain 22 points clear at the top and within touching distance of their first league title for 30 years.

This was arguably the least anticipated of Mourinho and Pep Guardiola’s 23 meetings as opposing managers, but it resorted to type as the Portuguese set up Spurs to defend deep, while City monopolised possession.

The visitors could have been out of sight by half-time as in a recurring theme of their season, the champions were wasteful in front of goal.

However, Tottenham also felt City were lucky not to be down to 10 men earlier when Raheem Sterling caught England international teammate Dele Alli with his studs.

Lloris was making just his third appearance since returning from a long-term layoff due to a dislocated elbow, but the French number one was back to his best to keep his side level at half-time.

Lloris turned Sergio Aguero’s low shot onto the post before the Argentine was chopped down in the area by Serge Aurier.

Referee Mike Dean initially waved play on, but with no break in play for a few minutes he eventually stopped the game after being told to give a penalty by VAR.

City’s dreadful run from the spot continued as Gundogan joined Gabriel Jesus and Sterling in failing to convert in recent weeks as his low effort was parried by Lloris.

Sterling then pounced on the rebound and went down over Lloris, but no second penalty was awarded and Sterling also escaped the possibility of a second booking for diving.

The chances continued to come for City as Aguero fired into the side-netting from point-blank range just before the break.

Dream debut

Gundogan was the guilty party again minutes into the second period after a calamity of errors.

Lloris collided with Japhet Tanganga, Aguero’s effort was cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld and when Sterling squared to Gundogan rather than go for goal himself, the German spooned the ball over.

However, the game was decided in three minutes just after the hour mark.

Zinchenko was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Harry Winks as Tottenham launched a counter-attack.

At that point City had had 14 shots on goal to Tottenham’s none, but they only needed one.

Bergwijn, signed earlier this week from PSV Eindhoven, capped a dream debut as he chested down Lucas Moura’s pass and volleyed past Ederson.

Eight minutes later, Spurs were out of sight when Son, who scored three times in a famous Champions League quarter-final win over City last season, was the scourge of City again with a fine low finish from Tanguy Ndombele’s pass.

City’s failings at both ends of the field leaves Guardiola with plenty of problems to solve just weeks away from his side’s Champions League last-16 clash with Real Madrid.

And there was more concern for Guardiola ahead of that tie as Sterling hobbled off with a muscle injury five minutes from time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/berg-wijn-for-spurs.html
196,03-2-20,Ronaldo double sends Juve six-points clear,"Cristiano Ronaldo stretched his scoring streak to nine consecutive league games with a penalty double on Sunday as Juventus bounced back from last weekend’s defeat to Napoli with a 3-0 win over Fiorentina.

The Portuguese striker slotted in both his goals from the spot in either half in Turin with Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt heading in a third in injury time.

Maurizio Sarri’s side open up a six-point lead on top of the Serie A table on second-placed Inter Milan, who travel to lowly Udinese later on Sunday.

Juventus had fallen to just their second defeat of the season last weekend at Sarri's former club Napoli, despite Ronaldo scoring.

Fiorentina, in 14th position, have had a resurgence in form since Giuseppe Iachini took over on December 24, and had been unbeaten in the league this year.

They tested Juventus goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny early with the Pole getting his hand to deny Federicio Chiesa’s back-heel kick and a Pol Lirola effort.

Fellow Pole Bart?omiej Dragowski denied Rodrigo Bentancur at the other end before a VAR viewing confirmed Fiorentina’s German Pezzella had handled the ball in the area.

Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo made no mistake, slotting in five minutes before the break.

His second came ten minutes from time after Federico Ceccherini brought down Rodrigo Bentancur.

Ronaldo made it 14 goals in nine games to bring his tally to 19 this season, including seven penalties.

The former Real Madrid player has now scored 50 goals in 70 games since moving to Juventus in 2018.

The 34-year-old also becomes the first Juventus player to achieve a run of goals in nine consecutive league games since David Trezeguet in December 2005.

De Ligt nodded in a Paulo Dybala cross after 91 minutes to hand Iachini his first league defeat with the Tuscany side.

Third-placed Lazio will try to close the gap on Juventus against struggling SPAL later on Sunday.

197,03-2-20,Tough opener for Nagal,"India’s best singles players will try to exploit the home conditions while veteran Leander Paes will be seen in action for one last time here when the Tata Open Maharashtra begins here on Monday.

The left-handed Prajnesh is up against Yannick Maden, ranked 125, while Sumit Nagal finds himself pitted against former top-20 Serbian Viktor Troicki in their respective opening round matches.

Both of them are the only direct entrants in the men’s singles main draw in which five Indians are competing.

Troicki has been in sensational form in the recent past. Partnering Novak Djokovic, he led Serbia to ATP Cup triumph. Troicki entered the main draw with an easy 6-2,. 6-4 win over Evgeny Karlovskiy of Russia in the final qualifying round on Sunday.

Ramkumar Ramanathan, Sasi Mukund and Arjun Kadhe have been given the wild cards. Ramkumar will be seen in action on Monday when he competes against seventh seed Italian Salvatore Caruso.

For Paes, who has been awarded wild-card alongside his Australian partner Mathew Ebden, it could be his final tournament in India if he does not play at the Bengaluru Open.

“This edition is special in more than one way, while we are celebrating 25 years of the tournament in India this will also be the last chance for Tennis Fans to watch Leander play live in Pune,” said Sunder Iyer, Secretary of Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA).

Serbia’s Nikola Milojevic, Italian Roberto Marcora and Czech player Lucas Rosol also made their way into the singles main draw with wins in their respective final round match in the qualifiers of the ATP 250 event.

While Milojevic thrashed the Netherlands’ Robin Haase 6-3, 6-3, Marcora upset Slovenian Blaz Rola 6-4, 7-6 in a hard-fought clash.

In the fourth match of the final qualifying round, Rosol managed a 6-2, 7-5 win over Ebden.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tough-opener-for-nagal.html
198,03-2-20,"Alexa, read me a story","With plenty of audiobooks, podcasts, music and online audio content for the young, jumping from different platforms is becoming a challenge for parents

Melanie Musson in Belgrade, Montana, does a lot of driving with her four girls. Juggling a broad age range, one to nine, she’s forever searching for ways to keep them all entertained without relying entirely on video.

While she still adores paper and tablet books for her kids, Musson said, “I think when they hear without seeing, they have to make up visuals in their heads. That’s so good. They have to be engaged and get more out of it.”

There are plenty of quality audiobooks, podcasts and music for the young, she noted but weeding through thousands of selections and jumping from platform to platform is a challenge since audio content has exploded over the last few years.

Dad blogger Balint Horvath in Zurich agreed after trying to make sense of kid options for his 14-month-old daughter.

“I couldn’t find any resource that would organise podcasts according to different criteria. Information without proper searchability is like looking for a needle in a haystack,” said Horvath, who works as a productivity coach for research and development teams.

Audiobooks and music for kids have been around awhile but podcasts made for the three to 12 set are relatively new, driving more parents to choose one-stop platforms that include all formats.

Demand is “primarily driven by parents who are podcast listeners or audiobook fans,’” said Frannie Ucciferri, associate managing editor for the nonprofit Common Sense Media.

With a huge bump in podcasts overall, the value of audio content for kids hasn’t been lost on companies large and small. Spotify recently launched a new ad-free app, Spotify Kids, as a free extension for premium family subscribers. Not yet available in the US, it’s packed with singalongs, soundtracks and stories for children as young as three. A platform called Pinna is among the latest to launch ad-free with a variety of content and ages in mind, at $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year. Others stick to podcasts alone, while Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited allows parents to customise a child’s experience to provide the most relevant books, videos, apps and more without ads, starting at $2.99 a month.

Old-school broadcasters are also getting into the act. Boston’s WGBH, for instance, widely shares free of cost two of its top podcasts for young people: Molly of Denali, based on the TV series about a girl in Alaska, and The Creeping Hour, for ages eight to 12. More are planned as part of the public affiliate’s “ongoing exploration of audio storytelling,” said WGBH spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.

Bonnie Way of Vancouver, British Columbia, has five kids, ranging from two to 12, and like Musson, she pulls a lot of travel time with her brood. She reaches for audiobooks to keep them happy, even on short trips, and relies a lot on her local library for free selections.

“Yes, it can be challenging to find books that everyone is happy listening to. My four-year-old is probably exposed to things that her older sisters wouldn’t have heard at that age. We started with short stories like Robert Munsch and Curious George, and moved to longer stories like the Chronicles of Narnia,” she said.

Some of her kids are prone to motion sickness, and listening rather than reading helps, Way said. She sees other benefits as well. “Audiobooks create a shared experience. We’re able to discuss the books after we’ve listened to them, which has been a lot of fun,” she said.

Maggie McGuire is a former teacher who has been in children’s media for more than 20 years. She’s now CEO of Pinna, which is backed by the Graham Holdings Co, formed from what remained of The Washington Post Co. after the Post itself was sold to Jeff Bezos five years ago.

Pinna both curates and creates for kids ages three to 12. It offers more than 2,000 audiobooks, podcasts and songs while also producing original podcasts, all ad-free and in compliance with federal standards aimed at protecting children’s privacy and safety online, McGuire said. It’s available as an app and usable off the Pinna.fm website.

Podcasts, McGuire said, are a “fresh new format that everyone’s very excited about.” The company worked with parents and teachers to understand what they were looking for in audio content. Among their priorities were a “one-stop solution” and a high level of curation to ensure quality and that all content was tucked into a safe platform exclusively for kids.

“There’s a real desire now to figure out how the media diet in a kid’s day, in a kid’s week, can include things that aren’t wholly screen-based,” McGuire said.

Last year, Pinna produced 25 podcasts of its own, and plans to grow that number this year. Its slate of originals accounts for half the listening among its consumers, McGuire said. The company plans to launch curated playlists this month. Not unlike other streamers, Pinna will mix new content with classic stories and other familiar standards.

Included is Pinna’s Peabody-winning podcast, The Unexplainable Disappearance of Mars Patel, a serial mystery performed by middle graders for middle graders. Another popular original is Grimm, Grimmer, Grimmest, a series of fairy tales retold. It was written and produced by Adam Gidwitz, bestselling author of A Tale Dark and Grimm.

For younger kids, Pinna partnered with Random House Children’s Books to turn the publisher’s popular Ron Roy book series, A to Z Mysteries, into a podcast. Mo Willems and Rick Riordan are among top names in the company’s audiobook lineup on Pinna, along with music from Kidz Bop, They Might be Giants and Ralph’s World.

The Amazon-owned Audible.com, a dominant force in audiobooks, is also reaping benefits from the increased interest in kid content. The company offers more than 30,000 titles for kids among more than 4,75,000 overall.

“Parents and families are excited about listening together before bedtime. They’re listening on road trips. They’re listening while they’re making dinner,” said Diana Dapito, a senior vice president of content at Audible.

Audible worked with RL Stine on its original Camp Red Moon, with Pottermore Publishing on Wizarding World audiobooks and has produced more than 100 audiobooks of the The Baby-Sitters Club series, including some narrated by Elle Fanning. In September, Audible released an original of Jessica Khoury’s middle-grade The Mystwick School of Musicraft with music performed by the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra Youth Orchestras. It’s now in Audible’s Top 20 most-listened-to kid titles of all time.

Parents’ nostalgia has played a role in kids’ listening, Dapito said, but so has the emergence of home speakers such as Alexa. “It’s easier than ever for kids to have access,” she said, “and for everybody to come together.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/alexa--read-me-a-story-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/alexa--read-me-a-story.html
199,03-2-20,Happy with the learnings in NZ: Bumrah,"India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah said he as learnt a lot from his first tour of New Zealand after returning magical figures of 3/12 in the fifth and final T20I here on Sunday.

India swept the series 5-0 with Bumrah playing a key role in the final encounter as the tourists defended 164-run target.

“Feeling very good. The match got close at one point but we had belief that if we can squeeze in one or two good overs, the match can get close,” he said after the match.

“It was windy, I was trying to use the wind and the longer side of the boundary. Very happy with the learnings, different ground dimensions, first time in New Zealand; great result,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/happy-with-the-learnings-in-nz--bumrah.html
200,03-2-20,Not thinking about T20WC at the moment: Rahul,"Chief architect of India’s rare 5-0 clean sweep over New Zealand, India opener KL Rahul on Sunday said he is not yet thinking about the T20 World Cup but wants to carry his sparkling form into the big event.

The 27-year-old from Karnataka was named the Player of the Tournament for scoring 224 runs in the five-match series at an average of 56.

“I am batting really well now and I am happy to do the roles I am doing for my side. Not thinking too much about the T20 World Cup at the moment, but hopefully I can continue batting this way,” he said.

India notched up a rare 5-0 whitewash over New Zealand with a seven-run win in the fifth and final T20 International and Rahul said the team’s ability to find answers in difficult situations was the key to its success.

“I am pleased. It is great to be standing here winning 5-0. Very happy that my performances could result in victories for India. We were happy to come into this series with confidence and to keep executing our skills every game. We came up with answers from every situation and it is a great result for me and the side,” he said.

“I think it is a winning habit that we have cultivated wherein we want to win every time we step onto the ground. As a team we keep believing in each other. Leading up to the World Cup, there were a few strategies that we wanted to try out. It just keeps giving us more and more confidence to keep going around.” India will next play three ODIs against New Zealand beginning on February 5 and Rahul said they will follow the same process to achieve success in the 50-over format.

“We’ll relax a little bit over the next couple of days and enjoy the victory. But once we start with the next series, the process will remain the same,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/not-thinking-about-t20wc-at-the-moment--rahul.html
201,03-2-20,We need everyone to be the best version of themselves: Kohli,"India captain Virat Kohli on Sunday said he wants his players to be the “best version of themselves” in order to dominate world cricket in the coming years.

India notched up a rare 5-0 whitewash over New Zealand with a seven-run win in the fifth and final T20 International here.

“We need everyone to be the best versions of themselves. It is all about laying the vision in front of the boys, the way you think, prepare. The guys are taking notice of it and they realise that the team needs 120 percent from them every time,” Kohli said.

“Because only then you will find ways to win. That has been a massive change for us in the last two-three years. We have seen the results; we obviously won't win everything and these victories give a lot more pleasure than the one-sided victories.”

With Kohli resting himself from the inconsequential final game, Rohit Sharma was the stand-in skipper, but the opener suffered a calf injury while batting and had to retire hurt.

In his absence, K L Rahul led the side to victory.

Heaping praise on the team at the presentation ceremony, Kohli said: “All of us are really proud of how we played. It's about finding ways to win. Today, all these young guys were on the field after Rohit’s unfortunate injury and them coming together and handling the pressure.

“That gives me a lot of pleasure watching from the outside and they will take this momentum going forward for many years.”

Kohli also backed under-fire New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, saying he is the right man to lead the Black Caps despite the 0-5 drubbing.

“Kane and me have similar mindsets, similar philosophies. It is amazing that despite being from different parts of the world, we have similar thinkings and we speak the same language,” he said.

“Despite what the scoreline suggests, I feel that New Zealand cricket is in the best hands and he is the right guy to lead this team. He is the perfect, perfect man to lead them. I wish him the best of luck and power to lead this side in the future. They are a side everyone loves to watch and play against.”

It was the first time that New Zealand lost three or more matches in a bilateral T20I series at home. The hosts had gone down 0-2 to England back in February 2008.

New Zealand stand-in skipper Tim Southee said there wasn’t much difference between the two sides.

“It’s another close one, unfortunately on the wrong side again. If you give them a sniff, they take it with both hands. I don't think it is a massive gap, the scoreline does suggest that, but we only need to do the smaller things better,” he said.

The two teams will next play a three-match ODI series beginning on February 5 and Southee hoped that the hosts will put up a better show with new players coming into the side.

“The ODIs are a different format, new personnel come in and it is a format where we have done well,” he said.

India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for his three-wickets haul, said he always had the belief that a couple of good overs can change the complexion of the game.

“Feeling very good. The match got close at one point but we had belief that if we can squeeze in one or two good overs, the match can get close,” he said.

“It was windy, I was trying to use the wind and the longer side of the boundary. Very happy with the learnings, different ground dimensions, first time in New Zealand, great result.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-need-everyone-to-be-the-best-version-of-themselves--kohli.html
202,03-2-20,0-5 series whitewash hurts: Taylor,"Senior New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor on Sunday admitted that the 0-5 whitewash by India has hurt his side badly and the whole T20I series has been a disappointment for them.

Taylor, however, said his side played better cricket than the results suggest though they knew from the beginning that it was going to a be tough task against a strong Indian team.

“The whole series has been a disappointment, the way we put ourselves in good positions and just were not able to capitalize. When you are up against a world-class side like India, we have played a lot worse and got better results than this,” Taylor said after New Zealand lost the fifth and final match by seven runs to hand India a rare series whitewash.

“Even though it’s a different format (than ODI and Test), it still does hurt. Winning is a habit and losing those tight games. But we are going into a format that is one of our strengths. In ODI cricket, hopefully Kane’s shoulder is all right, new personnel and some world-class players coming back and we are looking forward,” he said of the three-match ODI series from February 5-12.

He said New Zealand have given a strong Indian side room to take advantage out of it and they had suffered from that.

“You can’t give this Indian side an inch, we gave them a lot more than that and they took advantage. You got to learn a lot quicker than we are now with both bat and ball. Until then, we will get similar results,” he said, referring to the instances when New Zealand lost two matches in Super Over.

Taylor, however, hailed the Indian team for being able to win series away from home.

“More often than not it is tough to win away from home but to come over here with a couple of their star players missing that would add a different balance to their side. I am sure it is very good for Indian cricket.

“I probably say this, we were completely outplayed in the series last year and we came back and won that semi-final in the World Cup. Whenever we play India in a T20I game, we know it will be an uphill task but we know we can still beat them when it counts hopefully,” he added.

Taylor, who hit 53 on Sunday, said the target of 164 was achievable but the Kiwis came up short in a tight chase and could not recover from a poor start.

“I thought we were under pressure when I came out there. The way Tim Seifert came out and batted, we got ourselves to what once again would normally be a comfortable scenario with 66 off 60 balls. You win, maybe 95 times (from there),” said the 35-year-old right-handed batsman.

“When you got a world-class bowler like Bumrah, you have got to skin the cat slightly differently and he is able to be their X-factor for them. The way (Navdeep) Saini and others bowled put us under some pressure and wickets fell at different times,” he said, explaining how New Zealand batsmen lost their plot.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/0-5-series-whitewash-hurts--taylor.html
203,03-2-20,Eves lose to Aussies in T20 tri-series,"Indian women suffered a four-wicket loss against the mighty Australia after a disappointing batting performance in their second match of the T20 tri-series here on Sunday.

India struggled to 103 for nine in 20 overs after being asked to bat. The visiting team’s bowlers did well to stretch the game till the penultimate over but there were not enough runs on the board.

Elysse Perry was the undisputed star of the game, picking up three wickets in one before before making 49 off 47 balls in Australia’s chase.

India had beaten England in the tournament opener while Australia had lost to England in a Super Over finish on Saturday, leaving all three teams with a win each.

“Our lower order definitely needs to bat a lot better, especially when the top-order doesn't get runs. However, really appreciate the performance of the bowlers,” said India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at the post-match presentation.

India next play against England at the Junction Oval in Melbourne .

Barring opener Smriti Mandhana (35) and Harmanpreet (28), Indian batters showed complete lack of application on a pitch offering extra bounce.

India lost their last six wickets for 21 runs with pacer Perry (4/13 in 4 overs) picking three of them in 14th over over, removing Harmanpreet, Taniya Bhatia and Deepti Sharma.

Sixteen-year-old Shafali Verma, touted as the next big thing in women’s cricket, lasted only three balls while Jemimah Rodrigues crawled to 1 off 11 balls, leaving their team at 16 for two in three overs.

The experienced Mandhana and Harmanpreet stitched a 40-run stand before the latter’s dismissal triggered a collapse.

The spin-heavy Indian bowling attack did all they could with left-arm spinner Rajeshwari taking two wickets for 18 runs in four overs. Offie Deepti, who opened the bowling, too kept things tight taking one wicket for 18 runs in four overs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eves-lose-to-aussies-in-t20-tri-series.html
204,03-2-20,Gill smashes double century as India A save first unofficial Test,"Shubman Gill is expected to retain his place in India’s Test squad after scoring an unbeaten 204 for the A team in the drawn four-day game against New Zealand A here on Friday.

Resuming the day four at 127 for two, India A went on to make 448 for three in their second innings with Gill scoring his second double century on an away tour (the first one came in West Indies last year).

Gill and Test regular Hanuma Vihari (100 off 113) shared an unbeaten 222-run stand for the fourth wicket to save the game for India A. Another valuable contribution came from Priyank Panchal (115 off 164).

Gill’s 279-ball effort comprised 22 boundaries and four sixes. Vihari’s quickfire century comprised 11 fours and three sixes.

It was a much improved batting effort from India A as the pitch eased out at the Hagley Oval. The team, captained by Vihari, made 216 in the first innings in which Gill was the top-scorer with 83.

In response, New Zealand A had amassed 562 for seven before declaring the innings.

Mayank Agarwal, who will open alongside Rohit Sharma in the two-Test series against New Zealand later this month, had a forgettable outing in the game as he got out for a duck in both the innings.

After a fine double century, Gill is certain to retain his place in the Test squad. The 20-year-old was also part of the squad in the home series against South Africa and Bangladesh but did not get a game.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gill-smashes-double-century-as-india-a-save-first-unofficial-test.html
205,03-2-20,Sindhu beats Shriyanshi Pardeshi,"World Champion PV Sindhu put up a masterclass to beat Shriyanshi Pardeshi in an all-Indian clash as Hyderabad Hunters notched up a thrilling 4-3 win over Mumbai Rockets in the fifth Premier Badminton League here on Sunday.

Languishing at the bottom of the table, Hyderabad finally had something to cheer about as Sindhu lead a recovery after the team was 0-3 behind at one stage against the sixth-placed Rockets.

Sindhu had come to this match on a two-match losing streak, having suffered a reversal of fortunes at the hands of Michelle Li and Tai Tzu Ying. However, this time the Hunters Trump made no mistake as she beat Shriyanshi 15-5, 15-10 in a clinical display.

Priyanshu Rajawat then defeated Korea’s Lee Dong Keun 15-13, 15-9 in the men’s singles match, while Vladimir Ivanov and N Sikki Reddy brushed aside KS Rang and Pia Bernadeth 15-8, 15-8 to edge out Mumbai at the GMC Balayogi SATS Indoor Stadium.

Earlier, 2014 Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap won his first match of the season after tasting a defeat in four consecutive ties.

The Mumbai ace has a 3-2 head-to-head record against World No. 42 Daren Liew on the BWF World Tour and he used all that experience against the Malaysian, whom he last beat at the Korea Open in November.

Showing all his rhythm and range, the Mumbai Trump was able to register a quickfire 15-8, 15-13 win.

In men’s doubles, Kim Sa Rang and Kim Gi Jung easily beat Hyderabad’s Ben Lane and Vladimir Ivanov 15-10, 15-8 to make it 3-0 in Mumbai’s favour.

Sindhu then took the court and claimed a straight game win to start Hyderabad’;s recovery.

In the first game, it was a one-way traffic as Pardeshi found it difficult to counter Sindhu’s pace and power.

In the second game, however, the Mumbai player was able to give a better account of herself. By speeding up the shuttle, she was able to put an end to Sindhu’s domination.

As Sindhu fumbled at the net, Pardeshi was just two points away from the World No. 6 at 9-11 before the Hyderabad shuttler stopped her momentum and wrapped up the match.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sindhu-beats-shriyanshi-pardeshi.html
206,03-2-20,Anti-CAA protests: UP Police arrests 108 PFI members in four days,"Police in Uttar Pradesh has arrested 108 members of the Popular Front of India in the last four days for their alleged involvement in protests against the anti-citizenship law, a senior official said on Monday.

The arrests are in addition to the 25 made earlier, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told reporters.

""This is just the beginning. We will get to the roots of the organisation. A probe is also going on about their financial dealings. We are in touch with central agencies and are sharing information with them,"" he said, adding that Uttar Pradesh was the first state to take this kind of action against the organisation.

Giving details, acting Director General of Police (DGP) Hitesh Chandra Awasthi said 14 people were arrested in Lucknow, 21 in Meerut, 20 in Varanasi, 16 in Bahraich, three in Sitapur, nine in Ghaziabad, six in Muzaffarnagar, seven in Shamli, four in Bijnore, five in Kanpur and one each in Gonda, Hapur and Jaunpur.

Asked whether the state police has any information about the PFI's financial transactions from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), he said, ""We are collecting evidence.""

He added that they were continuously interacting with the ED and other agencies but declined to comment further.

In December 2019, Uttar Pradesh Police sought a ban on the PFI, suspecting the organisation's complicity in the statewide violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The ban was sought after PFI's Uttar Pradesh head Wasim and 16 other activists were arrested for allegedly masterminding the violence in Lucknow during anti-CAA protests.

The PFI was formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF). Security agencies have alleged its leaders have been groomed in the SIMI ideology.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/up-police-arrests-108-pfi-members-in-four-days--official-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/anti-caa-protests--up-police-arrests-108-pfi-members-in-four-days.html

208,03-2-20,"RS again adjourned till 2 pm amid protests against CAA,NPR","Rajya Sabha proceedings were on Monday adjourned for the second time till 2 pm after unrelenting opposition members sought a debate on the issue of NPR and the amended citizenship law.

As soon as the Upper House reassembled at noon, members of the Congress, Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) were up on their feet demanding an immediate discussion on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh said he cannot allow discussion on issues on which the chairman has already given a ruling on adjournment notices given by Opposition parties.

Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said, ""I have a fundamental issue. We run the House based on rules. There is Rule 267 for discussion. Why there is such a rule in the book if it is not allowed.""

The Chair did not yield to members' demand and began to take the Question Hour, but Opposition members were on the aisle while TMC members trooped into the Well protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR.

Azad insisted that the discussion should be allowed because people are being allegedly killed in BJP-ruled states across the country.

As there was no order in the House, the Chair was forced to adjourn till 2 pm.

Earlier, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu disallowed notices given by several opposition members to discuss the issue and then adjourned proceedings till noon after MPs belonging to the Congress, TMC, Left and BSP rose to raise the issue.

Naidu said members will get enough opportunity to raise the issue during discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address to the joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament.

The President's address had specific mention of the amended citizenship law and it can be discussed during the debate on the Motion of Thanks, he said.

However, Satish Chandra Mishra of the BSP, Derek O'Brien of the TMC, T K Rangarajan of the CPM and other opposition members rose to speak on it.

Naidu cut them short, saying he has already given a ruling on adjournment notices and cannot allow them to speak now.

As other opposition members joined them, Naidu adjourned proceedings.

Naidu said he had received notices from leaders such as Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma of Congress, TMC leader O'Brien, Binoy Viswam of the CPI and others under Rule 267 seeking setting aside of the business of the day to take up discussion on issues related to NPR and Citizenship Amendment Act.

Also, call attention notice has been received from Subramanian Swamy on related issue.

He, however, said members could raise the issue during the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address.

""Finance Minister, don't be scared of my questions. I am asking these questions on behalf of the youth of the country, to answer whom is your responsibility,"" Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.

210,03-2-20,NIA to quiz former J-K MLA for links with Hizbul Mujahideen commander,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will question former JK MLA Sheikh Abdul Rashid for his links with self-styled Hizbul Mujahideen commander Naveed 'Babu', arrested along with suspended Jammu and Kashmir Police DSP Davinder Singh, officials said here on Monday.

Rashid, popularly known as 'Rashid Engineer' and leader of the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), contested as an Independent candidate in the 2014 Assembly constituency from Langate in North Kashmir.

He is at present in judicial custody at the Tihar Jail after he was arrested by the NIA on August 9 in connection with a case related to finding of terror activities in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The officials said the agency would soon approach court for seeking a production warrant for summoning Rashid and question him about his association with Naveed alias 'Babu', whose full name is Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmad.

He is at present under the custody of the NIA till February 6.

Rashid was arrested along with suspended Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Davinder Singh on January 11. The police officer was allegedly ferrying Naveed along with two others out of the Kashmir Valley.

As reported by PTI last week, Naveed had claimed during interrogation that he had been in constant touch with the legislator for establishing a firm base for the terror group in North Kashmir and was looking for possible hideouts in that area, the officials alleged.

This is definitely a serious offence and needs to be probed thoroughly, they said, while justifying the need for questioning Rashid.

Along with Singh and Naveed, Rafi Ahmed Rather and Irfan Shafi Mir, who claims to be an advocate, were also arrested on the day from the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway at Qazigund.

On January 23, Naveed's brother, Syed Irfan Ahmed, was also arrested after he was brought from Punjab. He was in constant touch with his brother and had asked him to look for an accommodation in Chandigarh, where they could escape the harsh winter months of Kashmir.

Last year also, Singh had ferried Naveed to Jammu and facilitated his return to Shopian after ""rest and recuperation"".

Rashid was first a mainstream politician who was arrested by the NIA last year in connection with a case related to the funding of terror activities in Kashmir.

His name had cropped up during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali arrested by the NIA for allegedly supplying money to terror groups and separatists in the valley.

The NIA had registered the case against separatist and secessionist leaders, including unknown members of the Hurriyat Conference, who have been acting in connivance with active militants of proscribed terrorist organisations Hizbul Mujahideen, Dukhtaran-e-Millat, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and other outfits and gangs in 2016.

The case was registered for raising, receiving and collecting funds through various illegal means, including hawala, for funding separatist and terrorist activities in the erstwhile state and for causing disruption in the valley by pelting stones on the security forces, burning schools, damaging public property and waging war against India, the probe agency said in the FIR.

Hafiz Saeed, chief of the banned Jamaat-ud- Dawa (JuD), the front of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror outfit, has been named in the FIR as an accused.

The FIR also names organisations such as the two factions of the Hurriyat, one led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the other by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Hizbul Mujahideen and the Dukhtaran-e-Millat, an all-women outfit of separatists.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nia-to-quiz-former-j-k-mla-for-links-with-hizbul-mujahideen-commander-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nia-to-quiz-former-j-k-mla-for-links-with-hizbul-mujahideen-commander.html

213,03-2-20,"Djokovic takes aim at Federer's Slams, ranking record","Novak Djokovic put Roger Federer on notice as he won his 17th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and warned he was going all-out for the Swiss's record of 20 -- and his mark for weeks as world number one.

Djokovic, who came through a mid-match slump to win his eighth title in Melbourne, is relentlessly totting up the victories that could soon end the debate over who's the greatest in history.

The five-set victory over Dominic Thiem was his eighth in eight finals in Melbourne, putting him alongside Federer and Nadal as the only men to win the same Slam eight times.

It makes Djokovic, 32, the first man in the Open era, and only the second in history, to win Grand Slam titles in three different decades -- and as a not-insignificant bonus, returns him to world number one.

In an ominous sign for his rivals, the Serb has started the year unbeaten with Wimbledon, the French Open, the Tokyo Olympics and the US Open all lying in front of him as tantalising opportunities.

He is clear-sighted about his goals: overtaking Nadal's 19 Major titles and Federer's 20 to become the all-time Grand Slam king, and outdoing the Swiss master's record 310 weeks in the top ranking.

Djokovic has so far clocked up 276 weeks as number one and could pass second-placed Pete Sampras's 286 in April, and Federer's 310 on October 5.

""Obviously at this stage of my career, Grand Slams are the ones I value the most. They are the ones I prioritise,"" said Djokovic, adding ""there's a lot of history on the line"".

""Grand Slams are one of the main reasons why I am still competing and still playing full season, trying to obviously get the historic number one (record). That's the other big goal,"" he said.

'Huge win'

With five Major titles in just over two years, and unbeaten by Nadal and Federer at the Grand Slams since 2014, there's no question who's now the leading member of the Big Three.

The latest rankings tell the story at the top of men's tennis: Djokovic is number one, Nadal, one year older at 33, is second and 38-year-old Federer is a relatively distant third.

Seven-time Major winner Mats Wilander said Djokovic's win in Melbourne sets a marker for a year in which he could sweep all before him.

""At the end of the year, we could have two players on 20 or two on 19 or even more because Novak can win all four,"" he said.

""This is a huge win for him going forwards. A loss here would have been very difficult to get confidence and come back.

""But the door is open for him to start climbing through it and talk about being the greatest ever.""

As he jets out of Melbourne, his name etched yet again on the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, Djokovic warned that his confidence and expectations were soaring.

""I'm super-happy with the way I started the season. It kind of sets the tone for the rest of the year,"" he said.

""To start off the season with a Grand Slam win significantly boosts your confidence and your expectations are quite high for the rest of the season.

""But whatever happens, this season is already successful.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-the-greatest----djokovic-takes-aim-at-federer-s-slams--ranking-record-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/-the-greatest----djokovic-takes-aim-at-federer-s-slams--ranking-record.html
214,03-2-20,KL Rahul jumps to second place in ICC T20 rankings,"KL Rahul reaped rewards for his stellar all-round show in India's 5-0 drubbing of New Zealand as he rose to a career-best second position in the ICC T20 Rankings released on Monday.

Rahul scored 224 runs, including two fifties and a 40 plus score, in the five-match series besides keeping wickets.

Pakistan's Babar Azam maintained pole position while India vice-captain Rohit Sharma entered the top-10 of the batsmen rankings. Skipper Virat Kohli remained in ninth position.

Among other Indians, Shreyas Iyer (up 63 places to 55th) and Manish Pandey (up 12 places to 58th) are others who have advanced in the latest rankings.

The story is similar for the India bowling attack as Jasprit Bumrah has gained 26 places to reach 11th position, Yuzvendra Chahal has advanced 10 places to 30th and Shardul Thakur's eight wickets in the series have lifted him 34 places to 57th position.

Navdeep Saini (up 25 places to 71st) and Ravindra Jadeja (up 34 places to 76th) have also moved up.

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson's 160 runs in the series have taken him from 23rd to 16th position while Tim Seifert (73rd to 34th) and Ross Taylor (50th to 39th) have also made notable gains in the batsmen's list.

215,03-2-20,I don't think you can come back from anywhere if you have not played for so long: Kapil on Dhoni,"Legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev on Monday raised fresh doubts over Mahendra Singh Dhoni's future in international cricket, saying ""I don't think you can come back from anywhere"" after not playing for so long.

The two-time World Cup winning captain, who has not played since India's semifinal loss in the World Cup in the United Kingdom, was last month dropped from the BCCI's list of centrally contracted players.

""If you haven't played cricket for so long then I don't think you can come back from anywhere,"" Kapil, India's first World Cup winning captain, told ABP News.

Kapil also felt Dhoni's form in the IPL could be crucial.

""... But he still has IPL, his form there will be important and selectors should see what is best for the country,"" he said.

""Dhoni has done a lot for the country but when you don't play for 6-7 months, you leave a doubt in everyone's mind. And then that creates a lot of discussions which shouldn't happen.""

The 38-year-old's omission from the contract list was not unexpected considering that he has not played any international cricket for months.

India head coach Ravi Shastri had said that Dhoni may soon end his ODI career but could be in contention for a spot in the T20 World Cup squad provided he does well in the IPL.

Since the World Cup, Dhoni has missed the tour of the West Indies and the home series against South Africa, Bangladesh, the West Indies, Australia and the limited overs assignments against New Zealand.

One of the biggest names in Indian cricket, Dhoni led India to two world titles — the 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the 2011 ODI World Cup at home.

The veteran has played 90 Tests, 350 ODIs and 98 T20 Internationals for India, accumulating over 17,000 runs and effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-don-t-think-you-can-come-back-from-anywhere-if-you-have-not-played-for-so-long--kapil-on-dhoni-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-don-t-think-you-can-come-back-from-anywhere-if-you-have-not-played-for-so-long--kapil-on-dhoni.html

219,03-2-20,Sabarimala: SC bench to frame questions relating to discrimination of women in religious places,"The Supreme Court on Monday said it will frame legal questions to be adjudicated by a nine-judge bench on religious discrimination against women at various religious places, the larger concerns which have arisen during the Sabarimala temple case.

The nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said that it will inform the parties about the time frame and the questions framed in the matter on February 6.

The bench, also comprising justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S A Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said it will also deal with the issue whether a reference order can be made in review jurisdiction for a hearing by a larger bench.

During the hearing, senior advocates Fali S Nariman, Kapil Sibal, Shyam Divan and Rakesh Dwivedi said in review jurisdiction, there cannot be any reference order on issues to be heard by a larger bench.

The senior lawyers contended that in review jurisdiction, the scope is very limited and the court can only see whether the judgement under review has any error apparent or not.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, senior advocates K Parasaran and Ranjit Kumar, however, opposed the arguments and said the top court while exercising the review jurisdiction can refer a larger issue, which had arisen during the adjudication of the dispute, to a larger bench.

The bench said it will deal with all the issues and frame the questions which needs to be adjudicated by the nine-judge bench.

The bench made clear that it was not discussing the issue of entry of women of all age groups into Sabarimala temple in Kerala.

It has been hearing several senior lawyers on the issue of framing of larger legal questions to be deliberated upon by it relating to discrimination against women in various religions.

""The Sabarimala review case is not before us. We are not deciding Sabarimala. We are deciding the larger questions,"" the bench said when senior advocates Nariman, Sibal, Divan and Dwivedi opposed the hearing on the so-called larger issue relating to discrimination against women in various religions.

A five-judge bench, by a majority of 3:2 on November 14 last year, had referred to a larger bench the issue of discrimination against women in religions such as denial of entry of Muslim women into mosques, the practice of female genital mutilation in Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community and denial of right to Parsi women who have married outside their religion.

At the outset, Nariman said the question whether women of all age groups can be allowed entry into the Sabarimala temple has been already decided by the Supreme Court in 2018 and the subsequent review has also been dealt with and hence, this cannot be adjudicated afresh.

The bench said it will also consider the objection of Nariman as one of the issues.

Nariman said the apex court cannot club other issues with Sabarimala and it cannot frame questions in a review and bring in new issues.

""Scope of review is very restricted. This will set a new precedent. How can you think about other issues in a review?"" he said.

To this, the CJI said, ""No. We will not be deciding these issues. We will only interpret articles involved in these cases.""

Sibal, appearing for the All India Muslim Personal Board, said though Muslim women are allowed entry into the mosque, the issue of essential religious practice is broad enough to be decided by this court.

The Article 25 and 26 (fundamental rights to religion) of the Constitution are part of the fundamental rights which are enforceable against state action, he said.

""A lot of petitions have been filed saying Nikah Halala is bad. Somebody is saying polygamy is bad. How the bench will decide the issue,"" Sibal said.

To this, the bench said, ""That is why we have set up a nine-judge bench. That is why we are hearing you.""

The bench said it was only going to decide the interpretation of those articles which have been invoked in Sabarimala.

The five-judge bench on November 14 last year had set out seven questions of law to be examined by the larger bench. They include the interplay between freedom of religion under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, need to delineate the expression ""constitutional morality"", the extent to which courts can enquire into particular religious practices, meaning of sections of Hindus under Article 25 and whether ""essential religious practices"" of a denomination or section thereof are protected under Article 26.

While the five-judge bench unanimously agreed to refer religious issues to a larger bench, it gave a 3:2 split verdict on petitions seeking review of the September 2018 decision, allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala shrine.

A majority verdict by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and justices A M Khanwilkar and Indu Malhotra decided to keep the pleas seeking a review of its decision regarding entry of women into the shrine pending and said restrictions on women at religious places were not limited to Sabarimala alone and were prevalent in other religions also.

The minority verdict by justices R F Nariman and D Y Chandrachud gave a dissenting view by dismissing all the review pleas and directing compliance of its September 28, 2018 decision.

By a 4:1 majority verdict, the apex court had lifted the ban that prevented women and girls between the age of 10 and 50 years from entering the famous Ayyappa shrine in Sabarimala and held that the centuries-old Hindu religious practice was illegal and unconstitutional.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sabarimala-case--sc-to-frame-questions-relating-to-discrimination-against-women-in-religions-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sabarimala--sc-bench-to-frame-questions-relating-to-discrimination-of-women-in-religious-places.html

222,03-2-20,Pak’s locust army to intensify raid on India,"Pak declares national emergency; till now locusts have ruined 4L ha crops in India

With Pakistan declaring a national emergency on Saturday, the locust outbreak in India is likely to intensify in the coming months.

The Locusts Warning Organisation (LWO) of the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that around 3.50-4 lakh hectare crops in various districts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been affected in 2019-20. The damage caused by locust attacks in 2019-20 is believed to be one of the worst in India. Crops of mustard, cumin and wheat have been devastated in Rajasthan and Gujarat, affecting lakhs of farmers. In Rajasthan, the worst hit districts are Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Hanumangarh, Ganganagar, Bikaner and Sirohi.

South Sudan, Uganda, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Southern Iran, among other countries are also likely to see robust locust attack in the coming months, threatening agriculture-based livelihoods.

According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the locusts are expected to grow over the coming months due to unusual and extreme weather and powerful cyclones.

According to locust warning system, the locusts entered Rajasthan through Pakistan and then spread across Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts in north Gujarat. Currently, locusts were found in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner, Jalore, Jodhpur, Pali, Sirohi, Sriganganagar of Rajasthan and Banaskantha and Bhuj-Kutch of Gujarat area. Over 3.68 lakh hectare areas have been sprayed so far in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.

The locust warning system falling under the Agriculture Ministry has blamed Pakistan for this year’s attack, saying it failed to conduct control operations successfully. “Ecological conditions are not favourable for locust breeding in summer.

However, the incursion locusts across the border is still continuing. If Pakistan had taken proper control measures, the breeding of locusts could have been stopped, it said. Due to a longer monsoon in India, the locusts got a favourable environment to breed,” officials said.

“Adult locust swarms can fly up to 150 km (93 miles) a day with the wind and adult insects can consume roughly their own weight in fresh food per day. A very small swarm eats as much in one day as about 35,000 people. If allowed to breed unchecked in favourable conditions, locusts can form huge swarms that can strip trees and crops over vast areas,” officials added.

According to the FAO report, the locust swarms have attacked vast areas of the region. “For example in Kenya, a single swarm covered an area 40km by 60km, able to consume as much food in a single day as 85 million people, while in Ethiopia swarms have covered more than 429 km 2. Unusual weather conditions last year contributed to the swarm, especially the widespread heavy rains across the Horn of Africa since October 2019. Across the region the October to mid-November rainfall was up to 300 per cent above average; in Kenya, the rainfall was up to 400 per cent higher than average,” it said.

Locusts thrive in wet conditions, and outbreaks often follow floods and cyclones. Heavy rain leads to growth of vegetation in arid areas, providing locusts with the conditions needed to develop and reproduce, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak---s-locust-army-to-intensify-raid-on-india-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pak---s-locust-army-to-intensify-raid-on-india.html

Ajeenkya D Y Patil, Chairman of the Ajeenkya D Y Patil Group (ADYPG), emphasised that parents, not just in India but in other countries as well, put their life's earnings into their child's education and future.

""This should not be the case,"" he said. Education, Patil said, should become affordable for all.

""I feel education should be democratised. It should be available in plenty and at a very low cost. Education is knowledge and knowledge should be allowed to go everywhere,"" he told PTI in a telephonic interview.

ADYPG is primarily focussed on the education, healthcare, agriculture and sports sectors. Among the largest education providers in India, the Group has five universities in Maharashtra and over 220 institutes of higher learning, including medical, dental, engineering, hotel management institutes as well as schools across the globe.

Patil said technology has enhanced access to education tremendously and it is through technology that education is now reaching regions and sections of society that were inaccessible earlier.

Against the backdrop of technological advancements, Patil said, ""education will have to evolve and it is already changing because of technology. The corporates and industry will need to come around in terms of recruitment"".

Patil said as technology revolutionises the education scenario, legislation will also be very important because while traditional educators have followed the laws, technology platforms will need authenticity.

There will have to be some legislative changes because it must be ensured that there is quality-based education. Further, some sort of accreditation is also required to give authenticity to the new forms of education platforms that technology brings, he said.

In the next 10 years, the Group, which has a school in Belgium, is looking to expand its education footprints in the European region.

It has a medical school in the Caribbean that will go online this year. Patil described the Caribbean as an ""exciting market"" for the Group, which is looking to expand in the area of healthcare facilities in the region.

""Indian education has always been excellent in terms of the strong foundation and base it gives a person...Rather than bringing overseas education into India, we feel that there is an opportunity for our education to reach out (to other countries) as well,"" he said.

""There is a lot of wisdom in the Indian teachings and that wisdom can be translated into today's realities and methodology. That will be a fantastic culmination of education,"" Patil added.

He stressed that education and healthcare should be given more priority in the country and while the government has initiated several programmes in this regard and giving it an impetus, ""there has to be a very large push in momentum"" to enhance the pace.

""India has huge opportunities. It's not just about creating employment, it's about creating entrepreneurs, who can then fuel the economy by creating his businesses, employing more people. The culture of entrepreneurship is very important,"" Patil said.

In healthcare, the Group has three hospitals in Mumbai, Pune and Kolhapur and is also now embarking on a 600-bed hospital project in Mumbai. The Group's hospitals treat about 4,000 patients free of cost daily.

Patil noted that the doctor-population ratio in India is ""dismal at the moment"" and there is need for many more medics to cater to patients in rural areas.

With most of the doctors concentrated in the urban areas, reaching the masses in rural areas is a ""big challenge"" both for the government as well as for the private players. However, the current regime is giving a ""tremendous push"" to bridge this gap ""because they understand that there is a lack of adequacy"", he said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/education-should-be-democratised--available-in-plenty-and-at-low-cost--leading-indian-educationist-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/education-should-be-democratised--available-in-plenty-and-at-low-cost--leading-indian-educationist.html
224,03-2-20,How lifting less can give you better results,"Researchers have found that weightlifters could do less and get stronger by changing the amount they lift each session.

The researchers compared the average weights lifted by two groups over six weeks: one using a traditional training method of a ""one rep max"" - the maximum weight an athlete could lift - and one using a load velocity profile, where the weights were tailored so they lift either more or less at each session.

All who used the load velocity profile became stronger despite lifting less overall during the six week period, said the research, published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.

""The velocity-based training enabled us to see if they were up or down on their normal performance and thus adjust the load accordingly. It's about making sure the athlete is lifting the optimal load for them, on that particular day,"" said study lead author Harry Dorrell from the University of Lincoln in the UK.

""If you lift too little then you won't stimulate the body as you intend to; but if you lift too much you'll be fatigued, which increases the risk of injury,"" Dorrell added.

According to the researchers, traditionally, the one rep max would be used to dictate the weight load for all sessions.

In a study, the research team established the one rep max in the two groups.

They then used a linear positional transducer - essentially a specialised stopwatch and tape measure - to record the length of time it took to lift the weight, and the distance the weight was moved to establish a ""velocity measurement"" in one of the groups.

That coupled with the one rep max established the load velocity profile for the athlete.

At each session, the load velocity group completed a warm-up consisting of a series of repetitions where the weight load was gradually increased and their velocity measurement taken.

Each rep was recorded and compared with their pre-established load-velocity profile.

This comparison enabled the participants' training load to be adjusted based on their performance that day: if the athlete was moving the same load at a faster velocity, the weight was increased, but if they were lifting slower, the weight load would be reduced.

The findings can be used to improve muscular strength and power, and have positive implications for the management of fatigue during resistance training.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/how-lifting-less-can-give-you-better-results-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/how-lifting-less-can-give-you-better-results.html
225,03-2-20,Melodic alarms may help reduce morning grogginess: Study,"Do you often feel groggy while waking up from sleep? A melodic alarm like 'Good Vibrations' by the Beach Boys may help, according to a study.

The research, published in the journal PLOS One, suggests that the sounds people wake up to could be affecting how groggy and clumsy they feel in the morning.

The researchers from RMIT University in Australia found that melodic alarms could improve alertness levels, while harsh alarm tones may increase levels of morning grogginess.

They noted that the finding could have important implications for anyone who needs to perform at their peak soon after waking, such as shift workers and emergency first responders.

""This study is important, as even NASA astronauts report that sleep inertia affects their performance on the International Space Station,"" said Associate Professor Adrian Dyer, from RMIT University.

""We think that a harsh 'beep beep beep' might work to disrupt or confuse our brain activity when waking, while a more melodic sound like the Beach Boys 'Good Vibrations' or The Cure's 'Close to Me' may help us transition to a waking state in a more effective way,"" Dyer said in a statement.

The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in California in 1961.

The research involved 50 participants, using a specially designed online survey that enable them to remotely contribute to the study from the comfort of their own home.

Each person logged what type of sound they used to wake up, and then rated their grogginess and alertness levels against standardised criteria for sleep inertia -- an impaired state of brain present immediately after awakening.

The finding may help contribute to the design of more efficient interventions for people to use on their own devices to wake up properly, the researchers said.

According to the lead author of the study, Stuart McFarlane from RMIT University, morning grogginess -- or sleep inertia -- was a serious problem in our 24-hour world.

""If you don't wake properly, your work performance can be degraded for periods up to four hours, and that has been linked to major accidents,"" McFarlane said.

""You would assume that a startling 'beep beep beep' alarm would improve alertness, but our data revealed that melodic alarms may be the key element. This was unexpected,"" he said.

The researchers noted more studies are needed to better understand the precise combination of melody and rhythm that might work best.

However, considering that most people use alarms to wake up, they said, the sound people choose may have important ramifications.

""This is particularly important for people who might work in dangerous situations shortly after waking, like firefighters or pilots, but also for anyone who has to be rapidly alert, such as someone driving to hospital in an emergency,"" McFarlane said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/melodic-alarms-may-help-reduce-morning-grogginess--study-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/melodic-alarms-may-help-reduce-morning-grogginess--study.html
226,03-2-20,"Majority of Canadians reject paying for Harry, Meghan's security","A clear majority of Canadians feel their country does not have to pay for security for Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who have settled in British Columbia.

Seventy-seven per cent of people surveyed by Nanos Research, for CTV, believe the Candian taxpayer does not have to pay for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex because they are not in Canada as representatives of the Queen.

Canada is a parliamentary monarchy and Queen Elizabeth II is the reigning head of state.

Only 19 per cent of Canadians would not object to their country assuming a share of the security costs.

There has been no official announcement about the question of security for Prince Harry and Meghan, or who will cover the bill, now that they have officially left the royal family.

Canadian authorities have only indicated that discussions were taking place.

More than two-thirds of Canadians feel the privacy of the couple and their infant son will be better respected in Canada than it was in Britain.

But Harry and Meghan -- who live in Victoria, on Vancouver Island -- are taking no chances: last month they issued a legal warning to media over photographs of the duchess out walking her dogs with Archie, their son.

Their lawyers claimed the images were taken without Meghan's consent, the BBC reported, and the couple were prepared to take legal action.

Perhaps more worrying for the couple in the long run is that only 32 per cent of those surveyed were strongly in favour of maintaining links with the royal family and their country's status as a constitutional monarchy. Twenty-eight per cent said they were only somewhat supported that option.

And 35 percent would be more or less strongly in favour of abolishing links with the British monarchy.

China's National Health Commission in its daily report on Monday said that 2,829 new cases of coronavirus were reported nationwide on February 2, taking the total number of infection to 17,205.

The death toll rose to 361 with 57 deaths reported on Sunday, state-run Xinhua quoted the commission's report as saying.

Among Sunday's deaths, 56 were reported from Hubei Province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, and one from southwest China's Chongqing, the commission said.

Total 5,173 new suspected cases were reported on Sunday, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland reached 17,205 by the end of Sunday.

Also on Sunday, 186 patients became seriously ill, and 147 people were discharged from hospital after recovery.

The commission said 2,296 patients remained in severe condition and 21,558 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.

A total of 475 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery.

The commission said 1,89,583 close contacts had been traced, adding that among them, 10,055 were discharged from medical observation on Sunday, with 1,52,700 others still under medical observation.

By the end of Sunday, 15 confirmed cases had been reported in Hong Kong and eight in the Macao SAR and 10 in Taiwan it said.

Meanwhile, China is set to open a 1000-bed makeshift hospital built in record 10 days at Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak in central China's Hubei Province.

Huoshenshan (Fire God Mountain) Hospital was delivered on Sunday in Wuhan. It is dedicated to treating patients infected with the virus, Xinhua reported.

Another 2,300-bed makeshift hospital would be opened on Wednesday adjacent to it, the official media reported.

A total of 1,400 medical staff from the armed forces are tasked with treating patients in Huoshenshan Hospital starting from Monday, Xinhua reported.

The medics consist of 950 people from hospitals affiliated to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Joint Logistic Support Force, and 450 from medical universities of the army, navy and air force of the PLA who were sent to Wuhan earlier.

228,03-2-20,Not much difference between anarchist and terrorist: Prakash Javadekar to Kejriwal,"Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had called himself an ""anarchist"" and there is not much of a ""difference between an anarchist and a terrorist"".

His remarks come a few days after the Election Commission issued a show cause notice to BJP MP Parvesh Verma for allegedly calling Kejriwal a ""terrorist"".

Addressing a press conference here, Javadekar raked up the issue of Kejriwal ""staying a night at the Moga residence of Khalistan Commando Force chief Gurinder Singh during the Punjab Assembly polls"".

""You knew it was a militant's house. Still, you stayed there. How much more evidence do you need?"" he said.

""Kejriwal is now asking with a sad face, 'am I a terrorist?' You are a terrorist and there is a lot of evidence to prove that. You yourself had said you are an anarchist. There is not much of a difference between an anarchist and a terrorist,"" the senior BJP leader said.

Flanked by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and Union minister Anurag Thakur, Javadekar said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was supporting Shaheen Bagh, where slogans of ""Assam ko azadi"", ""Jinnah wali azadi"" were being raised. ""Supporting such slogans is also terrorism"".

He alleged that Kejriwal stood with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where ""anti-India slogans were raised, and did not grant sanction to prosecute (those who raised the slogans)"".

""On January 26, you threatened that you would stop their prosecution. How much more proof do you need? The people of Delhi now know that you are the chief of liars, you are an anarchist and sympathise with terrorists.

""You are supporting Shaheen Bagh, JNU, the slogans being raised there and all such anarchists...Then you are definitely a terrorist. This is your identity, no matter how innocent face you make,"" he said.

On Thursday, the Election Commission had issued a show cause notice to Verma, the BJP MP from West Delhi, for allegedly calling Kejriwal a ""terrorist"".

He was earlier barred from campaigning for 96 hours (four days) for making controversial remarks at a poll meet recently.

An emotional Kejriwal had later said it was for the people of Delhi to decide whether they consider him their son, brother, or a terrorist.

""How have I become a terrorist? I've arranged for medicines...Did so much for the needy. I've never thought of myself or my family...

Addressing a rally in Karkardooma in east Delhi, Modi alleged that the AAP and the Congress were provoking people and misinforming them.

They were keeping the Constitution and tricolour in the forefront, but the aim was to ""divert attention from the real conspiracy"", Modi said ahead of the Delhi elections on February 8.

Referring to the protest in Shaheen Bagh, he said people commuting to and from from Noida are facing a lot of problems.

""The people of Delhi are quiet and they are angry watching this vote bank politics,"" he said.

232,03-2-20,India ready to fight China virus,"Suspends e-visa facility temporarily for Chinese, foreigners residing in China

After reporting a second confirmed case of coronavirus from Kerala on Sunday, India escalated its security measures to deal with the deadly outbreak that has so far killed more than 305 people in China, infected over 14,000 others and spread to 25 countries. India temporarily suspended e-visa facility for Chinese travellers and foreigners residing in China after evacuating 647 Indians and seven Maldivian citizens by special flights from coronavirus-hit Wuhan city.

The Government on Sunday issued a fresh travel advisory, urging everyone to refrain from travel to virus-hit China and that travellers on return could be quarantined. “Also, anyone with travel history of China since January 15, 2020 and from now on could be quarantined,” said the Government statement here.

According to the Central Government, the second patient has a travel history from virus-hit China and he has been isolated in a hospital.

Confirming the second case, Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja said the condition of the student, currently admitted to the isolation ward at the Alapuzha Medical College Hospital, was “stable”.

Earlier in the day, the minister said in Kollam that the State was awaiting the results of tests conducted on the patient from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.

“Now, we have got the test report of the patient. There is a positive case in Alapuzha,” she told reporters here on Sunday evening after chairing a high-level meeting with senior health department officials. The first patient, a woman medical student, is in an isolation ward at the Thrissur medical college hospital.

“We are trying to ensure that the virus does not spread. The two patients, who have tested positive for the virus, are stable. Their condition is not serious. But we are monitoring them closely,” she said.

Till date, 1,793 people who travelled from coronavirus-hit countries have been identified and placed under surveillance in Kerala. Of this, 70 people have been admitted in selected isolation facilities and 1,723 are under home isolation, a State medical bulletin said.

Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Beijing said, “Due to certain current developments, travel to India on e-visas stands temporarily suspended with immediate effect. This applies to holders of Chinese passports and applicants of other nationalities residing in the People’s Republic of China. Holders of already issued e-visas may note that these are no longer valid.”

“All those who have a compelling reason to visit India may contact the Embassy of India in Beijing or the Indian consulates in Shanghai or Guangzhou, as well as the Indian Visa Application Centres in these cities,” it said.

An Air India’s jumbo B747 made two flights to Wuhan city and evacuated 647 persons over the last two days. “Periodic checkups are being done as per medical protocol. All tests are negative till now. Food, bed and other basic requirements are provided. Sufficient amount of medicines are also kept at the centre.

Isolation beds are also kept ready in case of any situation arises,” a statement issued by the authorities said about these quarantined persons.

As a preventive measure, Cabinet Secretary held a high level review meeting on the preparedness for coronavirus with secretaries of Health and Family Welfare, External Affairs, Home Affairs, Civil Aviation, Department of Health Research, and representatives from ITBP, AFMS and NDMA, here on Sunday.

Till Sunday, 58,658 passengers from 445 flights have been screened while a total of 142 symptomatic travellers have been picked up to be referred to the isolation facilities set up by the Government.

Meanwhile, in a fresh set of instructions, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that testing of only one swab sample is enough, as against the earlier two, in suspected coronavirus cases. The new WHO instructions aims to ensure faster testing of samples which will quicken the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.

A video shared by Government officials on Sunday showed a group of six students dancing and taking selfies and videos inside the Manesar facility.

“The students are happy as they have been evacuated. You can see them dancing and making videos even though they have their face masks on,” said an official.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in a tweet on Sunday, “7 Maldivians brought back with 323 Indians from Wuhan on the second @airindiain flight today. #NeighbourhoodFirst at work again.”Five doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, who were onboard the first flight, were also present in the second flight, an Air India spokesperson said.

233,03-2-20,Centre presses for early hanging of 4 Nirbhaya rapists,"HC says will pass order after parties end arguments

Seeking quashing of the death warrants suspension against the four convicts of the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, the Centre on Sunday told the Delhi High Court that the four death row convicts are “not entitled” to any more time asserting that the credibility of the judiciary and its own power to execute death sentence are at stake.

After a lengthy argument by the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and the defence counsels, Justice Suresh Kait of the Delhi High Court who heard the Centre’s petition challenging stay on the execution of the four death row convicts, reserved the order. Justice Kait said the court will pass an order after all the parties concluded their arguments.

Solicitor General Mehta, representing the Centre and the Delhi Government which have sought setting aside of a trial court order staying the execution of the convicts, said, “There is a deliberate, calculated and well thought of design to frustrate mandate of law by the convicts who were testing the patience of the nation”.

Senior advocate Rebecca John, representing convict Mukesh Kumar, contended that since the four were sentenced to death by a common order, they have to be executed together and cannot be “singled out”. “Let me concede I have delayed the process, I am a worst person, I have committed a horrible crime which is unimaginable, still I am entitled to Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution,” John submitted.

During his arguments, Mehta contended that convict Pawan Gupta’s move of not filing a curative or a mercy petition is a deliberate, calculated inaction. He said there was a deliberate delay on the part of the convicts and a prompt reaction to their pleas by the judicial and executive system.

The law officer said by the trial court’s interpretation of Rules, if convict Pawan Gupta chooses not to file mercy plea, then nobody could be hanged.

“There is a deliberate move of co-convicts to delay the process which can frustrate the mandate of the trial court’s judgment awarding them death sentence that was confirmed by the Delhi High Court and upheld by the Supreme Court,” he said.

Referring to the December 6, 2019 Hyderabad gangrape and murder case of a veterinarian in which the four accused were killed by the police in an alleged encounter, the Solicitor General said what happened there was shocking but people celebrated it.

“It gave a very bad impression.... The credibility of the institution (judiciary) and its own power to execute death sentence are at stake,” he said. The Supreme Court had formed a three-member commission headed by a former apex court judge to inquire into the alleged encounter.

Police had claimed that all the four accused in the Hyderabad case were shot dead in “retaliatory” firing by the cops when two of the accused opened fire at them after snatching their weapons and tried to escape from the site where they had been taken for a reconstruction of events as part of the investigation.

“The four Nirbhaya case convicts are playing with judicial machinery and trying the patience of the nation”, Mehta said, adding that any delay in the execution of death penalty will have a dehumanising effect on the convicts.

While Mukesh and Vinay Sharma’s mercy pleas have been rejected by the President, Pawan has not yet filed it. Akshay Singh’s mercy plea was filed on Saturday and is pending.

Advocate AP Singh, who appeared for convicts Akshay Singh (31), Vinay Sharma (26) and Pawan Gupta (25), opposed the Centre’s plea to set aside the stay on execution of death sentence.

John raised preliminary objection on the Centre’s plea saying it was not maintainable. She contended that the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court and while the Government was accusing the convict of delay, it has woken up just two days ago.

“It was the victim’s parents who moved the trial court for issuance of death warrants against the convicts. At no point the Central Government or the State Government approached the trial court to immediately issue death warrants,” John argued.

John told the High Court that the Centre has moved a plea in the Supreme Court seeking clarification whether co-convicts can be executed separately and this petition is pending before the apex court.

Mehta, however, said convicts are not to be hanged only till the stage of their SLP before the Supreme Court. Seven years have gone by but the convicts are still playing with the state machinery and the judicial system, he said, adding that the crime committed by these convicts was so ghastly that it has shaken the conscience of the nation.

Opposing the plea, John urged that she was only pressing for a common execution, if at all it happens, and as on today there was no definitive order to single order the executions of the convicts.

She added that a common judgment was passed by the trial court that they be hanged by neck till death and the death row convicts have every right to avail the remedies available to them till their last breath.

John said the day is not far when the execution will happen but nobody should circumvent the procedure as it is the question of life of a person.

She argued that the Supreme Court has never said that the convicts delayed the process and his curative petition as well as mercy petition by the President was rejected on merits and not due to delay.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012 in Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

234,03-2-20,"AAP seeks FIR, ban on Yogi campaign","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday asked the Election Commission to ban Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath from campaigning in the national Capital over his alleged provocative speeches and sought registration of FIR against him.

Responding to Yogi’s speech, AAP Rajya Sabha MP and senior leader Sanjay Singh said it has been 48 hours since the AAP has sought time from the Election Commission to meet them but the same has not been granted.

“Issueless and leaderless BJP plans to spoil the elections in Delhi. The problems created during the election campaigns testify this. Two Union Ministers sowed the seeds of hatred and violence in Delhi. Influenced by these leaders, their followers brought guns to Delhi and fired at people”, he said.

Attacking Delhi Police, he said unfortunately it watched such unwanted instances of violence silently and indifferently. “Yogi has made the entire Uttar Pradesh sick. Nearly 60 children died in his home town due to lack of oxygen in the ICU. Thousands of children died due to various diseases in UP. Television channels reported that in Sonbhadra in UP that one packet of milk mixed with one bucket of water and served to children as part of their mid-day meal,” he said.

Singh further said Yogi came in Delhi and talked about some issues to divide people.

The AAP has demanded banning Yogi from campaigning after he echoed in the line of BJP MP Anurag Thakur’s “Goli Maro…Yogi had reportedly said, “Boli se nahi to goli se maan hie jaayega”, during in an election rally in outer Delhi on Friday. The CM warned those attacking the Kanwariyas.

Targeting the BJP, he said it has no issue for Assembly polls and in absence of issues, BJP leaders resorted to divisive tactics and speeches in order to spoil the electoral debate and polarise the electorate.

Continuing his relentless attack on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal,Yogi on Sunday while addressing a rally in Badarpur of Southeast Delhi said, “When the provisions of Article 370, that gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir, were abrogated; pain was felt by Pakistan and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal.”

Also, Yogi termed the Shaheen Bagh protest a “malicious attempt to disturb peace and normal life”. “When Article 370 was abrogated, pain was felt by Pakistan and Arvind Kejriwal,” Adityanath said, addressing a rally in south Delhi’s Badarpur.

Yogi said in the Delhi elections, on one side there is the leadership of Narendra Modi for development and nationalism, on the other, there is the Congress and Kejriwal who “support divisive forces”.

“The BJP is working with zero tolerance towards terrorism. But Kejriwal is busy with sponsoring and offering biryani in Shaheen Bagh,” he said.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh Singh said it has been 48 hours since his party sought time from the Election Commission for a meeting but it has not been granted.

“He (Yogi) must be arrested for his communal speeches. We have lodged a complaint with the EC,” he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aap-seeks-fir--ban-on-yogi-campaign-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/aap-seeks-fir--ban-on-yogi-campaign.html
235,03-2-20,"'1917' dominates Baftas 2020, best actor winner Joaquin Phoenix","British filmmaker Sam Mendes' war drama ""1917"" ruled the 2020 edition of Baftas with seven wins, including best film, best British film and best director but it was best actor winner Joaquin Phoenix calling out the ""systemic racism"" of the industry that received a lot of attention at the awards ceremony.

Phoenix, who was awarded the Bafta for his titular performance in ""Joker"", accused the industry of sending out ""a clear message to people of colour that you are not welcome here"".

Both British Academy of Film and Television and Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences were heavily criticised for the lack of representation and diversity after the nominations were announced.

The acting categories had shut out people of colour while no women directors were recognised in the directing segment.

""I don't think anybody wants a handout or preferential treatment, although that's what we give ourselves every year. I think people just want to be acknowledged, appreciated and respected for their work. This is not a self-righteous condemnation because I'm ashamed to say that I'm part of the problem,"" Phoenix said on stage at the Royal Albert Hall.

""I have not done everything in my power to ensure that the sets I work on are inclusive, but I think it's more than just having sets that are multicultural. We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. I think it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it. So that's on us,"" he concluded.

Prince William, who presented this year's Bafta Fellowship to ""Star Wars"" producer Kathleen Kennedy, also addressed the issue.

""We find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to address diversity in the sector. That cannot be right in this day and age,"" he said.

""1917"" also took home the Baftas for cinematography, production design, sound and special visual effects.

Actor Rebel Wilson took a potshot at the Academy for not nominating women directors. She said, ""I don't think I could do what they do, honestly. I just don't have the b***s,"" as the room erupted in laughter.

Besides Phoenix's predicted win, Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" managed two more awards in the best original score and casting categories.

Actor Renee Zellweger took home the best actress honour for her role as legendary singer-actor Judy Garland in ""Judy"" and had a brief reunion with her ""Bridget Jones"" co-star Hugh Grant near the stage.

Grant, who was one of the presenters, joked, ""First of all, well done Jones.That was a very silly little dress, I thought,"" the actor, who played the role of Daniel Cleaver in the movie, said.

Brad Pitt and Laura Dern continued their winning streak in the supporting categories as they bagged one more for their performances in Quentin Tarantino's revisionist period piece ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and divorce drama ""Marriage Story"", respectively.

In a reference to the UK leaving the European Union, Pitt said -- in a written note read by his ""Once Upon a Time..."" co-star Margot Robbie -- ""Hey Brits, heard you just got single. Welcome to the club!""

""He's gonna name this Harry, because he's really excited about bringing this back to the States with him,"" Robbie said in another dig at the locals in light of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle “stepping down as senior royals” as Prince William and wife Kate Middleton chuckled in the audience.

South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" scooped two Baftas -- for original screenplay and film not in the English language.

The award for best adapted screenplay went to writer-director Taika Waititi for ""Jojo Rabbit"".

""This is very, very cool for me. (I) come from the colonies. We know it's been a hard week for you guys,"" the New Zealander filmmaker began his acceptance speech.

Lifting the trophy, Waititi said, ""It's been very nice to take a little bit of your gold, back home, where it belongs.""

Jay Roach-directed ""Bombshell"", based on the accounts of several women at Fox News who set out to expose CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment, picked up best hair and make-up trophies.

Greta Gerwig's adaptation of ""Little Women"" secured a win in the best costume category and ""Ford v Ferrari"", which released in the UK as ""Le Mans '66"", was adjudged the film with best editing.

Actor-director Andy Serkis was honoured with the outstanding British contribution to film award, which was presented to him by veteran theatre and film actor Ian McKellen.

Micheal Ward, known for ""Top Boy"" and ""Blue Story"", was named the Bafta rising star.

""Klaus"" took home the best animation award and ""Grandad was a Romantic"" was named the best British short animation. ""Learning to Skateboard in a war zone (If you're a girl)"" won the best British short film award.

""Sama"", a film about a young mother's experience of the Syrian civil war, won best documentary Bafta.

""Bait"" was named outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-1917--dominates-baftas-2020--best-actor-winner-joaquin-phoenix-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-1917--dominates-baftas-2020--best-actor-winner-joaquin-phoenix.html
236,03-2-20,Coronavirus in China may have come from bats: studies,"The novel coronavirus that has claimed over 350 lives and infected thousands in China may have originated from bats, according to two latest studies published in the journal Nature on Monday.

In the first study, the researchers carried out a genome sequence of the virus associated with the respiratory disease outbreak in China, isolated from a patient working in the seafood market linked to the initial cases.

The study found that the virus was closely related to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses previously identified in bats in China.

The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in the central Hubei province of China in December, has killed 361 with 57 deaths reported on Sunday while the number of confirmed cases has climbed to 17,205. The Philippines on Sunday reported the first death outside China from the epidemic that has spread to 25 countries, including India, the US, the UK and Russia.

In China, all the deaths have been reported in Hubei Province - the epicentre of the virus outbreak. The virus was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on January 31.

The first patient was admitted to a hospital on December 12 last year, and investigations have identified a seafood market, which also sold wild animals, in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, as the potential source of the outbreak.

Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues from Fudan University in China studied a 41-year-old male market worker admitted to a hospital in Wuhan on December 26, who experienced symptoms of respiratory illness, including fever, chest tightness and cough.

A combination of antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid therapy was administered. However, the patient exhibited respiratory failure and his condition did not improve after three days of treatment.

The researchers performed genome sequencing on a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid - a lung secretion - collected from the patient.

They identified a novel virus and found that the viral genome shared 89.1 per cent nucleotide similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses from bats.

It is not possible to conclude from the analysis of a single patient that this coronavirus is the cause of the current outbreak, the researchers said.

The findings have been corroborated by independent investigations in other patients, they said.

Another study, published in Nature, carried out the identification and characterisation of the coronavirus associated with the recent outbreak, revealed similarities with SARS coronaviruses.

The analysis uncovers evidence that the coronavirus has an origin in bats, although the animal source of this outbreak has not been confirmed.

Coronaviruses have been a source of infectious disease epidemics in humans, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

SARS-related coronaviruses are mainly found in mammals such as bats and are a potential threat to public health.

As of December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness has been reported, originating in a seafood market in Wuhan. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

Zheng-Li Shi and colleagues from Wuhan Institute of Virology in China analysed samples from seven patients with severe pneumonia, six of whom were identified as workers from the seafood market in Wuhan, where the cases were first reported in December.

Full-length genome sequences obtained from five of these patients are found to be almost (over 99.9 per cent) identical to each other, and share 79.5 per cent sequence identity with SARS coronaviruses.

The researchers also found that the virus sequence was 96 per cent identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, suggesting that bats are a probable source of this coronavirus.

The identification and sequencing of seven non-structural proteins also found in SARS coronaviruses demonstrates that this virus is a SARS-related coronavirus, which the authors provisionally name novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), they said.

The resaerchers determined that 2019-nCoV enters cells through the same route as SARS coronaviruses, via the ACE2 cell receptor.

Antibodies isolated from patients infected with 2019-nCoV are shown to have the potential to neutralise the virus.

A previously identified horse antibody against SARS-CoV also neutralizes the virus at a low serum dilution, but whether or not anti-SARS-CoV antibodies cross-react with 2019-nCoV needs to be confirmed using serum from humans who have convalesced from SARS-CoV infection.

The researchers developed a test that can differentiate 2019-nCoV from all other human coronaviruses.

They showed that 2019-nCoV was detected in initial oral swab samples, but that subsequent samples (taken around 10 days later) did not have a positive viral result.

This finding suggest that the most likely route of transmission is through the airways of individuals, although the researchers note that other possible routes may be possible, and more patient data is needed to investigate the transmission routes further.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-in-china-may-have-come-from-bats--studies-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus-in-china-may-have-come-from-bats--studies.html
237,03-2-20,Govt looks for liberal Mughal Dara’s grave,"The Modi Government has set up a seven member-panel consisting of senior archaeologists to locate the grave of “liberal Muslim” Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh (1615- 1659), who is said to be buried somewhere in Humayun’s Tomb in the national Capital.

There are around 150 graves of the clan of the Mughal rulers in the historical monument and the grave of Shikoh is said to be one among them.

The graves of many members of the Mughal clans have already been identified at the “mortuary of the Mughal dynasty”. The move to identify the grave of the Mughal Prince comes close on the heels of a symposium named “Dara Shikoh: A hero of the Indian syncretist traditions”, held recently in Delhi. Among others, it was addressed by Krishna Gopal, joint general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

The Mughal Prince is touted by the RSS as a liberal Muslim who was said to be rooted in the “Indian knowledge tradition — a truth-seeker who tried finding commonalities between the Hindu and Islamic spiritual traditions — and initiated a healthy debate and a dialogue between the two faiths”.

The panel constituted by the Union Culture Ministry last week has been given three months to locate the grave of Shikoh on the premises. The other members of the panel headed by ASI Director (Monument) TJ Alone include RS Bisht, Sayeed Jamal Hassan, KN Dikshit, BR Mani, Mohmmed KK, Satish Chandra and BM Pandey, senior archaeologists and ASI officials.

Shikoh is known for his mastery in Sanskrit and had translated the Bhagavad Gita into Persian language.

“We have been asked to submit the report within next three months,” said Sayeed Jamal Hassan, ex-director of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and one of the members of the panel.

He said “temporary records and a biography of Shahjahannama compiled by Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, a court historian during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, has dedicated at least two pages detailing last days of Shikoh, on how he was brutally murdered and buried somewhere at the historical monument built by the wife of Humayun in her husband’s memory.”

An Islamic inscription has been written on Shikoh’s grave, as per the epic, said Hassan.

French historian Jean Filliozat in his book has written that Shikoh’s Samudra Sangama (The Confluence of Oceans), is the most important text for the comparison of sufism with Indian doctrines and spiritual practices.

Shikoh’s greatest literary achievement was the translation of 52 Upanishads from Sanskrit into Persian, titled Sirr-i-Akbar (The Great Secret) and, in some manuscripts, Sirr-ul-asrar (The Secret of Secrets). He was the eldest son and heir-apparent of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.

According to the ShahJahannama, after Auragzeb defeated his brother Dara Shikoh in 1657 in the war for the control of the Mughal empire, he brought the latter to Delhi in chains and paraded him all over the city. Shikoh’s s head was then cut off and sent to Agra Fort where his father had been imprisoned in a Fort overlooking the Taj Mahal he had built for his wife Mumtaz. Aurangzeb took over the reins of the Mughal Empire. Dara’s remains were buried in an unidentified grave somewhere at Humayun’s Tomb.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-looks-for-liberal-mughal-dara---s-grave-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/govt-looks-for-liberal-mughal-dara---s-grave.html
238,03-2-20,Performance capture an egalitarian form of acting: Andy Serkis,"Actor-director Andy Serkis, who was honoured at the Baftas 2020 for his pioneering work on performance capture, said this form of ""egalitarian"" acting is a great tool for artistes going ahead in the 21st century.

He was presented the Bafta for his outstanding British contribution to cinema by veteran theatre and film actor Ian McKellen.

The actor, who met with an accident while playing winter sports appeared onstage in crutches, received a standing ovation as he accepted the trophy from his ""Lord of the Rings"" co-star.

Serkis has delivered powerhouse performances by playing computer-generated characters such as Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the revolutionary ape, Caesar in ""Planet of Apes"" film franchise to name a few.

The 55-year-old actor said performance/ motion capture signifies the ""end of typecasting"", allowing actors to play any role they want to.

""I truly believe performance capture is an egalitarian form of acting. It's one of the great tools for actors and filmmakers of storytelling in the 21st century. It signifies the end of typecasting - anyone can play anything. It never used to be accepted as a standard industry practice, but it is now,"" the actor-director said in his acceptance speech.

""So a monumental thank you to all the innovators, coders, animators, the CGI artistes, companies, and the actors who continue to develop it,"" Serkis added.

He thanked his wife and ""favourite actor on the planet"" Lorraine Ashbourne and his family in his address.

Serkis also thanked ""Lord of the Rings"" director Peter Jackson, the team at WETA digital who did the visual effects that transformed him into Gollum.

""Thank you to Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyle for introducing me to the foresaid spandex suit, spending many years with Ian and spending wonderful characters in your movies,"" he said.

In a nod to the ""Planet of the Apes"" team, the actor expressed gratitude to his ""ape family"" -- Dylan Clarke, Matt Reeves, Rupert Wyatt, Terry Notary and Michael Giacchino.

The magnum opus, which features Anil Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Alia Bhatt, Janhvi Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar, is set in the Mughal era.

When asked how he will strike a balance in 'Takht' as Bollywood period films have often been criticised for endorsing Islamophobia, Karan told reporters, ""You're talking to someone who has directed 'My Name is Khan'.""

""My sensitivities to religions across the world will always be on point. That's something I believe as a human being and as a citizen of this great country and of the world.

242,03-2-20,"Disha, Aditya on retaining moral compass while playing killers in 'Malang'","In their upcoming release ""Malang"", Disha Patani and Aditya Roy Kapur essay characters that are in a quite dark space, with both justifying the act of killing. According to the actors, these are morally tricky characters, and as performers they essay such roles in a non-judgmental manner, emphasising that the film is nothing but a work of fiction.

In the trailer, Aditya's character says: ""Mere liye, jaan lena mera nasha hai (for me, taking lives is an addiction)"".

Disha's protagonist quips: ""Jaan lena mera mazaa hai (taking lives is fun)"".

Disha's character is otherwise portrayed as someone who loves to live ""from one high to another"", soaked in adventure sports, long rides and wild nights out.

Talking about her role, Disha told IANS: ""Every individual has her own reality, and every action she takes, she feels, is justified in the situation that she lives. That is what my character is about. For example, there are psychopath killers and, of course, what they are doing is not right! So when the audience watches the film, I do not want them to get inspired by her actions and try them in reality. It is a work of fiction.""

For Aditya, playing such a character is a morally tricky deal. ""It is tricky and that is why it is important to understand such a character instead of judging him. In reality, all of us try to rationalise the way we behave, the way we take any action. As an actor, I am trying to give life to a fictional character, so it is important to understand that. I try to understand where they are coming from when they do something instead of judging them as right or wrong,"" he explained.

The actor added: ""A guy can do something that is wrong in my opinion but not for him as a character, and on screen I am not playing myself but a fictional character written by someone, which came from someone's imagination. So when I am working on a character, I refrain to make it likable, especially in this case, because he is doing some dubious things in the film.""

244,03-2-20,Trump impeachment trial to resume for final arguments,"President Donald Trump's impeachment trial resumes for final arguments on Monday before an expected acquittal later in the week that Democrats have said will be invalid because no witnesses testified.

The president was impeached in December for abuse of power over pressure on US ally Ukraine to announce investigations that would have helped him politically, including into Joe Biden, a leading challenger for this year's presidential ballot.

Biden is among the candidates Monday in the Iowa caucuses that choose the state's Democratic nominee and mark the official start of election season.

The selection process in largely rural Iowa, coinciding with final impeachment arguments in Washington, will be closely watched as a sign as to which of 11 Democratic candidates are gaining early momentum to challenge Trump in November's election.

At only the third impeachment trial of a US president, Trump is all but assured of being acquitted Wednesday, the day after his annual ""State of the Union"" speech, which the president said will carry a ""very, very positive message"".

Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate to 47 for the Democrats, but a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is needed to remove him from office.

Adam Schiff, the leader of the House prosecutors, known as impeachment managers, told CBS on Sunday that it was ""pretty remarkable"" that senators on both sides had acknowledged that Democrats proved their case against the president.

""But I'm not letting the senators off the hook. We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed. It will be up to the senators to make that final judgment, and the senators will be held accountable for it.""

Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Joni Ernst on Sunday said Trump's behaviour was troubling but not impeachable.

Alexander, of Tennessee, suggested Trump had been naive in asking a foreign ally to look into Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine, which Republicans have claimed without evidence were corrupt.

But he added: ""The bottom line: it's not an excuse. He shouldn't have done it.""

Ernst said it was ""up to the American people"" to decide on Trump's behaviour, adding that she would vote Wednesday to acquit the president.

""I think generally speaking, going after corruption is the right thing to do, but he did it in the wrong manner... I think that he could have done it in different channels,"" she told CNN.

Trump is also accused of obstruction of Congress for ordering officials not to comply with subpoenas for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry.

On Friday, just two Republicans -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine -- joined Democrats in voting to introduce witnesses, a practice they said was followed at every other impeachment trial in US history.

A narrow majority of Americans believe Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress by withholding documents and testimony during the impeachment inquiry, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll.

But they remain divided on whether he should be kicked from office, with 46 per cent hoping to see him removed and 49 per cent saying he should keep his job.

Democrats had been eager to hear from Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other key administration figures caught up in the scandal.

Bolton reportedly says in a forthcoming book that Trump told him military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev's investigating Biden -- corroborating the central claim against the president.

After the failure to call witnesses, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the chamber ""did not live up to its responsibilities, turned away from truth and instead went along with a sham trial"".

Four contenders for the Democratic nomination -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet -- are required to be back in Washington Monday at the impeachment trial even as the Iowa caucuses take place.

245,03-2-20,"Built in 10 days, China's virus hospital takes 1st batch of patients","The first batch of patients arrived on Monday at a specialised hospital built in just 10 days as part of China's intensive efforts to fight a new virus.

Huoshenshan Hospital and a second facility with 1,500 beds that's due to open this week were built by construction crews who are working around the clock in Wuhan, the city in central China where the outbreak was first detected in December. Most of the city's 11 million people are barred from leaving the area.

The Wuhan treatment centres mark the second time Chinese leaders have responded to a new disease by building specialised hospitals almost overnight. As severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread in 2003, a facility in Beijing for patients with that viral disease was constructed in a week.

The first batch of patients arrived at the Huoshenshan Hospital at 10 am on Monday, according to state media. The reports gave no details of the patients' identities or conditions.

The ruling Communist Party's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, sent 1,400 doctors, nurses and other personnel to staff the Wuhan hospital, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The government said earlier some have experience fighting SARS and other outbreaks.

Authorities have cut most road, rail and air access to Wuhan and surrounding cities, isolating some 50 million people, in efforts to contain the viral outbreak that has sickened more than 17,000 and killed more than 360 people.

The Huoshenshan Hospital was built by a 7,000-member crew of carpenters, plumbers, electricians and other specialists, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Photos in state media showed workers in winter clothing, safety helmets and the surgical-style masks worn by millions of Chinese in an attempt to avoid contracting the virus.

About half of the two-storey, 60,000-square-metre (600,000-square-foot) building is isolation wards, according to the government newspaper Yangtze Daily. It has 30 intensive care units.

Doctors can talk with outside experts over a video system that links them to Beijing's PLA General Hospital, according to the Yangtze Daily. It said the system was installed in less than 12 hours by a 20-member ""commando team"" from Wuhan Telecom Ltd.

The building has specialised ventilation systems and double-sided cabinets that connect patient rooms to hallways and allow hospital staff to deliver supplies without entering the rooms.

The hospital received a donation of ""medical robots"" from a Chinese company for use in delivering medicines and carrying test samples, according to the Shanghai newspaper The Paper.

In other cities, the government has designated hospitals to handle cases of the new virus.

In Beijing, the Xiaotangshan Hospital built in 2003 for SARS is being renovated by construction workers. The government has yet to say whether it might be used for patients with the new disease.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/built-in-10-days--china-s-virus-hospital-takes-1st-batch-of-patients-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/built-in-10-days--china-s-virus-hospital-takes-1st-batch-of-patients.html
246,03-2-20,"Shanghai stocks dive 7.72% on virus, biggest drop since 2015","The Shanghai Composite index tumbled nearly 8% on Monday as Chinese regulators moved to stabilize markets jolted by a virus that has spread to more than 20 countries, slamming regional tourism and threatening global growth.

The outbreak of the virus in China has prompted governments around the world to step up surveillance and quarantine requirements as airlines cancel hundreds of flights. Millions of Chinese remained in lock-down as the number of people infected by the virus topped 17,000 as of Sunday night. It has killed more than 360 people, all but one in China.

The Shanghai benchmark dropped almost 9% after markets opened after a week-long Lunar New Year holiday that was extended by three days. It was its worst day since August 2015, despite the central bank's effort to put billions of dollars of extra cash into the markets through short-term securities purchases.

Many analysts have dropped their forecasts for China, the world's second-largest economy, to near 5% from earlier forecasts of 6% economic growth for the year. With tens of millions of Chinese city dwellers ordered to mostly stay home, retailer and tourism-related businesses already are suffering.

China's communist leaders have massive resources for intervening to staunch panic selling of shares and have deployed them during past crises, including the 2008 global financial meltdown and the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Most of the country's largest companies and financial institutions are state-controlled.

On Sunday, the central bank announced it was putting 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) into the markets to ensure there would be enough cash. The Shanghai Composite fell 2.8% on Jan. 23, its last day of trading before the holiday.

While shares in many sectors fell on Monday, prices for some Chinese pharmaceutical companies hit their 10% upside limit in early trading. Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical, Jiangsu Sihuan Bioengineering and Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co. Were among the limit-up companies. Major conglomerate New Hope Group plunged to the 10% downside limit, as did Dongfang Electric Co.

The benchmark for China's smaller market, in Shenzhen, plunged 8.4%. Worries over the potential harm to businesses and trade from the virus, first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, have triggered wide swings in share prices around the globe.

On Wall Street on Friday, the Dow skidded more than 600 points as the widening pandemic stoked fears that travel restrictions and other uncertainties could dent global growth.

The U.S. Market, which had calmly been setting record after record, suffered its worst January since 2016 and its first monthly loss since August.

“The worst case scenario is that this Wuhan coronavirus rages on unchecked like the ebola crisis in west Africa several years ago,"" said Francis Lun, a stock analyst in Hong Kong.

It could take two or three years for China to recover, he said.

“Because China is the big elephant in the room now. If it falls, it will bring down all these smaller fries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and even Japan. So nobody is immune,"" Lun said.

The central bank said its open market operations were aimed at ensuring sufficient liquidity.

The People's Bank of China often uses reverse repurchases of securities that it plans to sell back, basically serving as very short-term loans, to increase the amount of money circulating in markets.

A large share of the 1.2 trillion yuan put into the markets was going to meet payment obligations falling due on Monday, analysts said.

“This is well beyond the band-aid fix, and if this deluge doesn't hold risk-off at bay, we are in for a colossal beat down,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. Said in a client note.

The plunge when markets reopened was expectable, he said.

“It's not the earthquake at the open but rather the aftershocks that will drive risk sentiment on Monday,” he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/shanghai-stocks-dive-7-72--on-virus--biggest-drop-since-2015-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/shanghai-stocks-dive-7-72--on-virus--biggest-drop-since-2015.html
247,03-2-20,'Man shot dead in London stab frenzy was convicted Islamist terrorist with family links to Lanka',"A man shot dead by the Scotland Yard after he went on a stab frenzy on a busy high street in south London was a convicted Islamist terrorist, with family links to Sri Lanka, who was recently released from prison after serving half of his sentence period for preparation of acts of terrorism, police said.

The Metropolitan Police said Sudesh Mamoor Faraz Amman, a 20-year-old British national with extended family in Sri Lanka, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS).

Amman was sentenced to three years and four months in prison in December 2018 after being charged with 10 terror-related offences. He was aged 18 that time.

Amman was released under licence last month. He was under surveillance.

""The suspect had been recently released from prison where he had been serving a sentence for Islamist-related terrorism offences. We are confident that this is an isolated incident that has been contained,"" said Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi on Sunday night.

Of the 10 offences under which Amman was jailed, seven were of making records of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism and three of dissemination of terrorist publications.

Police had been told of extremist material being posted on the social media app Telegram by an account called @strangertothisworld, which turned out to be of Amman.

He had used documents about making explosives, weaponry and carrying out terrorist attacks. Among them were manuals on bomb-making, knife-fighting and close combat. Reports at the time also said he had told his girlfriend she should murder her ""kuffar"" (non-believer) parents.

Police found a notepad in his home, where he had listed his ""life goals"".

""Top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to 'Jannah' - the afterlife,"" Alexis Boon, then head of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command, said after he was jailed over a year ago.

On Sunday, Amman was wearing a hoax bomb vest as he was pursued by armed officers as part of a proactive counter-terrorism surveillance operation before they shot him dead at the scene.

A man in his 40s, who suffered life-threatening injuries in the stabbing, is said to be out of danger and one woman in her 50s, who had non-life-threatening injuries, has since been discharged from hospital.

Another woman in her 20s who suffered minor injuries, believed to have been caused by broken glasses triggered from the discharge of the police firearm, continues to receive treatment at hospital, the Met Police said.

""Detectives from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command continue to carry out fast-time enquiries into the circumstances of the attack in Streatham High Road at approximately 1400 hours on Sunday, February 2,"" the Met Police said in a statement on Monday.

""Search warrants are being carried out at two residential addresses in the south London and Bishop's Stortford (Hertfordshire) areas respectively. No arrests have been made and enquiries continue at pace,"" the statement said.

In a statement from Downing Street after an emergency meeting with UK Home Secretary Priti Patel on Sunday night, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson once again pledged tougher sentencing measures for dangerous terrorists.

""We will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences,"" he said.

It is thought that Amman may have realised he was being watched because he stole a 10-inch 3.99 pound kitchen knife from a store on the Streatham High Road at the time of the attack and, within seconds, stabbed a woman in the back. As he ran up the busy high street he stabbed a man.

At least two plain-clothed police officers who had been following Amman, dressed in hoodies and jeans and with balaclavas covering their faces, gave chase on foot after he attacked his first victim.

It is thought that a third officer on a motorbike who had been part of the surveillance team may have been the first to open fire.

In November last year, in a similar scenario, two people were killed after convicted terrorist Usman Khan went on a stabbing frenzy in London Bridge area of the UK capital.

It later emerged that Khan's family originated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and he was out on parole after serving part of his sentence for plotting terrorist attacks on the UK.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-man-shot-dead-in-london-stab-frenzy-was-convicted-islamist-terrorist-with-family-links-to-lanka--2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-man-shot-dead-in-london-stab-frenzy-was-convicted-islamist-terrorist-with-family-links-to-lanka-.html
248,03-2-20,UK's Johnson talks tough on trade; EU demands fishing rights,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is setting out a tough opening gambit Monday in negotiations with the European Union, saying the UK will walk away without a free-trade deal rather than agree to follow rules set by the 27-nation bloc.

Just 60 hours after Britain left the EU, the first country ever to do so, Johnson is digging in his heels about future relations. In a speech to business leaders and international diplomats in London, Johnson plans to say “we want a free trade agreement,” but not at any cost.

“The choice is emphatically not 'deal or no-deal,'” Johnson plans to say, according to extracts released by his office.

“The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada's – or more like Australia's.” Australian-style trade would mean a panoply of new tariffs and other barriers between the U.K. And the EU, its near neighbour and biggest trading partner.

Across the Channel, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the European Union will link any access to its market for British products directly to the access that EU boats will be given to UK waters.

Barnier underscored the difficulties of the trade negotiations with Britain when he highlighted the small but emblematic fisheries industry, which was a key issue in the UK's protracted Brexit divorce deal.

Barnier told France Inter radio that “there will be no trade deal with the British if there is no reciprocal access deal for our fishermen.” Barnier said the two topics will be negotiated at the same time.

In their divorce agreement, Britain and the EU agreed to strike an “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership,” including a free trade deal and agreements for security and other areas.

They gave themselves 11 months to do it. A post-Brexit “transition period,” in which relations stay essentially unchanged, runs until the end of 2020. For the rest of this year the U.K. Will continue to follow EU rules, although it will no longer have a say in EU decision-making.

Britain says it wants a “Canada-style” free trade agreement with the EU covering both goods and services. But it is adamant it won't agree to follow the EU's entire r ule book in return for unfettered trade, because it wants to be free to diverge in order to strike other new deals around the world.

The bloc insists there can be no trade deal unless Britain agrees to a “level playing field” and does not undercut EU regulations, especially in areas of environmental protections, worker rights and health and safety standards.

Johnson intends to double down on Britain's tough stance. The prime minister chose to deliver his speech in the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich on the River Thames, a spot steeped in Britain's past military glories.

The vast hall, covered in paintings glorifying British achievement, is where Adm. Horatio Nelson lay in state after his death at the Battle of Trafalgar against the navies of France and Spain in 1805.

“There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept U.K. Rules,” he will say.

“The U.K. Will maintain the highest standards in these areas — better, in many respects, than those of the EU -– without the compulsion of a treaty. And it is vital to stress this now.” It's a message aimed as much at a domestic audience as it is at the bloc, but EU leaders are unlikely to be impressed by what they'll see as British intransigence and wishful thinking.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/uk-s-johnson-talks-tough-on-trade--eu-demands-fishing-rights-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/uk-s-johnson-talks-tough-on-trade--eu-demands-fishing-rights.html
249,03-2-20,Hong Kong shuts most China crossings over virus as medics strike,"Hong Kong announced it was closing all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland on Monday to slow the spread of a deadly new coronavirus as medics staged strikes calling for the border to be completely sealed.

The semi-autonomous financial centre has 15 confirmed cases of the disease, most brought from the mainland where the epidemic began and has so far killed more than 360 people.

On Monday afternoon city leader Carrie Lam said all land crossings would be closed at midnight except for two bridges, the first connecting Hong Kong to Shenzhen and the second linking it with Zhuhai and casino hub Macau.

The city's airport -- one of the world's busiest -- would remain open to mainlanders, although there are already restrictions on people from central Hubei province where the epidemic began.

Lam said the latest closures -- which came after four crossings were shuttered last week -- would reduce the number of Chinese mainlanders and allow officials to focus resources on two land entry points as well as the airport.

""The numbers will come down,"" she told reporters.

She reiterated her view that a complete closure of the border would be impractical, economically damaging and discriminatory given the close links between Hong Kong and the mainland.

But calls for a full border closure are growing, fuelled by a historical mistrust of the mainland after nearly 300 Hong Kongers were killed in the 2003 SARS outbreak which was initially covered up by Beijing.

On Monday, hundreds of medical workers walked off their jobs for the start of a five-day strike.

The first batch were ""non-essential"" staff but the union has said more strikers, including frontline doctors and nurses, will walk out on Tuesday after they rejected the government's latest move.

The city's Hospital Authority, which employs 75,000 people, warned that half of pre-booked operations would be cancelled but the strike appeared to have little impact on emergency procedures.

Lam said her decision to close more border crossings was not sparked by the strikes, which she described as an ""irrational act"".

Some 13,400 mainlanders entered Hong Kong on Saturday, down from 27,800 three days earlier before the partial checkpoint closures were announced.

More than 100,000 Hong Kong residents are also returning to the city each day, 56,000 via land crossings with the mainland.

Criticism of the Lam administration's decision not to seal the border has come from opposition lawmakers and some medics -- but also from her own pro-Beijing camp.

The virus outbreak comes at a politically precarious time for Lam who has record-low approval ratings after deploying riot police to face down seven months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests.

Animosity towards Beijing and mainlanders has also risen steeply in recent years in lockstep with Hong Kongers pushing for democracy.

Many in Hong Kong feel an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is clamping down on the city's freedoms.

And they also resent economic pressures caused by the influx of mainland migrants and day-trippers, something that has helped ramp up prices of everything from pharmacy goods to retail rents and housing.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hong-kong-shuts-most-china-crossings-over-virus-as-medics-strike-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/hong-kong-shuts-most-china-crossings-over-virus-as-medics-strike.html
250,03-2-20,"With 'Thappad', we are trying to address elephant in the room: Taapsee Pannu","Calling domestic violence ""an elephant in the room"", Bollywood star Taapsee Pannu hopes her film ""Thappad"" starts a conversation around the issue.

In the Anubhav Sinha-directed movie, Taapsee plays an educated, upper middle-class woman who is forced to take stock of her relationship after being slapped by her husband.

""The film is not just about domestic violence. It is just one trigger. There is a dialogue in the film which says 'I can suddenly see all the unfair things that I did not notice earlier'. So 'Thappad' (slap) is a trigger and suddenly you see these things that were taken for granted in a relationship,"" Taapsee told PTI in an interview.

""We are trying to bring out the elephant in the room. Let's see how many discussions or how many awkward silences are there after people see the film,"" she added.

The 32-year-old actor said women are often told to ""tolerate"" and are given a different 'to-do' list than men for a relationship, which creates an imbalance and the film addresses these disparities.

""It is like there is a (separate) to-do list for both women and men that is expected from them in a relationship. Who decided this? Did you just blindly follow what was told to you? It is not a mistake of any one person but of everyone as a society that we are trying to normalise it,"" Taapsee said, adding that her character Amrita questions everyone, including herself, in the process.

According to Taapsee, it was a conscious decision to set the background of the story in an upper middle class, educated and well-to-do family.

""It is not that such things happen in those houses where people are uneducated, this happens in educated families as well. It is happening with three women out of five,"" she said.

Asked whether she had questioned herself as well, the actor said she unlearned certain things that were ingrained in her as a woman.

""When you are growing up you are told to follow certain things.... But with age as I became independent, I realised I am working as hard as a man of my age and I am earning well, maybe not more, but I can run my house like any other man. So why are rules different for me? I should not do certain things because I am a woman, why? When you start becoming independent, you become confident and start questioning things.""

But if you've been wondering how the Z Flip might work out in practice, it may well be of interest.

254,03-2-20,India's No 2 smartphone brand Vivo aims for a long innings,"Chinese smartphone maker Vivo which created history by becoming India's No 2 smartphone brand for the first time in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 2019, has firmly set eyes on thriving for a long term after building strong fundamentals in the last five years, says Nipun Marya, Director-Brand Strategy, Vivo India.

Vivo captured 21 per cent market share to reach the second spot, after Xiaomi, as Samsung slipped to third place with 19 per cent market share in Q4, according to Counterpoint Research.

""It was all about investing, building the foundation and creating strong fundamentals in order to become a successful brand in India. Those fundamentals are across verticals, say distribution for example. We started with offline as we wanted to be a strong retail player. Today, we are present at 70,000-plus outlets across the country,"" Marya told IANS during an interview.

""Service centres are another key milestone for us. Our service centres are company-owned and company-operated. We have close to 600-700 such centres, ensuring that our philosophy and brand ethics reach those who visit the centres because we want to serve our customers in the right way,"" Marya explained.

Vivo grew 76 per cent (year-on-year) in the full year 2019 and 134 per cent (year-on-year) in Q4 2019, driven by good performance of its budget segment series.

According to Marya, ""We were among the first mobile phone bands to set up their own surface-mount technology (SMT) lines. So now, our annual capacity is 33.4 million. Whatever we are making in India, we are selling here,"" Marya told IANS.

Over 10,000 people are directly employed at the Vivo factory in Greater Noida.

""The good thing is that our brand has reached the length and breadth of the country. Considering that 70,000-plus outlets we are present in today automatically means that we are practically present everywhere, said the Vivo executive.

Marya knows that consumer behaviour in India is fast changing so he is building devices which can sustain heavy workloads.

""If you were to ask me two main consumption patterns among the users -- one is content streaming and the other gaming. These are possible primarily for reasons like better device speed owing to next-gen processors, better displays and bigger screens. So, experience becomes more immersive, more seamless"".

""As far as gaming is concerned, it is still a niche in India but will soon explode on the scene,"" he added.

On launching a 5G device, Marya said there is still time.

""There is no 5G network here in India. Will people still buy a 5G phone? My hypothesis is yes because I understand the psychology of a consumer. When he's buying a 5G device, he wants to be future-ready, whether 5G will come in six months or one year or two years' time, they don't know right now. But they want to be future-ready,"" Marya explained.

Foldable as a form factor can certainly emerge, he added, but these are early days.

""I still believe that 2020 will not see foldable in a big way. Clearly, our business is not about who launches a device with a unique form factor first. I think it all boils down to how you keep giving better and better experiences and products to consumers.

""Moving early is not that relevant. Apple is a great example which is yet to enter the 5G race. I think while there is a lot of merit in innovation and innovation is certainly one good way, I don't think late movers have a disadvantage,"" Marya stressed.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-no-2-smartphone-brand-vivo-aims-for-a-long-innings-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/india-s-no-2-smartphone-brand-vivo-aims-for-a-long-innings.html
255,03-2-20,Elon Musk hires AI that 'reports directly' to him 24,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk who is a staunch critic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has now hired the technology, turning AI into a subordinate that ""reports directly"" to him daily.

Musk, who has crossed swords with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma over the role of AI, is finally giving the technology some space, like in his startup Neuralink which is creating a brain-machine interface.

Tagging Lex Fridman, popular host of the Artificial Intelligence podcast on YouTube, Musk tweeted: ""At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn't just icing on the cake, it the cake"" @lexfridman

""Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me & we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI,"" the Tesla CEO added.

For him, AI can only do 'benign' tasks and those jobs too are being evaluated critically by him.

Tesla is using advanced AI for vision and planning, supported by efficient use of inference hardware to achieve a general solution to full self-driving.

The company is building silicon chips that power its full self-driving software from the ground up, taking every small architectural and micro-architectural improvement into account while pushing hard to squeeze maximum silicon performance-per-watt.

The company is applying cutting-edge research to train deep neural networks on problems ranging from perception to control.

""Our per-camera networks analyze raw images to perform semantic segmentation, object detection and monocular depth estimation. Our birds-eye-view networks take video from all cameras to output the road layout, static infrastructure and 3D objects directly in the top-down view,"" says Tesla.

""Our networks learn from the most complicated and diverse scenarios in the world, iteratively sourced from our fleet of nearly 1 million vehicles in real time. A full build of Autopilot neural networks involves 48 networks that take 70,000 GPU hours to train. Together, they output 1,000 distinct tensors (predictions) at each timestep,"" the electric carmaker added.

The company is also developing core algorithms that drive the car by creating a high-fidelity representation of the world and planning trajectories in that space.

During a recent presentation about Neuralink's brain-machine interface technology, he said: ""Even in a benign AI scenario, we will be left behind.

""Hopefully, it is a benign scenario. But I think with a high-bandwidth brain-machine interface we can actually go along for the ride.

256,03-2-20,"All-weather bowling attack, improved batting overseas make India formidable: Mike Hesson","An all-weather bowling attack and batsmen's improved ability against pacers in overseas conditions have made India a formidable unit across formats, feels former New Zealand head coach Mike Hesson.

Hesson, who will take charge of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2020 IPL season, also said the 5-0 rout of New Zealand in the T20 series shows the current lot of Indian players is exceptionally talented.

""India are far better side now at present and they are improving all the time. Their bowling attack now suits all conditions around the world because their bowlers, pacers and spinners, are so good. That's something they haven't always had,"" Hesson told PTI in an interview.

""And their batsmen's ability to play pace bowling has also got better the more they have toured. So this group of players is exceptionally talented group. This series' win will help them (for the World Cup in Australia later this year).""

Up next is a three-match ODI series, and India-New Zealand will play the first match in Hamilton on Wednesday. Hesson said New Zealand's new-look pace attack will have its task cut out.

However, he feels the subsequent two-Test series will be a different proposition despite New Zealand's recent 0-3 loss in Australia.

""New Zealand had a poor tour of Australia and they would be hurt with that. But up to that point, their Test cricket was exceptional in the last 2-3 seasons, probably even longer.

""New Zealand know these conditions well. From a Test bowling point of view, if there is something in the surface, likes of Tim Southee will exploit it and Trent Boult should be back as well. Neil Wagner asks different questions too, so I am really looking forward to it.

""India will have an expectation of winning this Test series. But New Zealand is a very tough place to come and win Test matches. You cannot take anything for granted and I am sure India won't,"" said Hesson.

Hesson also blamed New Zealand for making some questionable decisions during the T20 series in which they lost back-to-back games in a Super Over.

""Losing in such a manner can become a bit of habit. Once New Zealand lost a couple (Super Overs), they almost started dreading the Super Over. And once you do that, you are not in the right frame of mind.

""Once again, even in both those Super Overs, New Zealand were in situations in this series where they could have won it. They will look back in hindsight and wonder if they used the right bowling option (Tim Southee) at that time.

""Changes of pace can be useful in a Super Over rather than necessarily trying to bowl yorkers,” reckoned Hesson.

While India ticked off a couple question marks in terms of Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey and the pace department with youngsters, there are still some question marks remaining in their World Cup preparation.

Power-hitting in the middle, for example, as Shivam Dube went off-colour as the series progressed. Additionally, Rishabh Pant didn't get any chances as K L Rahul kept wickets.

""They were trying out different players in this series (and home season). Tried Shivam Dube, and Manish Pandey, who were playing slightly different roles, and I think they have found enough about those players. Of course if you have the ability to bring in Hardik Pandya (currently injured) towards the backend, that gives an extra dimension.""

About the vital M S Dhoni question, Hesson opined that India already had plans in place if the former skipper didn't return after the IPL as speculated. Dhoni has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand in July.

""It seems like India have moved on. And they have certainly had to put their plans in place for when that (Dhoni's retirement) happens. I have heard in the press that a lot depends on the IPL in terms of how Dhoni operates. If he is in good touch then obviously he plays, but looks like India have moved past MSD at this stage.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/all-weather-bowling-attack--improved-batting-overseas-make-india-formidable--mike-hesson-2020-02-03.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/all-weather-bowling-attack--improved-batting-overseas-make-india-formidable--mike-hesson.html
