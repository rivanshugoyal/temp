0,27-3-20,What can we do for India?,"It’s perplexing that when China is still in lockdown, work has resumed on infrastructure projects in Tibet. India must watch these developments carefully and take necessary measures

The Prime Minister had appealed for a “Janta (people) Curfew” on March 22 in a bid to prevent the deadly Coronavirus from spreading into the community on a larger scale. At that time, Narendra Modi’s appeal got an overwhelming response from all citizens and we stood together to do his bidding. Unfortunately post the Janta Curfew, people are not taking the 21-day lockdown announced by Modi seriously and are coming out of the homes.

For instance, in Hyderabad’s Hi-tech City, where most of the highly-educated software professionals reside and software companies are located, there was a major traffic jam on March 25 and the streets were filled with people. Similar violations of the curfew are being reported from other parts of the country, like Delhi, Noida, Chandigarh and so on. This is despite repeated warnings by the Government about the need for social distancing to stem the spread of the Coronavirus.

We have witnessed the impact of the virus in Italy and the US due to the lack of social distancing, despite constant reminders by the Governments there on the importance of doing so. Citizens of India, and the world at large, are very conscious of the fundamental rights as guaranteed under the respective Constitutions of their countries. However, are we equally conscious of our duties towards our countries? As the citizens of India, we are obligated to abide by the fundamental duties contemplated under Article 51A of our Constitution. Article 51A was incorporated into the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976 and came into effect from January 3, 1977. The Article contemplates fundamental duties that citizens of the country are obligated to follow. These include abiding by the laws and the directions issued by the State in the interest of the public. These are all constitutional obligations cast upon the citizens to help in the promotion of the spirit of patriotism and for upholding the unity of the country.

Pursuant to the same, we performed our fundamental duty when we responded to the call for the “Janta Curfew.” Post the March 22 curfew, we still continue to have obligations towards the nation’s security and the health of its people. We should not only enjoy the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution but we are also obligated to adhere to the fundamental duties.

The Government has got every right to give appropriate directions in such times of calamities and we are obliged to follow the same. In case we do not discharge our obligations in relation to our fundamental duties/obligations as contemplated under Article 51A, the State would be entitled to register cases against us under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code ( IPC), more particularly under Section 269 and 270 of the IPC.

Section 269 says that, “Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act, which is and which he knows or has a reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life shall be punished with imprisonment up to six months.”

Section 270 of the IPC also implies that, “Whoever malignantly does any act, which is and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term, which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.”

The Government may also invoke the Epidemic Disease Act, 1887, for better prevention of spread of dangerous epidemic diseases. The Central Government may take measures as warranted and any violation of the same constitutes an offence under Section 188 of the IPC, which stipulates that any disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant is an offence and shall be punished with imprisonment for a month.

In case State Governments are unable to channelise financial resources, in the light of the present calamity which obviously has an enormous adverse effect on the country’s economy, the Central Government may invoke Article 360 of the Constitution and impose financial emergency. The cost of the COVID-19 lockdown in India has been pegged at Rs 9 lakh crore or four per cent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to a report by British brokerage Barclays. A report by Nomura had said that as over 75 per cent of the Indian economy will be shut down during the 21-day period, the lockdown will lead to a direct output loss of approximately 4.5 per cent.

At present, almost 80 per cent of the major financial centres of the country have been locked down, including commercial cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata and so on. The US dollar is at an all-time high against the Indian currency i.e., equal to Rs 75.62.

Most of our economy is dependent on small businesses and also the daily-wage earners. In the light of the total lockdown of the country, the State has to take care of the daily-wage workers who are deprived of their livelihood during this period as it would be impossible for them to survive without it.

In fact, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of financial relief and welfare measures on Thursday for the farmers, the poor, widows, daily-wage and migrant workers as the country prepares for a long lockdown. The Government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore Prime Minister Gareeb Kalyan Yojana. Sitharaman announced that the relief package would include direct benefit cash transfers, free Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to families living Below the Poverty Line (BPL), grains and pulses for the poor while the middle class would be able to withdraw funds from their Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) account. The Government will pay EPF contribution, both of the employer and employee, for three months for all those establishments with less than 100 employees out of which 90 per cent earn less than Rs 15,000 per month. It also announced collateral-free loan doubled to Rs 20 lakh to 63 lakh women self-help groups that will help seven crore households.

The Government also announced insurance of Rs 50 lakh for medical professionals who are on the Coronavirus frontline. As of now, the Government is fulfilling its responsibilities towards the citizens.

However, Article 360 says that if the President is satisfied that the situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or credit of India or any part thereof is threatened, he/she may declare a financial emergency.

During this period, the executive authority of the Union is empowered to give directions to the States to follow the same. Any such direction may also include a provision requiring the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class or people serving a State or the Union Government.

A provision requiring all Money Bills and other Financial Bills to be reserved for the consideration of the President after they are passed by the Legislature of the State is also there. A proclamation issued under Article 360 shall remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament. Once approved, it remains in force until revoked by the President. Till now no such financial emergency has been imposed under Article 360 and the Government is doing all it can to mitigate the financial woes of the people that have been brought upon them by the lockdown. However, this may not be the case in the long run as the Coronavirus cases across the country are rising exponentially on a daily basis.

State Governments across the country are preparing quarantine centres in preparation of the expected onslaught of the virus if we are unable to contain the contagion. In these circumstances it may become necessary for the Central Government to take the appropriate decision to invoke Article 360 of the Constitution or else the State Governments may face a severe financial crunch.

The Modi Government has taken the lockdown decision in the nick of time although it could have done it a bit earlier. And all the citizens are obligated to heed the advice and warnings given by the State and Central Governments in this regard by confining themselves to their homes and only come out in case there is an emergency and for buying essential items.

It is time for us to realise the seriousness of the pandemic and follow the social distancing and lockdown instructions given by the Government to the letter. If we expect our Government to respect our fundamental rights then we have to perform our fundamental duties, too. It is not a one-way street. It is mandated by the Constitution.

1,27-3-20,COD a boon for everyone,"The Govt will be able to improve efficiency and citizens will be saved from the unnecessary hassle of visiting various offices

Recently, students of a college in Delhi University, while being acquainted with the “Digital India” initiative of the Narendra Modi Government, were asked how many of them had gone to a Government office for availing services. About 90 per cent of them raised their hands. When they were asked how many of them would like to go back to the Government office for availing its services, the response was a big, resounding “No” from almost all of them. Asked to give a reason for this response, many of them cited long queues, uncooperative staff, being made to run from one counter to the other, rudeness, tardiness and the lackadaisical attitude of Government servants, as some of the factors that would prevent them from going back. And this was not just restricted to departments run by State administrations, it also included offices run by the Central Government.

The writing on the wall is clear. Given a choice, no one, particularly the new generation, wants to visit Government offices to get the simplest of work done. The experience of visiting a Government office, even if it is equipped with computers and air conditioners and other modern amenities, has not been very good for common citizens, particularly the younger generation, which is short on time and patience and has gotten used to getting what they want at the click of the mouse or a tap on a touchscreen. Apart from this, the inconvenience of travelling from their place of residence or work to the Government department, the time required to be spent on getting the job done, procedural ambiguity and availability of alternatives for such service delivery, play a major role in putting people off Government offices.

Today, there are various products being purchased through endless e-commerce platforms and services being availed through technological platforms where citizens need not visit the brick and mortar shops/offices. In view of these emerging technological advancements, the expectations of citizens have enhanced significantly and they are willing to pay for services delivered to them at their doorstep and the convenience of making payment at the time of delivery of services, which is called Cash on Delivery (COD).

In fact, it was Flipkart, which after its launch in 2007, revolutionised e-commerce through its COD payment model. Thanks to the COD model, Flipkart’s products reached far-flung areas of the country. People, who did not have the facility of online banking or credit cards, were the ones who propelled the COD model.

A Nielsen Global Connected Commerce Survey report says that about 83 per cent of shoppers in India favour utilising cash for all their online purchases. Customers also hesitate to input card information because of different online frauds and hacking. It says that the larger part of the payment made by buyers for online stores like Flipkart, Amazon and so on, was COD, where 72 per cent were from significant urban communities and 90 per cent from small towns.

The online retail sector is booming and COD is a major contributor to this. Despite the fact that e-wallets and internet banking services are on the rise, the COD payment model is still preferred by a large section of society. Payment choices like internet banking, credit and debit cards and e-wallets cater to just 30 per cent of online purchases as compared to COD. One sector, which could further boost the COD payment model, is the delivery of Government services. Citizens generally require birth certificates, domicile/residence certificates, caste certificates, income certificates, ration card, election card, school/college certificate, marriage certificate, land records, land registration documents, various permissions/licences for doing business and organising social functions/events and so on. Filing Government challans or taxes, getting various licences are some other services that could be delivered at home.

Citizens should be able to avail services through online processes where they can attach various documents as required by the Government and the Government/institutions concerned should send the certificate/licences/documents to their residence/office after finishing the verification and other due processes. Citizens are willing to pay the courier charges and “fee” as prescribed by the Government.

COD for Government-to-Citizen (G2C) services is one business model which can do wonders for both the Government as well as the people. While the Government will be able to cut costs in terms of office set-ups and improve efficiency, citizens will be saved from the unnecessary hassles of visiting Government offices.

The COD payment model from delivery of G2C services would have multiple advantages in terms of reduced carbon emissions as people won’t have to drive to the service centres. There will be massive time saving and fewer man-days lost as well. It will cut graft and the system of touts as officers/staff will process the applications on a “first come, first serve” basis and reduce undue favouritism. The COD payment model for G2C services will redefine the process and character of Government services and bring out the “service” part in the true sense. COD for G2C services will be a game-changer for enhancing transparency in Government service delivery.

2,27-3-20,Covid-19 will hit the farm sector,"If sowing is delayed in the Zaid season or farmers miss this window because of late delivery of seeds, or no seeds at all, we are possibly looking at a famine-like situation emerging and also extreme feed shortages coupled with food price inflations later this year

Humanity is besieged by the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the moment. However, more than the virus, its manifestation has gained notoriety in the world. As economies plummet, fear reigns our minds, streets and homes. Sneezing and coughing have become a reprehensible act in these times. The Indian Government, like others around the world, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) are trying very hard to contain this global pandemic. But the threat surrounds us. A major world power like China has fallen prey to this disease. Iran, Italy and now the US are being ravaged by it and it is only a matter of weeks, if not days, before it hits the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations and India, with its full might. As of now we have have 694 confirmed cases and 14 deaths in the country but this number is going up daily. As a safety measure, the Union Government has announced a 21-day lockdown across the country. It is a commendable step to curb the spread of the virus.

But ahead of the curve, black markets were already trading new commodities — masks, soaps, disinfectants and so on. People continue to hoard supplies. Very soon black markets will load up on essential medicines, foods and so on and as the desperation level and death toll rise, the agrarian sector and seeds will be devoured by the Coronavirus mayhem, too.

Farming is the backbone of our economy and most of our agriculture today depends on quality seeds and the organised seed sector. Our food production is also dependent on availability of human resources or farm labour and free movement of agricultural products — including seeds, fertilisers and so on. Both are restricted at this time. The US has shut its borders followed by the European Union (EU) and the world has cancelled visas and restricted the movement of people.

Even when the lockdown in India is lifted, the current environment of fear can only herald decreased availability of farm hands in the near future. There will be a rise in farm wages for this season and we may see the cost of production of foods rising. The threat is even greater in the poultry sector, as prices of chicken in Delhi have nosedived. People are falsely conjoining avian flu with COVID-19 and this is leading to greater losses in the poultry sector. Even before the 21-day curfew began, the workers were reluctant to work on poultry farms due to the rumours.

The global seed sector is deeply dependent on a global supply chain of production regions and no one country is a seed sovereign by itself. The freezing of ports and seeds shipments will derail agricultural productivity later this year. Small and medium seed traders and small seed companies may also be at risk, as they don’t store vast stocks of seeds. They rely on the international and domestic shipments before each season. A disruption will be detrimental to their business.

World over, March and April are a very important time for planting spring crops such as maize, sunflower, soybean, canola, spring wheat and barley, open field vegetables and so on, north of the Equator and autumn crops to the south. In India too, we will see the sowing of Zaid season crops soon. If sowing is delayed in the Zaid season or farmers miss this window because of late delivery or seeds or no seeds at all, we are possibly looking at a famine-like situation emerging and also extreme feed shortages coupled with food price inflations later this year.

The International Seed Federation (ISF) has sought to assuage fears citing the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR) statement: “There is currently no evidence that food, including seed, is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus. Transmission via surfaces, which have recently been contaminated with the virus is, nonetheless, possible through smear infections. However, this is only likely to occur during a short period after contamination, due to the relatively low stability of Coronaviruses in the environment.” What this means is that there is no evidence yet and seeds may not be a gateway.

These are tough times and call for courage and truth. We need to make informed and scientific evidence-based decisions so that COVID-19 doesn’t evolve into another monster which threatens not just our health but also our agriculture. The Indian Government and other Governments of the world should not impose any restrictions on agrarian products, including seeds. Seed companies and exporters should take responsibility for the health and safety of workers involved in the shipments. Port authorities have strenuous months ahead due to the massive work of screening shipments and people and they should be aided in this. The virus spreads from person to person, so the latest WHO directives should be broadcast and people and workers need to be made aware of them. Shipments of seeds anyways have a very low risk of spreading viruses and hence should not be stopped or delayed. The world must come together in this time of crisis. We need to become conscious and alert as this pandemic affects each one of us. We have to fight not only the Coronavirus but fear itself.

3,27-3-20,Force majeure,"While the Modi Government deserves wholehearted support in tackling COVID, a few correctives should be in place. Wholehearted and not unthinking support is the need of the hour

We live in strange and unnerving times. India and the world are currently in the midst of a raging battle against a common enemy — Coronavirus. The total number of cases in India at the time of writing stood at 686 and the number of deaths at 13. Both these numbers, unfortunately, are expected to rise over the weeks that will follow. Numbers across the world are staggering. The death toll in Italy and Spain have reached in the thousands, eclipsing that of China’s.

The most worrisome aspect of the virus is not the fatality associated with it — though for the elderly and those without adequate medical care this figure is frighteningly high — but its speed of transmission. The virus took just 67 days to reach the first one lash and in the next 15 days, it infected the next two lash people across the world. The modern world has rarely witnessed an enemy about whom we know so little and which moves relentlessly and ruthlessly. Though this does not require saying, yet: We cannot beat the virus unless we pull in the same direction. This is not the time to squabble as there will possibly never be a more unifying enemy in our lifetime.

In the light of this very different world that you and I have woken up to, it is important to support and recognize the efforts of the Indian Government, healthcare professionals and workers, the media, policemen and all other individuals who have put themselves in the line of fire. The Prime Minister has our full support in tackling the virus. While his decision to impose a nationwide lockdown may seem to be a bit too harsh, we must keep in mind that the Government has our best interests in mind. The Finance Minister has also been announcing several relief measures for the poor and the marginalised. I cannot commend this move enough. With the economy, especially small businesses, in shock, I hope this is the first step in dealing with this unprecedented crisis.

During this time, we must also be grateful to the country’s federal structure, several Chief Ministers, most notably Arvind Kejriwal and Pinarayi Vijayan, who have truly shown their leadership capabilities at an hour when this quality is necessary and found wanting at times. While I endorse and support the measures taken by the Government to tackle the unique beast of COVID-19, I, as an Indian, would also like to put forward a few suggestions and perspectives that I believe, can aid our fight against this dreadful disease and, hopefully, see us emerge victorious at the end of this long battle. I hope that the many trollers, who often attack any piece of writing by looking at the writer rather than the content, see this article in that spirit. Stranger things are happening in times of Corona.

The need for a down-up approach: While the lockdown is necessary to contain the virus, it is important to ensure that the cure has (i) the desired effect, ie, it prevents people from congregating together in large groups and (ii) does not provide greater pain to the very sections of society it seeks to protect than the disease itself. The Prime Minister’s speech while commendable in many ways was found significantly wanting on this count.

By giving just a few hours’ time for the 21-day lockdown to kick in and that, too, without adequate disclosures/detailing regarding the provision for essential services, the Prime Minister caused widespread panic across the country. There were massive crowds that assembled around grocery stores and chemists, fearing the worst. The impact of this crowding will only be seen later but it was distinctly avoidable.

The Prime Minister, for example, could have taken a note from the Delhi Government, which had itself called for a lockdown two days prior to his announcement. The Delhi Government has been more stringent than the Union Government pertaining to certain measures. The only difference has been the approach followed by both. The former has rather been more down-up than top-down in its tactics. This system has been successfully implemented by various firms as well, where employees and workers at the ground level have been able to provide accurate feedback on what measures work while dealing with the customers.

In the case of Governments, the customer is the vast population of this great country. Therefore, as is becoming more obvious day by day, a top-down approach does not work. Instead, we need a clear line of communication between the Prime Minister and the public. This includes taking a press conference where the media, which has been and will be crucial in highlighting the shortcomings of the Government’s measures, can highlight questions that the public, too, have been raising. Such press conferences can be done effectively through social media platforms like Facebook live events with limited access to accredited journalists. However, to limit this only to the Prime Minister would be a big mistake. Chief Ministers, too, need to follow a similar approach. This is why Delhi Chief Minster Kejriwal must be applauded for being proactive in this regard.

Similarly, there are widespread reports of police officers in a number of States disrupting the supply of essential services by lashing their lathis on workers, trying to reach their place of work or transporting essential services. E-tailers allege that up to 15,000 litres of milk and 10,000 kg of vegetables were dumped due to police action. This must be stopped at the earliest. Certain Police Commissioners have held discussions with e-commerce service providers and come to the conclusion that they would pass instructions to their officers. However, this step must be taken a little further. Officers must hold Facebook live discussions where citizens can highlight areas where they are facing discomfort or harassment. I do not blame the policemen entirely on this count as till now, they have only been given broad guidelines to ensure no movement on the roads. The requirement at this stage is one of nuance, which cannot come from a top-down approach towards governance.

An active bureaucracy: Another step which I think can help is to involve the bureaucracy. I have held many discussions with bureaucrats, and they feel they can contribute in alleviating the issues faced by the public while also maintaining social distancing and following all lockdown norms. One clear area where this can help is with respect to daily-wage and migrant workers. As a result of the lockdown, daily-wage and migrant workers have been left to fend for themselves. The sudden decision to stop all trains and buses from inter-State travel has left lakhs and lakhs of workers in the middle of nowhere or without a roof over their heads. There are numerous stories of workers and children walking hundreds of kilometres to reach their villages.

While a large number of readers will have the luxury of dealing with the panic and pain caused due to the outbreak of Coronavirus with their families by their side, this essential support system is not within the reach for these migrant workers. On this count, I plead that the Government takes steps while acting within the lockdown protocol, to ensure that these workers can be transported to their home States in buses with strict social distancing norms and sanitation practices in place. The bureaucracy can help implement these steps. It is in times like these that the bureaucracy can and must come to the fore, even if they do so in regulated numbers. By allowing a large number of them to sit at home, we are being deprived of this valuable resource.

Of course, it is easier to speak than it is to write and easier to write than to practise but just like every Indian, I want the country to come out of this crisis as a shining example to the world. While I support the Modi Government wholeheartedly in its efforts to tackle the virus, wholeheartedly does not mean unthinkingly. In order to beat the Coronavirus, wholehearted and not unthinking support is the need of the hour.

4,27-3-20,Humanitarian crisis,"Labourers don’t have bank accounts and are out of the welfare arc. As they migrate, the flu could swamp rural India

State borders now present a picture of reverse human migration as thousands of daily wage earners, casual labourers and vendors, who do not have a bank account or even money to save, trudge back to their home States despite a lockdown. With no buses, trucks or trains, they have decided to surrender to destiny and return to their villages on foot. For even without a day’s work, they would not be able to get food for their families or rent the hovel they live in at slum clusters. Food shortages and uncontrolled hoarding have meant that they have not been able to get basic rations over the last two days, leading to widespread panic. It is a hard choice between starvation and the flu. In the absence of soup kitchens or shelters, the vast numbers of India’s unorganised labour market won’t even be able to avail the economic relief measures announced by the Government. And they are going back home, thinking they will live off the land with whatever subsistence farming can give them. There will be a roof over their heads where they do not have to pay rent. There’s no agricultural activity either, signalling a low output of food crops that may foist another problem on the nation later. This is a humanitarian crisis like no other. Let us not forget migrant returnees may have already unwittingly carried Coronavirus into India’s vast rural swathes, which are unaware, unprepared and under-equipped to deal with the criticality of a health emergency of this scale. And considering they are travelling in clusters, all of them could be potentially infected by the time they reach from carriers among them. Then the whole purpose of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 21-day lockdown, to break the transmission cycle of the virus, would get defeated. Worst, rural India could be swamped. Assuming these “non-banked” people even avail of the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana and get 5 kg per person rice/wheat each month for the next three months in addition to 5 kg of rice/wheat that they already get, they would rather use these benefits at their village than be homeless and helpless in cities. This unprecedented flight of migrant workers out of our cities, be it Rajasthan or Telangana, poses a new challenge in our fight against the virus. Containing and settling them at shelters in a specified location pose the biggest challenge. Frankly, India has not had time to prepare for the human dimension of the virus or the lockdown. The WHO did lead it up the garden path, not pressing the panic buttons early on. There was a denial about the inevitability of community explosion, given the density of our population and the failure of Indians to take to social distancing, isolation and quarantining protocols seriously. Now experts are saying the lockdown would have been effective had it been enforced a week or two before and that we are still two steps behind the virus.

According to reports, over 2,000 daily wage workers in Ahmedabad took to their feet and other means of transport for their homes back in Rajasthan. Thousands of wagers are walking long distances, even to the extent of 100 and 300 km, and often on empty stomach to reach their villages. According to the Economic Survey of 2018-19, over 90 per cent of our total workforce is “informal.” The worrying part is that the NITI Aayog estimates show that India’s informal sector employees are approximately 85 per cent of all workers. The Economic Survey of 2016-2017 had indicated an annual flow of close to nine million migrants among States between 2011 and 2016. Internationally, too, migrants are posing newer challenges to managing the epidemic. Borders throughout the Middle East tend to be porous with political refugees, economic migrants and others often travelling along informal routes. It is very difficult under such circumstances to monitor who is entering and leaving what country. Also, these people cannot access public healthcare. This has caused much of the spread in nations around Iran, too. Now imagine that with our States. We are quite precariously perched but trying to flatten the curve would mean not just lockdowns or an economic package but aggressive testing, isolation and surveillance. Where are these facilities in rural India? If we are to ride this out and look ahead, there can be no two ways about rearranging a nation’s health priorities. As the PM said, Jaan hai to Jahaan hai.

5,27-3-20,Data crunch,"Video-streaming services find themselves restricting data consumption across the world

As almost half of humanity finds itself under lockdown, some of the few companies that might be benefitting belong to the video-streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime globally, and others like Hotstar, Voot and MX Player in India. However, they also have had to face unique challenges, thanks to the Chinese contagion. Production of movies and television shows has come to a screeching halt, forcing players like Netflix to establish a $100 million fund to ensure that production crews, many of whom do not have permanent jobs, have access to some funds at least. But the bigger problem is the pressure that such streaming services have put on mobile networks. With more people staying home and watching movies and television shows online, there has been a surge in video consumption.

As a result, both telecom operators and Governments across the world have requested that these popular services reduce the quality of the service. With high-definition streaming using upwards of two megabits per second and Ultra High Definition 4K streaming using up 10 megabits per second, mobile firms, who are the main networks in India, are finding themselves under huge amounts of strain. Many streaming services have already announced that they would be suspending High Definition and Ultra-High Definition streaming on cellular networks with immediate effect. People consuming data on WiFi or broadband networks can still enjoy preferred quality streaming. During a time of a national emergency, which we are facing right now, mobile networks must be kept free. Heavy data consumption is clogging up the networks. While the amount of mobile data available and its prices have been a big boon for the Indian economy over the past two years, the fact is that reducing streaming quality to standard definition will make little or no difference on mobile phones and at the same time keep the networks free for emergencies. This is a responsible act by both the telecom operators and the streaming service providers. However, this thankfully does not apply to fibre and copper networks but the reach of those in Indian households is extremely limited in the first place. This, of course, highlights how India and the world need to strengthen their data networks and make them faster so that more people can use it. It also highlights how different companies get affected when a crisis of this nature emerges and how they are working around it. Hopefully, things will return to normal soon and people will go back to office and the days of “Netflix and Chill” will return but for now, “Netflix and stay at home.”",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/data-crunch-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/data-crunch.html

On Thursday, Lallu said that a large number of people working as construction workers, labourers etc. had embarked on a walk for hundreds of kilometres to reach their native places as public transport had been suspended due to the lockdown.

“In the absence of transport, these hapless workers have no option but to trudge for long distances in the hope of making it to their homes and families. Pictures of men, women and small children undertaking the arduous journey without food, water and shade is heart wrenching,” Lallu said, referring to interviews being aired by some news channels on Thursday.

“I demand that the Union and UP governments identify such people and provide food, water and other facilities especially for children. Besides, the government should also arrange for their safe return to their homes. But before that, they should also be tested free of cost for corona-virus,” the Congress leader suggested.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-cong-chief-urges-govt-to-help-stranded-workers.html

|

Unable to withstand the calamities of nature over a long stretch of time, a farmer in Banda decided to put an end to his miseries by immolating himself on Wednesday.

Ironically, while the Banda district administration claimed to be looking into the suicide motive, the police dismissed it as an “outcome of a family feud”.

As per reports, Hargovind Chaturvedi (60) of Gumanganj area of Nairaini (Banda) owned a land holding of 25 bighas and had taken a bank loan of Rs 1 lakh for the present crop season. But recent untimely rains and hailstorm had wreaked havoc on the standing crops in his field, forcing him to worry about ways to repay the bank loan on time.

To add to his woes, the recent lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus aggravated his plethora of problems.

Unable to cope up with his miseries, Hargovind finally decided to put an end to them on Wednesday night and doused himself with kerosene and set himself afire. His family members somehow put out the fire and rushed him to a nearby primary health centre where he succumbed to the burns soon after.

Sub-Divisional Magistrate Vandita Srivastava told local media persons on Thursday that she was not aware of the incident and assured of inquiring into the details. However, SHO of Nairaini police station, Girendra Singh, said that the victim committed suicide “due to a family dispute”’

A case was registered and investigation is underway.

He alleged that the State administration was not prepared for the lockdown of 21 days declared by the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi to combat the menace of Coronavirus (COVID-19). Talking to The Pioneer, the Congress leader said that the lockdown has brought the poor and daily wage earners on the verge of starvation. “In my constituency more than 50 percent population is of the poor. These poor fellows have not made any preparation for the lockdown. They don’t have enough food to feed their families. Similar situation prevails in all parts of the state.

I request the state government to provide one month’s ration free of cost to every ration card holder of the state,’’ he said. The Congress MLA added many ration cards are not updated so they are not online.

17,27-3-20,"I am first a sanyasi' then a CM, says Yogi Adityanath","Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the government’s first priority was to protect the poor and the daily wage earners as the lockdown would financially hit them very badly because “as a sanyasi, I believe that serving humanity is serving God”.

“I am a chief minister but before that I am a yogi and a sanyasi. My background is connected with Hindu mutt which is dedicated to manav sewa. Nar Sewa, Narayan Sewa’ is the mantra of Hindu philosophy. I have seen the dedication of mandirs and mutts towards serving humanity, particularly the poor and the downtrodden,” the chief minister said in a freewheeling interview to this reporter in the state capital.

“Therefore, when we talked about lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, my first thought went towards these daily wage earners and I wondered how they would make their both ends meet if restrictions were imposed. I have seen how mutts make arrangements to provide free food to the poor without looking at one’s caste, creed and colour. So, I told the officials to first chalk out plans for the poor and then go for lockdown,” Yogi said, tapping softly the armrest of the sofa he was sitting on at his 5, Kalidas Marg official residence in Lucknow.

The chief minister said that at that juncture he had two options; one to seek help from the Centre and second, arrange funds for the poor. “We opted for the second option. I asked the officials to make all arrangements so that no one slept empty stomach,” he said, elaborating on the ‘Nar Sewa Narayan Sewa’ project his government has launched.

The Uttar Pradesh government has launched a scheme under which daily wage labourers are given Rs 1,000. The money was transferred to the accounts of 20 lakh daily wage earners through DBT.

“Our government is giving a maintenance allowance of Rs1,000 to street vendors, rickshaw-pullers, e-rickshaw drivers, construction workers and porters who have lost employment because of the lockdown. People have been asked to stay indoors. Railway stations and airports have been shut down because of coronavirus. Buses are off the road. This means rickshaw-pullers, e-rickshaw operators and tempo drivers have no work. It is the responsibility of the state to provide relief to these people and this money (maintenance allowance) will come handy for them,” Yogi said, adding that the government support would continue till lockdown.

The chief minister said that the government was providing free ration to poor people having below poverty line (BPL) ration cards, destitute, old age pension holders, construction workers and daily wage workers who were not entitled for Rs 1,000 benefit.

“They will get 20 kg of wheat and 15 kg of rice. District magistrates have been issued directives in this regard and sufficient funds have been sent to all districts,” he said.

In 2017, during floods, I had adopted a model, which proved successful, where food packets were distributed among the flood ravaged people. I asked why can’t we do the same now also and give to the people food packets having rice, flour, oil and other basic things. Thus, we made a plan to distribute food to over 1.60 crore poor families who have antyodaya card or are very poor,” he said.

Yogi takes a pause, looks around the long hall having sofa sets along the wall which has big pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind. The side table has a memento presented by members of minority community while at one corner there is a fresco of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar presented by Ambedkar Maha Sabha.

“Look, the world is in the grip of fear. The UP government had started making arrangements since January. Isolation wards were identified in each district and within a day or two we will have over 10,000 isolation beds across the state. The bureaucracy has been asked to stand up to the challenge,” he said, adding that people were listening to him and this was the time officials too worked as directed.

Why do people listen to you, Is it because you are a chief minister or a sanyasi?

Smile returns on the face of the chief minister. “This is the ‘sanskar’ of Bharat where ‘sanyasi’ holds an important place. But when people see the aacharan (conduct) of ‘sanyasi’ and his dedication for the masses, their affection for him increases,” Yogi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/i-am-first-a-sanyasi--then-a-cm--says-yogi-adityanath.html

21,27-3-20,Punjab to distribute door-to-door,"To help the daily wagers and unorganized labourers across the state who are worst hit by the curfew imposed in light of the COVID-19 crisis, the Punjab Government would distribute 10 lakh packets of dry rations to help them through the contingency situation.

Announcing this, the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said that the packets, containing 10 kg atta, two kg dal, and two kg of sugar each, would be distributed in the slums and other pockets where such daily wagers and labourers are staying in large numbers.

At the same time, the Chief Minister also ordered that these packets should be made available at the offices of the Deputy Commissioners to support any such persons who do not get covered in the door-to-door distribution and may call the helpline numbers for food.

“While the economic package announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is welcome and would provide support to many sections of the society, there is unfortunately no immediate relief provided by the Centre to the daily wage earners and the unorganized sector workers, who have been left in the lurch following the curfew or lockdown imposition,” he said.

Earlier, during a video conference conducted by Congress national president Sonia Gandhi with the Chief Ministers of the party-led states, Capt Amarinder said that all efforts were being made by his Government to reach out to the poor in Punjab.

He updated the Congress president of the various measures being taken in the state to provide succour to the citizens in this hour of crisis.

The Chief Minister further said that all arrangements were being made to ensure home delivery of essential items and services, and to reach out to those in need at their doorstep.

Clear directions have been issued to both, the police and civil administration, to streamline the support and delivery systems in every district, he said, adding that there was marked improvement in this regard today and the situation would further stabilize on this count in the next couple of days.

23,27-3-20,Police criticized for using force against violators,"Even as the people continue to violate strict curfew rules across the State, the Punjab police has come under fire from all sections for using the force to check the violations.

On Thursday, as many as 170 FIRs, including four against those who violated home quarantined rules, have been registered and 262 persons have been arrested for violating the quarantine and curfew guidelines.

Lashing out, Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal expressed his “strong disapproval” of the insensitivity being shown by the Punjab Government in implementing the “constructive measures” to fight coronavirus pandemic.

Reiterating SAD’s full support to all measures of the Union and the Punjab Governments, Sukhbir said that the people of Punjab were not prepared for the sudden curfew and were taken by surprise by its suddenness.

“While I understand the urgency of the matter, the Government needed to ensure its implementation through sensitive and persuasive means rather than use of brute force against those violating curfew, especially against the women. It is against our culture to force women to do sit ups that too by male cops. This is totally unacceptable,” he said.

He added that there are so many psychological, practical and legal means available to ensure effective enforcement of the curfew regulations, and thus “there is no need to humiliate the self-respecting Punjabis who have by and large been cooperating with the government's measures in this direction”.

“Any curfew of such long duration can be effective only with the people’s cooperation. The government must use the media, especially the electronic and online media, to spread awareness rather than panic and frustration among the people. We support the government's efforts but disagree with the methods being adopted. This must change,” he said.

However, he appealed to the people to fully cooperate with the administration in observing curfew regulations. “It is in our own interest to stay at home and look after the elders and children during this challenging period,” he added.

40,153 COPS ON GROUND

A total of 40,153 police employees, in different ranks, have been deployed on ground in various districts or police commissionerates across the State for enforcement of curfew including sealing of affected clusters — Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr) and Jalandhar rural districts — besides maintenance of essential supplies and law and order.

Since Sunday, a total of 839 FIRs have been registered with 1291 persons being arrested, with Amritsar rural, Tarn Taran, Fatehgarh Sahib, and Mohali topping the list.

PUNJAB POLICE LOGS INTO INNOVATION

Coronavirus has not only brought out the tough side of the Punjab police, but also its innovative capabilities.

Making the best use of its social media profiles to send across the ‘stay at home’ messages, the state police chief Dinkar Gupta has shared interesting GIFs from his official Twitter handle with #PunjabFightsCorona.

Showing why one should stay behind closed doors, DGP shared a tweet with a picture of a rocking chair at one side written “Rest at Home” above it and a picture of a coffin on another with words “Rest in Peace” — sending across a clear message loud and clear.

“You can stay behind closed doors, or below the ground. Choose well,” he tweeted with the gif.

In another tweet, the DGP has shared a gif written “VIRUS” with flashing letter ‘U’, saying “only U can break the chain”. “1 virus. 1.3 billion people. Let’s not give this virus a chance to win. Practice all the safety measures you can,” he wrote.

In fact, the police has also roped in renowned Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh to narrate the story of “Gawaacha Gurbakhsh” (Missing Gurbakhsh), who has returned from Italy and has gone missing, infecting people.

CONGRESS AND BKU RAISE FARMERS' PROBLEMS

Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja wrote a letter to Khattar on Thursday drawing his attention to the problems likely to be faced by farmers in the wake of delay in procurement of crops.

Selja said the State Government should set up a round-the-clock dedicated helpline for farmers where all their concerns should be clarified. Demanding waiving of crop loans, she also said that the credit limit of Kisan Credit Cards used by farmers should be increased.

As delay is expected in wheat procurement, the Government should make arrangement to store the produce of farmers or get it lifted directly from their fields, she said in the letter.

Meanwhile, BKU's Gurnam Singh said the government should not wait till April 20 to procure wheat. “By that time, 90 per cent of wheat would have been harvested and procurement mandis are flooded with the crop at one go and will not help the situation. The Government should make arrangements to procure it from the fields at its own pace,” he added.

Singh also said the Government should give advance of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per acre to the farmers who have to pay to farm labourers and to meet other expenses related to harvesting and storing of crop.

“The Government can deduct this amount later from farmers accounts when they procure the produce and make payment to farmers for it,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/procurement-of-mustard--wheat-to-start-from-april-15--khattar.html

Singh said the Congress has set a wrong precedent by taking such a decision.

The former CM said the Congress even after more than 15 months in government, has not come out of its vindictive political mentality and has been working on an agenda of changing the names of institutions and schemes.

“Such a decision is unexpected and painful,” Singh said.

He further said that a true political ideology is not that of tampering with names.

“The contributions of leading personalities of the state like Pandit Mahdavrao Sapre and former MP Chandulal Chandrakar in the country’s freedom struggle, is incomparable.

“Had the state government wants to give due respect to both the great personalities, then it could have been better if the new institutions were named after them,” Singh said.

But by changing the name of the journalism university, the state government has given a wrong signal among the education sector and setting a wrong precedent, he added.

The former CM said the founder of the state, late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had laid the foundation of the institution, the identity of which is being altered and it reflects the political immaturity.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-maligning-political-environment-of-state--raman.html

The move, aimed at decongesting state prisons in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, was taken in line with the Supreme Court’s directions regarding the same.

Disclosing, Punjab Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Thursday said that the Supreme Court had constituted a high powered committee under the chairmanship of Punjab Legal Services Authority chairperson with Principal Secretary (Jails) and ADGP (Prisons) as members.

“The committee has circulated detailed criteria and procedure to initiate the releasing of prisoners. The convict prisoners will be released

on parole for six weeks and under-trial prisoners on interim-bail for six weeks,” said Randhawa.

The Minister informed that there were around 24,000 prisoners lodged in 24 jails across the State against an authorized capacity of 23,488.

As per committee report, while the primary aim was to protect the prisoners’ health and restrict transmission of COVID-19 by decongestion of prisons, the overall good of the society and maintenance of order in the society in these extraordinary times was also kept in mind while making the recommendations.

The committee hence, recommended release of convicts on parole for a period of six weeks. “Prisoners sentenced up to seven years with maximum two under-trial cases (both on bail); and further should have availed last parole peacefully, are to be considered for release on parole,” said the Minister.

The Minister pointed out that the prisoners already out on parole shall be given six week extension in parole in order to ensure quarantining of prisons. As a one-time measure, the Superintendents of concerned jails have been empowered to process the cases of parole so as to expedite the process of release.

An under-trial shall be considered for a six-week interim bail, if he or she is facing one or two cases, in which maximum punishment is seven years or less. Special cases under certain heads of crime such as Section 498-A, 420, 406, 324, 325, 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Excise Act and those under section 107/151 CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) shall also be considered for the bail.

Camp courts shall be held on jail premises itself for grant of interim bail.

However, those convicted or charged under POCSO Act, 376 IPC, 379-B IPC, acid attack, UAPA, Explosives Act and foreign nationals shall not be considered for release. Also, conditions have been put on for those covered under NDPS Act cases.

The committee has relaxed the conditions further for release of prisoners suffering from chronic diseases like diabetes, HIV, pregnant women and those above 65 years of age.

To ensure order in the prisons, the DLSA chairperson has been asked to visit the jail on every alternate day to interact with the prisoners after taking necessary precautions.

The Department of Prisons and Correctional Services is also granting remission as per Punjab Jail Manual to eligible prisoners.

As per the Apex Court’s directions, physical presence of under-trial prisoners before the courts has been stopped and recourse to videoconferencing has been taken.

The state president of Anganwadi Workers Association, Rekha Negi said that they will not support the decision of the State Government to deliver ration supplies to the locals at home with the help of Anganwadi workers unless the government agrees to their demands.

The Anganwadi workers had protested for about two months against the Government and in support of their demands which included raise in allowance, travel allowance, provident fund and health insurance. They had deferred their protest after they were reportedly assured by the State administration to consider their demands by March 10 after making a committee where all the issues could be raised by Anganwadi workers. Reportedly, the State Women Empowerment and Child Development Minister Rekha Arya recently said that if the need arises, the Anganwadi workers will also be deployed for the supplies of ration to the people at home. However, Negi rejected the plan saying that the government pays too less to expect such a risky job amid the threat of novel coronovirus (COVID-19).

67,27-3-20,BJP hails Rs 1.7 L-cr relief package for weaker sections,"The BJP on Thursday welcomed the Rs 1.7 lakh-crore relief package announced by the Union Government for daily wage earners, farmers, women and senior citizens and pensioners in the organised and unorganised sectors saying it will help the poor sections of the society when the nation is on a 21-day lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

BJP President Jagat Prasad Nadda said the wide-range of economic package under Prime Minister ‘Garib Kalyan Yojna’ would mitigate immediate problems of food and money for the economically deprived population who would receive additional 5kg of wheat or rice per person as also ‘dal’ of 5 kg per house-hold for next three-months besides getting money in their bank accounts through DBT (Direct Bank transfer).

A total of 80 crore people will be covered under the package. Government also announced Rs 50 lakh medical insurance cover for all health workers including Doctors, nurses and other medical personnel who are in forefront of battle against Coronavirus which may cross the crucial Rs community spreadRs stage any time from now.

Nadda said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a ""huge relief"" for the poor in this hour of crisis and asserted that it is the ruling party's resolve that nobody is left hungry.

Former party president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the announcement shows the sensitivity of the government towards the poor and other vulnerable sections of society.

Nadda said that over 80 crore poor people will get an additional five kg each of wheat and rice beside one kg of pulse for three months to ensure that everyone gets an adequate amount of food.

Farmers, daily wagers, poor women, people with disabilities and senior citizens will also get monetary relief through direct benefit transfer, he said.

""On behalf of every BJP worker, I thank the prime minister for this relief to the poor, farmers, women, youths, senior citizens and the organised sector for such important decisions and this relief package,"" he said.

Nadda also hailed the Government's announcement of insurance of health professionals and the decision to give free LPG cylinders under the 'Ujjwala' scheme for three months. Cash will be transferred in the bank accounts of poor farmers, poor widows, poor pensioners and poor disabled.

Farmers who were receiving Rs 6,000 annually would get Rs 2,000 upfront under Prime Minister’s scheme and MNREGA workers daily wage would be increased from Rs 182 to Rs 200. Three-months free cylinders would be provided to women covered under ‘Ujjawala’ scheme.

BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav said the Government under Modi's leadership stands solidly with the poor and other segments of the population and is committed to the country getting over the coronavirus pandemic.

The Government has announced three-week’s lockdown until mid-April, saying it is the only way out for the country to decisively defeat the virus by rigorously adopting social distancing.

BJP has also suspended all its official programmes across the country with the party workers asked to assist Government varied efforts to counter pandemic across the country.

A day before, the BJP said one crore of its workers will provide for meals of five poor persons each during the 21-day lockdown. A mechanism will be put in place at the earliest in this regard, according to party’s national media head Anil Baluni.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-hails-rs-1-7-l-cr-relief-package-for-weaker-sections.html
68,27-3-20,Opp welcomes Central package to tide over coronavirus crisis,"The Opposition on Thursday welcomed the Centre’s move to come out with the Rs 1.70 lakh-crore financial package for several categories of citizens including farmers and daily wage earners. However, a few of them also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allocating a lesser amount of Rs 15,000 crore for tackling coronavirus when compared to a greater allocation of Rs 20,000 crore for development of Central Vista that will include construction of a new Parliament in the national Capital. They sought the diversion of the Central Vista fund to fight the pandemic.

The allocation for the Central Vista had been done on the same day when the PM had announced the countrywide lockdown.

While the Congress welcomed the financial package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and aimed at helping the poor survive the economic distress due the Covid-19 lockdown, the Trinamool Congress said it came late and the Centre had actually taken the cue from the measures announced by the Mamata Banerjee government more than a week ago.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the announcements are in the right direction. ""The Government announcement today of a financial assistance package is the first step in the right direction. India owes a debt to its farmers, daily wage earners, labourers, women and the elderly, who are bearing the brunt of the ongoing lockdown,"" he said on Twitter.

Terming the financial package as a ""modest plan"", Congress leader P Chidambaram contended that a lot more needed to be done. While welcoming the provision of foodgrains for the poor, the former FM claimed that there was not enough cash infusion. He observed that some sections of society had been completely left out. He noted that some of his suggestions such as help to tenant farmers, EMI deferment and GST rate cut had not been addressed. At the same time, Chidambaram called on the Centre to put forth a further plan of action very soon.

The Trinamool Congress on Thursday said the Centre's financial package announced in the wake of a countrywide lockdown to combat coronavirus has taken a ""cue"" from the one offered by the party-led dispensation in West Bengal.

""Centre takes cue from relief plans already rolled out by state govts like #Bengal a week ago -- free 6 months ration for the poor, health insurance for champion frontliners fighting corona and Rs 1,000 for daily wagers under new Prochesta scheme. Will supplement State efforts,"" tweeted TMC MP Derek O'Brien.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that financial package is inadequate to handle the Corona crisis, comparing the Rs 7.78 lakh crore loan waiver to big corporate houses.

He said the huge loan wavier to corporate houses shows that there is no dearth of resources in India and urged the Centre to come with more financial packages for the welfare of employees and poor people, who are financially hit due to the lockdown.

Yechury also urged the Prime Minister to immediately stop the Central Vista project and divert the Rs.20,000 crore allotted for it for the Corona relief package.

“Unconscionable that the central government finds it necessary to spend Rs.20,000 crore at this precise moment for a new house for the PM & other beautification schemes. Central Vista plan must be scrapped, earmarked funds must be transferred to tackle Corona crisis and its impact on the poor, said Yechury.

Former union minister and senior Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor also appealed to the Prime Minister to divert the Rs 20,000 crore Central Vista fund to fight COVID-19. ""This is merely Rs 20 crore per district. Grand spending on buildings at this time of crisis is a postponable luxury,"" tweeted Tharoor.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-welcomes-central-package-to-tide-over-coronavirus-crisis.html

She also requested the Prime Minister to put in place broad based social protection measures, including direct cash transfer, for daily wagers, MGNREGA workers, factory labour, construction and unorganised workers, fishermen, farm labourers and other vulnerable sections of the society.

Sonia Gandhi suggested that the centre should consider deferring all EMI payments for the next few months and also waive interests charged by banks for this period.

She added that the government should immediately put in place several social protection measures which should include direct cash transfers to daily wage workers, MNREGA workers, construction workers, farmers and others part of the informal sector.

71,27-3-20,Guidelines for e-doctors to reach out to needy,"As tele-consultation with doctors is becoming the norm among people, literally locked in their houses due to the coronavirus threat, the Government has come out with a set of guidelines regarding the e-platform to enable the medical professionals reach out to the needy.

The idea is not only to reduce the load on the already over-burdened hospitals and avoid unnecessary exposure to both medical professionals and patients but also to prevent malpractices, if any.

Incidentally, despite the concept being recognised and defined by the WHO and its spreading influence over the past decade, it is only now that India has come out with such guidelines which singularly deals with the practice of Telemedicine here.

Prepared by the Board of Governors, which was set up in supercession of the Medical Council of India, in collaboration with the Niti Aayog, the ‘Telemedicine Practice Guidelines’ gives detailed do’s and don’ts while engaging in tele-medicine and tele-consultation and ensure that ethics are maintained on the part of medical professionals.

“There are a number of benefits of telemedicine…In India, providing In-person healthcare is challenging, particularly given the large geographical distances and limited resources. One of the major advantages of telemedicine can be for saving of cost and effort especially of rural patients, as they need not travel long distances for obtaining consultation and treatment,” say the guidelines.

The Government feel that with telemedicine, there is higher likelihood of maintenance of records and documentation hence minimalises the likelihood of missing out advice from the doctor other health care staff.

Thus, health systems that are invested in telemedicine are well positioned to ensure that patients with Covid-19 kind of issues receive the care they need, it says.

The guidelines aims to assist the medical practitioner in pursuing a sound course of action to provide effective and safe medical care founded on current information, available resources, and patient needs to ensure patient and provider safety.

The BoG will soon develop an online programme on practice of telemedicine to familiarise the doctors with the subject. “All currently registered medical practitioners need to complete a mandatory online course within 3 years of notification of these guidelines to provide consultation via telemedicine. Thereafter, undergoing and qualifying such a course, as prescribed, will be essential prior to registration of a medical practitioner,” as per the guidelines.

The doctors can use any telemedicine tool suitable for carrying out technology-based patient consultation e.g. telephone, video, devices connected over LAN, WAN, Internet, mobile or landline phones, chat platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc., or Mobile App or internet based digital platforms for telemedicine or data transmission systems like Skype/ email/ fax etc.

However, the guidelines have made it clear that though telemedicine consultation provides safety to the medical professionals from contagious conditions, it cannot replace physical examination that may require palpation, percussion or auscultation; that requires physical touch and feel.

It also clearly specify the categories of medicines that can and cannot be prescribed.

As per the guidelines, doctors are strictly prohibited from insisting on telemedicine, when the patient is willing to travel to a facility and/or requests an in-person consultation and misuse patient images and data, especially private and sensitive in nature. If found violating, penalties will be as per the IMC Act, ethics and other prevailing laws.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/guidelines-for-e-doctors-to-reach-out-to-needy.html

82,27-3-20,"Migrant workers say goodbye to Delhi, many on foot","Following the coronavirus outbreak, the railway stations and Anand Vihar and Kashmiri Gate Inter-state bus terminals (ISBT) have now become home to migrant labourers and rickshaw pullers who spend their sleepless nights, hoping restoration of transport services so that they can return home.

Interestingly, most of them started walking towards their respective States by foot. “What can we do in such a situation except taking a call ourselves? Waiting in open night in hope of situation to get improved is better than walking towards our home states. It may take 10 to 15 days to reach at homes but considering circumstances, we have decided to go-ahead,” said a daily wager, who is staying at ISBT for last couple of days in a hope that he would get a transport for his native house in Uttar Pradesh.

Hailing mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, these labourers are unable to pay rent and these workers had no choice except to vacate accommodation with a little money left in their hand to survive. “We labourers are paid on daily basis. With no work it was not possible for me to pay next month rent for my house in JJ cluster at Rangpuri so only option was to leave for home. We have limited money with us now,” said Ramesh Kumar (37), a native of districr Sitapur in Bihar.

Forced by unprecedented situation, these migrant labourers are feeling trapped with no one paying heeds towards their plight. Many among them are dependent on each other to survive while some of them have started visiting the nearest overcrowded shelters to have food and return back at the same open premises, fearing that they can also catch the deadly coronovirus infection.

“We around 10 to 12 people including children. The day lockdown was announced we all packed our luggage and left for the bus stand but when we reached here, the bus services were suspended, leaving us with no other option but to spend our nights here,” said Bhure Lal (43), who used to work as a laborer in city.

“Most of us had left towards their homes on foot due to unavailability of transport system. There is no food and even roof, so what would one do. I have two children but I can’t walk towards Kanpur along with them on foot,”said Vijay, a resident of Kanpur who worked as a daily wager in Delhi.

“Though we face issue while staying at bus stand and Railways stations as police keeps on removing us from here. But where do we find shelter as shelters homes in city are also full and we don’t have money even to afford a house to stay in. We only go to shelter homes for food,” said Vijay in hushtone.

“I used to work in a plastic godown located at Samaypur area. I have not been going to work since the last 6 days. I belong to Muzaffarpur , Bihar but now cannot even travel to reach home due to this lockdown,” said Sanjay Choudhary, a daily wager.

“Here we ourselves do not have money to survive. All we are worried about is our families to whom we used to send money and are not been able to now. Most of our(workers) families are dependent on us. Spending every penny or saving we have is becoming difficult for us,” said Choudhary.

Another dailywager, Dara Singh who used work in at polythene bags factory stated that he don’t have money due to which it’s really difficult to survive. “I got little saving which in this situation I need to get it to my family. Our families back home will die of hunger. We request the government to come forward to help us out,” said Singh who belongs to Giridi area of Jharkhand State.

Migrant workers are also facing double trouble as neither they have information on how to prevent themselves from this coronavirus pandemic nor do they have financial assistance to survive this lockdown from the government.

Earlier on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had proposed to provide assistance of RS 5000 each to construction worker as a sign of relief. However the workers from other fields appreciated this move but asked for similar relief for themselves.

“Why just construction workers? The government should also look after the other sections of labourers. While they should also educate us as to how can we protect ourselves from this virus,” Dara Singh said.

Meanwhile, there are long queues at Shelter homes across the city for food, which has also created a challenge for the authorities due to Coronavirus outbreak.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/migrant-workers-say-goodbye-to-delhi--many-on-foot.html

91,27-3-20,Tamil Nadu positive cases rise to 28,"Even as the number of persons tested positive for coronavirus touched 28 by Thursday evening and two persons succumbing to the pandemic (one each in Madurai and Kanyakumari), the activities of religious preachers from other countries is causing worries to security officials in Tamil Nadu. The cause of death of person in Kanyakumari district is yet to be ascertained and the health Minister’s office is tight lipped about the incident.

The 28 persons who have been admitted to hospitals in Chennai, Madurai, Salem and Erode include four Indonesian and two Thailand citizens. These six persons are in the State for religious preaching. They have been indoctrinating the faithful about

Tablighi Jamaat (Society for Spreading Faith), ‘an organization urging Muslims to return to practicing their religion as it existed during the lifetime of Prophet Mohammed’, according to State Police officials.

The Indonesians reached Salem in the first week of March from New Delhi by Kerala Express and since then they have been proselytizing in the districts of Salem, Madurai and Erode. The person who died on Wednesday, an office bearer of a local mosque management committee , had accompanied the Indonesians during their engagements in Madurai.

TG Vinay, Madurai district collector, told reporters that the health department officials are tracking the persons who had met the Indonesians and the Madurai man during congregations and social gatherings to collect samples from them for testing.

The secret visits undertaken by the foreign preachers belonging to TJ have taken security agencies by surprise. The organization was in the news recently when they held an ‘international mass religious gathering’ in the last week of February 2020 at Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia where more than 700 COVID- 19 cases have been reported. There is total secrecy associated with the TJ gatherings.

“What we know is that the Indonesians and Thai nationals have been addressing congregations in various mosques in these districts. Since outsiders are not allowed during these meetings, we do not know what kind of sermonizing is happening during these religious classes. It could be anything ranging from interpretation of Quran to encouraging the Muslims to fight the CAA,” said a senior intelligence official.

The official who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that monitoring of congregations in temples across the State was not at all a problem.

“But mosques and churches are a different class as we can never infiltrate into the religious gatherings inside these places. The concerned Government agency is yet to make any probe into the activities of these proselitizers ,” he said.

The statement regarding the number of Corona Virus patients admitted to various hospitals in the State were disclosed by Dr C Vijaya Baskar, Tamil Nadu Minister for Health.

Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswamy who held a day long meeting in the secretariat on Thursday with ministers, senior bureaucrats and district collectors later made a passionate plea to the people of the State to cooperate with the administration in its war on Corona.

“I am addressing you not as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu but as a member of your family. Do not get panic as the total lock down has been declared for your own safety and security. The State administration is doing all it can do to make your stay in indoors a comfortable life. Maintenance of social distancing is the only option to prevent the spread of Corona, said the chief minister taking a cue from the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on Wednesday evening.

To ensure that vegetables and fruits continue to reach people without any hindrance, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has started giving out passes to those involved in the supply chain for their easy movement in the city.

Officials of the agriculture ministry said that the ministry is in constant touch with state governments in charge of agriculture marketing and APMC or wholesale mandi boards to take proactive measures to ensure supply of essential vegetables and fruits is not hit during the lockdown period.

“There were initial resistance but we have persuaded with State Government and APMC board to keep mandis open. As a result, 1,600 fruits and vegetable mandis have started functioning smoothly today and 300 more will open from Friday,” officials said. While there is no scarcity of vegetables and fruits arriving in the capital, wholesale traders said that sending it to retail markets was a challenge. Because of the lockdown, the retailers are finding it difficult to reach the wholesale market. Vegetable traders’ association general secretary Anil Malhotra alleged that wholesalers and staff were not able to reach Azadpur mandi leading to rotting of the stock of perishable items.

There are about 6,900 wholesale mandis, including grains, vegetables and fruits ones, across the country. The grain mandis get activated during the time of harvest.

Right now, the focus is on vegetable and fruit mandis. To normalise supply in major cities, the Centre has asked Mother Dairy’s Safal vegetable outlets in Delhi, Sufal Bangla retail outlets in Kolkata, Hopcoms retail outlets in Bengaluru and similar outlets in Chennai and Mumbai to monitor movement of supplies and coordinate with local administration.

On the inter-state movement of vegetables, officials said traders are “facing problems on the ground as the police is enforcing strictly the lockdown rules”. However, mandis have been asked to set up a control room to intervene and coordinate with local police and district collector as well as transport association to resolve the matter, officials added. On safety and preventive measures, the official said awareness is being created about coronavirus outbreak through loudspeaker and even posters have been put out in mandis.

Besides, mandis have put in place a system to maintain social distancing and encouraging traders to wear face masks and hand sanitisers regularly to combat coronavirus. Even mandi premise is being disinfected regularly, the official added. While many people complained that retail prices had risen, traders said wholesale rates of onion and potato had fallen by 25%.

In a bid to support the economy during the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unveiled a slew of measures, including its steepest interest rate cuts in more than 11 years. The repo has been cut by 75 basis points to 4.4 per cent - the lowest in at least 15 years.

Further, the Reserve Bank reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for all banks by 100 basis points to 3 per cent to release Rs 1.37 lakh crore across the banking system. It also allowed banks to put on hold monthly instalment payments on all term loans for three months.

He further said that the growth projection of 4.7 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2019-20 and 5 per cent for the whole fiscal was at risk.

Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, Samco Securities said, In such uncertain times, instead of fresh funds entities want to save their skin, RBI's relaxation of only 3 months instead of 6 months for moratorium on interest on loans and working capital has disappointed many.

He added that there is no doubt that the RBI is playing every card in its pocket to prevent a crisis-like situation by giving banks the ability to lend more, but as such no direct helping hand has been given to ailing industries as of now.

111,27-3-20,‘United’ response to virus crisis,"G20 nations pledged a “united front” on Thursday in the fight against coronavirus, saying they were injecting USD 5 trillion into the global economy to counter the pandemic amid forecasts of a deep recession.

US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined the emergency videoconference chaired by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, who called for coordinated action while facing pressure to end an oil price war between Riyadh and Moscow that has roiled energy markets.

The talks come amid criticism that the G20 has been slow to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left more than 21,000 dead worldwide according to official data, and triggered financial shock waves as more than three billion people are locked down.

“We are strongly committed to presenting a united front against this common threat,” the leaders said in a joint statement after the summit. “We are injecting over USD 5 trillion into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.”

As concerns mount for poorer countries without access to capital markets or adequate health facilities, G20 leaders also pledged to work with bodies such as the International Monetary Fund to deploy a “robust” financial package to support developing nations.

“It is our responsibility to extend a helping hand to developing countries and (the) least developed countries to enable them to build their capacities and improve their infrastructure to overcome this crisis and its repercussions,” King Salman said. The world’s 20 most industrialised countries are scrambling to defend their virus-wracked economies amid forecasts they will likely plunge into a recession. On Wednesday, the financial ratings agency Moody’s estimated the G20’s overall gross domestic product would contract by 0.5 per cent this year, with the US economy shrinking by 2.0 percent and the eurozone by 2.2 per cent.

This week, French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pushed for an emergency G20 summit to limit the impact of the pandemic.

The lack of immediate action stood in contrast to the 2008 financial crisis, when the group quickly swung into action to mobilise assistance for vulnerable countries.

Talk of global coordination has yet to resonate under Trump’s isolationist presidency. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took aim at China, saying the top diplomats of the Group of Seven agreed with him that Beijing was waging a “disinformation” campaign about the pandemic.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---united----response-to-virus-crisis.html

“This is a virus that respects no borders. The outbreak we are battling is our common enemy. All must work together to build a strongest global network of control and treatment that the world has ever seen,” Xi said through videoconference.

Xi’s statement came amid growing international criticism of China’s reported failure to be fully transparent in reporting the COVID-19 outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.

Xi said the community of nations must move swiftly to stem the spread of the virus and China will be more than ready to share its good practices, conduct joint research and development of drugs and vaccines, and provide assistance where it can to countries hit by the pandemic.

He said China has set up its online COVID-19 knowledge centre that is open to all countries. About the pandemic’s impact on global economy, Xi asked G20 members to cut tariffs, remove barriers and facilitate the unfettered flow of trade.

He called on all G20 members to take collective actions, send a strong signal and restore confidence for global economic recovery.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/xi-calls-for-all-out-global-war-against-corona--moots-tariff-cuts.html
113,27-3-20,"Virus toll over 21,000","As world leaders hold online crisis talks on Thursday on the coronavirus pandemic that has forced three billion people into lockdown and claimed more than 21,000 lives.

With the disease tearing around the globe at a terrifying pace, warnings are multiplying over its economic consequences, and experts say it could cause more damage than the Great Depression.

Amid squabbling between the leaders of China and the US over who is to blame, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the world to act together to halt the menace.

“COVID-19 is threatening the whole of humanity,” he said. “Global action and solidarity are crucial. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.” The global lockdown — which also took in India’s huge population this week — tightened further on Thursday as Russia announced it was grounding all international flights, while Moscow’s mayor ordered the closure of cafes, shops and parks.

Tokyo’s millions of citizens have been told to stay home and tourism-dependent Thailand has shuttered its borders. Economists say the restrictions imposed around the world could cause the most violent recession in recent history.

“The G20 economies will experience an unprecedented shock in the first half of this year and will contract in 2020 as a whole,” ratings agency Moody’s said.

Unemployment rates are expected to soar — as much as 30 per cent in the US — according to James Bullard, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve.

Leaders of the G20 major economies will hold a virtual huddle later Thursday in the shadow of such dire predictions. “As the world confronts the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges to healthcare systems and the global economy, we convene this extraordinary G20 summit to unite efforts towards a global response,” tweeted the king of Saudi Arabia. Saudi currently holds the rotating G20 presidency.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said richer nations needed to offer support to low and middle income countries. The devastating effect on poorer nations was laid bare on Thursday when the Philippines announced that nine frontline doctors had died after contracting COVID-19.

Three large Manila hospitals said this week they had reached capacity and would no longer accept new coronavirus cases. Hundreds of medical staff are undergoing 14-day self-quarantines after suspected exposure, the hospitals said.

The death toll from the virus, which emerged in China late last year, continued to grow, with the US becoming the sixth country to hit four figures. Almost 1,050 people are now known to have died in the United States, with nearly 70,000 confirmed infections, a tally by Johns Hopkins University showed.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-toll-over-21-000.html
114,27-3-20,Infections near 5L as health systems buckle,"The number of coronavirus infections closed in on a half-million worldwide Thursday, with both Italy and the US on track to surpass China, and a record-shattering 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week in a stark demonstration of the damage to the world’s biggest economy.

Health care systems in Europe and New York buckled under the strain, with Spain’s death toll climbing to more than 4,000.

In the US, an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package to help businesses, hospitals and ordinary Americans make it through the crisis cleared the Senate and is expected to be voted on in the House on Friday.

At least 2.8 billion people, or more than one-third of the Earth’s population, are under severe travel restrictions.

But the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, scolded world leaders for wasting precious time in the fight against the virus that has already killed more than 22,000 people and infected over 480,000, thrown millions out of work and ravaged the world economy.

“The time to act was actually more than a month ago or two months ago,” he said Wednesday. “We squandered the first window of opportunity. ... This is a second opportunity, which we should not squander and do everything to suppress and control this virus.”

In the United States, where deaths passed 1,050 and at least 70,000 people were infected, the damage from the widespread economic shutdown was made plain when the number of people applying for unemployment benefits last week was more than four times the old record, set in 1982.

A political battle, meanwhile, raged between those demanding urgent action for a long siege against the pandemic, like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and President Donald Trump.

Trump has expressed hope churches could return to normal by Easter on April 12, and grumbled that “our country wasn’t built to be shut down” — apparently concerned that the outbreak’s devastating effects on financial markets and employment will harm his re-election chances. Democrats say Trump is putting the economy ahead of the health and safety of Americans.

“I’d like to say, let’s get back to work next Friday,” said Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. “That’d be wonderful. But it can’t be arbitrary.”

In Brazil, the country’s governors are defying President Jair Bolsonaro over his call to reopen schools and businesses, dismissing his argument that the “cure” of widespread shutdowns is worse than the disease. As of Thursday, the country had more than 2,500 cases and 59 deaths.

New York has emerged as a virus hotspot. The city’s mammoth convention center is being turned into a hospital. The state recorded more than 350 deaths.

Spain has become the country in Europe where the outbreak is spreading the fastest.

On Thursday, the Health Ministry reported reported nearly 8,600 new infections and 655 deaths, bringing the total cases to over 56,00 and more than 4,000 fatalities — second only to Italy’s death toll of about 7,500.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/infections-near-5l-as-health-systems-buckle.html
115,27-3-20,"Spain toll over 4,000","The coronavirus death toll in Spain surged to 4,089 after 655 people died within 24 hours, the Health Ministry said on Thursday.

It was a 19 per cent increase on figures released Wednesday by the authorities in Spain, which has the world’s second highest death toll from the disease after Italy.

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 56,188, the ministry said. Despite a national lockdown imposed on March 14, which parliament on Thursday agreed to extend until April 11, both deaths and infections have continued to mount, with officials warning this week would be particularly bad.

But the rise in the number of new deaths was smaller than that recorded on Wednesday when the figure rose by 738 or 27 per cent. Health authorities are hoping it will soon become clear whether the lockdown is having the desired effect.

The Madrid region has suffered the brunt of the epidemic with 17,166 infections — just under a third of the total — and 2,090 deaths, or 51 percent of the national figure.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose wife is infected with the virus, has said this is the country’s most difficult moment since its 1936-39 civil war.

“Only the oldest, who knew the hardships of the civil war and its aftermath, can remember collective situations that were harsher than the current one. The other generations in Spain have never, ever had to face as a collective something so hard,” he said when he imposed the state of emergency on March 14.

116,27-3-20,"Coronavirus cases in US cross 65,000 with more than 1,000 fatalities","President Donald Trump has approved major disaster declarations on public health for many US states, including worst-hit New York, as the total number of confirmed cases in the country crossed 65,000 mark and more than 1,000 people have died due to the deadly coronavirus.

According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus in the US rose to 1,031 with 68,572 confirmed cases. The United States has the third highest number of confirmed cases behind China and Italy.

In addition to declaring a national emergency, President Trump has approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, North Carolina, Texas and Florida.

This is probably for the first time in recent memory that over half a dozen states have been approved for major disaster declarations on public health.

Condition continues to deteriorate in New York City, which has emerged as the epicentre of the COVID-19 in the US.

By Tuesday, the number of confirmed cases crossed 30,000 and at least 285 people died. New York was followed by neighbouring New Jersey with 4,402 cases and 62 fatalities.

The new rates, to be effective from April 1, will be applicable for its borrowers availing loans based on external benchmark-linked lending rate (EBR) and repo-linked lending rate (RLLR), the bank said in a statement.

The EBR has been reduced to 7.05 per cent per annum from 7.80 per annum, while RLLR to 6.65 per cent per annum from 7.40 per annum.

The bank said equated-monthly instalments (EMIs) on eligible home loan accounts (linked to EBR or RLLR) will get cheaper by around Rs 52 per Rs 1 lakh on a 30-year loan.

120,27-3-20,3.3 mn Americans seek jobless aid,"Nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week — more than quadruple the previous record set in 1982 — amid a widespread economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus.

The surge in weekly applications was a stunning reflection of the damage the viral outbreak is inflicting on the economy. Filings for unemployment aid generally reflect the pace of layoffs. Layoffs are sure to accelerate as the US economy sinks into a recession.

Revenue has collapsed at restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, gyms, and airlines.

Auto sales are plummeting, and car makers have close factories. Most such employers face loan payments and other fixed costs, so they’re cutting jobs to save money.

As job losses mount, some economists say the nation’s unemployment rate could approach 13 per cent by May. By comparison, the highest jobless rate during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009, was 10 per cent. The economic deterioration has been swift. As recently as February, the unemployment rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5 per cent.

And the economy was growing steadily if modestly. Yet by the April-June quarter of the year, some economists think the economy will shrink at its steepest annual pace ever — a contraction that could reach 30 per cent.

In its report on Thursday, the Labor Department said 3.283 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week, up from 282,000 during the previous week.

Yet many people who have lost jobs in recent weeks have been unable to file for unemployment aid because state websites and phone systems have been overwhelmed by a crush of applicants and have frozen up.

That logjam suggests that Thursday’s report actually understates the magnitude of job cuts last week. So does the fact that workers who are not on company payrolls — gig workers, free-lancers, the self-employed — aren’t currently eligible for unemployment benefits even though in many cases they’re no longer able to earn money.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/3-3-mn-americans-seek-jobless-aid.html
121,27-3-20,Trump’s push to open economy could come at cost of lives,"The contrast could hardly be more stark. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has said that if all of his sweeping, expensive measures to stem the coronavirus saved one life, it would be worth it. President Donald Trump has another view: The costs of shutting down the economy outweigh the benefits, frequently telling Americans that 35,000 people a year die from the common flu.

Though it may seem crass, the federal government actually has long made a calculation when imposing regulations, called “the value of a statistical life,” that places a price tag on a human life. It has been used to consider whether to require seat belts, airbags or environmental regulations, but it has never been applied in a broad public health context.

The question is now an urgent one given that Trump in recent days has latched on to the notion that the cure for the pandemic should not be worse than the disease and argued that “more people are going to die if we allow this to continue” if the economy remains closed. He has targeted a return to a semblance of normalcy for the economy by Easter Sunday, April 12.

Critics say he’s presenting the nation with a false choice at a moment when deaths and infections from the virus are surging.

“We’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable,” said Cuomo, whose state has seen far more infections and deaths from COVID-19 than any other state. “And we’re not going to put a dollar figure on human life.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump---s-push-to-open-economy-could-come-at-cost-of-lives.html

Aspirin has anti-inflammatory properties and also thins the blood. For years, doctors have been prescribing low-dose aspirin for some people to reduce their risk of heart disease and stroke. However, there are also possible risks to taking aspirin, including bleeding in the brain, so guidance from a doctor is important.

Because aspirin can be beneficial to the heart, researchers have hypothesised, and smaller previous studies have suggested, that it may also be beneficial to the brain, possibly reducing the risk of dementia by reducing inflammation, minimising small clots or by preventing the narrowing of blood vessels within the brain.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/taking-aspirin-may-not-reduce-dementia-risk.html
123,27-3-20,US grants Iraq shortest sanctions waiver yet for Iran gas,"The United States on Thursday granted Iraq a 30-day waiver to keep importing Iranian gas despite American sanctions, two Iraqi officials told AFP, the shortest extension yet.

The US slapped tough sanctions on the Iranian energy sector in late 2018 and has granted Iraq a series of waivers, usually for 45, 90 or 120 days. Baghdad relies on gas and electricity imports from its neighbour Tehran to supply about a third of its power grid, crippled by years of conflict and poor maintenance.

“This is the final extension,” one source at the Iraqi president’s office told AFP.

The source said Washington had been frustrated that Iran was meddling in the Government formation process in Iraq. Adnan Zurfi, who has had close ties with US officials since the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, was nominated on March 17 and has a month to pull together his cabinet. “The US did not want to put Zurfi in a difficult position by not renewing the waiver,” a second senior Iraqi official told AFP, confirming the 30-day extension.

The official said Baghdad had prepared a checklist at the beginning of the last 45-day waiver period of ways the country could decrease its reliance on Iranian oil. “But we haven’t been able to accomplish any of them because of the circumstances,” the source said. Iraq has been hit by a cocktail of crises in recent weeks, including the government formation stalemate, collapsing oil prices and the novel coronavirus pandemic.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-grants-iraq-shortest-sanctions-waiver-yet-for-iran-gas.html

In his address at a video conference of the G-20 leaders, Modi also pitched for developing a new crisis management protocol and procedures to deal with global health crisis besides significantly boosting capability of organisations like the WHO, Government sources said.

He also said G-20 should work together to reduce economic hardships, particularly of the poor nations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic which has killed over 21,000 people and infected more than 470,000 globally.

The Prime Minister called for ushering in a new globalisation for collective well being of entire humankind, noting that medical research should be freely and openly available for all countries.

He said empowering the WHO was necessary for development of effective vaccines to deal with global pandemics.

125,27-3-20,Life imitates films,"With binge-watch becoming the ideal quarantine activity, pandemic films are the new favourite genre across the world, says Chahak Mittal

There’s no trespassing in this city or the planet. I’m sorry! Earth is closed today.” Till a month back, this was just a dialogue by Tony Stark aka Robert Downey Jr in Avengers: Infinity Wars. But now, it is a lived reality. The shopping complexes, cafes and bars, cinema halls, theatres, museums, public centres, offices, and schools and colleges have downed their shutters and there is not a single soul on the streets amid the ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus or COVID-19.

‘Netflix and chill’ was the buzzword for hanging out alone or with friends earlier but now, it’s the favourite ‘quarantine’ activity. And while people juggle with deciding on what to watch online, data shows that streaming and downloads of films, which show global crises or pandemics akin to the present one, have seen a sharp rise. One such is Contagion (2011), which gives the viewer a feeling of déjà vu as the film revolves around a family man (played by Matt Damon) who tries to navigate a partial societal collapse after a deadly virus spreads across the globe.

As per the data released by various sources, the film is becoming one of the most popular pandemic genre movies of 2020. According to iTunes, it is the third most popular film on the channel currently as well as the only film in the top 10 that didn’t come out in 2019 as every film that’s listed in the top 20 was released in 2019, except for this one. The film might have not garnered as much attention when it was first released due to its “unrealistic” and some “highly fictional” assumptions as claimed by many critics. There were sequences where a vaccine was developed really quickly and the film depicted that the virus reached humans through contact with animals.

However, today, it has returned to make the audience realise how it predicted the Coronavirus outbreak of 2020 long back in 2011. As per the data released on March 8 by The Verge and TorrentFreak, which collaborated to study the rise of number of downloads of Contagion between January 1 and March 4, thousands of people around the world were found to be illegally donwloading the pandemic film. The results were analysed by checking the IP addresses that shared the film and studying torrent tracker data. The study also said that before January 24, Contagion was torrented about 200 times per day around the world. On January 25, the number rose to 1,500. As per the US, after the virus started spreading there, the downloads were around 18,000 every day.

According to MUSO, a piracy analytics firm, Contagion downloads, from 546 on January 7, rose to over 30,000 by January 30. Such a high number of piracy visits of the film have proven what heights people reach up to when they are not able to stream any film that they want to watch.

As per the data by Google trends of the last 90 days, “Where can I watch Contagion?” became the ninth most searched query whereas “Contagion online,” “Contagion full movie download,” or “Contagion Netflix” became the 19th, 20th and 21st queries respectively. The film is now available on Amazon Prime Video and Google Play only in some countries.

Not just the surge, the film is also becoming a medium of learning about the situation for students. Rebecca Katz, director of the Centre for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, recently revealed that she made her students watch the film’s ending to “educate them about the interconnectedness between animals, the environment and the humans.”

Film writer Scott Z Burns recently told a magazine, that while the disease in the film was more deadly than the COVID-19, Scott was more interested in using the virus to explore how the pre-existing conditions in society make us susceptible to fear as well as the virus. He said, “The similarities between Contagion and the Coronavirus are immaterial, accidental, and really not that important. What is more important is the societal response and the spread of fear and its knock-on effects, which are proving to be accurate” and that’s why the film is gaining popularity among netizens across the world. Director Steven Andrew Soderbergh also pointed out that Contagion feels “prescient” as it “not only gives an illuminating glimpse into what happened — but what might.”

Well, another film that has taken the internet and netizens by storm is Korean Netflix series My Secret Terrius, which was released in 2018. Viewers believe that the film had “predicted” the current virus outbreak. One of the sequences in episode 10 depicts a doctor and an information spy talking about a potential virus named Coronavirus, which has allegedly been tweaked to make its mortality rate reach 90 per cent as compared to the MERS, which only had 20 per cent mortality rate. The doctor says that “the Coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days,” which is a more serious concern. She adds that the virus has been “manipulated to attack the lungs directly within just five minutes of being exposed.” The “mutant virus” could be used as a weapon and lead to a biochemical global terrorist attack. The film is unavailable or has been removed from the online platform in many countries now.

Other Hollywood films which are again making it big because of the pandemic scare are Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak (American documentary series, a Netflix Original, 2020), Pandemic (2016), Outbreak (1995), Carriers (2009), the series, Containment (2016), I Am Legend (2007), and The Andromeda Strain (1971). As the virus claims more and more lives, the films show how the average person must maintain social distancing, try hard not to touch his or her face, and only stay indoors. Nothing else can be done until a solution is found, which wouldn’t happen overnight. Netflix Original film Bird Box (2018), which was a fictional and a metaphorical take on how a global pandemic can take over humanity, also depicted how people in order to survive must stay put in their homes to not let the plague reach them.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/life-imitates-films-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/life-imitates-films.html
126,27-3-20,Mithali wants women’s IPL next year,"BCCI should not “wait forever” to start the women’s IPL, said India women’s ODI captain Mithali Raj, urging the board to make it happen next year on a smaller scale before gradually developing it.

“I personally feel they should start a women’s IPL by next year, even if it’s on a slightly smaller scale and with some changes in rules, such as, say, have five to six foreign players in the first edition instead of four as is the case with the men’s IPL,” Raj told ESPNCricinfo.

After India lost the T20 World Cup in the finals earlier this month, former skipper Sunil Gavaskar had called for a full-fledged women’s IPL from next year to unearth talent.

In 2019, a three-team women’s tournament was held featuring sides called IPL Velocity, IPL Trailblazers and IPL Supernovas.

This year, the BCCI had decided to organise a four-team women’s T20 challenge to run parallel to the men’s IPL playoffs, but now it has been put on hold along with the main event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

India don’t have enough women cricketers for a full-fledged IPL but Raj said it can still be conducted if existing IPL franchises own teams to begin the process.

“I agree we don’t have the depth in the domestic pool yet, but the key is to get the existing franchises to form teams, even if (only) five or six of them are keen to begin the process because in any case, the BCCI was going to have four teams,” she said.

“You cannot wait forever; you have to begin at some point, and gradually, year by year, you can keep evolving the league and then bring it down to four foreign players.”

Raj also said that teen sensation Shafali Verma, who impressed with the bat in the T20 World Cup, should be included in the ODIs too.

“It’s not a bad idea to consider her for the ODIs. She is young but that should not be a criterion for not giving her opportunities in the ODI side,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mithali-wants-women---s-ipl-next-year.html

“This is a very different situation, an extraordinary situation where sports couldn’t have happened at all. The well-being of human lives is above everything else,” ace rifleman Rajput said.

“Yes, I have been preparing for the Olympic Games for more than three years, hoping to go there and perform at the biggest stage.

“But we simply don’t have any choice now but to postpone the Olympics. I support the decision, we know it is for our well-being,” the 39-year-old rifle ace said.

Confined to his flat in Faridabad, which is close to the Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range, Rajput is now doing all he can at home.

“Of course we must remain indoors for the next three weeks or till the time the situation improves. But I am doing dry practice (or dry firing) at home besides yoga and meditation,” Rajput, who was dropped from the 2016 Olympic team at the expense of a shotgun shooter, said.

During dry practice, the shooter fires a fireman (on an object hung on a wall) without live ammunition.

Rajput secured his Tokyo quota in Rio de Janeiro last year when he gunned down a Silver in the men’s 50m rifle 3 positions event.

Since the 2008 Games, he has secured an Olympic quota four times on the trot.

Asked about the changes to his plans now that the Olympics have been pushed to next year, the shooter stressed on “peak performance”.

“Peak performance is something that needs a lot of emphasis. It means we follow the plans designed for us and peak at the right time, which is the Olympics in this case,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shooter-rajput-presses-reset-button.html

“The AELTC can confirm that it is continuing a detailed evaluation of all scenarios for The Championships 2020, including postponement and cancellation, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak,” an All England Club statement said.

“An emergency meeting of the AELTC Main Board is scheduled for next week, and in preparation we are communicating closely with the LTA, and with the ATP, WTA, ITF and the other Grand Slams.” Pressure is growing on the All England Club to make a decision and organisers have ruled out playing the tournament behind closed doors.

“The build for The Championships is due to begin at the end of April,” the statement said.

“At this time, very short window is available to us to stage The Championships due to the nature of our surface suggests that postponement is not without significant risk and difficulty. Playing behind closed doors has been formally ruled out.”

Given it takes two months to get the Wimbledon site ready for the event, a decision needs to be made soon and All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis expects the call will be made at the emergency summit.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wimbledon-fate-to-be-decided-next-week.html
129,27-3-20,Italian football chief ready to finish season in August,"Italian football federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina on Wednesday said he was determined that the Serie A season would be concluded even going into August.

All sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3 as of now.

“We will do everything to complete the championships, if necessary we will ask for the support of UEFA and FIFA to go beyond June 30 and play also in July or August,” Gravina told Radio Marte.

“It’s premature to think of a date, but we must think positively, also for the health of Italians and hope that this situation will end as soon as possible.”

The FIGC chief had last week expressed his hope that the championship could resume on the weekend of May 2.

As for the suspended championship, Gravina rejected either cancelling or assigning the title as the table stands where champions Juventus were leading by a point when the season was halted. “This would lead to an unpleasant scenario. As long as possible, I will continue to reject these options.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/italian-football-chief-ready-to-finish-season-in-august.html
130,27-3-20,Ronaldo is world’s best footballer right now: Pele,"Brazilian football great Pele has described Cristiano Ronaldo as the world’s best contemporary footballer, rating the Juventus forward ahead of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi.

But the 79-year-old believes neither Ronaldo nor Messi are as good as he was during a celebrated career with Santos, the New York Cosmos and Brazil.

“Right now, Cristiano Ronaldo is the best, because he is the most consistent over the past 10 years, although Messi should not be forgotten,” Pele said in an interview on the Pilhado YouTube channel.

The former Brazil No 10 also cited Zico, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo Nazario, Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff in his list of all-time favourite players. He did not mention former Argentina forward Diego Maradona, widely regarded as Pele’s only rival for the title of the greatest player in history.

“There is only one king. Pele was better than all of them,” he said. “If I have to be honest, well, I’m telling you the truth: my father and mother closed the factory. There will only ever be one Pele.”

131,27-3-20,"Delaying Olympics will involve ‘massive’ costs, say organisers","Rescheduling the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will involve “massive” additional costs, organisers of the Games conceded on Thursday as they convened a taskforce to begin working on the “unprecedented” and complex task.

The historic decision to postpone the Games over the new coronavirus outbreak leaves organisers with a logistical headache as they work to shift the enormous event to an as-yet-undecided date next year.

“One by one, we need to ensure the problems we face can be solved,” Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said in opening remarks at the first meeting of the taskforce.

“Additional expenses are going to be quite massive we assume. With regards to our revenues, we need to make a lot of effort there,” he added.

Muto gave no estimates for how much the process of postponing the Olympic and Paralympic Games could cost.

But according to the Nikkei daily, organisers estimate it will cost an extra $2.7 billion, including for venue rentals, rebooking hotels and additional payments for staff and security guards, among others.

Those costs could still come down depending on the outcome of negotiations, the business daily reported.

Muto said organisers would not rip up their existing plans, but added: “I guess we need to step back a bit.”

“Sometimes you need to go back to the drawing board,” he said.

The Olympics have never faced this much disruption in peacetime, and the decision to delay the event has created unprecedented challenges, Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori said.

Tokyo 2020 staff “will experience difficulties they have never experienced before. I am sure they will rise to the occasion. This is going to be a very difficult task that we are facing,” he said.

No deadlines have yet been set for the rescheduling of the Games, which are now due to take place by summer 2021, but Mori said he would ensure “all the decisions are made as quickly as possible”.

Muto underscored the scale of the task ahead, saying even he “didn’t imagine at all we would be tested to this degree”.

“We want to make sure we go beyond this test and that next year in Tokyo, the torch is lit for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. We believe this is the mission we face.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/delaying-olympics-will-involve----massive----costs--say-organisers.html
132,27-3-20,ICC to discuss contingency plans,"The members of the ICC Board will meet via video conference on Friday to discuss contingency plans for its multiple tournaments.

While a couple of ICC Board members confirmed that no concrete decisions are expected during the conference call, it became imperative that a meeting was necessary to discuss contingency plans.

The most high-profile ICC flagship event in 2020 is the Men’s T20 World Cup in October-November besides the various bilateral series which are part of the World Test Championship. The points system in case of cancelled series will be a topic of discussion.

One such series, England’s away tour of Sri Lanka, has already been postponed.

“Right now, the situation is such that no decision can be taken as no one knows when normalcy returns. Obviously the members will give a lowdown of the situation in their respective countries.

“But we need to be ready with plans if this lockdown continues for two more months. The complete FTP will be topsy turvy,” an official of a member nation said.

He said that points allocation of Test Championship games that will be postponed will be another issue.

“The England versus Sri Lanka series got postponed but where will it be slotted considering the FTP calendar is choc-a-bloc. It’s not one series that will be affected but a few more which are lined up,” he said.

There is England hosting West Indies and Pakistan in June and July while New Zealand travel to Bangladesh in August. India next play Test matches in November against Australia in an away series.

“So like what could be the ideal points distribution system. Whether giving 60 points each to both teams will be fair deal is something that members need to discuss,” he added.

As of now, there is no imminent threat to the World T20 in Australia but if lockdown continues for two to three months then it might be become Australian government’s prerogative to decide on travel restrictions and how they perceive the situation in their country at that point in time.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/icc-to-discuss-contingency-plans-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/icc-to-discuss-contingency-plans.html

134,27-3-20,Tiring effect,"Here’s why having old tyres on your car could be a risk

Tyres are of vital importance since they are the only part of the vehicle that makes contact with the road. Yet motorists often neglect their condition and age, and the results can be catastrophic. In its most recently available information, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that 738 people died in 2017 from tyre-related crashes.

As a tyre ages, small cracks in the rubber begin to develop over time, appearing on the surface and inside the tyre. This cracking can eventually cause the steel belts in the tread to separate from the rest of the tyre. Tread separation can also happen to defective, underinflated and poorly maintained tires. Hot climates will also accelerate the aging process.

Here’s what you need to know to determine tyre age and what issues old tyres can pose:

How long do tyres last?

Carmakers and tyre manufacturers differ in their recommendations on when to replace a tyre. Many automakers, including Ford, Nissan, Mazda and Mercedes-Benz, tell owners to replace tyres six years after their production date regardless of tread life. Brands such as Continental and Michelin say a tyre can last up to 10 years, provided you get annual tyre inspections after the fifth year.

The NHTSA has no specific guidelines on tyre age and defers to the recommendations of carmakers and tyre manufacturers.

Determining the age of a tyre

You’ll need to locate the transportation number printed on the sidewall of the tyre. The first two numbers represent the week in which the tyre was made. The second two represent the year. A tyre with a DOT code of 1018, for example, was made in the 10th week of 2018.

Tyres made before 2000 end in a three-digit code that is trickier to decode, but essentially if you see a DOT number ending in three digits, the tyre was made in the last century and should be immediately replaced.

If you see a partial DOT number on the outer sidewall, look for the full number on the inner side. Some tyre manufacturers opt to brand the number on the inside to reduce the chance of injury to the tyre mold technician.

Avoid used tyres

New tyres can be expensive, which is why used tyres are attractive to people who are strapped for cash. You’ll often find used tyres for sale in classified ads or at tyre-and-wheel shops that offer them as a low-cost alternative.

The problem with used tyres is that, while you can check their age, you have no idea how well they were maintained or what conditions they were used in. It is safer to avoid them entirely.

Make sure you’re getting fresh tyres

There are instances when people have purchased what they thought were new tyres at retail stores only to find out that they were manufactured years earlier. A tyre from the prior year is common, but anything older is likely to have a shorter life span. You have the right to request newer ones. Check the date before you drive away to save yourself the hassle.

Make a tyre inspection part of your routine when evaluating a used car to buy. If you find that the vehicle you’re interested in has old tyres, make that a part of the negotiation. The seller of the vehicle might be willing to discount the price so that you can buy new tyres, or even install new tyres before you purchase it.

Learn to let go of old tyres

If your tyres have plenty of tread left but are approaching the six-year mark, it’s time to get them inspected for signs of aging. And if the tyre shop recommends a set of tyres, spend the money and don’t put it off.

Getting rid of an unused spare or tyres with plenty of tread may seem counterintuitive, but if they are too old, it is the smartest thing you can do.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tiring-effect-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/tiring-effect.html
135,27-3-20,Corona doesn’t spread via tears,"Contrary to some reports, researchers now claim that the novel Coronavirus doesn’t spread via tears and it is unlikely that infected patients are shedding virus through eye fluid.

While researchers are certain that Coronavirus spreads through mucus and droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing, it is unclear if the virus is spread through other bodily fluids, such as tears, said the study published in the journal, Ophthalmology.

There is one important caveat, though. None of the patients in the study had Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye. However, health officials believe pink eye develops in just one per cent to three per cent of people with Coronavirus.

For the findings, researchers at National University Hospital in Singapore collected tear samples from 17 patients with COVID-19 from the time they showed symptoms until they recovered about 20 days later. Neither viral culture nor reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected the virus in their tears throughout the two-week course of the disease, the researchers said.

The study researcher Ivan Seah also took samples from the back of the nose and throat during the same time period. The findings showed that when a sick person coughs or talks, virus particles can spray from their mouth or nose into another person's face.

You're most likely to inhale these droplets through your mouth or nose, but they can also enter through your eyes, according to the research.

The study also revealed that you can also become infected by touching something that has the virus on it — like a table or doorknob — and then touching your eyes.

While the patients' tears were clear of virus, their noses and throats were teeming with COVID-19, the researchers said. The authors wrote that the findings, coupled with the low incidence of pink eye among infected patients, suggest that the risk of virus transmission through tears is low.

The researchers hope their work helps to guide more research into preventing virus transmission through more significant routes, such as droplets and fecal-oral spread.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/corona-doesn---t-spread-via-tears-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/corona-doesn---t-spread-via-tears.html
136,27-3-20,Pandemic pantry,"The virus has sent a nation of restaurant-goers back to the kitchen

Last Tuesday night in Tennessee, bluegrass musicians David and Virginia Blood were busy making sandwiches. In Pittsburgh, real estate agent Michelle Bushee was stirring a pot of homemade black-bean chilli in her kitchen instead of shepherding curious buyers through potential dream homes. Marty Prudenti, whose nights are usually spent working backstage at New York City’s Lincoln Center, was in his Long Island backyard grilling burgers for his twins. And in Texas, Babette Maxwell — who would otherwise have been running at least one of her three teenage sons to sports practices or school events — was Googling recipes to engineer homemade versions of her boys’ favorite Taco Bell items.

Throughout the the globe, lives have been radically upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is worry and washing of hands. But one bright spot is emerging from self-quarantine and mandatory working from home: In this nation that so often dines out or gobbles processed food on the run, people are suddenly cooking a whole lot more.

Before the coronavirus emerged, Kim Bierly often worked late at her office and then met her husband for a quick dinner at one of the restaurants in their central Pennsylvania neighbourhood. If they didn’t eat out, they’d reach into the refrigerator and choose something packaged to heat up.

“I’ve always enjoyed cooking,” Bierly says. “But it was being saved for weekends. And by the time you get to the weekend you had all the other things you need to do. So it would be something quick or something prepared.”

Now working from home, she’s pulling out old recipes — the kinds of things she remembers her mother making, like stuffed pork chops or a bubbling pot of chicken and noodles. “I think we need comfort right now,” she says, “and food is comfort.” Unavoidably, these home-cooked dishes come with a side of stress. We’re trying to protect ourselves from germs at the grocery store, and may wonder whether supermarket shelves will become emptier in the coming weeks. But those worries are encouraging people to get creative by trying new ingredients and sharing advice on how to use unfamiliar vegetables or cuts of meat bought out of necessity.

What can you do with the canned foods that have been idling since last year at the back of your kitchen cabinets? Facebook groups like Pandemic Pantry have sprouted up as gathering places for strangers to share advice.

Michael Volpatt, owner of the gourmet Big Bottom Market in Sonoma County, California, tackled the subject of canned goods on a recent installment of the impromptu cooking show he began hosting from his kitchen on March 14. Scrolling through Facebook while gathering ingredients to make himself dinner that night, Volpatt noticed the Facebook “Live” button on his phone screen. With his store closed, he realised it was a way to connect with friends and customers, and not be alone while preparing his meal. “Hey everybody,” his first broadcast began. “I’ve never done Facebook Live before. But I figured since I’m kind of staying at home and going to do some cooking later on, you’re going to join me.”

A growing audience now watches and comments nightly as he prepares everything from his mother’s marinara sauce to pot pies made with his Big Bottom Market biscuit mix, which appeared on Oprah’s

Favorite Things list in 2016. “It’s heartwarming,” Volpatt says, “and it takes a lot of the awkwardness of this whole experience away.”

Returning to old recipes and learning new ones can be both a necessity and a welcome distraction during this strange time. “Cooking brings back good memories,” Bierly says, “like standing there at the pot on my stove, cooking the spaghetti and thinking of when my mother used to do that.”

Food Network president Courtney White says her channel has seen a double-digit ratings increase in the past week, as viewers watch marathons of comfort food-focused shows like Guy Fieri’s “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.” FoodNetwork.com has also had a double-digit increase in visitors and page views, White says. And many of the channel’s chefs have been broadcasting informally from their home kitchens via social media, while viewers pepper them with questions in real-time.

Alone at our stoves, we’re realising how good it can feel to make dinner from scratch by using just a few ingredients consciously and carefully. Families are also getting their kids involved.

“Now, more than ever, we hope you’ll find moments of peace when gathering around the dinner table,” the co-founders of the retail chain Savory Spice wrote in a website post to their customers over the weekend. “We hope you’ll find moments of joy when preparing food with your little ones. We hope the simplicity of a home cooked meal is a quiet reprieve from the chaos outside.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pandemic-pantry-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/pandemic-pantry.html
137,27-3-20,What’s for dinner?,"While you are cooking food at home, the menu combination should be easy to prepare and satisfying

Just about now, you might be tired of cooking and eating what’s in your refrigerator. We are all used to asking what’s for dinner? What are we in the mood for — pizza, sushi, Mexican? And then going to a restaurant to get it.

Now, with the Coronavirus forcing many of us to stay home more, it’s time to look at mealtime and cooking at home a little differently. Instead of asking, ‘What I am in the mood for?’ I am looking more closely in my pantry and my refrigerator and letting my ingredients dictate what I make.

For example, a few months ago, I was lured to purchase a big bag of mixed unsalted nuts because they were labeled “Omega-3 Nut Mix.” I thought I would eat a handful of “anti-oxidants” a day for my health but they have gone largely uneaten. So, this week, I mixed up my favourite sweet and savory spices with both brown and white sugar and made my baked Sugar and Spice Candied Nuts. Sure, the sugar adds a few more calories but now they are a delicious and welcome nibble instead of sitting unused in the pantry.

Likewise, I had a head of broccoli in the refrigerator that needed cooking. I couldn’t bear the thought of steamed broccoli so I decided to roast it simply with olive oil and kosher salt at 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the tips were deeply caramelised. Broccoli is addictive roasted this way, as is cauliflower, and any leftovers are delicious the next day with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and good olive oil. If you have a pork tenderloin and a package of bacon in your fridge or freezer, you can make a simple two-ingredient main dish. A bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin dresses up your pork preparation with few ingredients and only a little more effort. If the bacon is room temperature, it will stick to itself as you overlap each piece and wrap the tenderloin. I do this with beef tenderloin as well. The smoky flavour and fat of the centre-cut bacon both protects and bastes the lean meat as it roasts. I grill mine indirectly but you can roast it in an 350 degree Fahrenheit oven set on a rack in a sheet pan. When the bacon-wrapped tenderloin is done, sprinkle it with your finishing salt and carve into thick slices to enjoy the benefit of the bacon crust.

Finally, while you are cooking dinner at home, think about each meal in simple terms: a main (usually an animal protein, or a bean or hearty vegetable dish), a green or other non-starchy vegetable, and a starch. That menu combination is easy enough to prepare and still very satisfying. During this time of uncertainty, ease and comfort are equally important. If you are making a stew or a pot of gumbo that has vegetables and protein in it, all you need to add is a starch like rice or fresh, hot cornbread.

And enjoy the cooking. A friend of mine at Traeger Wood Fired Grills sent an email this week and reminded me that “good food equals good mood.” Pass it along!",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/what---s-for-dinner--2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/what---s-for-dinner-.html
138,27-3-20,Rohit still hopeful on IPL 2020,"Star Indian opener and Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma felt that the time he spent with Ricky Ponting at the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise was “magic.”

Ponting was captain of MI in 2013, when they were yet to win an IPL title. He resigned from the post and handed it over to Rohit but stayed on as part of the coaching staff. His contribution is often seen instrumental in helping MI win their maiden IPL title that year and he would return to the franchise as a head coach, before moving to Delhi Capitals.

“Ricky Ponting to me was magic,” said Rohit on Thursday in an interaction with former England captain Kevin Pietersen on Instagram.

“The way he handled the team when he was captain during the first half and then he gave the captaincy to me midway. That takes a lot of guts and after that to be as involved as he was as a support staff member. He was supporting all the younger players in the team and he was guiding me in captaincy,” said Rohit.

Rohit said that he feels MI have made a few good purchases at the auction this year and hopes that the season starts whenever things settle. “We have got a few good additions to the squad like Chris Lynn, Trent Boult, Nathan Coulter-Nile.

“Boult is a good buy on a pitch like Wankhede with the swinging ball, I was looking forward to that. Alongwith (Jasprit) Bumrah he would have made a good combination. Still looking forward, fingers crossed. At some stage if things settle down, it should happen,” said Rohit.

Rohit also said that current Mumbai Indians coach Mahela Jayawardene is someone who gives a lot of clarity to his players. “Mahela is very calm, very composed. He only tells you to do things he sees as right or not to do them if they are wrong. His messages are very clear,” said Rohit.

The 2020 season of the IPL was scheduled to start on March 29 with defendng champions MI facing Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium in what was a repeat of the 2019 final. However the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic forced the organisers to push the tentative starting date to April 15, which itself is now clouded in uncertainty due to the three-week lockdown.

‘Itching to play’

Indian limited overs vice-captain is holed up in his apartment like everybody else these days due to three-week lockdown but said that he is making do with running up and down the stairs of his building to stay fit. “Its very hard actually (to stay fit),” said Rohit. “I live in a building which has about 54 floors and we had to stop all the indoor and outdoor activities. So just been running up and down the stairs. Not 54 floors but about two or three floors up and down and doing some conditioning exercises here and there.”

Rohit had been recovering — from a calf injury which he sustained during the fifth T20I between India and New Zealand — at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru before it was shut down due to the spread of the pandemic.

He however said that he is completely fit now, although he is yet to do an official fitness test because the NCA is not working.

He said that he has been itching to play the game again after spending two months on the sidelines and was looking forward to the IPL.

“Definitely miss playing the game. I was injured for two months so have been itching to play. When I got the news that everything was going to be postponed I was very sad. I was really looking forward to playing in the IPL,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rohit-still-hopeful-on-ipl-2020.html
139,27-3-20,Stokes continues IPL preparations despite cancellation threat,"Star England all-rounder Ben Stokes continues to train for the 13th IPL even though he is aware that the T20 league may become yet another sporting event to be cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic.

“At the moment my next competitive cricket is going to be in the IPL,” Stokes, who was bought by Rajasthan Royals in the 2018 IPL auction for Rs 12.5 crore, told the BBC.

“That hasn’t changed yet so I have to think I will be playing on April 20.”

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had said last week that the county season would not start until at least the end of May, while England’s tour of Sri Lanka was also postponed due to the dreaded disease. And given the current circumstances, a cancellation of this year’s IPL looks inevitable.

However, Stokes said he needs to keep working on his fitness to be ready if and when the IPL happens.

“I have to get my head round that I am playing even though in the back of my mind I know I am probably not,” he said.

“I have to build up and get myself physically in a position that if it does happen I am good to go. I cannot take three weeks off and expect the body to be ready for April 20 because it doesn’t work like that. It might happen and if it does I don’t want to be behind.

“There will be a lot of advice given to us and if it was an option to go we will have to take the sensible one.”

‘Shortened IPL’

England wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler is hoping for at least a curtailed IPL this season, aware that it would be difficult to conduct the “massive tournament” in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

“No news at the moment. We saw, initially, that it was going to be postponed. It’s very hard to see this changing in the immediate future, so I don’t see that as a possibility at the moment,” Buttler said in a skysports podcast.

“Obviously, it’s such a massive tournament for world cricket, so hopefully some of it can go ahead — perhaps a shortened tournament.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/stokes-continues-ipl-preparations-despite-cancellation-threat-stokes-continues-ipl-preparations-despite-cancellation-threat.html

Rohit, who has been out of action for last two months due to calf muscle injury was due for a comeback in the cash-rich Indian Premier League, which has been postponed till April 15 but stands a good chance of getting cancelled if prevailing situation continues.

""We should first think about the country. The situation needs to get better first then we can talk about the IPL. Let life get back to normal first,"" Rohit said.

The opener was responding to questions during an Instagram chat with teammate Yuzvendra Chahal.

India has so far recorded nearly 700 positive cases of coronavirus besides 16 deaths.

Globally, the death toll has crossed 22000 while infecting lakhs of people.

Thanks to the lockdown, all the Indian metropolis are wearing a deserted look.

""I haven't seen Bombay like this before. As cricketers, we don't get time with family. So much of tours and cricket is there.

He has been suspended from service.

Kollam District Collector B. Abdul Nassar on Friday morning submitted his report to the government and Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekheran recommended action to the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Later Vijayan, who is head of all civil service officials, suspended Mishra from service.

Mishra, a 2016 batch IAS officer, recently came to Kollam to take up the charge of Sub Collector. He informed his superior that he had been abroad and was asked to go for self-isolation at his official residence in Kollam, about 70 km from the state capital.

Nassar told the media on Friday that Mishra in his explanation has said that when he was told to go into self-isolation, he presumed it meant going to his residence in Sultanpur.

""This is a violation of protocol. I will submit the report of his act to the state government, who is authorised to take further action,"" said Nassar.

State Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty, who hails from Kollam district, said this is a clear case of a lack of social commitment.

According to reports, Mishra got married recently and had returned from Singapore/Malaysia. On Thursday, the officials found out that he was not present in his official residence at Kollam. He was traced with the help of police to UP's Sitapur.

He left Kerala a day before the lockdown was announced, sources added.

Mishra is in touch with the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police of Sultanpur. They are monitoring his health status and got his swab tested again. The report is awaited, sources said.

Two different set of charges will be slapped against the officer -- one for escaping from isolation and the other for violating departmental rules, as he left his home station without informing his superior, government sources said in Thiruvananthapuram.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kerala-ias-officer-skips-quarantine--traced-in-up--suspended-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/kerala-ias-officer-skips-quarantine--traced-in-up--suspended.html

Around 57% of the 11,000 scheduled participants for Tokyo had already made sure of taking part when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) pushed the Games back to 2021 due to the coronavirus on Tuesday.

The IOC and 32 international sports federations held a teleconference on Thursday where it was decided to respect the qualification process.

""Thomas Bach (the IOC President) first explained the reasons for the postponement of the Games, then said that the athletes qualified for Tokyo 2020 would automatically be qualified for 2021,"" one of the participants in the conference told AFP.

""One of the main subjects was to know when and how to organise the qualifications.

""In some federations, many sportsmen and sportswomen are not qualified and it takes at least three months for the Olympic Games to organise them.""

The 2020 Tokyo Games were scheduled for July 24-August 9, but after telephone discussions between Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a historic joint decision was taken for the first postponement of an Olympics in peacetime.

However, there is no definite date yet for the rescheduled Games with Bach saying Tuesday the Tokyo Olympics ""must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community"".

Many Olympic sports, such as boxing, saw the vast majority of their qualifying tournaments either interrupted or cancelled due to the global health situation.

Others, such as sailing however, already had 90% of their competitors qualified.

""The allocated quotas remain allocated,"" confirmed another participant in Thursday's meeting.

""Thomas Bach has confirmed that a decision (on a new date for the 2021 event) will be made within the next four weeks,"" he said.

149,27-3-20,IPL best tournament to prepare for T20 World Cup: Langer,"Australia head coach Justin Langer feels the IPL is an excellent platform to prepare for the T20 World Cup but conceded that health is paramount as the league may become another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Indian Premier League (IPL) was originally scheduled to start on March 29 in Mumbai but it was postponed to April 15 to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 24,000 people worldwide.

""Before this crisis started to unravel, we were absolutely determined for our guys to play the IPL,"" Langer was quoted as saying by foxsports.co.au.

""Because with the T20 World Cup coming up, there's no better grounding, no better practice, no better tournament for them to get ready for that,"" he added.

However, keeping in view the fast increasing transmission of the deadly disease, the Indian government has called for a nation-wide 21-day lockdown, which has casts serious doubts over the future of the cash-rich event's 13th edition.

""But obviously things have changed a lot. The health of not only our individual players, but also our country and India as a whole is paramount here,"" Langer said.

Australia's Pat Cummins, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steve Smith were to headline the IPL.

Langer, who is also a member of the national selection panel, insists he is not stressed about picking players as Australia have a well settled side.

The Aaron Finch-led side defeated South Africa 2-1 in three-match T20 series in February.

""In terms of selection, I'm not too stressed about it ... one or two positions in our World Cup side are up for grabs. It's a very, very settled team. We played great cricket against South Africa,"" he added.

Australia are scheduled to start their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan on October 24 in Sydney.

155,27-3-20,Centre provides Rs 1.7L cr succour to poor,"Focus on migrant/farm labourers; Rs 50L insurance for health-sanitation workers; fund to prevent lay-off

The Centre on Thursday unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package for the weaker section of the society to deal with the impact of the three-weak nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, there was nothing for the corporate sector that has taken a big hit due to the pandemic.

The economic package to help migrant workers, labourers, poor and agricultural workers, and others will come into effect immediately. “It has been made to reach out to the most vulnerable sections of the society who are in need of immediate help because of the economic disruption,” said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur was present, besides Atanu Chakraborty, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs and Debashish Panda, Secretary, Department of Financial Services.

Sitharaman also announced direct cash transfers for a large number of affected people, including senior citizens, widows, farmers and daily-wage labourers.

As per the package, health and sanitation workers will be insured for Rs 50 lakh per person. This will cover nearly 20 lakh persons.

“Safai karamcharis, ward boys, nurses, paramedics, technicians, doctors and specialists, and others’ health would be covered by a special insurance scheme. Any health professional who while treating Covid-19 patients meets with some accident, then he/she would be compensated with an amount of Rs 50 lakh under the scheme,” stated the Government Press release.

The package says that under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana 80 crore poor people will get 5 kg per person rice/wheat each month for the next 3 months in addition to 5kg of rice/wheat that they already get. Besides, 1kg of pulse according to regional preference for each household.

In a big relief to the rural women, the package says that 8.3 crore BPL Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries will be given free cylinders for the next three months. During this period, a maximum of three gas cylinders will be provided.

The move comes two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown.

Most of the financial benefits will be routed through the DBT scheme into the Jan Dhana account of the beneficiaries. In case, they don’t have such accounts, the Government will make alternative arrangement to provide them financial relief.

Sitharaman announced that daily wages under the MNREGA have been increased to Rs 202 a day from Rs 182. This will benefit nearly 5 crore families, Sitharaman said.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, farmers will get Rs 2,000 in April. This is expected to cover 8.7 crore families. The total amount distributed is estimated to be Rs 16,000 crore.

In addition, a total of 20.40 crore PM JAN Dhan Yojana women account-holders will be given ex-gratia of Rs 500 per month for next three months.

“This will help them run their household during this difficult period. For this purpose, the Government of India will spend Rs 31,000 crore,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

Amid clamour for relief to low-wage earners in the unorganised sector who face a gloomy scenario due to the lockdown, the Government has decided to pay 24 per cent of their monthly wages into their Provident Fund accounts for the next three months.

“Wage earners below Rs 15,000 per month in businesses having less than 100 workers are at risk of losing their employment,” the Government said, adding that the assistance would help prevent “disruption in their employment”. The package also hopes to provide succour to senior citizens, widows and divyangs, numbering 3 crore.

“The Government will give them Rs 1,000 to tide over difficulties during next three months. Rs 3,000 crore has been provided for this purpose in the PM Garib Kalyan Package,” the Finance Minister said.

As per the Government’s decision, the Employees’ Provident Fund Regulations will be amended to include ‘pandemic’ as the reason to allow non-recoverable advance of 75 per cent of the amount or three months of the wages, whichever is lower, from their accounts.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/centre-provides-rs-1-7l-cr-succour-to-poor-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/centre-provides-rs-1-7l-cr-succour-to-poor.html

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Thursday made the announcement making it clear that the order ""shall come into force on the date of its publication in the official Gazette"".

In the order, the government declared that the Central government is ""satisfied that the drug hydroxychloroquine is essential to meet the requirements of emergency arising due to pandemic COVID-19 and in the public interest, it is necessary and expedient to regulate and restrict the sale and distribution of the drug 'hydroxychloroquine' and preparation based thereon for preventing their misuse"".

157,27-3-20,US has most confirmed coronavirus cases in world,"The US now has more coronavirus cases than any other country after more than 16,000 COVID-19 infections were reported there in a single day, taking the number of patients in America to over 85,600, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

Globally, a total of 24,057 people have died due to the novel coronavirus with Italy standing at the top with 8,215 deaths, followed by Spain (4,365) and China (3,169), the varsity figures stated.

America leads with 85,653 COVID-19 cases, followed by China with 81,782 and Italy with 80,589 infections, the data showed.

According to Worldometer, the website that records confirmed cases of infection and deaths globally, the US by Thursday night had 85,088 individuals infected with coronavirus, of which 16,877 were added just in a single day. A week ago, the number of confirmed cases were 8,000. It has dangerously surged 10 times in the span of a week.

With at least 263 deaths, the US also reported most number of fatalities due to the contagion on a single day on Thursday. At least 1,290 Americans have died due to coronavirus so far, the website reported.

Over 2,000 coronavirus cases were reportedly in a serious condition. The number of confirmed cases as well as the deaths due to COVID-19 are likely to increase substantially in the coming days.

In China, where the outbreak originated in December, 3,287 people have died due to coronavirus pandemic while Italy has recorded 8,215 such deaths.

US President Donald Trump attributed the spike in the confirmed cases to the large-scale testing of the deadly disease.

""I think it's a tribute to our testing,"" he said, adding ""no one knows what the numbers are in China"".

Vice President Mike Pence said it was important for hospitals and labs testing the samples to report back to the Centre for Disease Control and Federal Emergency Management Agency so that the government has full visibility to provide the President with the best counsel.

The Abbott Laboratory submitted to Food and Drug Administration a national request for approval of a point-of-care test, he said, adding that this would be the kind of test where one could go to a doctor and get the test done and have the results in no more than 15 minutes.

In an in interview with the CNN, Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert said it was difficult to tell where the pandemic will go and how long it will last in the US.

This is the relative percentage of asymptomatic infection and it ""influences everything,"" he said.

It influences transmission, contact tracing, and the measures that the authorities need to take. That's why the most important thing to do now is to conduct widespread testing and collect more data, he asserted.

He called for ratcheting up the current level of contact tracing and testing.

""We've got to do it better than we are now,"" he said.

According to Deborah Brix, coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, 55 per cent of all new cases continue out of the New York - New York Metro area. This includes New Jersey as well, she said, expressing concern over the coronavirus spread.

""At the same time, 19 of the 50 states that had early cases, but have persistently low level of cases and at this point have less than 200 cases,"" she said.

Brix said the US had done 5,50,000 tests so far.

""We are still running somewhere about 14 per cent overall. That means 86 per cent of the people with significant symptoms because remember you had to have a fever and symptoms to get tested at this point. So still 86 per cent are negative,"" she said.

These are really important facts for the American people, Brix said.

She was critical of some of the modelling studies which had said that there would be 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2 million deaths in the US.

""They have adjusted that number in the UK to 20,000. Half a million to 20,000. We are looking into this in great detail to understand that adjustment,"" she said.

""When people start talking about 20 per cent of a population getting infected, it's very scary but we don't have data that matches that based on the experience,"" Brix said.

She assured Americans that there was no shortage of essential medical supplies including ventilators and ICU beds.

159,27-3-20,China reports one local coronavirus case after three days; imported cases near 600,"China has reported one domestically transmitted coronavirus case after three days and 54 new imported infections on Thursday, prompting Beijing to temporarily cancel visas for foreigners and restrict flights to prevent a second wave of the deadly COVID-19 in the country, health officials said on Friday.

The Chinese health authority said on Friday that it received reports of 55 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Thursday, of which 54 were imported.

A new domestic case was reported in Zhejiang Province, the National Health Commission (NHC) said while epicentres Hubei and Wuhan continue to report zero cases.

Also on Thursday, five deaths were reported all from Hubei province taking the overall death toll of coronavirus in the country to 3,292.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 81,340 by the end of Thursday, including 3,292 people who died of the disease, 3,460 patients who were still undergoing treatment.

The imported cases mostly of the Chinese nationals returning from abroad, especially the new virus epicentres like Italy and other EU countries, increased steadily in the last few days.

On Thursday, 54 new imported cases were reported from different cities taking the total so far to 595.

The NHC said 189 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

By the end of Thursday, 453 confirmed cases, including four deaths, have been reported in Hong Kong, 33 confirmed cases in the Macao and 252 in Taiwan, including two deaths.

As the imported cases increased, China on Thursday announced a temporary ban on the entry of foreigners holding valid visas or residence permits and drastically cut international flights in a bid to prevent the second wave of infections amid a surge in the number of imported cases in the country.

In view of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 across the world, China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits still valid to the time of this announcement, effective from midnight of March 28, 2020, a statement jointly released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the National Immigration Administration said.

Earlier, China's civil aviation regulator issued a circular on Thursday to further cut international flights as part of the efforts to stem the inflow of novel COVID-19 cases.

All domestic airlines were allowed to operate only one flight to each country per week, while foreign aviation companies should keep only one air route to China and there should be no more than one flight every week for each of the air route to China, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a circular that will be effective from March 29.

Stricter measures will also be taken to curb the spread of the virus on flights arriving or leaving the country and ensure that passenger load factor is lower than 75 per cent, the CAAC said, adding that it might further slash international flights if necessary.

The virus that first emerged in China's Wuhan city in the Hubei province in December last year has spread to 175 countries, infected 531,860 people and has claimed 24,057 lives, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.

160,27-3-20,Venezuela slams 'unfounded' US charges against Maduro,"The Venezuelan government slammed the indictments made by the US against President Nicolas Maduro and more than a dozen top officials for alleged drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism, and called them ""unfounded"".

""Venezuela denounces ... a new type of coup d'etat on the basis of vile, vulgar and unfounded accusations designed to minimize the high regard Venezuela enjoys in the fight against drug trafficking,"" Efe news agency quoted Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza as saying in a televised address on Thursday.

Earlier in the day, the US government announced multiple indictments against Maduro and 14 other figures associated with the Chavista regime in Caracas, as well as two dissidents from the now disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas for drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism.

Arreaza accused the Donald Trump administration of ""attacking the people and their democratic institutions"" while ""humanity is facing the most ferocious of pandemics"", a reference to the global coronavirus crisis.

On Thursday, the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a virtual press conference that she had a message for all top Venezuelan officials: ""The party's over.""

Prosecutors in Florida and New York, where the US Justice Department filed the charges, said that over the past 20 years, the Venezuelan government has been conspiring with the FARC to ship tons of cocaine to the US.

US Attorney General William Barr said that Maduro and other top Chavista officials - including National Constituent Assembly (ANC) president Diosdado Cabello - were part of the ""Cartel of the Suns"", the name of which refers to the insignia worn on the uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officers.

According to Barr, the socialist Maduro - as the ""leader"" of the cartel - and other Venezuelan officials have worked with the FARC dissidents to send some 250 tonnes of cocaine per year to the US via the Caribbean and several Central American countries, including Honduras.

""The Maduro regime is awash in corruption and criminality,"" said Barr at an online press conference. ""While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money, and the proceeds of their corruption. And this has to come to an end.""

This is the second time in US history that charges have been filed against a foreign head of state, the first being in 1989 when prosecutors in Miami charged Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega with drug trafficking, ultimately arresting him during the American invasion of that country, then bringing him to trial, convicting him and imprisoning him in Florida.

161,27-3-20,Brazil's Bolsonaro exempts churches from quarantine,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro decreed Thursday that places of worship are ""essential services"" that must be exempted from coronavirus confinement orders, the far-right leader's latest jab at aggressive containment measures.

The decree, published in the government diary, adds ""religious activities of any kind"" to the list of exempted services, alongside supermarkets and pharmacies.

It adds that such activities must be carried out ""in accordance with health ministry guidelines."" Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018 with the backing of Brazil's burgeoning evangelical Christian community, has clashed with local authorities who have closed schools and businesses in places such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

The president, who has called the reaction to the pandemic ""overblown,"" says such measures are unnecessary and will wreck Latin America's biggest economy.

Most places of worship in Brazil have already suspended services because of the outbreak, often broadcasting them online instead.

However, some prominent religious leaders have refused.

Asked if the coronavirus in Brazil could reach the same level of infection as in the United States, Bolsonaro said he didn't ""believe it will reach that point."" Brazilians, he said, ""don't catch anything.

You see a guy jumping over sewer water there, he goes out, he falls in... and nothing happens to him."" ""Moreover I believe that many people are already infected (with the coronavirus) in Brazil, weeks or months ago -- they already have antibodies that help it to not proliferate,"" Bolsonaro said, speaking to reporters outside the presidential residence in Brasilia.

Last week, the influential evangelical pastor Silas Malafaia, a Bolsonaro ally, called confinement measures ""a tactic by Satan."" ""My friends, do not worry about coronavirus.

It is just another tactic by Satan. Satan works with fear,"" he said.

Malafaia changed course Friday and suspended his churches' services. But he insisted that was because of official restrictions on public transportation, and said the doors would remain open for worshippers.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/brazil-s-bolsonaro-exempts-churches-from-quarantine-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-exempts-churches-from-quarantine.html

163,27-3-20,"As corona testing ratio too low, assessment has long way to go","With billion plus population, only 25,000 samples tested so far

With just around 25,000 samples tested from around 24,000 individuals so far, India with a billion plus population has to go a long way in assessing the true extent of coronavirus spread.

The test size is being considered as one of the lowest in the world on population yardstick. Various reports as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has been insisting on “test, test and test” asserting lockdown is not complete solution to combat the virus which has infected over 700 people and killed 15 so far in India.

Compare India with the US, which has four time less population, on testing parameters. While only around 24,000 individuals have been tested in India, the number stands around 60,000 for the USA.

WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been maintaining at various forum that “all countries should be able to test all suspected cases, they cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded.”

On Thursday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) directed hospitals, including the private ones, to collect the nasal and throat swab samples of the suspected cases of COVID19 in one VTM tube and transport them to the nearest testing laboratory in cold chain.

Till now, only people in contact with the infected or those with travel history to high-risk countries, or health workers managing patients with severe respiratory disease and developing Covid-19 symptoms, are eligible for test.

To ensure availability of testing kits, the Government through the ICMR has sought price quotes for the supply of 10 lakh antibody kits (serological test) for diagnosis of COVID-19. It will also procure 7 lakh RNA extraction kits, for a method which is currently used for the testing of the virus in the country.

Since, the clearance of the company manufacturing these kits will take its own time, experts say that India is already too late in ramping up its efforts to contain the deadly disease.

Meanwhile, on the suggestions of the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the ICMR has given nod to labs at Virology Department of the All Indian Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, KEM, Mumbai, NICED, Kolkata and Nimhans in Bangalore the to validate the testing kits.

The DCGI had pointed out that the country’s only lab, NIV-Pune that has been assigned for validation of kits will not be able to do job with cent per cent accuracy because of the load to test the kits hence, more labs should be asked to do the task.

The agency has invited kit manufacturers to quote their prices. It has also asked them about supply timeline and capacity available for COVID-19 testing kits that are approved by ICMR or international authorities like USFDA and EUA. The supply locations for the test kits are Dibrugarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhopal and Delhi.

In addition to over a 100 Government laboratories that have been approved for the COVID-19 testing, the Union Health Ministry has roped in close to 30 private laboratories with over 17,000 collection centres all over the country to carry out COVID-19 tests based on the ICMR protocols.

The laboratories are in the process of procuring the test kits and readying themselves for scaling up testing capabilities. The ICMR has also indicated that it might go for parallel contracts to more than one vendors to ensure timely supply.

Once community transmission is documented, the testing strategy will undergo changes to evolve into stage-appropriate testing strategy, the ICMR has said. Advisory for testing are being reviewed and updated periodically.

Now let’s take a look at Maharashtra which has recorded the maximum number of positive cases. Amid reports that Maharashtra lacks enough testing facilities for Covid-19, State Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh does not quite agree with it.

“As of now, we can cater to our current requirements. God forbid, there should not community spread of the pandemic in the State. On our part, we are preparing ourselves for the worst and are enhancing further testing facilities across the State,” Deshmukh told The Pioneer.

According to Deshmukh, the State currently has a capacity to test 2,000 Covid-19 samples in 14 Government-run laboratories across the State. “Before the outbreak of coronavirus, we had three laboratories National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and IGMC Hospital in Nagpur that had the capacity to carry out 800 Covind-19 tests. We have now added 11 more medical college-com-hospitals across the State for carrying out the necessary tests. Together, we have the capacity to 2,000 samples in these 14 Government-run labs,” Deshmukh said.

The 11 Government institution labs where Covid-19 testing has now been allowed are BJ Medical College-hospital, Pune, GSMC Hospital, KEM Hospital, Grant Medical-JJ Hospital, Haffkine Institute, all in Mumbai, AFMC college-hospital, Pune and Government medical college-associated Hospitals at Miraj, Akola, Aurangabad, Pune, Solapur and Nagpur.

In addition, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday granted permission to nine private laboratories in Maharashtra to undertake coronavirus tests. They comprise: HN Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre, Kokilaben Dhirubai Ambani Hospital Laboratory, Thyrocare Technology Limited, Metropolis Health Care Limited, IGenetic Diagnostic Pvt Ltd, SRL Limited, Suburban Diagnostics (India) Pvt Limited, all in Mumbai, AG Diagnostics Pvt Limited, Pune and InfeXn Laboratories, Thane (west).

“I reckon that these private laboratories can together undertake 2,000 Covid-19 tests a day. If we put the capacities of the Government and private hospitals together, we have total capacity to undertake 28,000-30,000 coronavirus tests in a seven-day week. This is more than sufficient cases considering that we are currently testing referral Covid-19 samples from various hospitals across the State,” Deshmukh said.

iGenetic Diagnostics, which was one of the pathology labs with NABL accredited centers located in Mumbai, elsewhere in Maharashtra, Delhi and Bengaluru that have been permitted by the ICMR to undertake Covid-19 test, says it can carry out 500 tests in a day. “We can carry out 500 Covid-19 tests in a day. We will collect samples from the homes of patients on the basis of prescriptions. We will carry out tests at the Government-prescribed price of Rs 4,500 per test. We have taken this initiative to support the Government in all its efforts to control the spread of this disease” iGenetic Diagnostics’ founder-CEO Arunima Patel said.

Meanwhile, according to a medical bulletin put out by the Public Health Department of the Maharashtra Government on Wednesday evening, as many as 2,988 people have - since January 18 --been hospitalised in various isolation wards across the State owing to them developing symptoms such as fever, cold, cough etc. Of the total admissions, 2,531 laboratory samples were negative and 122 have tested positive for coronavirus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/as-corona-testing-ratio-too-low--assessment-has-long-way-to-go-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/as-corona-testing-ratio-too-low--assessment-has-long-way-to-go.html
164,27-3-20,India has over 1-yr foodgrain reserve,"The Centre has enough foodgrain reserves to feed the poor amid the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.

According to official data, the Government currently has 58.49 million tonnes (MT) of foodgrains in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns. Out of which, rice constitutes 30.97 million tonne and wheat 27.52 million tonne.

The foodgrain stock is much higher than the required norm of maintaining a reserve of about 21 million tonne as on April 1. The Government will supply over next three months additional 2 kg subsidised foodgrains under the PDS, taking the total monthly quota to 7 kg per person.

Sources said 58.49 million tonnes of grains can enable the distribution of a full year’s quota in advance to all ration card holders and beneficiaries of other welfare schemes. “Also, there is a stock of around 3 million metric tonnes of pulses, 1.1 million metric tonnes of oil seed and 4 million tonnes of sugar,” the sources said.

Further, wheat procurement is about to start soon. The Consumer Affair Ministry allowed FCI to sell food stocks to private markets under the Open Market Sale Scheme. Besides, the Government has asked fast moving consumers good firms to ramp up supplies to meet domestic demand.

“FCI godowns has sufficient reserves to meet the demand and officials are keeping a close watch on distribution of foodgrains,” Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said in a tweet.

State-run Food Corporation of India (FCI), the Government’s nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains under the Public Distribution System, is keeping a close watch on supply of subsidised grains to the ration-card holders, he added.

Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), the Government is supplying 5 kg of foodgrains per month to over 80 crore people at a highly subsidised price. Wheat is supplied at Rs 2/kg and rice at Rs 3/kg.

In 2018-19, around 57 million tonnes of wheat and rice was distributed in the country through the ration shops network. That included grain for schemes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mid-day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and the Annapurna Yojana, apart from the needs of defence forces.

In the case of pulses, NAFED has stock of pulses at 3 million metric tonnes that can be immediately offloaded to markets. Except for red gram (arhar) that needs processing, all pulses varieties at NAFED are ready for distribution.

In the case of oilseed, one problem is that processing has to be quick, as they need to be converted into the edible form. This could mean some supply disruption. Even so, the oilseed stock with the Government is around 1.1 mt. Of this, 800,000 tonnes is groundnut seed and the rest is of mustard. Mustard seed’s conversion into oil is easier and quicker than groundnut’s.

The Centre allowed poor households applicable under public distribution scheme to lift six months of grains in one go. The move will not only ensure that ensure rural families have enough to survive but will also keep a check on price rise. India has enough grain stock to supply to its citizens for more than one year.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-has-over-1-yr-foodgrain-reserve-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-has-over-1-yr-foodgrain-reserve.html
165,27-3-20,"88 new cases, highest single day hike","India recorded 88 new positive coronavirus cases on Thursday, the single largest in a day, as the total count of confirmed cases, including 16 deaths and cured ones, reached 694. In a clear message that there will not be any let-up in the lockdown, the Government extended the ban on international flight operations to India to April 14.

“It has been decided that scheduled international commercial passenger services shall remain closed till 6:30 am (GMT) of April 14, 2020. This will not apply to approve international all-cargo operations and flights,” said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in a statement. Even as the coronavirus infected cases continue to move northward, the Government on Thursday asserted that India is not in the community transmission stage of coronavirus pandemic.

A senior Ministry official said if and when India registers community transmission of the deadly virus, people will be informed for their safety. Talking to media during the routine Press briefing here, head scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar said there is no hard evidence to say there has been community transmission of the novel coronavirus in India. The total count of positive Covid-19 cases in India neared the 694 mark, as per latest figures made available by the Union Health Ministry, as the country entered second day of the 21-day long lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as a measure to contain the spread of the deadly contagion.

He said social distancing is the strongest counter of the pandemic.Goa and Kashmir reported first coronavirus death. A 65-year-old man hailing from Hyderpora area, Srinagar, died on Thursday, becoming the first fatality in Jammu & Kashmir due to coronavirus while Maharashtra reported its fourth fatality.Dr Gangakhedkar dismissed claims that lack of travel or contact history of a Hyderabad positive case reflected that India was in the community transmission stage. “If we can’t figure out how one-two people got the virus it just means that we have not done enough to trace the history,” Dr Gangakhedkar said.Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said we can consider we are in community transmission stage only when there are about 20 to 30 per cent cases with no clue on how they got the virus.”If India enters that stage, we will not hide it. We will tell people so that we can step up the level of alertness and awareness,” he said.The Health Ministry officials also dismissed international studies saying India may face a staggering number of cases in the near future as doomsday predictors.On being asked about the predictions of a University of Michigan study, which said India could face between 100,000 to 13 lakh confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus by mid-May, Dr Gangakhedkar said there would be many doomsday predictors, but if the current lockdown is successful then we may not even see the current numbers budge. Agarwal said, “If we collectively work for it and follow guidelines issued by the government, we will soon be able to say that we have proved all these predictions wrong.” He said social distancing has been able to help break the chain of Covid-19 spread. “While the numbers of Covid-19 cases are increasing, the rate at which they are increasing appears to be relatively stabilising. However, this is only the initial trend,” he said.A senior Home Ministry official said the Government is working to ensure the supply of essentials. “The Government is taking steps to ensure that production, supply or distribution of essential goods and services do not get affected during coronavirus lockdown. States are working to provide food and shelter to migrant workers,” Punya Salila Srivastava, Joint Secretary, MHA said.The Health Ministry said 17 States have started work on earmarking hospitals for dedicated treatment of Covid-19 patients. Forty-five people have been cured so far.As per data by the Health Ministry, Maharashtra has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases so far at 128, including three foreign nationals, followed by Kerala which has recorded 118 cases, including eight foreign nationals.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/88-new-cases--highest-single-day-hike-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/88-new-cases--highest-single-day-hike.html

In a joint Press meet with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “We have decided to allow all establishments that supply essential items or are part of the supply chain for such items to function 24x7 to prevent overcrowding during the day. This will require no additional permits and licences. E-commerce companies in Delhi can home deliver essential commodities and employees’ identity cards to be considered valid,” he said.

Addressing people via video streaming, Kejriwal said areas SDMs and ACPs must ensure opening of shops and factories supplying such as vegetables, general, ration, medicines in their areas.

“ACPs have been tasked with ensuring that all the grocery shops and other utility stores remain open. Today we discussed delivery of essential services,” he said.

Kejriwal said, “We have ordered that there will be no restriction on e-commerce companies providing essential services. We have also formulated a plan by which we can check if the essential service providers are working at the ground and if they have enough stock or not.”

Citing Delhi’ health bulletin report on COVID -19, the CM announced that right now Delhi has a total of 36 COVI-19 positive cases. In the last 24 hours, only one new case was reported. “Among the 36 cases, 26 of them travelled from coronavirus affected countries and 10 people got the virus through local transmission.”

168,27-3-20,3-ply face masks can’t be priced above Rs 16/piece,"In its efforts to make face masks and hand sanitisers available to the masses, the Ministry of Food and Consumer Affairs on Thursday capped the price of 3-ply face masks made of melt blown non-woven fabric at Rs 16 per piece till June 30 and also allowed distilleries and sugar mills to manufacture hand sanitisers in bulk.

Licences have also been issued to 45 distilleries in an order to maintain demand and supply balance of sanitisers due to skyrocketing demand amid coronavirus.

Consumer Affairs Secretary Pawan Agarwal on Thursday said the retail price of 2-ply and 3-ply surgical face masks remain the same. The rates will remain in force up to June 30. The Consumer Affairs Ministry had notified MRP for 2 ply and 3 ply ‘’surgical’’ face masks at Rs 8 and Rs 10 per piece, respectively on March 21. But for 3 ply melt blown face masks, it had said MRP would at the rate that prevailed as on February 12.

“We had a meeting with face mask manufacturers. They were facing some challenges because of lack of clarity on MRP front. So, we have decided to fix the MRP of 3 ply melt blown face masks at Rs 16 per piece,” Agarwal added.

On allowing distilleries and sugar mills to manufacture hand sanitisers in bulk, Agarwal said the department had received 100 applications, of which we have given licence to 45 distilleries so far apart from 564 other manufacturers. “These companies will manufacture hand sanitisers in bulk. More than 55 distilleries are likely to be given permission in one or two days and many more are being motivated to produce hand sanitisers,” he said.

These manufacturers have also been asked to work in three shifts to maximize their output.

The Ministry has also asked the State Governments to remove any bottlenecks and ensure continuous availability in supply of raw materials — Ethyl Alcohol, ENA (extra neutral alcohol) and ethanol to manufacturers of hand sanitizers.

The permission has been given under the Drug Prices Control Order. Most of them have commenced production and others are likely to commence production in a week’s time,” Agarwal added.

State Governments have also been asked to give permission to distilleries on a priority basis to produce sanitizer in bulk, which can then be packed and bottled.

Leading hand sanitizer brands such as Lifebuoy, Savlon, Godrej Protekt and Dettol have been trying to ensure a steady supply of sanitizers, the supply has allegedly faltered in many places. High demand for hand sanitizers since the beginning of March had led to hoarding which caused a spike in prices and also sale of spurious products.

The sanitizer is divided into two categories: first is the over the counter (OTC) sanitizers in which the FMCG brands used to dominate till outbreak of corona. However, post-corona, the local illegal and unregulated production of OTC hand sanitizers have mushroomed in the country. The second category is of hospitals, which is catered to by a different set of MNCs and Indian companies and which is also facing shortages of raw materials due to jump in demand.

Earlier, the Government has brought these raw materials under the Essential Commodities Act and fixed price of ethanol used in hand sanitizer to not exceed what it was on March 5.

“Sanitizer industry operating in the State should be encouraged to operate their units in all the three shifts. Indian Sugar Mills Association and All India Distilleries Association have assured that Ethyl Alcohol, ENA (extra neutral alcohol) and ethanol will be made available to the sanitizer industry at reasonable price. The distillery units can also manufacture sanitizers in bulk,” the notification said.

The Government had also put a price ceiling to ensure that hand sanitizers are made available to the general public and hospitals at rational rates; the maximum retail price of hand sanitizers was fixed at Rs 100 for 200 ml bottle, consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan had said in a tweet last week.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/3-ply-face-masks-can---t-be-priced-above-rs-16-piece-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/3-ply-face-masks-can---t-be-priced-above-rs-16-piece.html

On Thursday, another blast took place near a Sikh crematorium here, injuring a child and disrupting funeral services for the 25 members of the minority community killed in the gurdwara attack.

The Sikh families cremated the remains of the victims on Thursday and urged the government to investigate the attacks.

Some Sikh citizens said they are tired of living in Afghanistan , the TOLO News reported.

We want investigations, our 25 people have been killed, said Dip Singh, a relative of one victim who was killed.

Which religious book asks you to attack a mosque or a Dharamshala. In what religion does that happen? Andar Singh, a family member of a slain victim, was quoted as saying.

Wednesday's attack was one of the deadliest targeting the Sikh community in the strife-torn country. Eighty people, including women and children, were rescued from the Gurdwara.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, saying the attack on the religious sites shows the extreme weakness of the enemy, religious sites should not be vulnerable to attacks and violence.

Sikhs have been target of attacks by Islamist militants before in Afghanistan.

In July 2018, ISIS terrorists bombed a gathering of Sikhs and Hindus in the eastern city of Jalalabad, killing 19 people and injuring 20.

171,27-3-20,Scarlett Johansson's daughter to be 'flower girl' at her wedding,"Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson says she is looking forward to seeing her daughter Rose ""in a flower girl dress"" at her upcoming wedding with ""Saturday Night Live"" writer Colin Jost.

Johansson and Jost engaged last May after dating for two years.

The couple has often been seen spending time with Johansson's five-year-old daughter, whom she shares with ex-husband, journalist Romain Dauriac.

The ""Jojo Rabbit"" actor said she tries to instill values in Rose such as reducing food waste and be more environment friendly, reported People magazine.

""It's hard, especially because my daughter is only five, so her world is so small. I think reminding her of how other people live and how her actions impact others is where to begin.

""Kids are aware of their own waste now and how to conserve and recycle. She sometimes will say things like, 'We can't use plastic straws'. I didn't even teach her that!"" Johansson said.

172,27-3-20,Evangeline Lilly apologises for 'arrogant' remarks about self-quarantine,"Actor Evangeline Lilly has tendered an apology over her ""dismissive"" and ""arrogant"" statement about social distancing in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.

The ""Ant-Man"" star was severely criticised on social by many, including ""Game of Thrones"" actor Sophie Turner and Maggie Grace, for saying that she won't be going into self-quarantine as she values freedom over everything else.

In a new post on Instagram, Lilly regretted her earlier statement and said she is practising social distancing now.

""I want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity I showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through COVID19. Grandparents, parents, children, sisters and brothers are dying, the world is rallying to find a way to stop this very real threat, and my ensuing silence has sent a dismissive, arrogant and cryptic message.

""My direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic. I never meant to hurt you. When I wrote that post 10 days ago, I thought I was infusing calm into the hysteria. I can see now that I was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation,"" the actor wrote.

Lilly said she is saddened that so many people have lost their lives due to COVID-19.

""I am grieved by the ongoing loss of life, and the impossible decisions medical workers around the world must make as they treat those affected. I am concerned for our communities small businesses and families living paycheck-to-paycheck and I am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help.

""Like many of you, I fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic, and I am praying for us all. At the same time, I am heartened by the beauty and humanity I see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time,"" she added.

Last Week, Lilly, 40, shared that she dropped her kids off at a gymnastics camp and that ""they all washed their hands before going in"".

She accompanied the post with the hashtag ""business as usual"", which did not go down well with many social media users.

The actor later wrote in the comments section, ""Some people value their lives over freedom, some people value freedom over their lives. We all make our choices. Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law for my comfort already, all in the name of a respiratory flu.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/evangeline-lilly-apologises-for--arrogant--remarks-about-self-quarantine-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/evangeline-lilly-apologises-for--arrogant--remarks-about-self-quarantine.html
173,27-3-20,Honey Singh: People nowadays get offended too quickly,"Pop star-composer Yo Yo Honey Singh says staying away from the industry for two to three years never made him nervous about losing it.

Asked about the fear of someone taking their place, he said: ""I don't want to outdo anyone's thought, but staying away from the industry for two-three years never made me nervous or fear of losing it. The time, I was away from 2017 till now, I composed 60 songs.""

""And I never felt out of the scene, because people were still grooving to my songs and loving my work. I am in the hearts and DNA of my audience, and no one changes that,"" he added.

The singer has been vocal about his struggles with bipolar disorder and alcoholism.

""I never let negativity reach me or any other aspect of my life, may it be songs, personal life or health. Talking about my health was a way of keeping my larger family and fans informed on my phase of life. I have written songs on my experience; they are more serious and philosophical. I will release the songs to tell my story to people,"" he said.

Talking about his journey as a person, the singer said: ""Early years of my career, I stretched and exerted myself extensively and I knew it would eventually affect my health. I have changed myself and my routine completely. Akshay (Kumar) sir is a huge inspiration for me. I wake up early, I give myself time to do my tasks and not rush myself into it.""

Recollecting his experience touring with Shah Rukh Khan in Australia, Honey Singh said: ""We went on an Australia tour with Shah Rukh Khan and there were protests against me performing, saying that I promote alcohol. Shah Rukh sir stepped in and said that if I don't come, then this tour won't happen at all. After the show, we were partying in my room and that's when I wrote the song - ‘Chaar bottle vodka'. We made Shah Rukh listen to the track and he asked what kind of song is this and we said,'this is about the 4 bottles of vodka that we finished last night'.""

The ""Loca"" hitmaker feels people now get offended easily.

""I think people nowadays get offended too quickly. As much I support the freedom of expression, I still think that you get judged on every single thing. In the past, we had songs like 'Mehbooba mehbooba', 'Choli ke peeche kya hai', 'Chumma chumma' and more, but they never got discussed of being morally correct or not. As an artist it becomes difficult to please the audience at large and be creative at the same time.""

The singer shared his thoughts in an episode of ""By Invite Only"", which airs on zoOm.

The singer isn't against the current remix trend, and said: ""I think everyone is original. Even though they are making remix, they are all original"".

In a fun quickie session, Honey Singh said: ""If I would be single, would take Alia Bhatt on a date with me"". When quizzed about one Bollywood actor who is overrated, Honey gave a witty response: ""Himesh Reshammiya.""

The long forgotten instrument Dotara, the folk language and melody, the colours, the dance, the flowers in the video. I truly believe these are aspects of India that are gorgeous and should be represented, to make people Groove to a whole new groove and just be happy"".

""This is the first time I have played with a new language on my single. The instrumentation has been kept as folk as it can be. In fact the original instrument where the song starts is called a DoTara, it's a two string instrument that was used by the Bauls of Bengal, when they used to travel from village to village, singing their stories. ‘Genda phool' is an amalgamation of folk melody with urban tunes and programming and has one purpose - To make you dance,"" he added.

""In December 2019, we were contacted by someone who claimed to have test files related to a subset of our current and future graphics products, some of which were recently posted online, but have since been taken down,"" AMD spokesperson said in a statement.

The stolen material include source code for Navi 10 (think Radeon RX 5700 series), the future Navi 21 and the Arden GPU inside the Xbox Series X.

The alleged hacker has valued the information at $100 million, though it's not exactly clear if that's its actual value.

AMD has filed multiple takedown notices to Microsoft-owned open source software development platform GitHub, where the source code for the Navi GPU was hosted until recently.

According to network traffic analysis carried out by Motherboard, Zoom for iOS is sending data to Facebook without making any mention of the practice in its privacy policy.

Upon downloading and opening the app, Zoom connects to Facebook's Graph API. The Graph API is the main way developers get data in or out of Facebook.

The data includes information about when a user starts the app, what kind of device they use, where they are located, their phone carrier, and unique advertiser data that companies use to create targeted ads.

""Zoom notes that it may collect data related to a user's Facebook profile, but does not explicitly mention sharing data on users who don't have a Facebook account"", said the report.

The company was yet to issue a statement on the report.

Zoom has become enormously popular as a video conferencing solution for both work and more social settings owing to the new coronavirus pandemic as most people are now working from home globally.

Some of the collaboration tools that have gained increased traction due to remote working in India include Zoom.

178,27-3-20,Indonesian volcano spews massive ash cloud,"Indonesia's most active volcano Mount Merapi erupted Friday, shooting a column of ash some 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) into the air in its second major eruption this month.

Ash and sand covered areas several kilometres (miles) away from the peak of the rumbling crater near Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta.

But authorities did not raise Merapi's alert level.

""There has been no reports of damage from the eruption. We urge people to stay calm and not panic,"" national disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.

Merapi erupted earlier this month, shooting a massive ash cloud some 6,000 metres in the air.

That eruption coated Yogyakarta and neighbouring city Solo with grey dust and forced an airport closure.

Mount Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of 280,000 residents.

That was Merapi's most powerful eruption since 1930, which killed around 1,300 people, while another explosion in 1994 took about 60 lives.

The Southeast Asian nation -- an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and islets -- has nearly 130 active volcanoes.

It sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", a vast zone of geological instability where the collision of tectonic plates causes frequent quakes and major volcanic activity. (AFP)

180,27-3-20,Coronavirus very grave in Singapore but will do all to stabilise economy : PM Lee,"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has described the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore as very grave , saying that his government will do whatever it takes to stabilise the country's economy even if nobody can tell what lies ahead.

Speaking to reporters after the government unveiled a supplementary budget of 48.4 billion Singapore dollars in Parliament on Thursday to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, Lee assured that he will do everything possible to stabilise the city state's economy, preserve jobs and help companies stay afloat.

""Whatever it takes to do that, we will do them,"" Lee said.

""We want to see people through this; we are under no illusions that this is the end of the story because nobody can tell what lies ahead,"" he added.

The city-state has reported 683 virus infections and two deaths, but has won praise for its approach and has so far avoided going into a total lockdown.

Lee gave a sense of the fast-changing situation, pointing out that his government had thought the measures contained in the Budget presented on February 18 would buy a few months of time for it to assess the situation and put together a second package.

But we did not expect within one month, the picture was totally changed, the health picture was totally changed, the economic picture was totally changed, conceded Lee.

""This is why the Government also completely changed its policy response and set aside a further 48.4 billion Singapore dollars to support businesses, workers and families, he said.

It was a Supplementary Budget nearly seven times the initial 6.4 billion Singapore dollars worth of measures in the February Budget to cushion the COVID-19 fallout.

The combined 55 billion Singapore dollar budget to combat the coronavirus is intended to see the country until the end of the year.

Lee added that Singaporeans must be psychologically prepared for things to worsen in the coming months.

In such a scenario, the government is prepared to tap on the reserves again, he said.

Singapore is drawing from national reserves to fund the supplementary budget announced on Thursday.

Lee noted that economies around the world have been drastically hit as the flow of goods and people reach a standstill.

As an open economy, Singapore is particularly hard hit, especially in industries such as aviation, tourism and hotels, he pointed out.

It is going to last quite a long time: it is not a V-shaped down dip, it is not a U-shaped dip, the Strait Times quoted Lee as saying.

The number of COVID-19 cases across the globe has skyrocketed to 531,860 and a total of 24,057 people have died so far.

At 85,653, the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. Nearly 1300 people have died in the US due to the disease.

The compulsory no pay leave will affect around 1,200 employees in senior grades. The remaining 2,800 employees of the airline such as members of cabin crews and ground handling services will be unaffected.

""While we are doing all possible, including a recruitment freeze, we have to look at other means to further reduce our cost,"" Thng said in an email to employees, which has been accessed by PTI.

""Therefore, for the period 1st Apr to 14th Apr 2020, all staff (except for staff in Level 1A and 1B) will be required to go on a few days of Compulsory No Pay Leave (CNPL) as follows: Staff in Level 4 and 5 to go on three days CNPL, Staff in Level 2 and 3 to go on two days CNPL, Staff in Level 1C to go on one day CNPL,"" he said.

Thng said the annual salary increment exercise for all eligible staff will be deferred from April to July 1 and an appropriate decision shall be taken then.

""For staff in Level 2 and above, the annual pay-out for Variable Performance Pay (VPP) will be deferred to July 2020,"" he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25 to April 14 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

In this time period, all domestic and international commercial passenger flights remain suspended.

Thng said in his email: ""With the lockdown till April 14, 2020, we will not be able to operate any commercial flight during this period. This has a huge negative impact on our cash flow as we will not be able to generate any revenue with all our operations temporarily suspended.""

""As mentioned in my message dated March 16, 2020, in order to reduce cost and conserve cash, we have started engaging our key partners and suppliers to reduce our immediate operating expenditure and discretionary expenditures have been avoided wherever possible,'' he said.

Various other Indian airlines have already announced their cost-cutting measures as there has been a drastic fall in revenues due to the situation arising out of the the coronavirus outbreak.

IndiGo has announced that its senior employees would be taking a pay cut of up to 25 per cent. GoAir has laid off its expat pilots, introduced leave without pay for employees on a rotational basis, and announced a pay cut for all employees.

The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, and therefore, Thng told his employees that he will provide another update to them before April 14.

183,27-3-20,National Capital silenced,"The Pioneer’s Kushan Mitra drove around a desolate and deserted Delhi.

As someone who has called this city home for over the past three decades, this was unusual. Even on the days when much of the city shuts down, Republic Day or Independence Day, the city is still loud, abuzz and full of life.

On a normal Thursday afternoon in late-March with such fine weather, Connaught Place would be full of people, young couples stealing some moments, shoppers hunting for deals at Palika Bazaar, office workers out for a drink with colleagues at the countless bars and restaurants. Instead, the giant flagpole is bare, the streets deserted other than the policemen running the checkpoints and Palika Bazaar’s entrances are locked. This is not Delhi as anyone has ever known it in living memory, even those with memories of the 1965 and 1971 wars will say that while blackouts and curfews were common, this is unnatural.

The destitute and the homeless face a challenge like never before, with few people on the streets to give alms and restaurants and shops shut, they can’t even acquire the limited rations that they used to earlier. While various State Governments and the Centre have promised that people will not go hungry, when you ask the runaways in Connaught Place if they have heard anything they tell you they haven’t. Some private individuals like Arjun and Ambika Pandey are distributing food packets and other doing so with fruit, but in these times, small private contributions can never catch up to state machinery.

Outside the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) at Kashmiri gate, a place that is usually bustling with human traffic 24 hours a day, it is surreal to see the empty roads. There are some buses running, but only for essential workers as notified by the government. Migrants from Uttar and Pradesh and Bihar who are still trying to find a way home now that their daily-wage jobs have evaporated thanks to this gift from China, stand helpless around the bus station, although it must be noted that the air in this area, usually thick with diesel fumes is strangely clean. Among those left behind by India’s economic growth of the past few decades, there is confusion and helplessness, but they are beginning to understand the gravity of the situation, but they know that they are, as the saying goes, caught between a rock and a hard place.

At popular destinations for local outings such as India Gate and Red Fort, the emptiness looks like the set of an apocalyptic movie rather than sites in an Indian city. There are some private vehicles around, but those are few and far between, mostly carrying officials and mediapersons.

But we face an enemy whom we cannot see, whom we do not know how to defeat, indeed nobody in the world knows how to defeat.

Earlier in the day, the Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal announced that there were 36 patients for SAR-CoV 2, the so-called ‘Wuhan Virus’ in the capital, but he also highlighted the risks that healthcare workers face with one virus-infected patient who returned from Saudi Arabia infecting a Mohalla Clinic doctor who subsequently passed it onto his family. The dangers are ever present. Those in the know are pinning some hope on various theories, particularly the ‘temperature’ theory, but we do not know what will happen next.

""Just as miniature is more difficult to make than a large canvas, short stories are more difficult than to write a novel, I feel short films are also difficult to make than feature films, since they have to be brief.

""Among all the short films I have done in the past couple of years, I would recommend 'The Wallet', written and directed by Saumitra Singh, which is a very simple, sweet and moving story. I really enjoyed working on it even though it is helmed by a first-time director. He was very clear with what he wanted.""

The short film recently released on Jio Cinema and it features Shah with Navni Parihar in pivotal roles. The film narrates an incomplete love story of an elderly couple.

Writer-director Saumitra Singh explained why every project was important to him: ""Every project, every journey is a learning experience. Yes, it's often a roller coaster ride, but that's the fun of it. I feel grateful to have worked with great icons of our film industry like Naseeruddin Shah and Navni Parihar.""

""The Wallet"" has garnered much appreciation in the festival circuit around the globe, winning over 50 awards across festivals.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/naseeruddin-shah--short-films-difficult-to-make-than-feature-films-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/naseeruddin-shah--short-films-difficult-to-make-than-feature-films.html

187,27-3-20,Infants born to mothers with COVID-19 may catch infection: Study,"Researchers have assessed 33 infants born to mothers with COVID-19, including three who were likely born with the disease, a finding that may lead to early diagnosis and better treatment for the youngest population at risk of infection.

The scientists, including Wenhao Zhou from Fudan University in China, said it is crucial to screen pregnant women and closely monitor neonates at risk of COVID-19.

According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, the most common symptom shown by the three infants was shortness of breath.

The first patient, born at 40 weeks of gestation, experienced lethargy and fever on the second day since birth, and was moved to the neonatal intensive care unit, the study noted.

""A chest radiographic image showed pneumonia, but other laboratory tests were normal. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on days two and four of life, and negative on day six,"" the scientists wrote in the study.

They said the second patient was born after a gestation period of 40 weeks and four days by cesarean delivery because of confirmed maternal COVID-19 pneumonia.

This baby, the researchers said, exhibited lethargy, vomiting, and fever, with a chest scan showing pneumonia.

They said nose, throat, and anal swabs from the baby tested positive for the presence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on days two and four of life, and negative on day six.

According to the research, the third patient, born after a gestation of 31 weeks and 2 days was delivered via cesarean since the mother had COVID-19 pneumonia.

The scientists said this baby required resuscitation.

They confirmed neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia with chest radiographic image.

These symptoms, the study said were resolved on day 14 of life after treatment with noninvasive ventilation, caffeine, and antibiotics.

However, of the three babies with symptomatic COVID-19, the scientists suspect that the most seriously ill neonate may have been symptomatic from prematurity, asphyxia, and sepsis, rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While recent studies have said there are no clinical findings suggestive of COVID-19 in babies born to affected mothers, and all samples like amniotic fluid and breast milk, were negative for SARS-CoV-2, the researchers said ""the vertical maternal-fetal transmission cannot be ruled out in the current cohort.""

""It is crucial to screen pregnant women and implement strict infection control measures, quarantine of infected mothers, and close monitoring of neonates at risk of COVID-19,"" the scientists wrote in the study.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/infants-born-to-mothers-with-covid-19-may-catch-infection--study-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/infants-born-to-mothers-with-covid-19-may-catch-infection--study.html

203,27-3-20,IMF chief: 'Clear we have entered recession',"The coronavirus pandemic has driven the global economy into a downturn that will require massive funding to help developing nations, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said Friday.

""It is clear that we have entered a recession"" that will be worse than in 2009 following the global financial crisis, she said in an online press briefing.

With the worldwide economic ""sudden stop,"" Georgieva said the fund's estimate ""for the overall financial needs of emerging markets is $2.5 trillion."" But she warned that ""we believe this is on the lower end.""

204,27-3-20,Italy virus could peak soon but more sacrifices to come,"Italy's coronavirus epidemic could peak in the next few days, experts said Friday, but regional authorities warned the crisis was far from over, as four more frontline doctors died.

The national health institute (ISS) cautiously suggested lockdown measures to curb the spread of the disease -- which has claimed over 8,100 lives and infected some 80,000 people -- may soon bear fruit.

""I want to be clear on one point. We have not peaked yet,"" the institute's head Silvio Brusaferro said.

""There are signs of a slowdown, which makes us believe that we are close, we could peak in the next few days."" But virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco warned that would not translate into a go-ahead to ease lockdown measures.

The slight slowing in case numbers ""should strengthen our desire to continue. We must not drop our guard."" And Brusaferro said any lifting of strict measures would have to be done with extreme caution.

""We'll have to take careful measures for some months in order to avoid the epidemic curve rising again,"" he said.

Italy's lockdown came into effect nationwide on March 9, extending strict measures put in place earlier across swathes of the north, where the epidemic began.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week that the measures taken to close schools, bars and restaurants and restrict movement would have to be prolonged beyond the original end-date of April 3, without specifying until when.

The rise in daily deaths on Thursday edged down to the lowest point in the crisis -- 8.8 percent.

But regional authorities in Italy's hard-hit north warned their hospitals were still under enormous strain.

""We have reached saturation point in intensive therapy, despite having doubled bed numbers,"" said the head of the Piedmont region, Alberto Cirio.

""If this rate does not drop, we risk not being able to make it,"" he said, while appealing urgently for extra ventilators.

The number of doctors killed by the virus rose to 44 on Friday, with nearly 6,500 health workers infected, ISS said.

The latest victim was doctor Annamaria Focarete, 70. One tearful colleague told AdnKronos news agency that ""with her fighting spirit she seemed to have beaten it. Then a superinfection got her.""

Military doctors and nurses battling the disease in field hospitals were thanked by Italy's defence minister Lorenzo Guerini, who said they were making the country proud.

""The battle is still a long one, we have a lot of work to do, but together we will succeed,"" he said via Skype.

He warned, however, that ""more sacrifices will be required of you"" before the worst was over.

And fears persisted that case numbers would continue to rise in central and southern Italy despite the lockdown.

""The gloom is deepening hour by hour. Psychological support for doctors right now is not only necessary, it's indispensable,"" said surgeon Liberato Aceto from the Santissima Annunziata hospital in Chieti, east of Rome.

""Conditions are getting increasingly difficult in the areas reserved for COVID-19 patients,"" he said.

It was particularly hard not to be able to reassure those gripped by the disease and fearful for their lives.

The sanitary protective gear worn by doctors obliged to keep their distance as much as possible created ""a barrier... An emotional distance"", and prevented them from making even the most basic of gestures.

""We can longer comfort a patient by holding their hand, or reassure them with a pat on the shoulder,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/italy-virus-could-peak-soon-but-more-sacrifices-to-come-2020-03-27.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/italy-virus-could-peak-soon-but-more-sacrifices-to-come.html
