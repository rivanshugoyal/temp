0,30-1-20,Fix the fault lines in healthcare system,"Let the 2020 Union Budget and the decade ahead turn out to be in the larger interest of healthcare, making it more accessible to all, affordable and patient-friendly

The growing disease burden should compel the country’s policymakers to allocate a fair chunk of funds for public healthcare infrastructure. The recent news on infant deaths in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome and in Kota district of Rajasthan due to hypothermia are glaring examples of existing fault lines within the primary healthcare system in India. Such incidents send a grave reminder that affordable and accessible, good quality healthcare still remains the biggest challenge in the rural hinterlands of our country.

The Centre’s ambitious flagship health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) has immense potential to correct the healthcare basics in the country. It holds a lot of promise and has the right intent, but one can just hope the Government and healthcare authorities take the right partnership approach to a more inclusive participation.

In the last Union Budget, the budgetary allocation for the healthcare sector stood at Rs 60,908.22 crore, with Rs 6,400 crore earmarked for the AB-PMJAY.

The scheme aims at providing annual health cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to over 10.74 crore vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries). Rationalisation of treatment packages and speeding up the recovery process are essential elements that will encourage more private hospitals to empanel under this scheme.

Let us focus on the basics: The healthcare sector is one of the biggest contributors to the Indian economy and accounts for six per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The hospital industry in India, accounting for 80 per cent of the total healthcare market, is witnessing a huge demand from global as well as domestic investors. It is expected to reach $132 billion by 2023 from $61.8 billion in 2017; growing at a CAGR of 16-17 per cent. The country’s medical tourism market is expected to grow from its current size of $3 billion to $7-8 billion by the end of 2020.

Yet, the country’s spending on public healthcare is estimated only at 1.3 per cent of the GDP. Besides having a poor infrastructure within public health facilities, there is also a lack of adequate resources. When over two-thirds of the sector is driven by private players, the Government should be more willing to get into a partnership-based approach with them to achieve Universal Health Coverage in line with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A multi-pronged approach: We require a multi-pronged approach from the Government to strengthen and reform the health sector. On the one hand, it involves improving the state of public healthcare by increasing budgetary allocation, establishing more medical colleges and improving primary healthcare facilities. On the other hand, it involves measures to enable the private sector to spread its presence beyond the urban landscape. This will help in improving accessibility for secondary and tertiary care in tier-II and tier-III towns, besides rural areas.

For the latter to happen, the Government must offer major incentives and tax breaks to private healthcare organisations setting shop in non-urban areas.

The incentives can include income tax breaks for the first few years of operations, help in procuring land, making medical equipment Goods and Services Tax (GST)-free for such hospitals and relaxation on service tax on hospital inputs. Similarly, establishing a mechanism to offer fund support or subsidisation in treatment costs to private hospitals in smaller towns and rural areas can go a long way in bridging the prevalent accessibility gap.

The cost of medical equipment is another pain point, which requires thrust and making the medical devices and equipment a part of the ‘Made in India’ initiative shall benefit this sector.

Impetus to innovation: There is also a need to provide an impetus to innovation within the medical technology sector. For that, special funds for start-ups that manufacture medical devices would specifically address the needs of the Indian populations, serving as a big boost to the sector.

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics for patient monitoring will add to significant financial savings and will increase the reach of healthcare in the country.

The need of the hour is that the primary care system should be strengthened in such a way that it is capable of doing the initial assessment, diagnosis and basic management and appropriate referral if need be. A thorough assessment and investigation at primary care or secondary care level can lead to a significant saving of resources at the territory level. The Government should facilitate more Continuous Medical Education to help professinals upgrade their skills which can solve the problem of shortage of trained doctors.

That Government must also consider oral health as an integral part of healthcare and give it the importance it deserves. The Narendra Modi Government should provide an enabling environment for the healthcare sector to grow. This is where the forthcoming Union Budget can show some vision and leadership.

This being the first Budget of the new decade, it will not only be a marker of the Government’s assessment but also a vision for the economy over the next 10 years.

Let 2020 and the decade turn out to be in the larger interest of healthcare, making it more accessible, more affordable and patient-friendly.

1,30-1-20,Wrong person at wrong time,"Nehru made a wrong choice of making Menon Defence Minister. Though the trauma of the 1962 war remains, many things have changed. The CDS should help in neutralising threats

India’s controversial Defence Minister VK Krishna Menon was recently in the news, courtesy a well-researched book, which did not elaborate enough on the implications for the country on account of having a wrong person at the wrong place and at the wrong time. Menon was one of the strangest characters, who appeared on the political scene after independence. PK Banerjee, the Indian chargé d’affaires in Beijing in 1962, who often encountered the haughty politician, wrote in his memoir: “Krishna Menon’s appearance in the Indian political arena was as sudden as it was unexpected... he had his education and was enrolled as a Barrister. He hardly had any legal practice …[but] became a protégé of Palme Dutt, a lawyer and founder member of the British Communist Party.”

How, after independence, he was suddenly nominated as the Indian High Commissioner in the UK is still not clear. A few years later, he came back to India and was made the Defence Minister: “In addition, for all practical purposes, he functioned as Foreign Minister de facto,” noted Banerjee. Menon was certainly brilliant in some ways. He joined the Union Cabinet as a Minister without a portfolio in 1956. It was former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who appointed him as the Defence Minister in April 1957.

Sixty-three years later, India still suffers because of Nehru’s choice. One of the many blunders that he committed was to stop using the seniority system in the Army, replacing it with the so-called merit-based method of promotion; in fact, posting his favorites in positions where they should have never been. This eventually led to the resignation of the then Chief of Army Staff, General KS Thimayya.

Let’s take a look at a few examples of the wrongs committed by Defence Minster Menon at the time when the Chinese troops attacked India in the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) and in Ladakh. It was only after meeting Wing Commander Jag Mohan (Jaggi) Nath, the first of the six officers who have been twice decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), India’s second highest war-time military award, that I realised that the outcome of the 1962 war could have been completely different had India used its Air Force.

Nath received his first MVC for his role in reconnaissance missions between 1960 and 1962 over the Aksai Chin and Tibet. His missions proved immensely useful to learn everything about the Chinese military build-up on the Tibetan plateau. Unfortunately, the political leadership (first and foremost the Defence Minister) refused to believe the hard evidence gathered during of his sorties. After one of his missions over the Aksai Chin and Tibet, a message came that Nehru, Menon and their favorite General, Biji Kaul, wanted to be briefed about Nath’s reconnaissance sorties.

Along with former Air Vice Marshal DAM Nanda, the then Deputy Chief of the Air Force, Nath went to South Block to meet Menon. They were waiting outside the Minister’s room when Kaul came and he started talking non-stop: “I know, I know, these fellows [the Chinese] are there. They asked me to throw them back. I can throw them back, not a problem! But they will be back the next day. It has to be planned out properly.”

Nath was surprised that Gen Kaul would speak this way in front of a junior officer: “I was a low-level officer” but [Kaul] continued shouting: “You saw the Chinese soldiers.” I said, “Yes, sir, I saw them.” “OK, go to the Defence Minister”, he finally said.

Nanda and Nath finally landed up in Menon’s office. Nath recalled: “He did not ask anything”, he just said, “Did you see the Chinese soldiers?” I answered: “Yes sir, I saw them.” “That’s alright, you can go.” That was it. Nath concluded: “There was a total breakdown.”

In a secret report written as he was forced to resign in November 1962, the flamboyant Defence Minister wrote: “China is reported to have the third largest Air Force in the world. This may well be true.” Though Menon was aware of the fuel issue: “[China] had inadequate fuel capacity in terms of war requirements,” he ignored the findings of the brave airman, who explained: “If we had sent a few airplanes [into Ladakh or NEFA], we could have wiped the Chinese out and everything could have been different in the 1962 war. The political leadership did not believe me that China had no Air Force…” Unfortunately, the then Chief of Air Staff did not have the courage to put his foot down. This led to one of the greatest tragedies in India’s modern history. Mao had bluffed Nehru and it worked.

Another sad story about the 1962 episode was recounted by Lt Col (later Maj Gen) KK Tewari, the Commander of the Signal Regiment of the Corps based in Tezpur (Assam), responsible in the early 1960s for the Tawang sector of the NEFA. Tewari wrote: “On the 19th [October], Brig Dalvi [Commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade] talked to the General Officer Commanding [GOC] at Zimithang [near the Tibet border] on the telephone. He was pleading with the latter to let him move up to a tactically sound defensive position.” He described the existing position along the river where he had been ordered to stay by the Corps Commander [BM Kaul] before his departure for Delhi as a “death trap.” Brig Dalvi was told “not to flap but to obey orders and stay put. He was visibly upset and was very abrupt on the telephone to his boss. He passed the telephone to me.”

Tewari told the GOC that the Chinese were moving down the Thagla Ridge like ants. He could also see at least half a dozen mortars, which were not even camouflaged: “The Chinese could not be there for a picnic, their attack was imminent on a massive scale,” he added. But Dalvi and his men were told that they had been informed by the “higher authorities in Delhi” that the Chinese would not attack …at a time they had already attacked.

Today, though the trauma of the 1962 thrashing remains, many things have changed on the ground. The creation of a post of Chief of Defence Staff should go a long way in overcoming the complete lack of coordination between the three services experienced in 1962. This, however, will not absolve Nehru’s wrong choice of making Menon the Defence Minister, a post he occupied for five crucial years.

2,30-1-20,JD(U) war or peace?,"As Nitish expels Kishor and Varma, he has a tough job rescuing lost space for himself than appearing as BJP’s tool

Usually, rivals end up pushing each other’s cupboards so that the skeletons tumble out in election season. But if the rumblings in the Janata Dal (United) are anything to go by, then the family war is now a raging fire with its leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expelling its top leadership crucially close to the State Assembly elections. JD(U)’s national faces — vice-president Prashant Kishor and spokesperson Pavan Varma — have been shown the door for asking questions of Kumar about the extreme nationalist politics of his ally BJP and the extent of the party’s continued association with it. Considering that both were once considered trusted aides of Nitish, who risked dissension within his State unit to empower them and both of whom contributed to his success in the 2015 Assembly elections, one wonders if more is to be read into this than the ideological clash over the BJP’s controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Nitish, who has proved himself as a shrewd politician, is known to survive all kinds of odds. This time, however, that job is a tad too difficult because he seems compromised by circumstance, unable to snap his symbiotic link with the BJP so close to the State polls, and being forced to spell out his views on citizenship of minorities. Perhaps, Nitish was looking for a way to trim the ambitions of Kishor, who, as an electoral strategist for other parties, was becoming too big, positing himself as heir apparent and even dictating terms to the JD(U) old guard. Beyond a point, Nitish could not overlook veterans who have been working with him like Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Ramchandra Prasad Singh and Bashishtha Narayan Singh. Neither could he ignore the fact that Kishor had aligned with several other Opposition parties (Aam Aadmi Party, Trinamool and Shiv Sena) and while dictating their strategies, wasn’t always circumspect about the JD(U)’s own imperatives. In fact, Nitish was upset when Kishor publicly criticised him for walking out of the federal front or the mahagathbandhan and realigning with the BJP. The CAA criticism was only the last straw. Kishor, who was once seen as a BJP plant has, in fact, now emerged as a cohesive voice of the Opposition and could well forge an alternative front at the national level by virtue of being the architect of its constituents. And Nitish knows, like all other federal parties now, that he can be relevant by only consolidating his home ground. He also knows his strengths. Even assuming that he continues with his support to CAA and the Muslim vote consolidates around Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), his voter base is still substantial and loyal. Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs) account for 30 per cent of his votes, the Maha Dalits for 15 per cent and women, whom he won over with his landmark 2016 decision to impose prohibition in the State, are quite a sizeable number still. Some youth are with him. These easily comprise 45 per cent of voters in Bihar. Besides, there is some leftover halo of being a committed performer and administrator that can be reinvested as leadership material. It is precisely for this reason that even the BJP is ready to go with him as the chief ministerial face.

Yet, the going for the BJP and Nitish will, henceforth, be uneasy. The BJP is breathing heavy on Nitish, particularly after the JD(U)’s dismal solo performance in the Jharkhand Assembly polls. Although they have negotiated a 50:50 seat-sharing formula in principle, the BJP has the upper hand. Nitish has burnt bridges with RJD so badly and has distanced himself from federal front leaders to such an extent that he has no other option but to be with the BJP. How much he can bargain within that is questionable considering the BJP now has “first party” ambitions in Bihar and post the Lok Sabha elections last year, where it swept the State, thinks it is residually helping its junior partner improve its individual numbers. Of course, given the latest round of drubbing in the Assembly elections, the BJP, too, is banking on Nitish to deliver in Bihar, save its face and dispel the notion that it cannot work with smaller parties. The dependence on numbers has become all the more important considering the warts that dot Nitish’s performance graph over the last couple of years — Patna floods, the encephalitis deaths, the accumulation of prohibition-related cases in courts and the State’s dismal rank in the Sustainable Development Goals index. Besides, though he has supported the CAA, he has categorically refused to comply with any kind of profiling-based census. Can he rescue his and the JD(U)’s credibility or end up just being the BJP’s winning tool? For somebody who has moulded himself as a conscientious politician, both Kishor and Varma have, in their exit, left a moral albatross around his neck, one that embodies loss of values to naked ambition.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jd-u--war-or-peace--2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/jd-u--war-or-peace-.html
3,30-1-20,Civil flying,"Should Kunal Kamra have been banned from flying? If so, why should rules be different for him and TV channels?

While flying on an aircraft, one expects some peace. Away from the pressures of daily life, on domestic flights at least, we are disconnected from the 24x7 world we live in. While you may jostle for the armrest with the person sitting next to you, on the whole, you expect your fellow passenger to respect your private space, just like we respect the personal space of others. Flying, therefore, has a level of civility that has gone missing 35,000 feet below on the ground. So, did comedian Kunal Kamra cross the line when he heckled television anchor Arnab Goswami on a flight recently? Yes. While Kamra himself released the video and claimed to have apologised to the crew for his actions, no matter how he justified them, they were completely and totally unacceptable. That said, the speed with which he was banned from flying was incredibly rapid and left no scope for redressal. There is a process to ban someone from flying that includes setting up an internal committee, waiting for its report, allowing a passenger to contest in an appellate body of the Civil Aviation Ministry and a court. Airlines just cannot follow a diktat from the Civil Aviation Minister. What seems to have irritated people on social media is how the rules were applied to Kamra when they have not been used against Goswami’s own news channel. His team members have historically boarded aircraft to harry passengers. There needs to be one rule for all. The Government needs to put its foot down and ban harassment of passengers onboard. Television cameras should not be allowed on aircraft and any channel or passenger who is found to be flouting the rules ought to be banned from flying.

The other reason for this is that flying is also an inherently dangerous mode of travel with terrorists finding civil aviation a juicy target. Had Kamra pulled his stunt in the US, he would have not only been on the “no-fly” list but also possibly inside Guantanamo Bay. While he is trying his darndest to become a martyr, the fact is that he knows exactly what he was doing. He should understand that he would have to pay a price. The Government, too, needs to know that it would be lionising him with its vengeance as he cries victimhood.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/civil-flying-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/civil-flying.html
4,30-1-20,Men in women’s seats in bus to be fined,"Male bus passengers found occupying seats reserved for women will now cough up fine in the State.

In view of the frequent complaints of harassment of women travelling in buses, the State Government has decided to penalise the male passengers found sitting on seats meant for women.

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting here between Commissioner of Police Sudhanshu Sarangi, members of private bus owners’ associations and Capital Region Urban Transport (CRUT) MD Arun Bothra on Tuesday. A notification in this regard would be issued soon.

Since women and girls are found harassed mostly while standing inside buses, the meeting stressed on ensuring availability of sufficient seats to women passengers in both Government-run and private buses. Besides, a special toll-free number would also be released to help women facing harassment in moving buses.

“Women passengers can call or send message on the cell number in case they face harassment while on travel. Immediate action will be taken after that. Bus owners have been directed to ensure an effective execution of the order. They have also been instructed to ensure that bus staffs are well-behaved and do not consume liquor during duty hours,” said an official source.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/men-in-women---s-seats-in-bus-to-be-fined.html
5,30-1-20,Slashed AC Mo Bus fares to continue till Mar,"The Capital Region Urban Transport (CRUT) has decided to continue with the reduced fares of AC buses of its Mo Bus services for the next two months. Ticket prices of AC Mo Buses that were slashed up to 38% in December last would continue till March 31.

The decision was taken at a meeting held here on Wednesday in the presence of CRUT MD Arun Bothra.

“There has been an overwhelming response after the reduction of AC ticket fares and rationalisation of the overall fare structure. In November, our ridership was around 84,000 and the revenue was around Rs 11.75 lakh. The ridership in January was an average of 1 lakh and the revenue Rs 12 lakh per day,” said CRUT General Manager Dipti Mahapatro.

While the revenue had dropped by 1% in December compared to November, a consistent growth of 5% is seen till date as compared to December, Mahapatro added. She further informed that there was a 22%- boost in AC ridership in December.

“While 4.3 lakh people travelled in AC Mo Bus in November, 5.5 lakh footfalls were recorded in December. In January, the growth has been a consistent 9% in ridership. As on January 27, 4.7 lakh people have traveled in AC Buses,” she said.

Mahapatro further added, “The move is aimed at encouraging more commuters to use public transport services, which would significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the roads as well as the pollution level which will contribute in decreasing carbon footprint in the capital region.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/slashed-ac-mo-bus-fares-to-continue-till-mar.html
6,30-1-20,Ganga Yatra a confluence faith and economy: Yogi,"Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that his government was working for holistic development in the state and would focus on supplying of pure drinking water to every household through Har Ghar Nal Yojana and developing Maa Vindhyavasini Dham.

Addressing a public meeting at the Government Inter College grounds here on the third day of the Ganga Yatra, the chief minister said a ` 6,000-crore project had been prepared for development of Mirzapur.

Yogi said the Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions, which had been neglected for decades, were now witnessing rapid development.

The chief minister said the river Ganga was not only a symbol of faith but also the base of Indian economy, adding that the Ganga Yatra was a confluence of faith and economy and everyone should contribute to it.

Yogi started his address raising slogans in praise of Maa Ganga and Maa Vindhyavasini and appealed to the people to keep the river clean.

The five-day Ganga Yatra is being taken out from Bijnor and Ballia and both the legs of the yatra would converge at Kanpur on January 31.

Yogi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the Namami Gange Project to make the river Ganga clean and ever-flowing. The chief minister said that his government had taken up the work of cleaning the Ganga on a war-footing.

“Earlier, the sewage of Kanpur used to fall directly into the Ganga, badly polluting its water and making it poisonous. But now, not a single drop of sewage falls in the river,” he said, adding that once Bhagirath had brought Maa Ganga from heaven to earth and today PM Narendra Modi had become a modern Bhagirath for making all efforts to clean its water.

Highlighting the achievements of his government, Yogi said that medical colleges had been established in Mirzapur and Sonbhadra and the entire Vindhya region was marching towards overall development.

“Since decades, Bansagar project was pending and its file was gathering dust during the previous regimes but Modi has made the dreams of the region a reality,” the chief minister said.

Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the Ganga Yatra was being taken out for a great purpose and everyone should contribute to it.

“Ganga is our culture. River Ganga provides salvation to us not only in this world but hereafter also,” he said.

He said that through the Namami Gange project, Prime Minister Modi had started the work of making Ganga clean in 2014 but the then UP government did not contribute to it.

“You handed over the reins of the state to Yogi Adityanath. Now, Modi and Yogi are here among you to clean the Ganga. Definitely, their efforts will bear fruit and the Ganga will become clean,” the Union minister added.

BJP state chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the Ganga Yatra aimed to bring prosperity in the lives of the downtrodden and the underprivileged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ganga-yatra-a-confluence-faith-and-economy--yogi.html
7,30-1-20,Sugarcoat the Budget,"The Union Budget will be bold and different. It has to be, because it’s a do-or-die situation for the Government which has to course correct all that ails the economy

Expectations ride high on Finance Minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman’s second Union Budget to revive the feel-good factor, which has been missing since negative news flow continued to dominate national and international headlines. At a time when the country seeks to increase investments from FDI and the local industry, the Government needs to pull every lever that can restore business confidence and make India the preferred investment destination. The 2020 Budget will be bold, it will be different. It will be a win-all one. It has to be, because it’s a “do-or-die” situation for the Government which has to course correct all that ails the economy. Undoubtedly, these are challenging times for any FM to present a Budget, as achieving the goal of a $5 trillion economy by 2024 necessitates doubling the growth rate to 12 per cent year on year for the next five years, which currently seems a distant dream.

What is unmistakable is that never before has any Prime Minister immersed himself so deeply in the pre-Budget exercise to get a first-hand sense of ground realities from India Inc, economists and policymakers. And, never before has an FM presented virtually four mini-Budgets in quick succession after her maiden Budget last year in an attempt to recalibrate if Government interventions are producing the desired outcomes to achieve whatever it takes to set the economic wheels in motion.

Fixing the economy and employment generation is the top priority of policymakers, as the window to capitalise on our demographic dividends is a finite one. Time is running out, as the labour force in the middle and lower levels is ill-equipped for absorption into Industry 4.0, which will worsen the problem of unemployment unless we make quantum leaps on our Human Development Index.

Thus far, the economy has been propped up by Government spending, which is only an interim solution till the private industry does not participate in job creation and expansion. World over, Governments are following a similar template for revival by marginally exceeding fiscal prudence by a percentage point in order to satisfy rating agencies. Since the global economic crisis of 2008, exceeding fiscal deficit targets has become the “new normal”, as a decade of easy money has accumulated a record $250 trillion debt, which is a cumulative of sovereign, corporate and household leverage. Central bankers, from the European Central Bank to the IMF, have encouraged Government spending in the hope of reaping economic dividends, regardless of mounting debt to GDP ratios. Globally, we are living through the Age of Uncertainty, beset by more variables than constants than we ever faced in the last 50 years. This is the third slowdown India is facing since 1991, and if we look back at the commentary post the Lhman-led global collapse in 2008, sentiments were even more dismal than they are today. Though the financial sector continues to face massive NPA problems, this is not just an India-centric problem but a worldwide phenomenon. A flashback to what got us here in the first place is that nothing jeopardised the already beleaguered and broken Indian banking sector more than the collapse of IL&FS in 2018 and DHFL in 2019. This was truly India’s unacknowledged Lehman moment, as IL&FS alone accounts for defaults of about Rs 91,000 crore owed to banks, institutional investors and mutual funds. While there is enough liquidity available with banks, they are not lending to long-gestation projects in infrastructure, housing or heavy industry such as steel and cement, which has a cascading effect in delaying their completion. The solution lies in creating a separate Development Finance Institution to boost long-term lending for projects like railways, ports, power and so on, as also a faster resolution of the insolvency process that would boost credit flows.

Expectations are that the Budget would lay the road map for a consolidated action plan to jumpstart the multiple propellers of growth by incentivising both the supply and the demand side. Starting with agriculture, housing, construction, automobiles and telecom, to the unorganised sector and MSMEs, all of which await a bailout plan. MSMEs contribute 45 per cent towards manufacturing output and over 28 per cent towards the GDP, while creating employment for over 11 crore people. The Centre has done well in earmarking Rs 100 lakh crore for infrastructure by 2025, provided a Rs 25,000 crore fund to revive the realty sector and allocated Rs 75,000 crore for improving farm productivity. Yet, the agri-crisis remains unresolved, as prices of fertiliser, diesel and electricity keep rising and prices of rice, wheat and sugar continue falling due to a surplus, making crop diversification and agro-based industries a priority.

Coming to the corporate sector, recent tax cuts have made Indian corporate tax rates competitively benchmarked to international rates. But as the industry has prioritised on using the cuts to de-leverage — and already has an average of 30 per cent excess capacity — the spinoffs from lower corporate taxes will take longer to play out and they will first wait for demand to pick up before loosening purse strings. The economy relies on seven major vectors of growth for revenue that goes towards nation-building and job-creation: Direct tax collections, Government spending, private industry, domestic demand, disinvestment proceeds, exports and FDI infusion. Typically, during periods of global buoyancy, countries pursue an Export-Led Growth strategy. Conversely, during periods of recession or de-globalisation, the Domestic Demand- Led Growth strategy dominates in order to keep the local economy insulated from global shocks. It is the contraction in domestic driven demand that has this time failed to keep the economy afloat. It is estimated that 70 per cent of economic growth comes from consumption, the rest from investment. Exports have been the other laggard as any comprehensive plan cannot make up the numbers if our share in world exports languishes at 1.7 per cent amid a period of bleak global trade. Consequently, tax collections have been below target in a contracting economy, leaving the Government limited avenues to raise additional resources.

Also, the Government is very likely to again miss the FY 20 disinvestment target, as divestment beyond 0.5 per cent of the GDP cannot be absorbed by the markets. Expediting disinvestment of Air India, Bharat Petroleum, Cement Corporation and Shipping Corporation is not easy as there is not enough appetite from retail or corporate investors to hasten this process. Though India has improved on six out of 10 parameters in the Ease of Doing Business and despite opening up multiple sectors to foreign investment in 2018-19, the foreign investment to GDP ratio has also taken a hit, falling to a decade’s low of 1.1 per cent from a high of 3.6 per cent in 2014-15. Foreign investments are vital for India’s growth, and despite the PM’s powerful pitch to attract investments, there is a mismatch on the ground, when the likes of Amazon or the largest foreign investor like Vodafone are locked in adversarial positions with the courts or the Government.

Perception, as they say, is more important than reality, so intent for creating an enabling business environment must be followed through with leniency and amicable dispute resolution by courts, regulators and line-ministries. Disputes also have a domino effect on job losses and banks that lent to the businesses, sending negative signals to oversees investors.

All said and done, the worst could well be behind us, as we are nearing the phase of capitulation. So the only way from here is up, which offers FIIs very favourable risk-reward ratios to resume investments as we bottom out. Seasoned investors know that investing in totally risk-free assets yields negative returns when adjusted to inflation. So FII money will ultimately flow back into emerging markets like India, which has strong fundamentals, a stable currency, vibrant demographics and high foreign exchange reserves. We will get to $5 trillion, albeit it may take longer than 2024 to achieve the goal. Regardless of the temporary slowdown, India’s weightage will continue to increase in playing a leading role in restructuring the global economic order, once we regain momentum.

8,30-1-20,Prepare for a different world,"Any education system ‘in tune’ with the current time or worse, the past, is actually ‘out of tune’ with the future which will be radically diverse

Along with the winter season, Delhi witnesses yet another season. This is the period where you can see adults getting ready for school while their wide-eyed, innocent toddlers look on. It’s the season of nursery school admissions, when children enter the formal education system for the first time. This is a tough time for parents as shortlisting schools, visiting them, talking to coordinators, principals, filling up forms and finally, getting their child admitted to the school of choice is indeed an exciting yet bewildering experience for couples.

The first and perhaps the toughest part is to shortlist schools as it is not only about the infrastructure, brand value, owners, teachers, location and so on but also about what is best for the child. There are nursery schools which have forward integration with CBSE or ICSE school education systems, there are International Baccalaureate schools and then there are schools which follow the learning and standards set up by the Cambridge Assessment International Education. Alternative systems of learning have also come up, which follow educational philosophies like Waldorf Education or Sri Aurobindo’s Integral Education. Homeschooling, which has its own merits, is also catching up as a concept now. Then, of course, there are schools with the sole philosophy of earning money. What system one should follow and what are the parameters on which a particular system should be judged become critical questions for young parents. The world around us prods us to make our children “fit in.” The defined notion of success, with even its timeline cast in stone, makes us jittery when those notions are not fulfilled and timelines are not met. As a society, our disproportionately-high focus on making our students “fit in” the traditional moulds makes us lose out on developing leaders for our society who can stand out. Let’s face it. The future is uncertain. The world, 10 years down the line, will be radically different from what it is today in ways we cannot even imagine. Things, which are not even part of science fiction today, will become reality. After all, who could have thought that the neighbourhood restaurant would be just a click away and a smart speaker would do your bidding? The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), digitisation and new technologies are changing the employment landscape. Large-scale disruptions will lead to newer jobs, replacing the existing ones. The fear of human jobs, being replaced by algorithms is not misplaced. As Yuval Harari, in his book, 21 Challenges of the 21st Century, says, most humans in the future will not suffer from exploitation but from irrelevance. Under such circumstances, any education system “in tune” with the current time or worse, the past, is actually “out of tune” with the future.

In an age where information is available on the fingertips, there is no point in schools bombarding students with facts and figures and judging them on the basis of their ability to recall information. A person full of facts and knowledge but devoid of critical thinking skills, innovative ideas and perspective will lose relevance in the society of the future. The morrow will require people who can make sense of information, use it to gain perspectives and create more knowledge. In short, tomorrow belongs to knowledge-creators, not knowledge-aggregators. “Intelligence” has to make way for “consciousness” and “education” has to make way for “learning.” Education, as we know it, has been intertwined with the dimensions of time and space. Technological changes and the consequent shift in attitudes are effecting decoupling of education and the two dimensions. The “uberisation” of education due to the rise of on-demand education technology is bringing campus to smartphones and disrupting the traditional education system in ways one could not have fathomed until recently. The very basic assumption that the first 20 years of life spent in getting educated will guarantee a job that will sustain a person for the rest of their working life is being challenged. The ’90s kids, who burnt the midnight oil learning programming languages, suddenly found data scientists getting a major share of the pie in the job market. A person might have to learn multiple skills in their lifetime to stay relevant. The framework of life-long learning is expected to eclipse, if not replace, the existing education system. Learning how to learn will become more important than learning the skills and knowledge relevant to today’s economic landscape. However, learning skills alone, which can be easily monetised, will not suffice in a world both made and fractured by technology. Ethics, emotional intelligence, resilience and empathy are some of the skills needed now, more than any other time in human history.

There is some progress in this direction. “Klassens tid”, a time slot that Danish schools dedicate just to teaching empathy to students, is a fundamental part of the curriculum. Jack Ma said that independent thinking, teamwork and empathy will not just set students apart, they will ensure they can be valuable contributors to society in ways that make them irreplaceable. The Indian education ecosystem, too, should catch up with the metamorphosis of global education systems and create an education philosophy based on the model of “glocalisation” after understanding global trends and assessing local needs. Parents must make conscious and informed choices to prepare kids for a radically different world.

10,30-1-20,UPRERA to set up e-Courts for redressal of complaints,"Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UPRERA) announced to set up e-Courts to redress complaints of aggrieved parties through an integrated management module.

The new system will come into effect from February 2, 2020.

“The Authority has envisioned an evolutionary process of addressing complaints of aggrieved parties through an integrated complaints management module, to be known as e-Courts,” said a senior UPRERA official.

UPRERA Chairman Rajive Kumar said in Lucknow on Wednesday, “The e-Courts will ensure transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of judicial system with focus on achieving the vision of digital nation. The Authority thus seeks greater participation and support from various stakeholders in the success of the system for managing complaints in a digital fashion.”

The module is dedicated towards inviting complaints, processing them through logical rules and disposing them of in a time-bound manner digitally.

However, the UPRERA has decided to continue with the old complaint forms till 12 midnight of February 2, 2020. From the next day, complaints can be submitted only on the new forms.

The e-Courts comprise of steps starting with registration of complaints through an online form that collects required information in a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive fashion. Then the complaints are pre-processed/ scrutinised by RERA for missing information in the complaint. The complainants and respondents will have an interactive dashboard where all information related to their cases will be visible.

All information from parties will be sought online, aiming for transparency in the process and achieving a paperless approach.

Besides, the process entails adopting a robust communication engine for sending timely notifications.

Sources said that presiding officers would have an equally interactive dashboard, having all information about the complaint and necessary integration with project-related information. The last part involves partly automating the process of order generation so that no essential information is missed in the order.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/uprera-to-set-up-e-courts-for-redressal-of-complaints.html

12,30-1-20,PM has forgotten about the jobs he promised: RLD,"Criticising the Prime Minister for “forgetting to provide jobs to youths”, Rashtriya Lok Dal state chief Masood Ahmad said that Narendra Modi had conveniently forgotten the promise he had made to the youth of the country during the Lok Sabha polls in 2014.

Ahmad was reacting to the PM’s address to NCC cadets in New Delhi in which he only spoke about Citizenship (Amendment) ACT and Pakistan’s role in spreading terror in India.

“Modi was merely playing with words. He cleverly skipped the issue of growing unemployment in the country. He should have spoken on measures being taken to improve the economy which is under stress and on jobs which the youths of the country need the most at this time,” he said.

The RLD leader said that several lakh youth were laid off after the Union government demonetised high value currency notes.

“In 2014, Modi had promised two crore jobs for youths which he never provided. Now he is trying to woo the youths by speaking on issues related to Pakistan to hide the failures of his government,” he said.

Ahmad said the PM did not speak about the violence by masked persons on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus some time back.

“Modi and other Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are used to propagating issues which suit their policies the best. The youth of the country are aware of these political gimmicks and they have got fed up of such speeches,” the RLD state chief said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pm-has-forgotten-about-the-jobs-he-promised--rld.html

14,30-1-20,Unforgivable Nathuram Godse was a patriot too!,"On this day (January 30) in 1948, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse. A priest-class Brahmin, Godse blindly loved the basic principles of Hinduism. Logically therefore, he hated all kinds of superstitions including the caste hierarchy. Around that time, the RSS was vehemently fighting untouchability in India and sincerely engaged in social reforms and freedom movement activities.

After the demise of Lokamanya Tilak in 1920, Gandhiji’s influence over the Congress outfit increased multi-fold for his public awakening activities had already become phenomenally intense. The slogan of truth and nonviolence had endeared him to all Indians. But Godse had slowly become worried about Gandhi’s blind trust in the power of nonviolent resistance to the British. He considered it a moral duty to resist and overpower aggressors by use of force. He worshipped Chhatrapati Shivaji as hero for destroying the Muslim tyranny. If Shivaji had not killed an aggressive Afzal Khan, he would have lost his own life. Godse was worrying more and more as Gandhi kept condemning towering warriors like Shivaji, Rana Pratap and Guru Gobind Singh as misguided patriots. He suspected Gandhi was unwittingly exposing his own self-conceit. He began believing firmly that a paradoxical Gandhi was a violent pacifist who would cause irreparable damage to the nation. He could do pretty little to raise voice against Gandhi because he had already become a ‘Mahatma’ and the whole world was in awe of him.

Godse was very impressed with Gandhi's work in South Africa to uphold the rights and wellbeing of the Indian community there. But back home, Gandhi’s ways irked and infuriated Godse no end. Godse got enormously disillusioned mainly because Gandhi’s acts were too partial to Muslims, but his attitude to Hindus was callous.

Even when Hindi was being chosen as the national language, Gandhi, finding some Muslims opposing it, permitted a ‘hybrid' language to be the national language. He named it ‘Hindustani' which had no grammar and no original vocabulary. It was a mere dialect, a loose mixture of Hindi and Urdu words. His blind followers supported him and the hybrid language flourished for long. On record, all Bollywood movies mentioned ‘Hindustani' as the language for Hindi movies until the 1980s.

From August 1946, the private armies of the Muslim League began massacring Hindus. Viceroy Lord Wavell, though distressed at what was happening, could do precious little. The Hindu blood kept flowing between Bengal and Karachi with only some sporadic retaliation by the victim community. The Interim Government was evidently sabotaged by the constituent Muslim League members who became growingly disloyal and treasonable to the Government. But Gandhi’s infatuation for them was growing. Eventually, Lord Wavell resigned as he could not bring about a peaceful settlement; and Lord Mountbatten succeeded him. Thus, King Log was followed by King Stork. The Congress, which had boasted of unquestionable nationalism and socialism, secretly accepted ‘Pakistan’ under pressure, slyly surrendering to Jinnah's conditions. India was torn apart.

Watchful Godse screamed that Gandhi was not the father of the Indian Nation. He was actually the Father of Pakistan. Gandhi’s inner-voice, spiritual power and doctrine of nonviolence, of which so much is discussed, had all crumbled before Jinnah’s iron will. Godse knew if he opposed Gandhi vehemently, he would be totally ruined; all his honour, more valuable than life, would be lost forever. So if he killed Gandhi, the Indian political strategies would surely become practical. The suppressed armed forces would also become active and provide support too willingly. Godse knew his own future would be totally ruined, but the country would be rendered free to follow the right course for real good nation-building.

Godse admitted during the court trial that his shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin to millions of Hindus. Since there was no legal machinery by which a subtle, unseen offender could be brought to book, he fired those fatal shots.

“I bear no ill will towards anyone individually, but I do say I had no respect for the present Government owing to their policy which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time, I could clearly see that the horrible anti-Hindu policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi,” he had said these last words before being declared guilty of murder by the trial court.

The national struggle reached its climax with the Partition of the country. The decades of struggle led by Gandhi who preached Hindu-Muslim unity finally ended with the partition into India and Pakistan. This event escalated matters and angered Godse, who believed that Gandhi had failed in his duty by consenting to the partition of the country. For example, Godse felt that Gandhi fasted when Hindu refugees occupied mosques in Delhi, but he did not raise a voice when Hindus were tortured by Muslims in, what is now, Pakistan.

Godse had further said at the court, “Nehru had played a critical role in the establishment of the Islamic state of Pakistan. His job was made easier by Gandhi’s persistent policy of appeasement towards the Muslims. But I do not desire any mercy to be shown to me nor do I wish that anyone else should beg for mercy on my behalf. I have no doubt that honest writers of history will weigh my act and find the true value thereof some day in future.”

The last demand by Gandhi to please Muslims in Pakistan had driven Godse mad. Gandhi told the five-month-old Government of India to cough out the Rs 55-crore due to Pakistan as part of the Partition settlement, then withheld because of its Kashmir invasion. Godse, Narayan Apte and other supporters decided to close the deal forever. They were aghast at Gandhi’s

pro-Pakistan stand.

They feared more damage would come if Gandhi lived. Godse assassinated Gandhi on January 30, 1948. The murder trial began on May 27, 1948 and concluded on February 10, 1949. Godse was sentenced to death.

No one can conclusively say today that unforgivable Nathuram Godse was not a patriot!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/unforgivable-nathuram-godse-was-a-patriot-too-.html
15,30-1-20,Ailing NINL gets Rs 178-cr bailout fund from OMC,"Finally, the Odisha Government has come to the rescue of the ailing Kalinganagar-based steelmaker Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) by sanctioning Rs 178 crore from Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC), which is one of the promoters of the joint venture.

While the NINL direly needs capital infusion as its financial situation is going from bad to worse, the OMC has sanctioned Rs 178 crore to meet debt commitments of the steel unit towards the banks.

Even as Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is concerned for the steel maker, it is Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy, known for his industry friendliness, who went all out to extend support for the NINL, said sources.

Principal Secretary Industries Hemant Sharma has also taken up the issue with concerned authorities, said sources.

OMC Managing Director R Vineel Krishna has been sensitive towards the requirement of NINL and he presented the requirement of the NINL for which the OMC Board has sanctioned the funds to be released in phases.

NINL Managing Director SS Mohanty, who is trying hard to save the ailing steel maker from closedown, has thanked the OMC authorities and the State Government as well.

Mohanty, who is running from pillar to post to save the NINL from total shutdown, has been in constant touch with the senior officials of the State Government and Government of India.

Sources in knowledge of the development said timely intervention of Union Minister Steel, Dharmendra Pradhan, helped the NINL receive financial support from the OMC, MMTC, NMDC during the period of crisis.

Pradhan is proactively pursuing the matter with both Central and State Government PSUs for favoring the NINL.

Meanwhile, the NINL has received Rs 60 crore from the NMDC and soon it is expected that the Central PSU will provide another Rs 20 crore, said sources.

As against a request for Rs 250 crore, the Odisha Government has released through OMC Rs 178 crore, said sources adding that the NINL is expecting more support from the principal promoter.

Now, over 10,000 people are depending on the NINL, both directly and indirectly, and after expansion the number will go up to more than one lakh, said sources.

With full fledged running condition, the NINL will fetch more price through strategic disinvestment and it will attract huge investment and expand its capacity, sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ailing-ninl-gets-rs-178-cr-bailout-fund-from-omc.html

17,30-1-20,Priyanka takes a dig at CM Yogi,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took a dig at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over deploying PWD engineers to restrict stray cattle from his programme during Ganga Yatra in Mirzapur.

“In the entire Uttar Pradesh, farmers are facing a lot of problems due to stray cattle menace but for the chief minister’s programme in Mirzapur, the government deployed engineers armed with ropes to check entry of cattle which could hinder Yogi’s fleet or during his programme,” tweeted Priyanka.

The Congress leader asked the Bharatiya Janata Party government in UP to take up responsibility of providing safety to farmers’ crops from stray cattle.

Interestingly, Priyanka also uploaded a video along with her tweet in which farmers are seen singing folk songs to highlight how stray cattle are destroying their cops after entering their fields.

A few days back, Public Works Department Executive Engineer in Mirzapur, Kanhaiya Jha, had issued an order asking nine junior engineers to be present from Reserve Police Lines to the CM’s programme venue in Birohi with ropes to prevent entry of stray cattle on the route that the CM was to take to go to the venue. The junior engineers were also asked to keep the cattle tied in case any one was found roaming near the venue.

Diploma Engineers’ Sangh had reacted strongly to the order and its chief Vijay Singh, while condemning the order, claimed that JEs were not trained to catch stray cattle so who would take responsibility in case any one of them got injured. He suggested that such duties be assigned to specialised cell of nagar palikas and nagar nigams concerned.

After the objection of Diploma Engineers’ Sangh, District Magistrate of Mirzapur took cognisance while the executive engineer who issued the order tried to come out clean, saying the order was issued by default and it had been withdrawn.

Sources confirmed that even the CM’s office took a serious note of the order and asked the Mirzapur administration to send a detailed report on how and on whose direction the order was issued and later withdrawn.

Action is likely to be initiated against the PWD officials responsible for issuing the order.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-takes-a-dig-at-cm-yogi.html

21,30-1-20,State Govt mulls to adopt new-age technologies,"The State Government is mulling to introduce new-age technologies in public service delivery so that citizens will reap benefits.

Most likely by May, it will take a complete shape as many areas of public service delivery are being looked into, said sources.

With the 5T charter being implemented in the State, new-age technology adoption is getting increasing priority.

At least four areas will be identified as ‘priority areas’ and stipulated timeline will be set up for implementation, say senior officials.

Solution to new age governance can be achieved through use of artificial intelligence, block chain, internet of things and data analytics.

Take the example of artificial intelligence. It is the ability of machine to perform cognitive task such as perceiving, thinking, decision making, learning and problem solving.

In the meantime, the NITI Aayog has decided to focus on five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs.

Those are healthcare, for increased access and affordability of quality, agriculture, in order to enhance farmers’ income, increase farm productivity and reduction of wastage, education, for improved access and quality and in Smart Cities and infrastructure, for efficient connectivity for the burgeoning urban population, as well as for smart mobility and transportation. AI can be utilized in resource shortage areas, where automated support to complete tasks more quickly can be done.

Similarly, internet of things (IoT) in governance will be very useful for city planning and monitoring and sectors like traffic control, smart parking and smart water supply.

In the agriculture sector, the IoT helps in smart irrigation and other issues also. Drones are helpful for disaster monitoring, mining and forest cover monitoring. The IoT in tourism will enhance personalized experience.

Similarly, data analytics in governance will be helpful in real time monitoring and evaluation. Trends can be analysed across time and geography which will help in finding root cause and degree of impact. Data analytics will be helpful in predicting analysis and framing policy for future, says an officer.

Experts say there are challenges in the system to adopt technology and most important is resistance from the workforce. Similarly, there is missing end to end solution in implementation and technological intervention is seen as an end in itself than means.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-govt-mulls-to-adopt-new-age-technologies.html

28,30-1-20,We're committed to mines stability: MCL,"The Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) has attached top priority to work of sand stowing in Talcher mines, where repeated subsidence incidents are occurring putting a question mark on safety of the mines as well of Talcher.

The MCL has placed work order on Central Institute for Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR), Dhanbad, to carry out scientific study for assessing the present status of long term stability of all underground workings of Talcher coalfields. However, the coal major has sought the cooperation of the locals in this regard, particularly in removing approach congestions for sand transportation to the pre-independence underground network.

In Talcher, the oldest coalfields of Odisha, the underground mining operations started in 1928 at Handidhua Colliery, Deulbera Colliery and Talcher Colliery, which became inactive in year 1998, 2006 and 2018, respectively.

Since most of the development of these mines were done without scientific approach for about five decades before nationalisation of coal sector in 1976, identifying underground network of these mines has always been a tough task for the MCL, admitted the company in a release.

It said, ""The MCL has always been affirmative to undertake stablisation work but practical constraints of inaccessible vulnerable areas developed during pre-nationalisation era and the resistance posed by the local dwellers over the workings has always been a challenge. It is, however, painful whenever we are blamed for non-execution of stabilisation work for the reasons beyond the control of present management.""

The MCL has already initiated a process for regional planning of Talcher coalfields with IIT Kharagpur providing consultancy service.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/we-re-committed-to-mines-stability--mcl.html

31,30-1-20,Capt to meet PM against review of MSP policy,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday held a luncheon meeting with the Congress party’s Members of Parliament (MPs), including his bête noire Partap Singh Bajwa, to discuss a variety of issues concerning the State.

During the meeting convened by the Chief Minister to discuss Budget proposals for the next fiscal and various issues pending with the Centre, the issue of high-end precision detection equipment required to check the use of drones by Pakistan to smuggle long-range weapons across the border was discussed.

Besides, it was decided that the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder would meet the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press the Centre against any review of MSP (minimum support price) policy.

Perceiving the Agriculture Price Commission’s latest recommendation to the Centre to review the MSP policy as a serious threat to Punjab’s farmers, the state Congress MPs urged the Chief Minister to approach the Prime Minister and urge him not to consider any such review.

The Members of both Houses of Parliament decided that the Chief Minister should press upon the Prime Minister the dangers of accepting the Agriculture Price Commission’s recommendation. Any change in MSP procurement policy will adversely impact Punjab’s economy, they felt, expressing the fear that the Centre would limit procurement as the the first step towards putting an end to MSP purchase.

Briefing the MPs on the status of the SYL case, the Chief Minister asked the MPs to push for amendment to Proviso of Section 12 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill 2019, to protect Punjab’s water resources.

It was decided at the meeting that officials would be deputed by the State in Punjab Bhawan at Delhi to coordinate with, and brief, the MPs on issues concerning Punjab. This was essential to ensure more effective interventions in matters relating the state, said a spokesperson after the meeting.

During the discussion on MSP and procurement, the meeting referred to a note by the Punjab Ministry of Distribution relating to Evacuation of Central Pool Food Grains from the Food and Public Consumer Affairs to underline the problems currently faced by the State in terms of tardy and slow procurement of wheat and rice by central agencies.

The Department has already sought the Centre’s intervention for immediate evacuation of Central Pool Food Grains from the state, and the matter has also been taken up this matter with the Prime Minister's office.

It was decided that the MPs would press the Centre for immediate evacuation of the Central pool Food Grains from the state, in view of the threat to the quality of stored wheat due to heavy rains and floods in parts of Punjab.

It was decided that the State will also continue to pursue, through the MPs, the matter of promotion of maize as an alternative crop to paddy.

Among other key issues of Punjab’s interest pending with the Centre, that came up for discussion during the meeting, were state’s demand for compensation of Rs 100 per quintal to farmers for zero burning of paddy residue, reduction of tax rate for dairy cooperatives, and exemption of dairy products from free trade negotiations.

On the issue of stubble burning, Jasbir Singh Gill (Dimpa) said that subsidy for paddy machines was not reaching the farmers. Officials present at the meeting clarified that though subsidy was coming from the Centre, there were complaints that the same was not reaching the farmers.

The meeting also decided to pursue with the Centre, and in the Parliament, Punjab’s pending demand for exemption to Textile Sector in the Border and Aspirational Districts under Section 80(1)(b) of Income Tax Act,1961.

The meeting expressed concern over the pending issue of Settlement of Food Cash Credit Account of Punjab, to the tune of Rs 31,000 crore, and it was decided that the MPs would aggressively pursue the matter with the Central Government.

The Chief Minister pointed out that the cash-crunched state was suffering immensely due to the delay in settlement of this amount.

The MPs were also asked by the Chief Minister to press for declaration of Eco-Sensitive Zone around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary Chandigarh for the areas falling in Punjab Territory.

The issues of establishment of PGI Satellite Centre at Ferozepur, Punjab, and establishment of a second AIIMS in Punjab were also discussed in detail.

A total of 34 issues were listed for discussion at the meeting as part of the agenda that the MPs have been directed to take up in serious earnest with the Centre.

Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar said that all the MPs should take up in the Parliament the issue of the delayed SGPC elections, to break the stranglehold of the Akalis on the religious body. The tenure of the current SGPC had ended in 2016.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-to-meet-pm-against-review-of-msp-policy.html

33,30-1-20,Environmental impact assesment for parking in HC,"With experts flagging serious concerns over the proposed multilevel basement parking in the vicinity of Punjab and Haryana High Court here, the Chandigarh Administration has now got down to brass tacks and preparing to get an environmental impact assessment study done for the project.

The Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) had in November last year gave approval to the expansion plan of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which included construction of three level basement parking opposite the existing multi-level parking on the premises in Sector 1 here.

The proposed multilevel underground parking site falls in the buffer zone of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Capitol Complex and many experts have warned that the new construction in the Complex may put its heritage status in jeopardy. Not only this, the proposed site also falls within the eco-sensitive zone around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary that was notified in 2017.

As per the proposal, the multi-level parking shall have three levels of basement to accommodate around 5000 vehicles.

The tentative size of the huge proposed basement parking is 434 ft x 810 ft.

The approximate covered area of one floor is 3,72,400 sft and for three floors is 11,17,220 sft.

While the CHCC has approved the parking project, the Chandigarh Administration would have to follow a cumbersome process including apprizing and taking consent from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to undertake the construction work in Sector 1, and taking environmental clearance and eco-sensitive zone clearance from Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) for its execution.

The Administration has decided to get conducted an environmental impact assessment study of the proposed parking project which will include aspects namely ambient air quality, vehicular traffic density, flora and fauna, water quality, socio-economic survey among other factors.“We will hire a consultant for preparation of environment impact assessment study for the multi-level parking project in the vicinity of Punjab and Haryana High Court. The study will be done for obtaining environmental clearance and eco-sensitive clearance from MoEFCC,” said a senior officer of UT Administration.

He said that the proposed construction site falls in eco-sensitive zone around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary area and the Administration need the approval of concerned Ministry before any construction in the area.

The Centre had in 2017 declared eco sensitive zone around the sanctuary in the area that falls within the boundary of union territory of Chandigarh. The width of this ESZ in Chandigarh ranges from 2 - 2.75 kms.

Also, the Capitol Complex in Sector 1 here was declared UNESCO World Heritage site in the year 2016. The Complex is an administrative hub of two states namely Punjab and Haryana and has iconic heritage buildings of Punjab and Haryana High Court, Haryana and Punjab Secretariat and Assembly, open hand monument among others.

Apart from city based senior architects, the officers in the UT Urban Planning Department have also raised concerns over the proposed project.Calling on the Administration to rethink over the project, former UT chief architect Sumit Kaur had recently said that the proposal of accommodating around 5000 vehicles near Rock Garden and in the vicinity of HC would definitely put more pressure in the area.

Although multi-level parking in the buffer zone was proposed for the High Court and Secretariat building earlier also, the Administration does not need to go for three-level underground parking now, she had said.Notably, in the dossier submitted before UNESCO in 2016 for the nomination of the World Heritage status of the Capitol Complex, the Administration had made it clear that increasing pressure on parking lots at the High Court and Secretariat buildings would be addressed without compromising on the layout of the site.

In the yearly report to be submitted to the UNESCO as per the operational guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention, the state parties (concerned authorities/states) have to describe any potential major restorations, alterations and/or new construction(s) intended within the property, the buffer zone(s) and/or corridors or other areas, where such developments may affect the outstanding universal value of the property, including authenticity and integrity.

Accordingly, the UT Administration will have to apprize the organization about any new construction at the heritage site and its buffer zone.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/environmental-impact-assesment-for-parking-in-hc.html

41,30-1-20,Health officials aim to reach 8 lakh children in Bokaro,"All the children in the age group of 1 to 19 years will be administered deworming medicines, under the National Deworming campaign on 10 February aiming to improve health and nutrition-level of children across the district. Health workers will provide medicines free of cost to all children in all schools and Anganwadi centers. This will also include children of juvenile homes and rehabilitation centers, informed Mukesh Kumar Deputy Commissioner Bokaro.

Under the campaign, there is a target to provide deworming medicine- Albendazole tablets (400 mg) to nearly eight lakhs children. Those children who will miss out the dose during on 10 February for any reason will get it on a mop-up round on 17 February, he said.

The Deputy Commissioner said that albendazole tablets should be chewed and eaten. It could also be taken with water in powder form, said DC.

Health dept officials informed that worm infection adversely affects children's health in many ways. Worms consume nutrients from tissues of the human body, which leads to the deficiency of nutrients in children, hampering their mental and physical growth.

Albendazole is a safe deworming medicine for both children and adults. This medicine makes the worm unconscious and their grip is loosened from the intestines and they come out of the body with feces when it would be taken in powder form along with water or chewed dry, said the official.

Children with excessive infection may experience symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration, stomach pain and fatigue, after consumption of the medicine. Such situations can be easily managed by school teachers or Aanganwadi workers, said the official.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/health-officials-aim-to-reach-8-lakh-children-in-bokaro.html
42,30-1-20,BJP MLA raises privilege issue,"Panki MLA Kushwaha Shashi Bhushan Mehta has raised questions on the mode of unfurling of tricolor this Republic Day celebrated on Sunday.

In his letter to SP Palamu Ajay Linda the first time MLA has written that in charge of Padma police outpost did not unfurl the national flag himself but called in the former MLA Panki Devendra Kr Singh, which is a privilege motion.

In the same vein Mehta has shot off a letter to DC Palamu Shantanu Kr Agrahari wherein he has written that former MLA Devendra Kr Singh was made to unfurl the national flag at Kisan Bhavan, Padma, SBI branch Padma, Janta High School Padma, Community Hall Padma, Primary school Tetaryadeeh , Panchayat Bhavans at Padma and at Bansee.

Mehta said, “I am too happy that Republic Day was celebrated with great fervour in my constituency, but from where comes that Government institutions like school, panchayat bhavans, kisan bhavan, community hall, police outpost etc got their unfurling ceremony by the former MLA.”

The MLA said the best thing would have been if the head or in-charge of these Government institutions had unfurled the national flag but to call in someone having a political badge shows the ulterior motive of the incharge of the government institutions.

He further said how incharge of a police outpost can get the national flag hoisted when he was himself there.

Mehta said were all these done to dance to the tune of the former MLA?

“No official should be any ignorant about the protocol and decency to be shown to the elected representative of the people and here these government institutions have flouted the basic norm of protocol,” Mehta said.

He said, “I have lodged a written complaint to the Speaker of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha in this connection. I understand DC and SP Palamu will take immediate cognizance of my complaint and apprise me of their findings and actions taken in this regard.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-mla-raises-privilege-issue.html

52,30-1-20,"Corruption is rampant in Haryana, says MLA","After Ram Kumar Gautam, Jannayak Janata Party MLA from Narnaund, the outburst from Tohana MLA Devender Babli, a close aide of senior JJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, is the latest in a series of rebellious acts being witnessed in the JJP, the coalition partner in the Haryana Government.

Babli who had defeated BJP candidate and State party chief Subhash Barala with a margin of over 50 thousand votes, from Tohana in the 2019 Assembly election, alleged that there was corruption in various departments including Police department in his constituency. He said Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar is an honest person but some leaders are misleading him on corruption issue.

Without naming Barala, he targeted the BJP state President saying some BJP leaders do not respect the mandate of the people and create hurdles for elected representative like me to perform my constitutional duties for the welfare of the people. He claimed that JJP MLAs are given step-brotherly treatment in BJP-JJP coalition government.

He alleged that people are being charged lakhs of rupees for their genuine work by some department officials.

Calling the ruling dispensation in the State as the most corrupt he said, nobody is bothered about people. Officials do not listen to me and people of my constituency. I am a social worker not a hard core politician. I join politics for betterment of the society. I am ashamed of being treated by this coalition government to the elected representative. The situation is not good at all.

In an interview with The Pioneer, Babli reveals his political journey and priorities as MLA of his Constituency. Excerpts from the interview:

Three months have passed of this coalition Government. What is your assessment?

The way this coalition government should run, is not happening. The departments are functioning very slowly and people’s concerns are not being redressed swiftly.

What have you done for your constituency in three months?

Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala recently visited my constituency and made several announcements. As per announcement, Rs 15 lakh will be given for small villages while Rs 30 lakh to the big villages for its development. We are working on those projects in which the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had earlier announced for my constituency.

What had you promised for your constituency during election campaign? What is the status of its delivery?

Besides my party’s manifesto, I had declared my own manifesto before the election. I had promised the constituency people of clean administration and corruption free governance apart from improving infrastructure and redressal of public grievances. I also had promised to the people a crime free society. But after three months of this government, crime is the highest in my constituency. There is huge corruption in my constituency. Under the prevailing situation, I am unable to provide clean administration and corruption free governance. I am a social worker. I had opted politics for social cause and bringing change in society.

Many JJP MLAs including Ram Kumar Gautam and You are not happy with BJP-JJP coalition government. This coalition government is also supported by independent candidates. Independent MLA Kundu had threatened to withdraw support if CM fails to order a probe into allegations of corruption against former cooperatives minister Manish Grover within a month. Do you think this coalition government will complete its five year tenure?

As of now, I can say that there is no threat to this coalition government and it will complete its five year tenure.

Have you met and complained about your grievance to Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala?

Yes, I have raised this issue before him several times. He says that transfer of officials is being done. Things will get settled with the appointment of new officers.

Would you like to register your verbal or written complaints before the Chief Minister?

Yes, very soon I will meet the chief minister on this issue.

What kind of of problems did you face with local BJP leaders?

They do not allow me to work. Leaders who have lost the election should follow the mandate of the people. He (Barala) is visiting my constituency with police force. Constitution does not allow it. Who had allowed him to reach my constituency with policemen in tow?

A BJP leader had recently said that you have become arrogant after winning the election?

I had also given statement to counter that. People have voted me and sent me for the assembly for the redressal of their concerns.

As you said there is corruption in police department in your constituency. Would you like to meet the State Home Minister Anil Vij?

Yes. There is a gunda raj in police department. There is huge corruption in police stations and police posts of my constituency. Liquor is being served at the police post and police stations. Other illegal activities and mismanagement can be witnessed in the police department. How will people feel safe under such circumstances? Will women feel safe? I have raised the issue of traders, increasing crime, drug peddling before the officials concerned. Officials say you do not have to worry. I am a representative of the people and if I do not worry then who will address people’s concerns. I will soon meet the Home Minister on the issue.

According to you, in which departments, corruption is rampant?

There is massive corruption in Police, Block Development offices, power departments, civic bodies among other departments.

Is CM accessible for legislators? Do you get time to meet CM?

Yes, I do not have any problem to meet Chief Minister. Legislators meet him on Tuesday. I too have met him several times in the past.

What will you do if your concerns are not addressed?

People will come out on roads if their concerns are not addressed. Being a representative of the people, I too will stand by them for their concerns.

Your opponent in the Constituency Subhash Barala is the state BJP chief and people of the constituency might have been consulting him for the redressal of their concerns. Do you think there should be meeting among leaders of BJP and JJP to resolve their differences?

I am a social person not a hard core politician. I lay emphasis on development of the people. People have not elected him in the Assembly election.

He should understand the mandate of the people of the constituency. I told officials to cooperate with me and address the concerns of the people. But some of them are ignoring me and are involved in corrupt practices which I will not allow at any cost.

Do you think senior leaders of JJP should consult party workers and leaders before having an alliance with BJP in the formation of the government?

People have voted me and I became an MLA. Being an MLA I have given authority to JJP leader Dushyant Chautala to take decision regarding government formation keeping in view people’s interest. He decided to support BJP in formation of the Government. There is no problem on that. If coalition government does not function well then people will teach them a lesson in the next election.

Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar claims of running corruption free governance in the State. But you are pointing at corruption in your constituency. An independent MLA Kundu also raised the issue of corruption during previous five years of BJP government in his constituency. You comment

CM Khattar is an honest person. But some persons are misleading him. In my constituency, there is rampant corruption. People have to pay money for their genuine work. (During interview, a person told him over phone that a police officer had taken Rs two lakh for withdrawing case filed against him). You have also heard this. You can understand how corruption is rampant in my constituency.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corruption-is-rampant-in-haryana--says-mla.html

Leading the march, NSUI Punjab unit president Akshay Sharma trained his guns on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trying to tear India’s secular fabric by forcing religiously discriminatory CAA, NRC and NPR.

“Constitution is sacrosanct and people of India have outrightly rejected Modi's nefarious designs to polarize communities across religious lines,” said Akshay adding that any attempt to alter the spirit of its preamble would be repulsed strongly evident in widespread protests across the nation.

Akshay, in the presence of NSUI national president Neeraj Kundan, said that terror unleashed on peacefully protesting students across universities have sounded death knell for Modi-Shah regime. “People have seen through the nefarious policies of Modi and will throw this BJP out of power,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nsui-holds-massive----constitution-bachao-march-.html

State BJP Spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that at some places in Jharkhand, some anti-social elements tried to disturb the atmosphere. “At some places, traffic was disrupted by anti-social elements and at some places there were vandalism. The administration remained silent throughout the time. It seemed as if these miscreants were enjoying the Government protection,” he added.

Mocking at Government officials, Shahdeo said that the officials had more information about the Bandh than the public.

With the end of this Bandh, the people of Jharkhand have given a clear indication that they are with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP on the CAA issue, he added.

Shahdeo said that the Government has not announced yet an impartial inquiry into the death of Neeraj Prajapati, the deceased in the Lohardaga incident. No top official has met the family members of the deceased, he added.

“The death of Tabrez Ansari caused panic all over the country, while no leader of the ruling coalition came to pay tribute after the death of Neeraj Prajapati. This shows the double vision of the ruling coalition towards majority society,” said Shahdeo.

Reacting sharply on Bharat Bandh call by the CAA opponents, BJP State president Laxman Gilua said that it is an insult to India’s Parliamentary system. “Such people are playing at the behest of the Congress party. It is known to everyone that this law is not a law to take citizenship but to give citizenship,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-terms-bharat-bandh-a-flop-show-in-state.html

The debris from the landslide witnessed in the middle portion of the mountain reached considerably down below though it stopped before reaching the road. According to the locals, the debris were stuck in trees which stalled the debris from falling down further.

However, the locals were feeling concerned due to stone falling down intermittently from this portion of the mountain. The local ward member Daya Suyal has demanded that the local administration take immediate cognisance of this very sensitive situation. It is pertinent to mention here that the Naina peak used to pose some threat to Nainital town till about 1990 due to landslides. After that, the Forest Department and Public Works Department constructed safety walls on the mountain.

Large scale tree plantation had also been carried out along with elaborate fencing work. These measures had helped in considerably controlling the landslide problem on this mountain.

However, the landslide witnessed amidst rain and snowfall on Wednesday has once again caused concern among the local residents. During the past 10-15 years a considerable number of buildings have been constructed in this area. Builders have also constructed flats and sold the same in the area from the polytechnic college to the Sainik School.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/landslide-on-naina-peak-raises-concern.html

The samples of suspected patients are being sent to this centre from all over the country.

Playing down the fact, the health department authorities are claiming that samples of only those patients are sent to Pune which are kept in isolation on suspicion for the disease.

They point out that number of such people in the country is very less.

60,30-1-20,Badrinath to reopen for pilgrims on April 30 this year,"The portals of Badrinath shrine will be reopened to the public on April 30 at 4:30 AM. The date of reopening of the shrine was arrived at ceremoniously in the palace of the erstwhile royal family of Tehri in Narendranagar on the occasion of Vasant Panchami on Wednesday.

The priests checked the horoscope of the erstwhile king of Tehri, Manujendra Shah to arrive at the date of reopening of the Badrinath shrine.

The chairman of Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee Mohan Prasad Thapliyal, Badrinath Rawal (chief priest) Ishwari Prasad Namboodri, BKTC chief executive officer BD Singh and a number of devotees were also present on the occasion. Astrologically speaking, the Adhik Maas being observed this year is one of the reasons why the Badrinath shrine is being reopened earlier this year than in the past. According to the traditional Hindu calendar–Panchang, there will be 13 months in this year- a feature referred to as Adhik Maas.

While the Hindu calendar uses the lunar cycle as its basis, the Gregorian calendar uses the solar cycle as its basis. While the year based on the lunar cycle comprises 354 days, the one based on the solar cycle comprises 365 days which amounts to a difference of 11 days in both the systems. To resolve this gap, there is an Adhik Maas every third year. The Adhik Maas will start from September 18 and last till October 16.

Due to this, various festivals falling from January to August will be observed about 10 days earlier while those falling between September and December will be observed 10 to 20 days late.

Due to this reason, Akshay Tritiya will fall on April 26 this year. The portals of the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines are reopened to the public on this occasion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/badrinath-to-reopen-for-pilgrims-on-april-30-this-year.html

62,30-1-20,BJP’s delegation meets Nadda on Chaibasa massacre,"The six member BJP fact finding team comprising Lok Sabha MPs from across the Country, which was stopped from visiting Burugulikera village in Gudri block of Chaibasa, where seven tribals were killed by pro Pathalgadi supporters, has submitted its report to BJP national president JP Nadda. The team in their report has highlighted about the incident and the “worsening law and order situation” in area after the incident.

The 10 page report comprises “Government’s failure to check law and order situation in the area” leading to killing of seven tribals by pro Pathalgadi supporters. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP, Samir Oraon and part of the delegation said, “The fact finding team though were stopped by district administration from reaching the incident site, but our local leaders including former MLA Guru Charan Nayak, who were camping in the area had found that government was protecting Pro Pathalgadi supporters.”

He also said that with government support to Pathalgadi movement gained momentum as Chief Minister Hemant Soren after visiting the incident site had said that those who were killed and those behind the incident are both our people. Chief Minister Hemant Soren after assuming office in his first Cabinet announced to withdraw cases against people for taking part in Pathalgadi Movement in Khunti in 2018.

The Pathalgadi movement hit the national headlines in 2018, after many tribal villages in Khunti and Simdega areas putting up giant plaques declaring their gram sabha as the only sovereign authority and banning outsiders from their areas. The pathalgadi supporters allegedly abducted and gangraped five NGO workers in June 2018. After the incident, then Raghubar Das Government had decided to tackle the situation with iron hand against Pathalgadi and their leader Yosuf Purty. The BJP MP claimed that the delegation will also meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah submitting the report.

The committee comprises Gujarat MP Jaswant Singh Bhabhor, Jharkhand MP Sameer Oraon, Maharashtra MP Bharti Pawar, Chhattisgarh MP Gomti Sai, West Bengal MP John Barla, former Jharkhand Minister Neelkanth Singh Munda.

The BJP delegation which sat on dharna comprises former Chief Minister Raghubar Das, former Assembly speaker Dinesh Oraon among others.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp---s-delegation-meets-nadda-on-chaibasa-massacre.html
63,30-1-20,Chaibasa killings not related to Pathalgadi: Cong,"The gruesome killings of seven villagers in West Singhbhum district on January 17 were ‘not even remotely’ related to the Pathalgadi movement, an independent fact-finding team of the Congress party has found during its visit to the Burugurikela village.

A six-member team, headed by Congress MP Geeta Koda, visited the tribal-dominated village on Monday and also spoke at length with the families of the diseased about the incident.

“Our team found that the killings were not even remotely related to the Pathalgadi movement.

I cannot disclose more details about our findings since we have not submitted the report to the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) yet,” said former Human Resource Development Minister Geetashree Oraon, who was a part of the fact-finding team.

Soon after the killings, media reports highlighted that the seven deceased men had allegedly had a tiff with some Pathalgadi supporters a day before they were killed.

They were reportedly abducted for protesting the Pathalgadi supporters’ demand of surrendering their Government identity and welfare cards. The next day, police found their bodies with their throat slit from jungles near the village.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been questioning the Government’s decision of withdrawing sedition charges leveled against Pathalgadi supporters in 2017, claiming that the leniency towards Pathalgadi supporters was encouraging such crimes in Jharkhand hinterland.

A BJP team of six MPs, including some from Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, were not allowed to enter the Burugurigela village recently – a development that further intensified the BJP’s attacks on the Government for allegedly saving the Pathalgadi supporters.

Some reports also said that the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI) – a Left Wing Extremist (LWE) group active in Jharkhand – might be behind the killings. However, the Congress party’s fact-finding team also rubbished the reports of PLFI’s involvement in the incident. “There is no role of PLFI in the incident,” Oraon said.

While the police have said that personal rivalry could be a reason for the coldblooded murders, they are yet to release an official statement on the reason behind the killings. Oraon on Wednesday hinted that personal rivalry could be a trigger for the attacks. However, she refused to disclose details about the team’s findings. “We will submit the report within a couple of days and let everyone know about our findings,” she said.

The six-member team was constituted by Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) president Rameshwar Oraon on January 24. The Congress party is a part of the ruling coalition Government in Jharkhand. It has 16 legislators in the 81-member Assembly and four ministers in the Cabinet.

The Pathalgadi movement in Jharkhand, which has its epicenter in Khunti, advocates the idea of having liberated lands in the interiors where the administration’s interventions were prohibited.

In 2017, villagers in parts of Khunti district held Pathalgadi –a practice of demarcating the borders of a village and declaring it as liberated land through writings on stone plaques – and allegedly prohibited entry of the administration in their villages.

Soon after coming to power in the end of 2019, Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that sedition charges against Pathalgadi supporters will be scrapped.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/chaibasa-killings-not-related-to-pathalgadi--cong.html
64,30-1-20,JVM merger with BJP after Delhi polls,"The plot of former Chief Minister Babulal Marandi’s party Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) merger with BJP is final and it will be executed soon. Sources said that after the end of Delhi Assembly election senior leaders from both the parties will announce the merger.

Sources said that to make the merger of JVM with BJP a grand affair, senior leaders from both the parties have decided to hold a mega function most probably at Prabhat Tara ground and will be attended by senior BJP leaders including OP Mathur, former chief minister Raghubar Das apart from Marandi himself.

Giving pace to merger talks of two parties, JVM chief Babulal Marandi on Tuesday left for Delhi from Ranchi via Kolkatta. Sources said that in Delhi he will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “The entire plot of merger of two parties is being looked by OP Mathur. The entire plot is executed in such a way that there is no technical problem in merger of two parties.”

Sources said that as it is win-win situation for both the parties, Marandi first tried to convince its two MLAs Bandhu Tirkey and Pradeep Yadav to join BJP, but when his legislators refused to join BJP, two parties decided to go ahead with their plans leaving Tirkey and Yadav.

Tirkey was expelled from party for anti-party activities as he was alleged to support Congress candidate Ajay Nath Shahdeo contesting from Hatia in Assembly election. Later, another MLA Pradeep Yadav who was made the JVM party leader in House was removed from post; however, both the leaders have challenged their expulsion.

Sources said that Marandi is taking time for merger of his party with JVM as he did not want technical glitches in the merger. Sources said that Marandi is very much interested to join BJP after he came to know that two of these MLAs (Yadav and Tirkey) were planning to join Congress. Both Yadav and Tirkey have openly opposed the merger of JVM with BJP.

Sources said that it will be win-win situation for both BJP and Marandi, as after the Assembly election debacle, BJP has been looking for a tribal face in Jharkhand with an appeal in Santhal region. Sources said that for Marandi too it will be rehabilitation for him as despite all efforts his party managed to win only three seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/jvm-merger-with-bjp-after-delhi-polls.html

The PCC president is expected to explain his view point and ways to stop the menace of dissent in the party to the top leadership of the party.

Talking to the media persons at state headquarters of the Congress party here on Wednesday, Pritam Singh said that he has sought time for meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the issue raised by Dharchula MLA, Harish Dhami.

He said that he would also meet Congress general secretary, K C Venugopal in Delhi. In the meeting with Venugopal, the PCC president would raise the issue of changing the position assigned to the Dharchula MLA, Dhami.

The Congress MLA became angry when he found his name on the last (98th) position in the list of secretaries. Pritam Singh is continuously asserting that he had sent Dhami’s name at 16th position in the list of special invited members.

The PCC president added that he understands the position taken by Dhami and he (Pritam) too would have taken a similar stance in a similar position.It is pertinent to mention here that Dhami believes that the Leader of Opposition (LoP) Indira Hridayesh is the brain behind the whole fiasco to humiliate him. He has opened a front against the veteran leader by saying that the LoP has always remained friendly and non combative with the BJP government.

RR Shahi circle inspector of police Chainpur said, “We are your police, not of British time. That British police time has gone. We are at your service. We are to help you.”

SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta asked the gathering if their fear of police is due to their any soft corner for the extremists the gathering did not respond at all.

In a series of tweets, Nadda launched a scathing attack on Chief Minister Kejriwal of poll-bound Delhi, saying there is neither Jan Lokpal nor Swaraj, only the rule of arrogance in the national Capital.

133,30-1-20,IIT-B bans ‘anti-national activities’ on Powai campus,"Amid student protests being witnessed in university campuses across the country, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-Bombay) has banned “anti-national activities” and “speeches, plays, music or any other activities that disturb the peace of hostel environment” as part of the latest hostel rules that it wants to implement strictly on its Powai campus.

In a 15-point “Code of Conduct Rules” mailed to the IIT-B students on Tuesday, the institute’s Associate Dean of Student Affairs stated: “This mail is to reiterate and highlight some of the hostel rules which need to be strictly implemented from January 28, 2020”.

Among the 15 points, the rule number 10 stands out: “Residents shall not participate in any anti-national, anti-social and/or any other undesirable activities”. Significantly enough, the Code of Conduct has not defined as to what are “anti-national activities”.

The second such significant restriction mentioned in the code of conduct reads thus: “No Posters or leaflets/pamphlets distribution allowed in the hostel without the permission of the respective hostel council or Dean of Students Affairs (DoSA)”.

Another equally stringent restriction reads thus: “Speeches/plays/music or any other activities that disturb the peace of hostel environment are strictly prohibited. Not allowed even if faculty is part of the gathering. Only matters that are approved by the DoSA office will be permitted”.

On her part, the IIT-B spokesperson sought to downplay the “Code of Conduct Rules” by saying: “These are not new rules, but were in the statutes”.

The gag order issued to the IIT-B students should be seen in the context of a peaceful protest march that the students had organised on December 15 inside the campus, against violence meted out to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. They carried torches, placards and banners saying ‘In Solidarity With Jamia’.

The gag order should also be seen in the light of the fact that a section of students belonging to four different groups at IIT-B (Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle, North-East Collective, Ambedkar Students’ Collective and Charchavedi) that are part of a collective called ‘IIT-Bombay for Justice’ has joined the anti-CAA and NRC protest organised by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) for Social Justice on December 27.

Many of the students of IIT-B feel that the Code of Conduct is the direct fallout of protests against CAA and NRC being witnessed on the campuses of educational institutions across the country. They feel that the latest restrictions are a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution which provides freedom of speech. Another section of students have even gone to extent dubbing the Institute’s move is tantamount to internal emergency with the IIT-B. Most of the students who are opposing the new hostel rules owe allegiance to the outfit ‘IIT-Bombay for Justice’.

When asked about `IIT-Bombay for Justice’, IIT-B’s official spokesperson said: “IIT-Bombay for Justice is not an officially recognised body of the Institute”.

Among other things, the 15-point Code of Conduct rules warn the students against screening pirate/unauthorized/unlicensed movies, moving around furniture and fitments, against defacing walls, doors, windows, shelves from inside or outside and against indulging in ragging. “Ragging is a criminal offence,” the Code of Conduct stated.

The rules also prohibit the students from possession, smoking and consumption of alcoholic drinks or narcotic drugs inside the institute’s campus. “Entering IIT-B campus/hostel in intoxicated state is also strictly prohibited,” the Code of conduct stated. While barring persons of opposite sex, guest or otherwise from staying in hotels overnight after 10 pm, the gang order said: “Only students of IIT Bombay are permitted to visit the rooms of hostel for academic purpose. They need to deposit IIT-B ID cards and with the hostel security and sign the visitors’ book.

The rules however allow parents, brother and sister to stay in the hostel rooms after prior permission from the warden or DoSA.

The rules bar the students staying in hostels from using two or four-wheelers inside the campus. On the good behaviour side, the IIT-B management has stated: “All residents shall be courteous and fair with everyone inside and outside the hostel. All students shall carry their institute identity cards and produce on demand. Fines and or disciplinary punhisments awarded under WDC and DAC need to be adhered within the timeframe provided”.

Spread over 550 acres, the sprawling IIT-B complex — at Powai in north-east Mumbai —has in all 18 hostels — including three hostels for women. There are at least 6,000 students anf faculty numbers at any given point of time.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/iit-b-bans----anti-national-activities----on-powai-campus.html

135,30-1-20,Supertech hasn’t handed over 200 flats: Homebuyers,"People who have bought homes at Supertech’s Romano site here refuted the builder’s claim that 200 flats were handed over to them last week, saying that only “three or four” families were given the keys.

Even these flats were handed over without the builders obtaining the “occupancy certificate”, the homebuyers' association said.

In a statement on Saturday, Supertech had said it “handed over as many as 200 flats in its Romano project to home buyers today”. Supertech Romano Homebuyers' Association, however, said the builders' claim is “untrue” and the project, which is delayed by over three years, is “far from livable”.

Confronted with the homebuyers' rejoinder, a Supertech spokesperson said on Tuesday that keys were handed over to 20 buyers.

But all flats in Tower B2 are ready and other homebuyers have been sent a communication offering possession, the builders claimed.

“Not everyone came on January 25 but we had invited all buyers on Tower B2 to take possession of their homes,” the spokesperson claimed.

The spokesperson said the group has “applied for” the occupancy certificate for Tower B2 of its project located in Sector 118.

Earlier, the homebuyers' statement said, “There are only 150 units in Tower B2 and not 200 as reported and on January 25 keys were given to only 3-4 buyers and not to 200 as reported.” “Neither the occupancy certificate nor the completion certificate has been obtained for the project or the units offered for possession,” it added.

The association said the promised infrastructure like a club, a swimming pool, children’s play area and jogging track are not yet available.

It alleged that Supertech has also backed out from its commitment to make pre-EMI payments to subvention buyers.

“The project is delayed by over three years and the company is not pursuing it even now. Mere 15-20 labourers can be seen on the site of such a huge size,” the homebuyers' association claimed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/supertech-hasn---t-handed-over-200-flats--homebuyers.html
136,30-1-20,"Muslim women permitted to enter mosques to offer namaz, AIMPLB tells SC","Muslim women like men are permitted to enter mosques for offering 'namaz', the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) told the Supreme Court Wednesday.

The AIMPLB reply was filed in response to a PIL of Yasmeen Zuber Ahmad Peerzade who has sought judicial intervention in ensuring entry of Muslim women in mosques. It will be considered by a nine-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde.

The bench is dealing with legal and constitutional issues relating to discrimination against women in various religions and at religious places including Kerala’s Sabarimala Temple.

“Considering the religious texts, doctrine and religious belief of the followers of Islam, it is submitted that entry of women in the Mosque for offering prayer/Namaz, inside the Mosque, is permitted. Thus, a Muslim woman is free to enter Masjid for prayers. It is her option to exercise her right to avail such facilities as available for prayers in Masjid.

“The All India Muslim Personal Law Board does not want to comment on any contrary religious opinion to this effect,” Mohammed Fazlurrahim, Secretary of AIMPLB, said in his affidavit filed through lawyer M R Shamshad.

Islam has not made it obligatory on Muslim women to join congregational prayer nor is it obligatory for woman to offer Friday Namaz in congregation though it is so on Muslim men, the affidavit said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/muslim-women-permitted-to-enter-mosques-to-offer-namaz--aimplb-tells-sc.html

Congress leader in Parliament Adhir Chowdhury who is also an MP from Murshidabad accused the Trinamool Congress saying the local leaders of the Bengal ruling outfit were under instructions from the higher leadership to thwart anti-CAA movement by other Opposition parties.

“The local TMC leaders organised the attack when the people of Jalangi were observing a bandh in protest against CAA,” Chowdhury said

questioning the true face of Mamata Banerjee’s movement against CAA.

A local villager said TMC’s Jalangi Block President Tahiruddin opened fire at the protesters, killing two people and injuring several others. The two deceased have been identified as Maqbool Sheikh and Anirudh Biswas.

“The police did not intervene despite repeated requests from the villagers when we saw TMC goons assembling with deadly weapons,” Shahrul Biswas, son of one of the deceased.

“Today, a strike was called in protest against CAA-NRC. While my father was returning, a few motor vans came and the Jalangi Block President of TMC Tahiruddin started firing randomly.

Police were present there but did not do anything to stop it,” Biswas said.

While local TMC MP Abu Taher denied that his party was involved in the clash CPI(M)’s Md Salim said “today’s attack only proves how the Mamata Banerjee does not walk the talk. She says something and does something else.

The TMC similarly tried to spoil the bandh called by the Left and the Congress against CAA and NRC last year, he said, adding “this proves that Modi and Didi are not only friends in need but also friends in deed.”

There were no reports of anyone getting injured during the sporadic violence. In north Maharashtra’s Dhule district, two groups clashed during a rally against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The incident took place on Hundred Feet Road in Chalisgaon Road police station limits during the rally where a large number of Muslims were present. A group from the Hindu community gathered at the spot and started shouting slogans in support of the CAA and NRC, which was followed by a clash and stone-pelting from both sides, a police officer said.

140,30-1-20,Opp boycotts Guv address,"Amid a high voltage protest and boycott by the Opposition Congress-led UDF, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Wednesday presented his policy address in the Assembly and read out references to anti-CAA resolution passed by the House, despite disagreeing with it.

Reading out the the anti-CAA stand of the State Government, the Governor said “our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism which is part of the basic structure of our constitution.”

Referring to the unanimous anti-CAA resolution passed by the Assembly, Khan, who has been at loggerheads with the State Government for moving the Supreme Court against the law and the resolution against it, said the Government believes the Act “goes against the cardinal principles” underlying the Constitution.

“Strong States and strong Centre are pillars of our federalism. The voices of genuine apprehension of the States need to be considered by the Central Government in the right spirit keeping broad national interest in mind, particularly when constitutional values are involved and there are widespread anxieties and apprehensions among a large number of our citizenry,” he said.

It’s learnt that the Governor decided to read out the reference to the State’s anti-CAA stance after a letter was sent by Vijayan this morning, in which the Chief Minister had requested Khan to read the policy address “in its entirety sans any additions or deletions.”

“Since the constitutional function under Article 176 is exercised with the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers, it is requested that the address approved by the Council of Ministers be read in its entirety sans any additions or deletions”, the letter stated.

The day also saw an unprecedented protest by the UDF members, who also boycotted the policy address.

As the Governor was being ushered into the Assembly hall by Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, UDF members, blocked Khan, raised “Go Back” slogans holding aloft “Repeal CAA” and “Recall Governor” placards and banners.

Speaker was seen repeatedly trying to pacify the agitating MLAs but in vain, after which the watch and ward personnel, who stood as a wall protecting the Governor, cleared his path to the dais.

In his policy address, Khan said though he had his “reservations and disagreement” over the subject, he would read the para 18 containing reference to anti-CAA matter, just to “honour” the wish of the Chief Minister. When Khan began his policy address, the Opposition members trooped out of the Assembly hall raising slogans and staged a sit-in protest at the gate of the Assembly.

“This august body (Kerala Assembly) unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Central Government to abrogate the CAA 2019 which my Government believes goes against the cardinal principles underlying our Constitution,” he said.

The Government has also filed a petition in the supreme court invoking Article 131 of the constitution, Governor said. As he was leaving the assembly, reporters asked him about the unprecedented protest faced by him, to which the Governor quipped that he had faced worst protests than this.

Meanwhile, taken by surprise over the governor’s move to read out Anti CAA reference in his address, Leader of Opposition, Ramesh Chennithala, who protested along with his front MLAs, told media that the State Government and the Governor had come to a “truce”.

“The double stand of the Chief Minister has been exposed now. The CM begged the Governor to read the policy address in full. Why is the CM silent on the Governor who has insulted the people of Kerala? This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” Chennithala alleged. The Top Court has been hearings a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala High Court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan, the then State Electricity Minister, and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three Hydroelectric projects in 1997.

Expressing solidarity with the Governor, BJP’s Kerala unit took out a march to the Assembly complex. Attacking the UDF, former BJP president, Kummanam Rajashekharan asked, “who gave authority to Congress to stop the Governor?..” “By blocking the Governor, the UDF has insulted the people of Kerala,” he said.

Khan had made it clear that he was not a “rubber stamp” and it was “improper” that he was not informed by the Government before moving the apex court.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-boycotts-guv-address.html

142,30-1-20,India among top 30 high risk countries,"nIndia is among the top 30 countries at “high-risk” from the spread of the deadly coronavirus, according to a study based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive in the countries from the worst affected cities in China.

Thailand tops the list of most “at risk” countries or regions worldwide followed by Japan, and Hong Kong. The US is 6th on the list, Australia 10th, the UK 17th and India 23rd, researchers from the University of Southampton in the UK said.

The University’s WorldPop team, Bangkok, Thailand, had compiled a list of cities and countries they believe are at high risk from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — which has killed over 132 people so far, and infected thousands.

It said Thailand is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus. Hong Kong is second on the list, followed by Taipei in Taiwan. Sydney, New York and London are among the top 20 other major international cities ranked in the research.

Within mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan.

“It’s vital that we understand patterns of population movement, both within China and globally, in order to assess how this new virus might spread — domestically and internationally,” said Andrew Tatem, a professor at the University of Southampton.

“By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness,” Tatem said.

The team used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data — which helps to identify devices — along with international air travel data to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations.

The team, including researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada, and the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, was then able to rank the top 30 most at-risk countries and cities around the world.

The researchers acknowledge that their analysis is based on ‘non-outbreak’ travel patterns, but highlight that a high proportion of people travelled with symptoms at an early stage of the outbreak, before restrictions were put in place.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-among-top-30-high-risk-countries.html

The Minister said that the State Government had taken steps to screen people who might have been exposed to the virus so as to prevent its spread in the State. He requested the Centre to provide kits that would enable the State Government to conduct the necessary tests to detect cases in Hyderabad itself.

At present, samples taken in Hyderabad are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.

145,30-1-20,"PFI, Rehab India officials meet ED to seek more time on PMLA summons","Representatives of the controversial outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) and NGO Rehab India Foundation on Wednesday met Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials to seek more time for its office bearers to appear before the agency for questioning in connection with a money laundering probe against them.

Four officials, including legal representatives, of the two outfits met ED officials at an agency office here on Wednesday.

The ED is probing PFI and NGO Rehab India Foundation under criminal provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as part of a case registered in 2018.

A recent ED report has claimed that violent protests in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) had an alleged “financial link” with the PFI. This aspect is also under the scanner of the ED along with some purported dubious deposits in the bank accounts linked to the Rehab India Foundation (RIF).

The agency had issued summons to seven office-bearers of the two outfits on Tuesday in connection the alleged funding for the anti-CAA protests.

Those summoned by the agency include PFI and Rehab India Foundation (RIF) Chairman E Abubacker, PFI vice-chairman O M Abdul Salam, General Secretary M Mohammed Ali Jinnah and national secretaries Anis Ahmed and Abdul Wahid Sait.

Similar summonses were also sent to RIF general secretary Remiz Muhammed and secretary A Chandrankandy.

The agency may issue a fresh date for Abubacker’s appearance before it. The other office bearers are scheduled to appear before the investigating officer of the case next week, officials said.

Officials said the agency is also probing remittances and withdrawal of funds from nine bank accounts of RFI apart from a deposit of `20 lakh from Dubai in its accounts.

At least Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in several bank accounts linked to the PFI between December 4 last year and January 6 in various parts of the country, sources said, adding this was the time when Parliament cleared the passage of CAA.

A total amount of `120 crore, credited at varied times into the bank accounts linked to the PFI, RFI and few others, is under the scanner of the agency, sources said.

“The Popular Front of India has stated it multiple times that we fully comply with the law of the land and the allegation of `120 crore transferred from the Popular Front’s accounts just before the CAA protests is totally baseless and the people who are levelling these allegations should prove these claims,” the organisation had said in a statement issued on Monday.

The ED took cognizance of a National Investigation Agency (NIA) FIR and charge sheet against the PFI to file the PMLA case against the outfit in 2018.

The ED is probing the PFI’s alleged role with respect to suspected terror-funding and possible creation of assets by using suspected “proceeds of crime.”

The PFI was formed in November, 2006 in Kerala and is suspected to have subsequently shifted its headquarters to Shaheen Bagh in the national capital.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pfi--rehab-india-officials-meet-ed-to-seek-more-time-on-pmla-summons.html

Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan demanded reduction in GST rates on agriculture inputs to less than 5 per cent and said the Government should announce measures like universal basic income to put more money in the hands of farmers and the poor so that their consumption increases.

He demanded that the Government bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime as it would help provide relief to the farmers, who have been paying higher rates, and said the Centre had earned over Rs 13.5 lakh crore by way of taxes on petroleum products.

He said the Government must tell how much has farmers’ income increased in the last five years under it, as part of its promise of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. “We want to know, as we are aware that nothing has happened so far. The budget should also provide a detailed outline of how to double farmers’ income by 2022 and what steps have been taken,” Chavan said at AICC Press conference.

Chavan said the Government should announce a national farm loan waiver on the lines of the previous UPA Government’s step undertaken in 2008 to benefit 14 crore farmer families in the country.

“We demand that the Government should put more money in the hands of 95 per cent poor who live in rural areas and help improve consumption through schemes like MNREGA. The Government should also bring a universal basic income scheme to ensure that there is direct benefit to people and money should go into their accounts directly to help improve consumption levels,” he said.

Chavan, a former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, said for farmers’ income to double by 2022 the agriculture sector has to grow by at least 12 per cent compounded annually.

Shringla, who was India’s envoy to the US before assuming the new responsibility, will get a fixed two-year term as Foreign Secretary. He succeeded Vijay Gokhale following his retirement.

Shringla is taking charge at a time of the high-profile post at a time when India is facing a plethora of foreign policy challenges including ramping up of diplomatic outreach in the wake of criticism by some countries and global institutions of the new Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA). India is also facing an increasingly assertive Trump administration and China’s attempt to expand its military and economic influence in the region.

Speaking to reporters ahead of taking the charge, Shringla, a 1984-batch officer of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), said “I am as committed to the ministry’s role in nation-building as I was almost 36 years ago when I entered these portals as a young professional. I look forward to functioning under the guidance of the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and the External Affairs Minister (S Jaishankar), our political leadership and with the support and cooperation of my colleagues both within the ministry and outside,” the 57-year-old diplomat said.

The Government did not follow the seniority principle in appointing Shringla to the top post. Indian High Commissioner to the UK Ruchi Ghanshyam, a 1982-batch IFS officer, was also in contention for the post.

Shringla had played an important role in successful hosting of the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston in September where US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Modi jointly addressed the Indian Diaspora.

“I am conscious of the fact that I am stepping into the shoes of my illustrious stalwarts and seniors who have upheld the highest standards of professionalism and integrity to their work.

Mercedes-Benz has 96 outlets in 47 cities across India right now and Schwenk said that the company aims to cross the 100 outlet mark in 2020.

Unlike other brands, he added that their financial health of their dealer partners was in good shape and said that Mercedes had helped their dealers whenever needed with Daimler Financial Services, the company’s finance arm.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mercedes-benz-launches-next-generation-gle.html
161,30-1-20,Gadkari urges industry to cash in on new expressway projects,"Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday urged industry players to cash in on the huge potential that 22 upcoming express highways hold in the areas of alternative fuel, electric highway and charging stations.

The Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister said that projects specially about Rs 1 lakh crore Delhi-Mumbai express highway can offer instant right of way to players interested in setting up LNG stations, electric charging stations or petrol pumps.

Addressing a conference on 'Future Fuels for Transportation' by FICCI, the minister said plans were afoot to set up 2,000 petrol pumps, including LNG.

“We are building 22 new express highways including Delhi-Mumbai Express Highway. Work on seven out of 22 projects have started and these have huge potential for the industry. If players want to come forward, we can offer right of way especially on Delhi-Mumbai Express Highway which we plan to complete within three years,"" the Minister said.

Gadkari said plans are on for an electric highway stretch on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and the land acquisition for over Rs 1 lakh crore expressway project has been completed. He said he will be visiting Sweden next month to see E-Highways and welcomed players for investments to convert highways into e-highways.

He also said: ""The RBI has assured us that they will allow us to take infrastructure loans for 30 years. So if a bankable project is for 30 years, the loan amount will be raised within 13-18 years. There will be two years moratorium period after completion of project. When after three years, toll collection starts then we will open an escrow account. Specific amount will be deposited in this escrow account.""

The minister said at present NHAI has 480 such secure, bankable projects and five more banks are willing to give loans like the SBI gave.

""Depending upon traffic, we will keep depositing money in the escrow account,” he said.

He said NHAI 's annual income for the current fiscal will be Rs 40,000 crore and it will reach Rs 1 lakh crore in coming years.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/gadkari-urges-industry-to-cash-in-on-new-expressway-projects.html
162,30-1-20,Oil Ministry pitches for inclusion of natural gas in GST,"Ahead of the Union Budget, the Oil Ministry has made a renewed pitch for inclusion of natural gas in the ambit of GST to promote the use of the environment-friendly fuel by reducing multiplicity of taxes and improving business climate.

When the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced on July 1, 2017, amalgamating 17 central and state levies, five commodities namely crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) were kept out of its purview given the revenue dependence of State Governments on this

sector.

""Currently natural gas is taxed under the VAT regime with VAT ranging from 3 per cent to 20 per cent across states,"" the ministry said in a booklet it brought out to promote the use of the fuel in automobiles, household kitchens, and industries.

If brought under GST, natural gas will attract a uniform rate of tax at the consumption point anywhere in the country after doing away with current rates of excise duty and VAT.

This, it said, would ""result in an increase in state domestic product and socio-economic development owing to increased economic activities"" which will lead to

improved employment opportunities.

Also, it would lead to improved investor confidence and attract more investment in natural gas infrastructure in the country, the booklet said, adding that a positive impact on environment and health due to reduction in carbon emissions across

major cities was another advantage.

""As gas is not under the ambit of GST, there is no input tax credit available. Further, the downstream industries are not able to claim the benefit of the tax credit of VAT paid on purchases of natural gas which is available for alternate fuels/feedstocks,"" the booklet said.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan too has been making a vehement pitch for the inclusion of gas in the GST.

""We believe natural gas as also aviation turbine fuel (ATF) can be included in the GST regime,"" he had said on Monday.

Including ATF and natural gas will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country, he had said. ""Including natural gas in GST is said to be one of the biggest drivers of not just consumption but will also incentivize producers to spend more on finding and producing more gas as well as incentivize importers to bring in more LNG.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-ministry-pitches-for-inclusion-of-natural-gas-in-gst.html
163,30-1-20,Lamborghini unveils new Huracan variant,"Rear-Wheel Drive supercar has 610 horsepower

Italian supercar maker Lamborghini on Wednesday took the wraps off the latest variant of their Huracan supercar in India. The Huracan EVO Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) has 610 horsepower and a claimed top speed of 325 kilometers per hour and a 0-100 time of 3.3 seconds, making it one of the fastest cars on sale in India. This variant which solely drives the rear wheels instead of the all-wheel drive regular model is a true ‘drivers car’ according to Sharad Agarwal, Head, Lamborghini India and will set a buyer back Rs 3.2 crore.

Speaking to The Pioneer, Matteo Ortenzi, Chief Executive Officer, Asia-Pacific, Lamborghini highlighted how India has been a bright spot for the company. “The advent of new technologies and engineering have made the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) space much more sporty. The Urus (Lamborghini’s SUV) has been really in demand with Indian buyers, because it does not make any compromises on performance.” Agarwal added that the Urus sold over 50 units in the first year of sales, and that this helped Lamborghini double their sales in the ‘super-premium’ segment (vehicles over Rs 2.5 crore) even though the segment declined over 18 percent in line with the rest of the automotive market in 2019. India is the only major market where Lamborghini outsells their Italian rival Ferrari and Ortenzi puts that down to the Urus but added that supercars like the Huracan help as well, “India is an important market for us, so much so that we launched the Huracan EVO in India first and both the Huracan Spyder and the RWD came to India within days of their global launch.” One reason for Lamborghini’s success in India according to Agarwal is because the company doesn’t just sell cars but also a ‘luxury lifestyle and experience’, “Lamborghini is much more than just cars, we do drives and track experiences and much more for our customers.”",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lamborghini-unveils-new-huracan-variant-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/lamborghini-unveils-new-huracan-variant.html
164,30-1-20,India's gold demand falls 9 pc on record prices in 2019: WGC,"India's gold demand fell nine per cent to 690.4 tonnes in 2019 from the previous calendar year as record domestic prices and economic slowdown dented retail purchase, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Thursday.

However, in 2020, gold demand in India -- the world's second biggest consumer after China -- could increase to 700-800 tonnes on hopes of increased acceptance of high price level and likely economic reforms boosting consumer confidence.

The domestic gold price finished 2019 just above Rs 39,000 per ten grams, almost 24 per cent higher than at the end of 2018, WGC said in its latest report.

""As policy measures unfold, broader economic growth accelerates and local prices of the past six months become more acceptable among households, India's gold demand will be in the range of 700-800 tonnes in 2020,"" Somasundaram PR, Managing Director of WGC's India operations, told PTI.

The WGC expects policy-led and industry-led initiatives to bring a marked shift in making the industry more transparent and organised this year, he said.

Already, the government has made hallmarking (quality certification) mandatory on January 15, 2020 with a transition period of one year for the trade to sell or change its existing non-hallmarked inventory. This is an overdue reform and a positive step towards making the Indian gold more trustworthy, he said.

""These and other changes to follow are significantly positive for the long-term sustainability of demand, especially for the compliant and the organised sector,"" Somasundaram said.

However, short-term challenges remain as large sections of the industry compete on low margins and fear tax uncertainty, leaving little incentive for long term investments and modern trade practices, he said.

""India's average long-term gold demand is likely around 850 tonnes given its affinity to gold and economic and social context,"" he added.

In 2019, the WGC said India's gold demand in volume terms declined to 690.4 tonnes from 760.4 tonnes in 2018, out of which jewellery demand fell nine per cent to 544.6 tonnes from 598 tonnes, while bar and coins demand also dropped 10 per cent to 145.8 tonnes from 162.4 tonnes in the said period.

However in value terms, the country's gold demand rose three per cent to Rs 2,17,770 crore in 2019 from Rs 2,11,860 crore in the previous year.

""Dhanteras – the first day of Diwali (the Festival of Light) which fell on October 25, 2019 – failed to bring cheer to gold demand in Q4 as the higher domestic gold price and weak economic sentiment curtailed gold sales,"" the WGC said.

Festival demand received some support from advance wedding purchases and a dip in the gold price ahead of the November wedding season released some pent-up wedding-related demand, but volumes were nevertheless soft compared with 2018, it said, and added, the slowdown was less pronounced among the more organised national and regional chain stores

India's gold import including through grey channels, the WGC said it declined by 14 per cent to 646.8 tonnes in 2019 from 755.7 tonnes in 2018. Imports through grey market stood at 115-120 tonnes in 2019.

""Imports remained lower due to softening of local demand and 37 per cent increase in recycled gold to 119 tonnes in 2019,"" Somasundaram said.

""We do believe imports may not rise as fast as demand this year. But do expect custom duty on gold to be reduced to 10 per cent from 12.5 per cent at present.""

Two-thirds of India's gold demand comes from rural areas, where jewellery is a traditional store of wealth.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-gold-demand-falls-9-pc-on-record-prices-in-2019--wgc-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-s-gold-demand-falls-9-pc-on-record-prices-in-2019--wgc.html
165,30-1-20,Charges politically motivated: Trump Defence,"Lawyers representing Donald Trump at his impeachment trial said the abuse of power charges against the US President were “driven by political desires”, as they wrapped up their opening arguments.

“The articles of impeachment fall far short of any constitutional standard,” White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who led Trump’s defence, said on Tuesday.

“What they are asking you to do is to throw out a successful president on the eve of an election, with no basis and in violation of the Constitution,” he said.

Urging the Senate to acquit the president of the abuse of power charges, the White House counsel argued that overturning the last election and “massively interfering” with the upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage to the people of the United States.

“The Senate cannot allow this to happen. It is time for this to end, here and now,” he said in his closing remarks at the Senate floor.

The Senate is conducting Trump’s trial as the House of Representatives voted last month to impeach him on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, both related to his dealings with Ukraine.

Trump is accused of cheating in his 2020 reelection bid by pressuring Ukraine, a US ally, to announce probe into Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter and a conspiracy theory, promoted by Russia, that Kiev helped the Democrats in 2016.

According to the impeachment charges, Trump froze military aid to Ukraine for two months last summer to put pressure on President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce the investigations, illicitly drawing a foreign nation into American electoral politics.

Trump’s legal team said he did nothing wrong and the articles of the impeachment are “constitutionally deficient and they fail to state impeachable offences”.

The lawyers said the entire process that led to the House of Representatives voting for the president’s impeachment was “completely partisan” and was not based on any wrongdoing by Trump or any constitutionally sufficient theories for impeaching the president.

“It was simply a partisan process that was driven by political desires to overturn the last election and to affect the 2020 election,” the legal team said.

Meanwhile, Democrats sought to have the Senate subpoena former national security advisor John Bolton as a witness, following leaks from his forthcoming book that suggested he could supply damning evidence against Trump.

Republicans, however, exuded confidence that they have enough votes to thwart any such move. In the 100-member Senate, Republican Senators have a 53-47 lead over the Democrats.

Bolton reportedly writes that Trump directly withheld security aid to Ukraine for his own political benefit.

During the three days of arguments, Trump’s lawyers painted him as a victim of a partisan attempt to undo the 2016 election.

Referring to Bolton’s allegations, Trump’s personal attorney Jay Sekulow said, “It is not a game of leaks or unsourced manuscripts.”

With the conclusion of the opening arguments of Trump’s legal team, the Senate trial now moves into a two-day period of questioning, during which each party will alternate questioning for up to 16 hours throughout Wednesday and Thursday. The senators will not ask questions themselves but submit them for Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding, to read.

A vote on whether or not to call witnesses in the trial is expected on Friday.

“No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!” Trump tweeted late Tuesday night.

Senator Ted Cruz exuded confidence that Trump will be acquitted of all the charges at the end of the trial. Praising Trump’s lawyers, Senator John Cornyn said the House managers made the mistake of allotting time to each of the managers.

“It was more like they weren’t talking to us, they were talking to the TV cameras and were enjoying their moment in the sun. I thought the President’s lawyers presented a concise and persuasive case,” he said.

“Not only do they want to negate the 2016 election where President Trump was elected, they want to bar him from being on the ballot in 2020. That’s what this impeachment trial is all about. That, to me, is a real threat to the American people’s right to be heard at the ballot box, particularly here nine months before the election,” Cornyn told Fox News.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/charges-politically-motivated--trump-defence.html
166,30-1-20,"Trump unveils Mideast plan favourable to Israel, angering Palestinians","President Donald Trump has released his long delayed Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, promising “a new dawn,” but angry Palestinians called it biased and deserving to go in the “dustbin of history.”

Standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House’s East Room, Trump said on Tuesday that his plan could succeed where decades of previous US attempts to intervene had failed.

“Together we can bring about a... New dawn in the Middle East,” Trump said to an enthusiastic audience that included throngs of Israeli and Jewish American guests — but apparently no Palestinian representatives.

They are flat out rejecting the plan, which grants Israel much of what it has sought in decades of international diplomacy, namely control over Jerusalem as its “undivided” capital, rather than a city to share with the Palestinians. The plan also lets Israel annex West Bank settlements.

Trump praised Israel for taking “a giant step toward peace” with the plan, which lays out a vision for future Palestinian statehood if a series of strict conditions are met.

These include requiring the future Palestinian state to be “demilitarised,” while formalising Israeli sovereignty over settlements built in occupied territory.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-unveils-mideast-plan-favourable-to-israel--angering-palestinians.html
167,30-1-20,"Yogi: Protesters speaking Pakistan’s language, won’t tolerate such acts","Continuing his attack on anti-CAA protesters, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday accused them of “speaking the language of Pakistan” and said such acts won’t be tolerated.

“Those staging protests at several places are directly or indirectly speaking in the language of Pakistan. The country is being cheated in the name of protests. Such acts won’t be tolerated or accepted,” the CM said during the convocation of a nursing college here.

Addressing students, the CM without taking names criticised the “distinguished personalities” who have extended support to the protests.

“Some self-proclaimed intellectuals are misleading people about the Citizen Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens to create unrest in the country,” Yogi, who earlier in the day took a dip in the Sangam in Allahabad said.

The Chief Minister said a large number of protesters didn’t know against whom they were protesting.

“When reporters at the India Gate asked them the reason behind the protest or about the law they were protesting against, surprisingly they didn’t know anything about it. This proves that they are misled and we all need to come forward to stop them as such people are a hindrance to development,” he said.

Drawing a comparison between minorities in India and Pakistan, CM Yogi said,” “Muslims in India became presidents of the country and judges of the Supreme Court while in Pakistan, it is difficult to find any Hindu, Sikh, Christian or Jain holding top posts,” he said.

169,30-1-20,RIL approaches NHAI for offering waste plastic-to-road tech,"Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance industries has approached National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for offering its ‘waste plastic-to-road’ technology that uses end-of-life plastic for road construction.

The company has already piloted a few projects and has constructed nearly a 40 kilometre-road by mixing 50 tonnes of end-of-life plastic waste with bitumen at its Nagothane manufacturing site in Raigad district.

“It took us some 14-18 months to develop this mechanism where we can use the end-of-life waste plastic like packaging of snacks and flimsy polyethylene bags, among others, in road construction.

“We are in talks with NHAI to share our experience and to help the use of end-of-life plastic for road construction,” the company’s COO Petrochemicals Business Vipul Shah told reporters. Apart from NHAI, RIL is also in talks with state governments and local bodies across the country for offering the technology, he said.

End-of-life plastic cannot be recycled.

Explaining the benefits of the usage of end-of-life waste plastic, Shah said, “it not only ensures sustainable utilisation of plastic but is also financially viable”.

“Our experience showed that 1 km of road uses 1 metric tonne (mt) of waste plastic and can save nearly Rs 1 lakh as it can be utilised as a substitute for bitumen to the extent of 8-10 per cent. So, roughly we saved Rs 40 lakh. Besides, this plastic also enhances the quality of roads,” he said.

Shah also said the roads made using end-of-life waste plastic were completed in two months and sustained the torrential rains of last year without any erosion.

“NHAI is expected to construct 10,000 kms of roads with average four lanes in FY2021, which is around 40,000 kms of roads that can use nearly 40,000 mt of waste plastics. Besides, other state authorities and local bodies are expected to construct 23,000 kms of around four-lane roads.

“This is a good 86,000 mt of waste plastic,” RIL head of business development (sustainable solutions) KRS Narayan said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ril-approaches-nhai-for-offering-waste-plastic-to-road-tech.html

The survey has put the median growth forecast for agriculture and allied activities at 2.6 per cent for 2019-20, the industry and services sector at 3.5 per cent and 7.2 per cent, respectively, during the current year.

""Growth is likely to improve to 5.5 per cent in 2020-21 as per the projections,"" the survey said.

Further as per the survey, the economic growth has been pegged at 4.7 per

cent for the third quarter of 2019-20.

The survey was conducted during December and January 2019-20 amongst economists belonging to the industry, banking and financial services sector, Ficci said.

As per the first advance estimates of the national income released by the NSO, India's GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and construction sectors.

The survey further said concerns remain on external front with exports projected to contract in 2019-20.

Merchandise exports are expected to decline by 2.1 per cent, while imports are expected to decline 5.5 per cent during the year, it said.

Moreover, median current account deficit forecast was pegged at 1.4 per cent of GDP for 2019-20.

""Moderation in global growth forecast, escalating geo-political tensions, and uncertainty around trade deal between US-China and BREXIT outcome still form major risk factors to India's growth in 2020,"" it said.

Participating economists said that a shortfall in government's revenue collections seems imminent this year on the back of lower than anticipated nominal growth.

To augment Government's revenue collections, they called for measures to boost the country's nominal GDP growth.

Citing weak consumption demand as a major impediment to India's growth, economists cautioned against any changes in the GST rates to improve revenue collections as it would prove to be counterproductive, Ficci said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/ficci-survey-projects-fy20-gdp-growth-at-5---to-improve-to-5-5--in-fy21.html

Newly-installed Chief Executive David Calhoun, who took the reins this month to stabilize the situation, pledged to turn the company around even as Boeing disclosed $9.2 billion in new costs connected to the MAX. Some analysts had expected new costs twice as high, and despite the hefty charges, Boeing shares rallied early Wednesday in pre-market.

The MAX has been grounded since March following two crashes that killed 346 people which opened the doors to intense scrutiny of Boeing's safety practices — and regulatory oversight of its productions — as well bruising congressional investigations which have revealed a troublesome culture at the aviation giant.

""We are committed to transparency and excellence in everything we do,"" Calhoun said in a statement. ""Safety will underwrite every decision, every action and every step we take as we move forward.""

Calhoun has been at the helm of Boeing only since January 13 after Dennis Muilenburg was ousted in December following criticism of his handling of the crisis, and immediately after damning series of internal communications were released.

Calhoun is targeting mid-2020 to win approval from aviation regulators to resume flights on the MAX, which is seen as a more realistic timeframe after Muilenburg repeatedly pushed a more optimistic schedule.

The grounding of the MAX dented Boeing's earnings in multiple ways, halting deliveries of new planes to customers, a major source of revenues. Boeing revenues in the fourth quarter plunged 36.8 percent to $17.9 billion, while revenues for all of 2019 dropped 24.3 percent to $76.6 billion. The crisis also prompted the manufacturer to first reduce and then halt production of the MAX until the crisis is resolved. Boeing said Wednesday the changes in the production schedule added $2.6 billion in costs connected to airplane deliveries, plus another $4 billion in ""abnormal production costs"" primarily in 2020 associated with the suspension of the MAX and a ""gradual resumption"" of production. The company set aside $2.6 billion to compensate airlines that have been forced to cancel thousands of flights due to grounded MAX planes and undelivered aircraft.

The MAX crisis also has weighed on numerous suppliers, such as Spirit AeroSystems, which announced earlier this month that it would lay off 2,800 employees in Kansas due to the production stoppage.

And General Electric, which builds engines for the MAX, said the crisis lowered cash flow by $1.4 billion for 2019.

Boeing also announced Wednesday that it would again cut back production of the 787 Dreamliner, a top-selling plane that has supported revenues during the protracted 737 MAX grounding.

The aerospace giant plans to cut production to 10 airplanes a month in early 2021 through 2023 based on the ""near-term market outlook,"" Boeing said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/boeing-reports-2019-loss-of--636-m--1st-year-in-red-since-1997.html

174,30-1-20,Xi orders military to help deal with coronavirus,"Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday ordered the military to “shoulder responsibility” to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has killed 132 people, infected 6,000 others with six foreigners contracting the disease for the first time in China and spread to 17 countries.

President Xi, who heads the People’s Liberation Army, told the military to keep their mission firmly in mind and shoulder responsibility to make contribution to winning the battle against the novel coronavirus, which he has described as a “demon”, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Already the military is pressing thousands of its medical personnel into Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, to assist the doctors.

Xi’s call to the military came as the number of confirmed cases of the rapidly spreading virus infection in mainland China reached 6,078 with 70 cases abroad, surpassing the cases witnessed during the SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, which had caused havoc in China in 2002-03. Over 800 people, mostly in China, died during the SARS epidemic.

The coronavirus, which first emerged in Wuhan in late December, has killed 132 people, infected over 6,000 others and spread to at least 17 countries, amid warnings by health experts that the epidemic may reach its peak in the next 10 days resulting in a big increase in number of cases.

The Chinese health authorities announced on Wednesday that 5,974 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions by Tuesday.

China’s National Health Commission said in its daily report that 1,239 patients remained in critical condition and 9,239 people were suspected to be infected with the virus. A total of 103 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery, the commission said.

For the first-time, Tibet too reported a suspected case of coronavirus.

A total of 65,537 close contacts had been traced, the commission said, adding that among them, 1,604 were discharged after medical observation on Tuesday. A total of 59,990 people were still under medical observation.

Also for the first time since the virus surfaced in December, six foreigners, including four Pakistanis and two Australians, have contracted the virus, raising concerns among thousands of foreigners working in China.

Pakistan also confirmed that four of its nationals, all students, have been infected with the virus in Wuhan. Over 500 Pakistani students were in Wuhan.

Chinese officials said one of the Pakistani students who contracted the virus was found in Guangdong province.

Guangdong health commission deputy head Chen Zhusheng said that the Pakistani and two Australians were in a stable condition but it was not known how they contracted the virus.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/xi-orders-military-to-help-deal-with-coronavirus.html
175,30-1-20,Trend Blazer,"Thappad is this year's Pink: Taapsee

Actor Taapsee Pannu feels her forthcoming starrer Thappad is reminiscent of her critically-acclaimed 2016 multiplex hit, Pink, which sledgehammered the message that when a woman says no, she means no.

“Working with Anubhav sir is always an enriching experience and he encourages one to push the envelope. When he discussed Thappad, I immediately decided this was a film I had to do. It has a thought provoking storyline and deals with a subject, which must be addressed in our society.

The film is directed by Anubhav Sinha. It also features Dia Mirza and Pavail Gulati. Thappad is scheduled to release on February 28.

‘So much has been said about Kangana, me and some kind of rivalry. But at every public event we've greeted each other graciously. As a filmmaker, I respect her talent and craft. She is an actor who has proved her mettle. Besides Ekta and Adnan Sami, I am honoured to receive the Padma Shri alongside Kangana.’

—Karan Johar

Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s Shikara has taken inspiration from real-life incidents of Kashmiri Pandits.

It brings back the untold story of Kashmiri pandits from the valley of 1990 and has 40,000 real migrants of Jagti and other camps who actually shot for the film.

The film also has actual footage from the exodus included which brings it even closer to reality.

The trailers have been widely appreciated for its storyline and the gut-wrenching portions from the pages of history. The film releases on February 7.

Bieber feared he would cheat on wife

Singer Justin Bieber questioned whether or not he would be able to commit and stay faithful to his wife Hailey Baldwin before he proposed to her.

“I was extremely nervous. I felt like in the past, we had talked about... me asking the question, and I felt like she would say yes,” he said.

Bieber added, “So I wasn't really nervous about the saying yes, but I think I was more nervous about ‘Am I going to make this commitment?' Am I able to make this commitment as a man and be able to honour because that's something serious. When you say you're gonna love someone for better or for worse and be faithful, that's huge. Am I able to do that? And, so I think that was really what I was battling with.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-01-30.html
176,30-1-20,Not downsizing but right-sizing,"For most of history, houses were more modestly proportioned and we lived quite comfortably in those smaller homes. Over time houses got too big. Now they are smaller again

With the current trend toward de-cluttering and downsizing, there are plenty of books about how to winnow down possessions to the few that are truly necessary and loved. This book shows how you can live well once that’s done. In Downsize: Living Large in a Small House (2019, The Taunton Press), author Sheri Koones focuses on practical ways to live well at home once you’ve streamlined your belongings and are living more compactly.

“It scares people to think of moving into a smaller space, but every single person I interviewed who has made the transition says they are so happy they did,” Koones says. “Time and again, people used the word ‘liberated’ to describe their move to a smaller space, with homes requiring far less time and money to maintain.”

Koones, who recently relocated from a sprawling 6,800-square-foot house in Greenwich, Connecticut, to a 1,400-square-foot home closer to town, has experienced the transition herself.

“It’s not just empty nesters anymore,” she adds. “Younger people, too, are in couples where they’re both working, they’re having children later, they want to be active and they don’t want to be doing maintenance on the weekends. They don’t want to be tied down to mowing lawns and doing all the other chores that come with living in a big house.”

Living more sustainably and saving on energy costs is also part of the attraction of downsizing, Koones says. So is aging in place. There are people of all ages looking for features like a master bedroom on the main floor or barrier-free showers.

“Yes, older people with disabilities need them but even younger people break a leg skiing or have situations where they want a barrier-free shower,” she says.

The book features photos and illustrations of 33 well-designed small homes in urban and rural settings in the US and Canada. It examines the features that make each home a success, with advice aimed at those building, renovating or even just organising their homes.

Some of the features that Koones says can make a small home feel more spacious:

177,30-1-20,Rajinikanth appeals to conserve water,"Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth has appealed for water conservation on a war footing as he marks his TV debut after 43 years of cinema via Discovery channel’s Into The Wild with Bear Grylls. “This war (water conserving) has to be led at all levels including government, community as well as on the individual front. I believe this show is a perfect platform to take the message of conserving water to every home across the country,” said the actor.

The 69-year-old Southern superstar shot for the programme in Karnataka’s Bandipur Tiger Reserve. It’s an 874 sq km national park, formed by integrating most of the forest areas of erstwhile Venugopala Wildlife Park established in 1941, and later enlarged to its current state in Chamarajanagar district, about 220 km Southwest of Bengaluru. The tiger reserve lists 28 species of mammals to be thriving in the forest, including royal Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, common leopard, bonnet macaque, Indian pipistrelle and barking deer, among others.

In August 2019, Grylls had hosted Prime Minister Modi in the Man vs Wild show, which was shot at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand in February 2019. Other international icons who featured in the show include United States President Donald Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, Titanic star Kate Winslet, Tennis virtuoso Roger Federer and Hollywood great Julia Roberts and others.

“Into The Wild is a truly unique show, at one level it offers adrenaline pumping action, while at another, the show lends itself beautifully to driving a specific purpose for the larger good of society,” said Rajinikanth.

“Bear Grylls has tested the survival skills of multiple celebrity guests, pushing them to their limits. I look forward to the survival challenge in the mesmerising wilderness of India,” he added. Also focussing on water conservation in the new programme, Megha Tata, managing director, Discovery, South Asia, said that the channel wanted to add a layer of purpose with each episode.

“Last year, the show featuring Modi, generated much desired attention on conservation of wildlife. We are confident that the forthcoming episode will sensitise each one of us about conservation of water,” Tata said.

Grylls heaped praise on Rajinikanth, saying that the actor is a phenomenon, who has captivated the audience across the world with his work both on screen and off screen.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rajinikanth-appeals-to-conserve-water-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/rajinikanth-appeals-to-conserve-water.html

179,30-1-20,SRMIST conducts accreditation workshop,"As a part of the quality mandate, University Grants Commission (UGC) has set the goal to get every Higher Education Institution accredited. In order to achieve this goal UGC has introduced a scheme called Paramarsh (Consultant). Under this scheme institutions like SRMIST which are accredited and acclaimed by various agencies act as mentors and adopt unaccredited institutions and mentor them towards accreditation. SRMIST has adopted five institutions in and around Chennai under this scheme.

The inaugural workshop for these institutes was conducted at SRMIST, Kattankulathur campus recently where the nuances of accreditation by NAAC were expounded by experts from SRMIST. It was also highlighted how SRMIST, which was first accredited by NAAC way back in 2006, improved its performance by leaps and bounds to attain the present exalted status. The five institutes are: Pachaiyappa’s College for Women, Kanchipuram, Pachaiyappa’s College for Men, Kanchipuram, C. Kandaswami Naidu College for Men, Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology and Thangavelu Engineering College.

Welcoming the representatives from other colleges, Registrar Dr N Sethuraman said, “This programme is organised so that other higher education institutions get mentored and we get the opportunity to lend our helping hand to other institutions.” Inaugurating the workshop, Vice Chancellor Dr Sandeep Sancheti said, “Consultations is the key to improvement in any domain. Things can be done easily when we start consulting, however, this is not followed much in the field of education. Consulting with experts, stakeholders is an important way to handle issues. Sharing the problem also helps in growth. This workshop will also aid in removing ignorance and help institutions improve their quality, which is an important benchmark.”

On SRMIST conducting this workshop, he said, “It is one of the first institutions to gets A++. Only a handful of universities have this status under the present NAAC system. So this expertise that we have can help other institutions apply for certification.”

He emphasised on the importance of active learning laboratory, foreign languages, faculty exchange programmes and so on that enabled SRM Institute of Science and Technology in becoming a top-rated ranking university.

Iran attacked Iraqi bases housing US soldiers in retaliation for an American drone attack that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 2, raising regional tensions.

The Pentagon and President Donald Trump had initially said no service members were injured or killed in the Iranian missile attack.

But last week, the Pentagon said 34 troops were injured in the attack. Earlier, the US Central Command said that 11 service members were treated for concussion symptoms from the attack. On Tuesday, it upped the figure of injured soldiers by 16 to 50 service personnel.

188,30-1-20,Colours of the world,"The contemporary art scene in the country has evolved and has an immense global presence. The 12th edition of India Art Fair is the right place to discover its reach. By Team Viva

Art that captures the imagination is often that which serves a witness to and a reflection of contemporary times. The populist sentiments against migration being voiced by many of the political parties has naturally found a reaction at the latest edition of the India Art Fair. There is a migration series — You Will Know Me, curated by Tara Sabharwal by The Art Alive Gallery. The works are about the artists who have migrated to the US and Germany. There are stories around artist like Vir Munshi on his return to his exiled home in Kashmir, Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam’s film on the experience of Tibetans in exile, Lavanya Mani’s dyed textiles on migrations, Sarojini Lewis’ prints on her grandfather’s migration during his service in British Army at the time of World War II and Tara Sabharwal’s collage depicting refugees on boats. Sunaina Anand, director of the gallery, says that they wanted to tell people about the migration stories through art.

But then this is not surprising. Going by the exceptional outing that Indian art and artists had at last year’s India Art Fair, the expectations are naturally high this year. The hopes centre certainly centre around not just bigger and better offerings for art connoisseurs but also diverse media, international art galleries expanding their collections across geographies and mediums and conversations across the art world taking up more space at exhibitions and galleries, feel experts.

The director of the fair, Jagdip Jagpal, shares that the 12th edition presents a strong line-up of leading artists — Maya Krishna Rao, national-award winning theatre performer and social activist; Lagos-based multimedia artist Jelili Atiku, whose works address political concerns for human rights and justice; multi-disciplinary artist Piyali Ghosh and Raisa Kabir, an interdisciplinary artist exploring the politics and cultural anxieties around globalised neo-colonial textile production and nationhood.

It also offers a platform for dialogues and discussions — Auditorium Talks, which will feature artist presentations, memorial lectures and conversations across the art world with critics, collectors and institutions across the globe. For instance, modernist Nilima Sheikh, Turner prize nominated filmmaker Naeem Mohaiemen and Magnum photographer Martin Parr.

Says Jagdip, “This year’s memorial lectures will be dedicated to life and works of modernist Ram Kumar and artist Tushar Joag. Other topics include discussions on South Asian Textile Art with curator Uthra Rajgopal from the Whitworth, Plans for Future Museums with Sophie Makariou and Kamani Sawhney from The Guimet and Museum of Art and Photography, amongst others.”

Outdoor art projects will showcase six large-scale installations by Indian and international artists. The metal sculpture by Anita Dube’s untitled 1994-2019 is a large-scale installation, taking the shape of a hollow cyborg to reflect her concerns with personal and societal loss in a technocratic age. Another in line will be Farah Mulla’s Crosstalk 2019, supported by Serendipity Art Foundation. She presents an interactive installation exploring the connections between the audience, space, sound and colour vibrations. There is Martin Parr’s Live Photography Project, 2020, Supported by Photoink, too. Magnum photographer Martin will capture people and present live photography at his booth.

Another in line is the Art Alive Gallery that focuses on promoting young and contemporary artist along with showcasing the new works of modern masters — Shakti Burman, Maite Delteil and Manu Parekh. In contemporary artists, the gallery will showcase new works of Suman Chandra, Purvai Rai, Portarasan Suban. Portarasan will present a ceramic sculpture depicting that the city that we live in has so much radiation. Purvai creates landscapes through textures of her textiles. Suman, with his Jharkhand drawings, will depict the misuse of land and how it has destroyed our environment. Roshini Vadehra, director of Vadehra Art Gallery, feels that the current scenario of art market is very challenging but the mood is positive. It is that time of the year when art is foremost on everyone’s mind and people are looking forward to new exhibitions. They are eager to know about the world of art.”

DAG’s offering at the fair, Masterpieces: 100 Years of Indian Art, includes the collection of modern art in one space. Ranging from a portrait of a jewelled dancer from the South to the delicate “wash style” associated with the Bengal School (Kshitindranath Majumdar) to the pathbreaking progressives (K K Ara, M F Husain, Krishen Khanna, S H Raza) and a phenomenal representation of the Madras Art Movement (K Sultan Ali), there are a lot of masterpieces on the display.

Ask Ashish Anand, MD and CEO of DAG, about the current art market? He says, “India’s art market is still young and, therefore, challenging, with a small base, insufficient infrastructure and lack of knowledge about art in general.” While he believes that art has to be accessible and understood by people before a viable market can exist, Jagdip feels that the South Asian art market has undergone a massive transformation since the downturn in 2009.

Through such fairs one can see the Indian art industry evolving at a global level. The international exchange of art and artists is giving a plethora of reasons to the the ones originating in India to leave their imprint. Ashish says, “In the recent years Indian art is making a global presence. Exhibitions and retrospective of Indian artists have opened outside, whether Nasreen Mohamedi and Mrinalini Mukherjee at the Met in New York, Nalini Malani in Paris or Bhupen Khakhar at Tate London, among others.”

Jagdip shares that the galleries are contributing to the development of the cultural scene within the South Asia art industry by laying a foundation for longer-term growth of the Indian art market. “We hear that galleries are making significant sales at all price points to both established and a new, younger generation of collectors, who will be important in shaping the art market of the future. A growth in non-commercial art market initiatives is creating new platforms for discussing, contextualising and promoting contemporary art.”

She believes that over the past decade the region has seen a massive increase in cultural activity with the establishment of new annual and biennial contemporary art initiatives such as the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the Colombo Art Biennale, the Lahore Biennale, Pune Biennial, the Serendipity Arts Festival and the Dhaka Art Summit. Private patronage for the arts in India and South Asia continues to grow, with increasing support from organisations such as Gujral Foundation and institutions such as Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, Kolkata Centre for Creativity and the forthcoming Museum of Art & Photography, Bangalore. “In conjunction with this, contemporary Indian and South Asian art and artists have been increasingly visible around the globe, generating even greater understanding of the region’s cultural diversity. There have been major exhibitions at the Guggenheim, The Met Breuer as well as high profile partnerships cross-continent between South Asia and Europe, such as the New North and South network which brought together 11 institutions in the UK and South Asia,” she adds.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/colours-of-the-world-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/colours-of-the-world.html

190,30-1-20,Superstarz meet Aces in 1st double header,"Badminton fans in Hyderabad are set for a spectacle as the first of the three double headers of the PBL 2020 is scheduled to take place today at the GMC Balayogi Sats Indoor Stadium. With the table toppers Chennai Superstarz taking on the third-placed Pune 7 Aces and the Mumbai Rockets meeting the North Eastern Warriors later in the day.

What makes the first clash a highly entertaining one is how robust both the teams have looked so far. With the Chennai team remaining unbeaten in three ties and Pune in two, one will taste its first defeat in the fifth edition.

The biggest attraction of this tie is the possible face-off between Chennai’s Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Pune’s Chirag Shetty, who partnered each other to a historic Thailand Open win last year. Having known each other’s games inside out, it will be interesting to see how they perform on the court as adversaries.

Satwik’s smashes and his dancing skills have been a major talking point of the league as the 19-year-old looks to be thoroughly enjoying his first stint with the yellow brigade. Shetty, meanwhile, has shown exceptional chemistry with world champion Hendra Setiawan and has gone a flawless 2-0 in Pune’s outings so far.

“It will be interesting to face Chirag on the opposite side of the net this time. Both of us know each other’s strengths and weaknesses very well and the one who holds his nerves under pressure, will win the match,” said Satwik on the impending clash.

Pune, on the other hand, has been bolstered by the arrival of the Commonwealth Games Gold medallists Chris and Gabrielle Adcock, who have shown tremendous fighting spirit to grind out wins for their team. 2019 Thailand Masters champion Loh Kean Yew has also been a valuable addition to the team as evident from his one win and a fighting loss in two outings.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/superstarz-meet-aces-in-1st-double-header.html

Atletico confirmed in a statement that Felix was injured during last weekend's goalless draw with Leganes in La Liga. “Joao Felix suffered a muscular injury in his right leg during the match against Leganes,” the statement read. “With the persistence of discomfort after a day of rest, the medical services have performed tests that detected the injury.

Fortuna sack ‘coach of the year’

Berlin: Fortuna Duesseldorf, who are bottom of the Bundesliga, sacked Friedhelm Funkel, just a day after he received a ‘coach of the year' award. On Tuesday, Fortuna tweeted “congratulations” to Funkel for receiving the accolade from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. However, the 66-year-old was sacked less than 24 hours later in the wake of Sunday's 3-0 loss to mid-table Leverkusen. “We have scored just 18 goals this season, statistically we are the weakest team in attack, and one of the weakest in defence, in the Bundesliga,” said sports director Lutz Pfannenstiel. “As a result, we no longer believe we can stay up if things stay as they are. We had to react.”

Pacer Jamieson in line for ODI debut

Christchurch: Fast bowler Kyle Jamieson is likely to make his debut for New Zealand during the three-match ODI series against India beginning in Hamilton on February 5. The 25-year-old had impressed during the One-day series against India A, taking six wickets. He was left out of New Zealand A's squad for the upcoming first unofficial Test at Christchurch, keeping in mind the upcoming series against India. New Zealand pace trio of Lockie Ferguson (right calf), Trent Boult (left hand) and Matt Henry (left thumb) are recovering from injuries and selector Gavin Larsen said Jamieson would be a cover for the ODI series.

193,30-1-20,Winning run ‘good sign’ ahead of WC,"Vice-captain Rohit Sharma on Wednesday emphasised on India’s recent winning streak in the shortest format, calling it a good sign heading into the T20 World Cup.

Rohit has forged two great opening partnerships for India with KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan. He said that the team management will decide which one comes to the fore later for the T20 World Cup.

“Whenever anyone’s got an opportunity, they have made it count. Shikhar as well, when he played the last series against Sri Lanka, he got a crucial 50 and then KL has been in good form over the last 7-8 T20s, he’s got probably 4 or 5 fifties,” Rohit said.

“So it’s a good sign for the team. That’s how we look at it. It’s important for most of our players to stay in good form and then what happens with the final XI and everything that will be only decided once all the players are available and the captain and management will sit together and identify who are the right guys to play that particular game. That’s how I look at it.

“For me, I want everyone to stay in good form, which has happened through the series. It is a great sign for us moving forward in this particular format at least. I wish the next two games too we don’t relax. We just want to keep the momentum going. It’s a good sign,” he opined.

India wouldn’t have won the third T20I without his two Super Over sixes but a modest Rohit credited Mohammed Shami for the victory.

Shami took two wickets in the final over to dismiss both Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor.

Rohit hit two sixes off the last two balls in the Super Over as India took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Both teams were tied on 179 runs each after fifties from Rohit and Williamson cancelled each other.

“I think Mohammed Shami’s last over was crucial, and actually that got us the victory. Not my two sixes. It was Shami’s over where we defended nine runs. It’s not easy with the dew,” Rohit said at the post-match press conference.

The India vice captain added, “The wicket settling in nicely and two set batsmen out there as well... One batsman was batting on 95 and their most experienced player was at the other end. Hats off to Shami to bowl that over and get us back into the game and into the Super Over.”

Last but not the least, Rohit opined that it was tough not to feel for New Zealand who have been on the wrong end of Super Over results for a while now.

“Kane Williamson played a solid innings. Of course their team will feel disappointed about how they could lose such a game. But we have to look at how we came back into the game.

“The last over that Shami bowled was very important for us and a positive sign because we could play a game like this in the World Cup. Then what do we do.

“We can’t lose hope. We will need to stay strong, even if you need defend five runs, you have to show a positive attitude, and we showed that here,” Rohit signed off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/winning-run----good-sign----ahead-of-wc.html
194,30-1-20,Thought at one stage we're gone: Kohli,"Virat Kohli said New Zealand deserved to win the third T20 after India prevailed in the Super Over to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.

Rohit Sharma smashed consecutive sixes in the final two balls of the Super Over to lead India to their maiden T20 series win in New Zealand following a nerve-wracking finish.

Needing 18 off six balls in the Super Over, India managed 10 off the first four balls. Rohit then smacked two sixes — one over mid-wicket and another over long off — to help India pull off a nail-biter.

“I thought we were gone at one stage. I told our coach that they deserved to win. The way Kane was batting, on 95. Feel bad for him, I know what it’s like to play those knocks when things don’t go your way. On the last ball, we had a discussion and we came to a conclusion that we had to hit the stumps,” the India captain said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Rohit turned out to be the star for India as he also top-scored with a 65-run knock to guide the visitors to 179 for five in their 20 overs.

New Zealand had it all under control with two runs needed off four balls and six wickets in hand to overhaul India’s total, but they faltered.

Mohammed Shami bowled a brilliant final over to tie the game and bring back memories of the 2019 World Cup final, which New Zealand agonisingly lost to England on boundary count.

New Zealand captain Kane Williamon did all he could, both in the run chase (95 off 48 balls) and the Super Over (11), but still it did not prove to be enough.

“Last ball we had a discussion, we had to hit the stumps because if you don’t, it’s a single anyway. Rohit was outstanding, both in our innings, and the last two balls as well. We knew if he got one hit, the bowler was under pressure immediately,” Kohli said.

With the series in pocket, the India skipper hinted that he will try out his bench strength in the remaining two games.

“It’s important to give a couple of the others some game time as well. We want to see how they do in these conditions, someone like Washington Sundar, or (Navdeep) Saini,” Kohli said.

Meanwhile, Rohit said there is no training possible for Super Over eventualities. In fact, the Indian team wasn’t aware of the Super Over and was made aware of the situation only after the match had finished in a tie.

“I don’t know if you can train for a Super Over. We’ve got a T20 specialist in Bumrah. For him, Super Over or whether he bowls in a T20 match is the same for him. There’s no training required there for him.

“But for the batters, you generally see who’s in good nick on that particular day and you assess and try and get that guy to bat. Probably if I hadn’t got the 60 today, probably it wouldn’t have been me going to face the Super Over. It could have been Shreyas Iyer or someone else.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/thought-at-one-stage-we-re-gone--kohli.html
195,30-1-20,Unadkat guides Saurashtra to close win,"Jaydev Unadkat picked up six wickets as Saurashtra held their nerve to win by four wickets against Baroda in a Group B Elite game on Wednesday.

Saurashtra had 200 to chase down and were on the mat at 113/6. But Aarpit Vasavada and Prerak Mankad got together and they took the bull by the horns, adding 87 to take Saurashtra over the line by four wickets.

Vasavada made 48 not out, Mankad finished with an unbeaten 36. The outright win strengthens this position as far as quarter-finals qualification goes. In six games, they have 25 points with three wins.

In Surat in a Group A game, Gujarat need 105 more to win against Vidarbha.

At 104/6, Vidarbha were down in the dumps, leading by just 36. Then, they were lifted by a seventh-wicket partnership of 82 between Akshay Wadkar and Aditya Sarvate to help swell their lead. Wadkar top scored with 87.

At close of play, Gujarat were tottering at 74/4 with Aditya Thakare picking up all four wickets for the defending champions.

fight for 3 points

Kolkata: Hosts Bengal and Delhi fought hard for three points as rain and bad light allowed less than an hour’s play on the penultimate day of their Group A match.

Middle-order batsman Jonty Sidhu was unbeaten on 49 after surviving an lbw off a no-ball, while Subodh Bhati looked edgy for his 25-ball seven as Delhi were 217 for 7, still trailing Bengal by 101 runs as only 9.3 overs were possible in the entire day.

Both the teams will look to get a first innings lead to secure three points, even as more rain is forecast for the final day.

Goa jump to top

Porvorim: Amit Verma led by example with a match-haul of nine wickets and an unbeaten century as Goa recorded an innings and 336-run win over Arunachal Pradesh inside three days in their Plate group fixture. The bonus point victory helped Goa (37 points) to the top spot in the Plate group, four points clear of Puducherry.

Nine for three after following-on, Arunachal Pradesh were bundled out for 170 in 49.2 overs with legspinner Verma returning with 6/71.

Rahul Dalal waged a lone battle with a 98-ball 68 but Verma cut short his resistance en route to his sixth five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.

Arunachal were shot out for a paltry 83 in reply to Goa’s mammoth 589/2 declared in the first innings.

Assam’s fightback

Cuttack: Openers Kunal Saikia (62 batting) and Subham Mandal (40 batting) led Assam’s fightback in the second innings with a century parntership after being forced to follow on by Odisha on the third day of Group C match.

Assam was bowled out for 238 in reply to Odisha’s first innings score of 436 with Ranjeet Mali (59) and opener Kunal Saikia (53) being the major contributors.

Resuming at the overnight score of 59 for 3, the visitors slipped to 147 for 7, losing the wickets of Rishav Das (37) and talented Riyan Parag (43).

Wicket-keeper Saikia and Mali, batting at No 9, launched a rearguard action and added 58 runs for the eighth wicket.

Asked to follow-on, Assam was provided a solid start by Mandal and Kunal Saikia, who was promoted to open, as they added 102 runs in 31 overs.

The visiting team still needs 96 runs to make Odisha bat again.

Meanwhile in Agartala, Maharashtra scored 103 for 2 in the second innings and needs 101 more runs to secure a victory against Tripura.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/unadkat-guides-saurashtra-to-close-win.html
196,30-1-20,NZ into U-19 WC semis,"Kristian Clarke came up with an all-round performance to help New Zealand beat West Indies by two wickets in a low-scoring affair and enter the semifinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Wednesday.

Clarke (4/25) first shone with the ball to restrict West India to 238 and then made an unbeaten 46 off 42 balls to take New Zealand home in the company of Joey Field, who was not out on 38.

Batting first, West Indies were bowled out in 47.5 overs with Kirk McKenzie top-scoring with a 104-ball 99.

Besides McKenzie, Kevlon Anderson (33) and Antonio Morris (31) also made useful contributions with the bat.

Right-arm pacer Clarke picked up four wickets for New Zealand, while left-arm spinner Jesse Tashkoff (2/35) and Field (2/52) shared four wickets between them.

Chasing the modest total, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals to find themselves in a spot of bother at 153 for 8 in 34.5 overs.

But Clarke and Field had other plans as they duo joined hands and shared unbeaten 86 runs for the ninth wicket to take New Zealand home, finishing at 239 for 8 in 49.4 overs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nz-into-u-19-wc-semis.html

199,30-1-20,Grieving Lakers return to training after Bryant's death,"The Los Angeles Lakers, reeling from the death of team icon Kobe Bryant, ""want to represent what Kobe was about"" as they press ahead with the NBA season, coach Frank Vogel said.

""We want to represent what Kobe was about more than anything,"" Vogel said on Wednesday.

""We've always wanted to make him proud, and that's not going to be any different here.""

Vogel, 46, spoke to reporters at the team's practice facility, where star players including LeBron James and Anthony Davis turned out but did not meet with the media.

Vogel said the club had a simple directive for players still coming to terms with Bryant's death in a helicopter crash on Sunday: ""You guys can speak when you're ready, and not before.""

But the timetable for returning to NBA action is set, with the Lakers to host the Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center arena on Friday.

That's less than a week since Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles.

The helicopter was headed to Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, where his daughter was set to play a basketball game.

When the team convened on Tuesday, Vogel said, ""We did some things that we thought would be therapeutically beneficial.

""We got in the gym for some team shooting work, no real practice working on anything in particular. I wanted our guys to come in mentally free but to get a sweat, touch the ball and be around each other.

""Then we had a lunch where we all just spent time together and grieved together.""

That lunch reportedly included sharing tales of Bryant, but Vogel found himself unable to offer any such reminiscences on Wednesday.

""There's some questions I'm just not ready to answer,"" said the coach, who had to ensure that every team member had been informed of Bryant's death.

""It's just strengthened what we've felt all year about our current group, which is we've become a family in a very short time.

""It's something that you talk about in the NBA with your teams, but this group in particular has really grown to love each other very rapidly and we understand the importance and the opportunity we have this year,"" Vogel said of a squad that takes a Western Conference-leading record of 36-10 into the game against Portland.

""This has just brought us closer together."" Ticket prices for Friday's game, where the Lakers are expected to honor Bryant's memory, have skyrocketed on re-sale site StubHub.Com, with seats priced at hundreds -- and in some cases thousands -- of dollars above their face value.

Meanwhile, Vanessa Bryant broke her silence on Wednesday, saying she is ""devastated"" and struggling to imagine life without her husband and daughter.

""We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe - the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna,"" Vanessa wrote in an Instagram post.

She said they are fighting to keep going and take comfort in the memories of the life they had together.

""Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless - and that's to say, immeasurable.

""I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever.""

Also, federal investigators completed their inspection of the crash site and handed it over to local authorities.

Police on horseback and all-terrain vehicles were brought in to secure the area, which was becoming a pilgrimage point for fans.

The Los Angeles County Coroner said Tuesday that four of the crash victims -- Bryant, pilot Ara Zobayan, baseball coach John Altobelli and Sarah Chester -- had been officially identified through fingerprints.

The coroner's office was still working to formally identify the five remaining passengers: Gianna Bryant, her Mamba Academy teammates Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester, Alyssa's mother Keri Altobelli and assistant Mamba Academy coach Christina Mauser.

A preliminary, fact-based report on the accident is expected in 10 days, according to Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

But a final report on the probable cause of the accident, described as a ""high energy impact crash,"" won't be issued for 12-18 months.

The helicopter was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder.

Nor did it have the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) that the NTSB had recommended be made mandatory on all helicopters with six or more passenger seats.

It's not certain that TAWS could have prevented the crash, with Homendy saying only that it ""could have helped to provide information to the pilot on what terrain the pilot was flying in.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/grieving-lakers-return-to-training-after-bryant-s-death-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/grieving-lakers-return-to-training-after-bryant-s-death.html
200,30-1-20,Thiem of change,"Dominic Thiem shocked top seed Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev ousted former champion Stan Wawrinka as tennis’s young pretenders stole a march on the old guard to reach the Australian Open semi-finals on Wednesday.

Austria’s Thiem, 26, beat Nadal 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-6 (8/6) — his first win in six attempts at Grand Slams, including two French Open finals — to end the 33-year-old’s bid to equal Roger Federer’s record 20 Major titles.

Earlier Zverev, 22, beat 2014 champion Wawrinka, 34, to go into a semi-final with Thiem, meaning that one of them will reach Sunday’s final against Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic, who have won 12 of the last 14 Australian Open titles.

Thiem had Nadal’s measure in the first two sets and he recovered from dropping the third to win the fourth-set tie-breaker, getting off the floor after falling to win one point and enjoying some luck from the net cord to set up the third and decisive match point.

“I was lucky in the right situation — the net cord was really on my side,” Thiem said. “But it’s necessary because he is one of the greatest of all time. You need some luck to beat him.”

Several young players have been knocking on the door of the Big Three of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic, and either Thiem or Zverev will get a chance to kick it open in Sunday’s final.

‘Almost too focused’

Germany’s Zverev rallied from a set down to halt three-time Major-winner Wawrinka 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 and reach his first Grand Slam semi-final.

Big things have been tipped for Zverev since he burst into the top 10 in 2017, but he said that until now he has been pushing himself too hard at the Majors.

“I was doing things in a way too professional way. I was not talking to anybody. I wasn’t going out with friends. I wasn’t having dinner. I was just really almost too focused.”

“I changed that a little bit this week... maybe this is how it should happen,” he added.

Wimbledon champion Simona Halep has also benefited from a more relaxed approach as she swept aside Anett Kontaveit 6-1, 6-1 to reach the semi-finals without dropping a set.

The Romanian fourth seed, who is spending time away from tennis between matches, said she was finally feeling comfortable on the biggest stage.

“I just feel more confident and I feel like I‘m able to do it,” said Halep, who is going after her third Major title. “It’s just a feeling that you don’t see this trophy as impossible anymore.”

Halep’s semi-final is against fellow two-time Slam-winner Garbine Muguruza, who continued her impressive return to form by beating Russian 30th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-3.

“I’m excited to play my first semi-final here,” said the unseeded former world number one, who won the 2016 French Open and 2017 Wimbledon.

“I’ve known her (Halep) for quite a long time so it’s going to be a tough match,” she added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/thiem-of-change.html
201,30-1-20,‘Roger is Roger’: Djokovic not underestimating ageless great,"Novak Djokovic is ever respectful of “great fighter” Roger Federer, but the Serb goes into their Australian Open semi-final as clear favourite after beating the Swiss maestro in every Grand Slam meeting since Wimbledon 2012.

The pair enjoy one of world sport’s greatest rivalries and will be facing each other today for a 50th time stretching back to 2006. Djokovic leads 26-23.

While Federer won their last clash at the ATP Finals in November, the Serb has a psychological edge at the Slams, beating him in all five showdowns since losing in the All England club semis eight years ago.

Sixteen-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic has also been in fine touch at Melbourne Park as he targets a record eighth title, dropping just one set en route to the last four.

In contrast, Federer has lived dangerously, two points from defeat against John Millman in the third round and incredibly saving seven match points in his quarter-final against Tennys Sandgren.

Djokovic pointed to Federer’s heroics in that epic as to why he can never be written off, despite being 38 and in the twilight of his career.

“What he did (against Sandgren) was amazing. He showed me he’s one of the best players of all time. I mean, he never gives up. When it matters the most, he’s focused and he plays his best tennis,” said the world number two.

“He’s a great fighter. Obviously I have lots of respect for him.”

Federer and Djokovic have dominated the Australian Open for years with the all-conquering pair sharing 12 of the last 14 titles.

Djokovic is the defending champion but Federer won in 2018.

“I think conditions suit us well here. Probably something to do with court speed, feeling comfortable down here,” said world number three Federer, who is gunning for a 21st Major crown.

“I mean, Novak also has gone on all these runs like I did for 10 years. He did the same for the last 10 years. It helps when you start the year off with a bang. We were able to do that quite a few times.”

Djokovic insists his record over Federer at the Slams since 2012 doesn’t tell the full story, pointing to their classic Wimbledon final last year.

In that memorable fight, the Swiss had two match points and was one shot from victory.

“It’s not like I’ve been dominating the match-ups. I’ve had success against him, in Grand Slams in particular. But Roger is Roger,” he said.

“You know that he’s always going to play on such a high level, regardless of the surface.

“He loves to play these kind of matches, big rivalries, semis, finals of Grand Slams. I mean, he’ll probably confirm that that’s probably the biggest reason why he’s still competing.”

Federer goes into today’s blockbuster on Rod Laver Arena after playing 14 gruelling sets in his last three matches, but insisted “I feel pretty good right now”.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---roger-is-roger-----djokovic-not-underestimating-ageless-great.html
202,30-1-20,"Ram joins Prajnesh, Nagal in singles main draw","Ramkumar Ramanathan was on Wednesday handed a wild card for the men’s singles main draw of the Tata Open Maharashtra and the organisers may grant a similar entry to veteran Leander Paes in the men’s doubles event.

India’s top two singles players, Prajnesh Gunnewaran and rising star Sumit Nagal have entered the main draw on their own.

For 25-year-old Ramkumar, who has sipped to 185 in the ranking ladder, will make his third appearance at India’s only ATP 250 event in Pune from February 3.

“There are three singles wild cards for the main draw of which we have announced one for Ramkumar. We are yet to decide on the other two wild-card entrants,” said Tournament Director.

“First time it has happened that two India players have made to the main draw of the tournament with a direct entry. We wish that an Asian or an Indian wins this tournament,” he added.

According to Sutar, legendary Paes has also made a request for a wild card entry into the men’s doubles event and it will be considered in a “positive” manner.

Surprisingly Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan, who won this tournament last year together, are not teaming up this year. Bopanna is also seeking a wild card entry with local lad Arjun Kadhe and so is Purav Raja with Ramkumar.

Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and N Balaji have also sought a wild card entries, making it tough for the organisers to take a call since there are only two wild card entries for the doubles event.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ram-joins-prajnesh--nagal-in-singles-main-draw.html
203,30-1-20,Neeraj qualifies for Olympics,"Star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.86m at the ACNE League meeting here, making an impressive return to the circuit after recovering from an elbow injury.

The 22-year-old Indian, who missed the entire 2019 season due to the injury, breached the Olympic qualification mark of 85m in his fourth attempt and secured the top place at the international event on Tuesday.

He threw the spear to 81.76m at the start and kept improving with every throw. He managed 82m in his second attempt and 82.57 in the third.

The throw of 87.86m is his second-best behind 88.06, achieved during his Gold medal winning show at 2018 Jakarta Asian Games.

“I am extremely pleased with the performance. Going into the competition, I did not try to put much pressure on myself and was keen to test myself out as it was my first meet in a long time,” Chopra said.

“The warm-up throws went very well, and even though my first three throws were around the 81-82m mark, I felt there were some flaws I could work on. This was a major target for me during my rehab and I’m happy to have qualified.”

Chopra said he will continue with his regular training in Potchefstroom with his coach and physio for few days.

“I will look to compete more in the coming months and am looking forward to more high quality competition at the Federation Cup and the Diamond League circuit.”

Another Indian in fray, Rohit Yadav threw 77.61m to finish second.

204,30-1-20,Sikandar’s 7 dismantle Lanka,"Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza picked up a career-best seven wickets as the hosts built a 175-run lead over Sri Lanka on the third day of the second Test here on Wednesday.

Off-spinner Raza claimed three wickets apiece in the morning and afternoon sessions to finish with figures of seven for 113 as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 293.

Raza’s haul was the second best for Zimbabwe in Test cricket, after former legbreak bowler Paul Strang’s eight for 109 against New Zealand at Bulawayo in 2000.

Rain again brought an early end to the day as Zimbabwe reached 62 for 1 at stumps in their second innings with Prince Masvaure unbeaten on 26.

Craig Ervine was the only Zimbabwe wicket to fall after tea when he edged behind off Vishwa Fernando for 13. Play will start early on Thursday at 07:35 GMT.

For the second Test in succession Zimbabwe were forced to make a concussion substitution after opening batsman Kevin Kasuza was again struck on the helmet while fielding at short leg.

Kasuza was diagnosed with mild concussion and will take no further part in the match. All-rounder Timycen Maruma has been drafted in to take his place.

Banerjee and Kejriwal have shared a cordial relationship over the years, with the Delhi CM coming out in support of his West Bengal counterpart during the general elections in 2019 and also during her face-off with the Centre over Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar.

Banerjee too on her part condemned attacks on Kejriwal during the general elections and lashed out at the BJP over the issue.

In the video, O' Brien is in Rajendra Nagar constituency in Central Delhi where he endorses the Kejriwal government saying it has delivered what it promised in terms of health, education, water, electricity and pollution.

""What they promised, they have delivered. The candidate here is Raghav Chadha, he is a boy from here, very enthusiastic. One of the youngest bright minds I have seen in Delhi.

206,30-1-20,BJP doesn't want to come to power in Delhi riding on hatred: Rajnath,"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said the BJP did not wish to come to power in Delhi riding on hatred and such a victory would be unacceptable to the party.

Addressing a rally in Adarsh Nagar, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also sought to assuage the concerns of Muslims over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and said bona fide citizens would remain unaffected under the new law.

""We do not want a victory that has been achieved because of hatred. Even if we win, we will not accept such a victory,"" he said.

Hitting out at the Opposition, Singh said there were some staging protests at Shaheen Bagh and instigating fear that Muslims will be stripped of their citizenship.

The BJP has been aggressively raising the pitch on Shaheen Bagh, an anti-CAA protest site in south Delhi.

Singh said Muslims should not suspect the government's integrity.

""I do not know whether you will vote for us or not, but I request you not to suspect our integrity. As the defence minister of this country, I assure you that every Muslim is a citizen of this country. Forget questioning his citizenship, I assure you that no one can even touch a Muslim citizen of this country,"" he added.

Singh said if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP had any malice, the government would not have come up with the ""sabka sath sabka vikas"" slogan.

He also accused the Opposition of playing the politics of hatred.

The plea was mentioned before Special Judge A K Jain who said it will be heard later in the day.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road.

208,30-1-20,PNB fraud case: Nirav Modi to appear for remand hearing in UK,"Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, is to be produced for a regular remand hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Thursday.

The 48-year-old, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, will appear via videolink from prison. His extradition trial is scheduled for five days starting May 11, with the case management hearings in the case set to begin soon.

Modi had made a last-ditch bail application in November last year with an ""unprecedented"" house arrest guarantee, akin to those imposed on terrorist suspects, as well as citing mental health issues from being behind bars at Wandsworth since his arrest in March 2019.

But the bail plea was turned down by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot over continued fears of witness intimidation and failure to surrender before the court for his extradition trial this year.

The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents the Indian government in the extradition proceedings, said there is no further prospect of an appeal for bail in a higher court as the UK High Court had already turned down Modi's plea earlier last year.

Modi is meanwhile expected to appear for ""call-over"" hearings every 28 days at Westminster Magistrates' Court until the case management hearings for his extradition trial kick in.

The diamond merchant denies the charges of fraud and money laundering and his defence team, led by barrister Hugo Keith, has claimed that the Indian government has wrongly “blackened” Modi's name as a “world-class schemer”.

As part of the change in circumstances required for a fresh bail application, Modi's lawyers had offered to double the bail bond security offered to the court, from the previous GBP 2 million to GBP 4 million.

They had also informed the court of attacks on their client from fellow inmates at one of England's most overcrowded prisons.

Modi has been behind bars at Wandsworth since his arrest on March 19 on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges brought by the Indian government.

During subsequent hearings, the UK court has been told that Modi was the ""principal beneficiary"" of the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs) as part of a conspiracy to defraud PNB and then laundering the proceeds of crime.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pnb-fraud-case--nirav-modi-to-appear-for-remand-hearing-in-uk-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/pnb-fraud-case--nirav-modi-to-appear-for-remand-hearing-in-uk.html

Gandhi, at an anti-CAA rally here, launched a scathing attack on Modi and said he was making Indians to prove that they are Indians.

Addressing participants at ""Save the Constitution"" march at Kalpetta in Wayanad, his Lok Sabha constituency on Martyr's Day, Gandhi said there was no difference between Godse and Modi.

""Today, an ignorant man is trying to challenge Gandhi's ideology. He is creating an atmosphere of hatred. The ideology is same. Nathuram Godse and Narendra Modi, they believe in the same ideology. There is no difference except that Modi does not have the guts to say he believes in the ideology of Godse,"" the Wayanad MP said.

Attacking the Prime Minister on the new Citizenship Law, Gandhi questioned Modi and asked who was he to ask Indians to prove that they were Indians.

""Indians are being made to prove that they are Indians. Who is Narendra Modi to decide who is an Indian. Who gave Modi the licence to ask for my Indianness? I know I am an Indian and I don't have to prove it to anyone. Likewise, 1.4 billion Indians do not have to prove that they are Indians,"" he said.

212,30-1-20,Super Overs aren’t our friends: Kane,"Disappointed Kiwi captain says it's just a shame that we couldn't get past the line

“Super Overs aren’t really New Zealand’s friend,” skipper Kane Williamson said after a heart-breaking loss in the thrilling third game.

India defeated The Back Caps via Super Over to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. Rohit Sharma smashed consecutive sixes in the final two balls of the eliminator to lead the visitors to their maiden T20 series win in New Zealand.

The defeat brought back memories of the 2019 World Cup final, which New Zealand agonisingly lost to England on boundary count.

“Super Overs aren’t really our friends. To be honest we would have liked to get across the line earlier and not in the Super Over. It’s just a shame that we couldn’t get past the line,” said a disappointed Williamson at the post-match press conference.

“It is pretty disappointing to be on the wrong side of the result after doing a lot of hard work. (But) There was a lot of improvement after the first two games.

“If we reflect on the match, then it was a brilliant game. India had a good total on that surface and they did well with the ball because it was taking some turn as well. The guys fought back nicely after the start India got with the bat. And we were able to build partnerships and take the game deep,” he added.

Asked about yet another disappointing outing in the Super Over, the New Zealand skipper said: “In my opinion we shouldn’t have them (jokingly). Look it is what it is. It’s good fun. We had a full house at midnight, which is really cool. It’s good entertainment.

“I am probably not the person to ask as we came second in the Super Over tonight like a few other times. So it was not ideal but people have enjoyed that, and that’s fine.”

Williamon did all he could, both in the run chase (95 off 48 balls) and the Super Over (11), but still it did not prove to be enough.

Williamson was especially harsh on Jasprit Bumrah (0/45), who had an off day and then was expensive in the Super Over as well.

“You are just trying to do what is required for the team, as best you can, and there are a number of other contributions that are really important,” Williamson said.

“Starting on that surface was quite challenging. Everybody found so but once you got in then you try to get a bit of rhythm and the partnerships were the most positive thing of that run-chase. Overall it was a much better performance.”

Williamson, however, said he didn't have any specific plan against Bumrah.

“No, not really targeting him (Bumrah), it was just that we need 10s (per over). There are big challenges that we have seen in every game but I guess you are trying to do the best and keep up with the asking rate.”

“Maybe ask AB (de Villiers) or other superstars (how to play Bumrah), but for me I was just trying to look for areas on that surface. It doesn’t always come off but it was nice that we were able to get so close without quite getting across the line,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/super-overs-aren---t-our-friends--kane-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/super-overs-aren---t-our-friends--kane.html
213,30-1-20,Barty comforted by baby after shock Australian Open loss,"World number one Ashleigh Barty said her 12-week-old niece helped put her Australian Open semi-final defeat into perspective on Thursday as she delivered her post-match press conference holding the baby girl.

American 14th seed Sofia Kenin silenced Rod Laver Arena with a surprise 7-6 (8/6), 7-5 win over the home favourite in fierce Melbourne heat.

It ended Australian hopes of a first homegrown women's champion since Chris O'Neil in 1978, and Barty's bid to win her home Grand Slam for the first time.

And in an unexpected twist, the 23-year-old sat down in front of the world's media with baby Olivia cooing on her lap.

""This is what life is all about, it's amazing,"" said the Australian, gazing fondly down at the baby.

""Perspective is a beautiful thing. Life is a beautiful thing.

""She brought a smile to my face as soon as I came off the court. I got to give her a hug.""

Barty, who had been the strong favourite having defeated the 21-year-old Kenin in four of their five previous meetings, said that it was ""a match where I didn't feel super-comfortable"".

""I felt like my first plan wasn't working. I couldn't execute the way that I wanted. I tried to go to B and C,"" said the down-to-earth Australian, who will remain world number one despite losing.

""I think I had to dig and find a way. I mean, I'm two points away from winning that in straight sets, which is disappointing.""

Barty, who held set points in each set, conceded that she ""didn't play the biggest points well enough to be able to win"".

The French Open champion hopes to rectify that next time.

""I've learnt so much over the last month, I've learnt from all of the experiences that I've kind of been thrown into,"" she said, baby Olivia sitting contentedly in front of the cameras.

""I've loved every minute and I won't wait a year to put those into practice.

214,30-1-20,Time running out for 'GOAT' Federer as rivals close in,"Roger Federer's fans call him the Greatest Of All Time but after defeat at the Australian Open his hold on the men's record for career Grand Slam titles is growing ever weaker.

When Federer walked gingerly off Rod Laver Arena on Thursday after his injury-hit semi-final loss to Novak Djokovic, he will have been acutely aware that at 38 time is running out to add to his 20 Major wins.

Rafael Nadal, 33, stands on 19 Grand Slam titles and is the favourite to reach 20 at the French Open in May-June -- a tournament where he has only lost three times.

Djokovic, 32, has 16 Major trophies and is going for an eighth Australian Open title on Sunday. He shows no signs of slowing down after winning four Grand Slams in the past two years.

Federer will be closing on his 39th birthday by the time Roland Garros and Wimbledon roll around -- nearly two years older than Ken Rosewall when he became the oldest Grand Slam champion at 37 at the 1972 Australian Open.

Federer's last Grand Slam title came at the Australian Open two years ago.

So while Federer may still wield the sweetest backhand in the game, in the fullness of time it could be his elegant style rather than his record that sets him apart from his peers.

'Huge respect'

However, the Swiss is not going without a fight and as the years advance, his resilience, if anything, is increasing.

Federer pulled off two breathtaking escapes in the earlier rounds in Melbourne. He was two points from defeat to John Millman and saved seven match points against Tennys Sandgren in the quarter-finals.

After a groin strain in the Sandgren match, rumours swirled that Federer may not even take the court against Djokovic. He admitted that by playing he was risking the first retirement in his 1,513-match career.

""Today was horrible, to go through what I did,"" Federer grimaced after Djokovic's 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-3 win.

""Nice entrance, nice send-off, and in between is one to forget because you know you have a three percent chance to win.""

Djokovic is well aware of Federer's endurance after their five-hour epic of a Wimbledon final last year when the Swiss held two match points before going down in a marathon fifth set.

""It's an amazing fact that he has never retired from a match, not a single match, throughout his career. Huge respect for that,"" said Djokovic.

Federer is not about to retire from the sport either, although he knows injuries could make the decision for him.

""You never know what the future holds. But especially my age, you don't know,"" he said, when asked if he would be back in Melbourne next year.

""I'm confident. I'm happy how I'm feeling, to be honest. I got through a good, nice training block. No plans to retire.""

Urging him on is the feeling that even as he edges towards 40, he is still capable of wringing more Grand Slam titles out of his ageing body.

""Yes, I do believe that,"" he said, when asked if he still thought he could win multiple Majors.

""I think by having the year that I had last year, also with what I have in my game, how I'm playing, I do feel that, yeah.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/time-running-out-for--goat--federer-as-rivals-close-in-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/time-running-out-for--goat--federer-as-rivals-close-in.html

217,30-1-20,No voting on EU resolution on CAA on Thursday: Govt sources,"The European Parliament has decided not to conduct a vote on Thursday on a resolution against India's new citizenship law, a move seen as an attempt to not jeopardise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Brussels in March for a bilateral summit with the 28-member block.

The European Parliament on Wednesday decided to take up the voting against the Citizenship Amendment Act during its new session beginning March 2.

Government sources called the deferment of the voting a diplomatic victory, adding that friends of India prevailed over the friends of Pakistan in the European Parliament on Wednesday.

India reached out to almost all countries of the powerful block, trying to persuade them against going ahead with the resolution against the CAA.

Sources said the European lawmakers agreed to delay the voting to get a direct perspective from about the CAA from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who is scheduled to visit Brussels to prepare the ground for Modi's visit in mid-March.

The EU lawmakers also wanted to wait for judicial review of the contentious law by India's Supreme Court.

Diplomatic sources said the vote on the resolution against the CAA may take place between March 30 and 31, but a debate on it will go on as scheduled later on Wednesday.

Six political groups of members of the European Parliament had moved a joint resolution against India's citizenship law, calling it discriminatory.

""Strenuous efforts of outgoing British MEP (Member of European Parliament) Shaffaq Mohammad to have a resolution passed by the European Parliament against India on the penultimate day before Brexit were defeated,"" a source said.

The government has been maintaining that the CAA is a matter internal to India and it was adopted following a due process through democratic means.

The sources said they expect that their perspectives in this matter will be understood by all objective and fair-minded MEPs.

A move by a group of MEPs to totally reject the resolution against the CAA was thwarted at the EU Parliament.

The new law passed by Parliament last month offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

India has been witnessing massive protests against the new law, with opposition parties, civil rights groups and activists saying granting citizenship based on religion is against the Constitution's foundational principle.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-voting-on-eu-resolution-on-caa-on-thursday--govt-sources-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/no-voting-on-eu-resolution-on-caa-on-thursday--govt-sources.html

220,30-1-20,"Take dip in Yamuna with your shirt off, Shah dares Kejriwal","You will realise condition of water of river Yamuna: HM

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday amped up his attack on Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal challenging him to take his shirt off and take a dip in the Yamuna, mentioning the river continues to be in a state of neglect.

“The AAP had said they will clean the water of river Yamuna. Kejriwalji, today I challenge you to take off your shirt and take a dip in river Yamuna. You will realise the condition of the water of river Yamuna,” said Shah in a nukkad meeting in Najafgarh Assembly constituency.

Pertinently, ahead of the announcement of the Union Budget for the financial year 2020-21, Kejriwal wrote to the Union Minister to increase Center’s share for Delhi citing various issues pertaining to air and Yamuna pollution, sanitation and other development works.

Taking a jibe at Kejriwal for his promise to make Delhi’s road like Europe, Shah said he (Kejriwal) cannot figure out potholes on Delhi’s roads.

Also, Shah attacked the Kejriwal Government for its statement related to transforming Delhi’s infrastructure to international standards while addressing meeting in support for Najafgarh BJP’s candidate Ajit Khadhari.

Once again, deviating masses from Delhi’s issue, Shah spoke about Citizen (Amendment) Act (CAA) and Shaheen Bagh protesters. “Delhi people will decide by their vote whether they are with the anti-CAA protesters or with the Government which sends anti-national elements to jail,” Shah said.

Hitting out at the AAP, the senior BJP leader said the Kejriwal Government had promised to open 1,000 new schools in Delhi but failed to do so, he (Kejriwal) is running schools in such buildings which have been marked for demolition. “The AAP has put the lives of innocent children in danger,” Shah said while mentioning about other promises made by the AAP during 2015 Assembly elections like induction of DTC buses and assurance of pukka house for slum dwellers.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/take-dip-in-yamuna-with-your-shirt-off--shah-dares-kejriwal-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/take-dip-in-yamuna-with-your-shirt-off--shah-dares-kejriwal.html
221,30-1-20,Most flights to virus-hit China suspended,"India issues fresh advisory, asks people not to travel to China

As the lethal coronavirus continues to spread far and wide claiming 132 lives and infecting over 6,000 others in China alone, India on Wednesday issued a fresh advisory asking people not to undertake “unnecessary” travel to the neighbouring country. Also, its only two passenger carriers that fly to China — IndiGo and Air India — announced suspension of most of their flights to the country as a precautionary measure.

Airlines based in Asia, North America and Europe have already announced restricted operations to the region in view of the outbreak of the virus.

India has requested China for permission to operate two flights to bring back its nationals from Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, the Ministry of External Affairs said.

The Indian Embassy in Beijing on Wednesday circulated registration forms and consent notes for the Indians in Wuhan and Hubei province to be filled by them.

While IndiGo airlines said on Wednesday that due to coronavirus outbreak in China, it has decided to suspend its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route from February 1 and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from February 1 to 20. Air India spokesperson said the national carrier is suspending its flights on Delhi-Shanghai route from January 31 to February 14.

In India, many people are under observation in hospitals for suspected coronavirus infection, including in Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha and the national Capital. The Union Health Ministry has asked people to use 24x7 helpline (011-23978046) for queries related to respiratory infection.

Efforts have been stepped up to handle any emergency situation in case arising due to the mysterious disease. Thermal screening has been expanded to 20 airports from seven, along with addition of 10 new laboratories to test the virus, as a precautionary measure.

The Government has activated four new laboratories —the Indian Council of Medical Research’s viral research and diagnostics lab network — at Alleppey, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai for testing samples. So far, Pune’s National Institute of Virology was conducting the tests. A total of 20 samples have so far been tested by NIV Pune and all were found negative.

Meanwhile, Mumbai Port Trust has been instructed not to give shore permit to any vessel coming from China.

The Civil Aviation Ministry has been told to ask airlines to make in-flight announcement and distribute “health cards” to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China. The Home Ministry has to ensure integrated check posts initiate screening of visitors across Nepal border.

People returning to the country after visiting China are being regularly screened for the deadly virus at airports across the country.

223,30-1-20,"EC strips Anurag, Parvesh of star status for hate speech","But two BJP leaders can still campaign in Delhi polls

Citing provocative languages used by Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and Delhi BJP MP Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma in campaign rallies, the Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday ordered the BJP to drop both of them from the list of star campaigners for the Assembly elections in Delhi.

Thakur and Verma can still canvass for the BJP but they will have to bear the campaign expenditures.

“The EC has ordered the removal of Thakur and Verma from the list of star campaigners of the BJP for the general elections to the Legislative Assembly of the NCT of Delhi with immediate effect and until further orders,” an EC note stated. The final order will be announced by the poll panel after examining their replies.

The comments by Thakur and Verma are part of a string of controversial comments and communally divisive rhetoric used in the Delhi election campaign.

The AAP leaders have accused that the BJP of trying to polarise the voters of a particular community because it cannot effectively counter ‘free electricity, free water, free travelling and corruption free governance of Arvind Kejriwal” in the Assembly polls.

When asked, a senior functionary of the poll panel said “they will not get any financial concessions that star campaigners get. It is just a financial penalty. The cost of a star campaigner’s canvassing is not added into the expenditure limit set for each candidate; rather the expenses are considered under the net expenditure done on campaigning by a political party. While political parties have no limit on the amount they can spend for electioneering, candidates can spend a maximum of Rs 28 lakh for campaigning in Delhi Assembly polls,” he said.

During an election rally in Delhi’s Rithala, Thakur criticised the section of people opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act, and egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan - “desh ke gaddaron ko....” (traitors should be shot down) - equating anti-CAA protesters with anti-national elements.

Likewise, west Delhi MP Verma also came under the EC’s scanner after he said the Kashmiri Pandit exodus from Kashmir could happen in Delhi, warning that lakhs of anti-CAA protesters in Shaheen Bagh could enter people’s homes to “kill and rape women”. Verma had stoked a storm by claiming at Bagpat in UP that “Muslims had never cast their vote for the BJP as they perceive it as a ‘patriotic’ party” and that “all terrorists are Muslims”.

The poll panel had taken cognisance of allegations of poll code violation against Thakur and Verma and issued the duo a show-cause notice, saying prima facie the remarks had the “potential of disturbing communal harmony”. The EC has also issued show cause notice to Verma for his remarks and sought reply by January 30 on Wednesday.

In the show-cause notice, the EC referred to section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, dealing with attempts to promote enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens on the grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language. It said the ruling BJP leader also made “certain other objectionable statements” at the meeting.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ec-strips-anurag--parvesh-of-star-status-for-hate-speech-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/ec-strips-anurag--parvesh-of-star-status-for-hate-speech.html
224,30-1-20,Rohit scripts India’s win in Super Over,"Rohit Sharma smashed consecutive sixes in the final two balls of the thrilling Super Over, leading India to their maiden T20 series win in New Zealand following a nerve-wracking finish in the third match here on Wednesday.

Needing 18 off six balls in the Super Over, India had managed just 10 off the first four balls. Then, Sharma smacked two big hits, one over mid-wicket and the other over long off, to help India pull off a nail-biter.

Before the Super Over, New Zealand had it all under control with two runs needed off four balls and six wickets in hand to overhaul India’s 179 for five. However, the hosts threw it away from a comfortable position as Mohammad Shami bowled a brilliant death over to tie the game, stretching it to a Super Over, bringing back memories of the 2019 World Cup final which New Zealand had agonisingly lost to England on boundary count. Kane Williamon did all he could, both in the run chase (95 off 48 balls) and the Super Over (11), but it did not prove to be enough to get his team over the line in a must-win game.

It was Williamson’s highest T20 score as the Black Caps scored 179-6 (20 overs) in reply to India’s 179-5 (20 overs). Rohit’s 65 off 40 balls had propelled the visitors after they were put into bat. India’s first T20 series in New Zealand came after a 1-2 loss to the Black Caps almost 12 months ago. On Wednesday, India’s fielding effort was poor, including an easy drop from Ravindra Jadeja with Jasprit Bumrah (0-45) proving expensive on the night.

Bumrah went for 11 runs in the penultimate over. Shami (2-32) conceded a six off the first ball of the 20th but then removed both Williamson and bowled Ross Taylor (17 off 10 balls) in the next five balls to snatch a tie.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rohit-scripts-india---s-win-in-super-over-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rohit-scripts-india---s-win-in-super-over.html

226,30-1-20,Eat fermented soy products like Natto and live longer,"A higher intake of fermented soy products, such as tofu, miso and natto, is associated with lower risk of an early death, say researchers.

In Asian countries, especially Japan, several types of soy products are widely consumed, such as natto (soybeans fermented with Bacillus subtilis), miso (soybeans fermented with Aspergillus oryzae), and tofu (soybean curd).

""In this large prospective study conducted in Japan with a high rate of soy consumption, no significant association was found between intake of total soy products and all-cause mortality,"" said study researchers from National Cancer Centre in Japan.

""In contrast, a higher intake of fermented soy products (natto and miso) was associated with a lower risk of mortality,"" they added.

For the findings, published in the journal The BMJ, researchers set out to investigate the association between several types of soy products and death from any cause (""all-cause mortality"") and from cancer, total cardiovascular disease (heart disease and cerebrovascular disease), respiratory disease, and injury.

They base their findings on 42,750 men and 50,165 women aged 45-74 years who were taking part in a study based in 11 of Japan's public health centre areas.

According to the study, participants filled in detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits, lifestyle, and health status.

Deaths were identified from residential registries and death certificates over a follow-up period of nearly 15 years, the researchers said.

The study found that a higher intake of fermented soy (natto and miso) was associated with a significantly lower (10 per cent) risk of all-cause mortality, but total soy product intake was not associated with all-cause mortality.

Men and women who ate natto also had a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality than those who did not eat natto, but there was no association between soy intake and cancer-related mortality.

These results persisted even after further adjusting for intake of vegetables, which was higher among those consuming larger portions of natto, the research said.

According to the researchers, fermented soy products are richer in fibre, potassium and bioactive components than their non-fermented counterparts, which may help to explain their associations

However, this is an observational study so can't establish cause, and the researchers cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed risk may be due to other unmeasured factors.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/eat-fermented-soy-products-like-natto-and-live-longer-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/eat-fermented-soy-products-like-natto-and-live-longer.html

233,30-1-20,"JD(U) expels Kishor, Pavan","Both leaders congratulate Bihar CM for being successful in his power pursuits

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday expelled two senior most leaders — Prashant Kishor and Pavan K Varma — from the Janata Dal (United) for accusing him of committing “ideological betrayal” by supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and aligning with the BJP for the Delhi Assembly elections.

Kumar took the extreme step after Kishor on Tuesday launched a vehement attack on him tweeting, “Nitish what a fall for you to lie about how and why you made me join JD(U)!! Poor attempt on your part to try and make my colour same as yours!” He was responding to Kumar’s claim that he inducted Kishor on Amit Shah suggestion.

Though the immediate cause for the expulsion of Kishor and Varma is seen as their objection to CAA and Delhi poll truck with the BJP, observers point to Kumar’s anger over their making public a series of behind-the-curtain political moves as the main reason for showing them doors.

The relation between Kishor and Kumar were apparently also strained ever sine the former took the responsibility of managing the Assembly election of Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. The TMC and the BJP share a bitter relation and it was becoming untenable for the JD(U) leadership to justify how could one of their senior leaders be managing the poll campaign of Mamata.

In a statement, party general secretary KC Tyagi said, “As both the party leaders have been broken the party discipline, they are being expelled from the primary membership of the party.”

Kishor had joined the JD(U) in September 2018. He was also made the vice president of the party. While Varma is a former Rajya Sabha member of the JD(U).

Soon after their expulsion from the JD(U), both the dissenting leaders took a dig at Kumar by “congratulating” him for being successful in his power pursuits by compromising “ideology”. Kishor offered Kumar his best wishes to “retain” the chief ministership of Bihar.

In a tweet minutes after the JD(U) suspended Kishor, he said, “Thank you Nitish. My best wishes to you to retain the chair of Chief Minister of Bihar. God bless you.” Varma, after being expelled from the JD(U), too gave left-handed complements to Kumar. “I congratulate Nitishji for removing all the obstacles and impediments from his path in his pursuit of short term political gain. This pursuit is clearly now completely without any

fidelity or loyalty to ideology”, he said.

The election strategist had a couple of days ago sought to embarrass Sushil Modi by sharing an old video clip wherein, as the then leader of Opposition, he had spoken harshly about the Chief Minister.

Kishor had raked up the episode by way of a riposte to Sushil, who had indirectly chided him for troubling Kumar by repeatedly violating his own party’s line.

Both Kishor and Varma came from apolitical background. Kishor made a name as a professional poll strategist after his involvement in Narendra Modi’s successful campaign as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

He was also seen as a key force in sealing Kumar’s alliance with the RJD in 2015 and then with the BJP

in 2017 before joining the JD(U) and being made its vice president.

Varma, a former diplomat, was sent to Rajya Sabha by the party as Kumar felt that he could be useful as an articulate voice in the national Capital.

Their expulsion from the party will be seen as a victory for its seasoned hands like Lalan Singh and RCP Singh who had not taken kindly to the rise of Kishor in the party and believed that his and Varma’s outspoken views ill- served its interests.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/jd-u--expels-kishor--pavan-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/jd-u--expels-kishor--pavan.html
234,30-1-20,It's time Bollywood boycott Ganesh Acharya: Tanushree Dutta,"A day after a woman filed a complaint against Ganesh Acharya alleging that he had forced her to watch pornography, actor Tanushree Dutta said Bollywood should boycott the choreographer.

A 33-year-old woman, an assistant choreographer, has written to the National Commission for Women (NCW) alleging that Acharya used to make her watch porn videos whenever she visited his office in suburban Andheri.

She also alleged that Acharya and two women assaulted her during a function of the Indian Film and Television Choreographers Association (IFTCA) held in suburban Andheri on Sunday. A complaint has been filed in this regard with Amboli police.

""It's time Bollywood and the other Indian film industries boycott choreographer Ganesh Acharya completely. Hiding behind the male superstars who work with this despicable man, he has been abusing his power and position to harass, bully and take advantage of vulnerable young newcomers to the industry,"" Dutta said in a statement here.

Dutta had alleged that her co-star Nana Patekar harassed and misbehaved with her while shooting for a song for their 2008 film ""Horn Ok Pleasss"", and Acharya, who was the choreographer, introduced new steps which were ""intimate"".

Recalling the trauma she faced, Tanushree said even though Acharya was party to all the harassment she faced on the 'Horn ok Pleasss"" set, he went on to spoil her name and reputation.

""Nobody had any regard for me and how much I had suffered psychologically and financially because of the turmoil I went though due to these people. I left the industry because I was so scared and hurt over the atrocious treatment meted out to me on 'Horn ok Pleasss' set.

""I had worked very sincerely to get to where I got in life and so went in shock for many years, over the whole episode on that set almost 12 years ago, that led to an attack on my car. They didn't just break my car, they broke my spirit that day,"" Dutta said, in reference to the attack on her car in 2008.

She expressed her displeasure over how ""leading men"" and ""heroes"" of Bollywood continued working with Acharya, whose most recent work includes ""Simmba"", ""Zero"", ""Sanju"" among others.

""Even after all the information of fraud, non payment of dues, sexual harassment of dancers, bullying and intimidation and even physical abuse of dancers is coming out about Ganesh Acharya in the media, if the actors, directors and producers still work with him, it would mean that they themselves are engaging in such acts also.

""It's a warning to the film industry to stay the hell away from Ganesh Acharya otherwise your own reputation will be joined to his character. I'm sure many more girls and boys will come out about his misbehaviour and shady business, opening floodgates in the future,"" she added.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/it-s-time-bollywood-boycott-ganesh-acharya--tanushree-dutta-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/it-s-time-bollywood-boycott-ganesh-acharya--tanushree-dutta.html

Ratna said Divyaang, whom she mentored during his days in theatre, approached her for the part.

""Some months ago a young actor (Divyang) came to me with a script. Now, actors making movies can be tricky so I was a bit cautious as I began reading but was charmed and moved and thoroughly entertained by the end.

""Working with Boman and Ranveer has been artistically satisfying, but the best part for me is the way a young, enthusiastic team is working to make this film the way it should be made.

239,30-1-20,Facebook to pay $550mn over its facial recognition technology,"Facebook has agreed to pay $550 million to settle a 2015 class-action privacy lawsuit against its use of facial recognition technology.

The lawsuit in the US state of Illinois claimed that Facebook's 'Tag Suggestions' tool, which scans a user's face in photos and offers suggestions about who that person might be, stored biometric data without user consent, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, CNET reported on Thursday.

A federal judge ruled in favour of making the facial recognition case a class action lawsuit in 2018. Facebook appealed against the ruling but lost the appeal in a 3-0 court decision in August last year.

Facebook's $550 million settlement will be paid out to eligible Illinois users and to cover the plaintiffs' legal fees, according to The New York Times.

The $550 million amount negotiated is ""the largest all-cash privacy class action settlement to date,"" according to law firm Edelson PC, one of three that represented the plaintiffs in the suit.

""Biometrics is one of the two primary battlegrounds, along with geolocation, that will define our privacy rights for the next generation,"" Edelson PC founder and CEO Jay Edelson said in a press release.

Illinois Facebook users from mid-2011 to mid-2015 may expect as much as $200 each, depending on several factors.

This is the second major settlement from Facebook in six months, after a huge $5 billion settlement with the US FTC last year over users' privacy violations.

""We are proud of the strong team we had in place that had the resolve to fight this critically important case over the last five years. We hope and expect that other companies will follow Facebook's lead and pay significant attention to the importance of our biometric information,"" said Edelson.

240,30-1-20,Huawei races to replace Google apps for next smartphone,"If you can make smartphone apps, Chinese tech giant Huawei wants you.

The No. 2 global smartphone brand is struggling to hold onto its market after Washington accused Huawei of being a security risk and blocked access to U.S. Components and technology.

That includes YouTube and other popular Google “core apps” customers expect on new phones. They will be missing from the global rollout of Huawei's next model, the P40, due out in March, replaced by its own music, payment and other apps.

Huawei Technologies Ltd., along with every other smartphone brand except Apple Inc., relies on Google's Android operating system. So it's scouring the world for replacements. At events for developers from New Delhi to Warsaw to Sao Paulo, Huawei is promising cash rewards if they meet a deadline Friday to get apps onto its online store.

The company says it will invest $1.5 billion in app development. It faces an expensive, uphill struggle to create alternatives to the Google-centered world of music, navigation and other apps, according to industry experts. Others including Nokia and Microsoft have tried and failed to create their own mobile ecosystems.

Creating “diverse apps” is a “really challenging task to Huawei,” said chairman Guo Ping in videotaped comments released by the company.

Huawei, also the world's biggest maker of switching gear for phone networks, rejects U.S. Accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using phony security claims to hurt a commercial rival.

The Trump administration also is pressing European and other allies to exclude Huawei switching gear from next-generation telecom networks.

The conflict has fed fears technology industries might split into Chinese, U.S. And other spheres with incompatible products.

Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has said it wants to stay in a unified global industry and work with Google and other U.S. Partners.

The Android system is open-source, meaning phone brands use it for free but most also pay Google for “core apps” and the software to support them.

Huawei can keep using Android but is blocked from buying those “core apps” for pre-installation. That threatens to cripple Huawei's ability to compete with market leader Samsung and other Android-based phones.

Consumers expect “well-known apps that their peers are using,” such as Google Maps, said Thomas Husson, a principal analyst for Forrester, in an email.

“It would require massive investment to convince developers to develop for a new eco-system and a lot of marketing efforts."" Huawei already sells phones without Google “core apps” in China, where the ruling Communist Party's internet filters block access to YouTube, the Google search engine and thousands of other foreign websites. Instead, Huawei phones come with Chinese search engine Baidu.Com, video service Youku.Com and other local apps.

But Huawei competes on a level playing field in China with competitors that face the same restrictions. In other foreign markets the others have the popular Google package.

For the P40, Huawei has signed an agreement for developers to use maps from a Dutch provider, TomTom. Details of other services have yet to be announced.

In response to questions, Huawei said executives would talk to reporters next month at the Mobile World Congress, the industry's biggest annual event.

The chief executive of Huawei's consumer unit, Richard Yu, told reporters in December the P40 would be launched in Paris in late March, using Android instead of Huawei's HarmonyOS operating system, which it unveiled last year.

HarmonyOS is based on code developed for other Huawei devices and could replace Android if needed. But the company wants to keep working with Google, which has spent more than a decade improving Android with input from Huawei and other companies.

Replacing Google apps is “a massive undertaking for any company,” said Dermot Daly, chief executive of Tapadoo, an Irish app developer that isn't working for Huawei.

Huawei Mobile Services offers some 45,000 apps. But that is barely 1.5% of the 3 million titles on Google Play Store, where most Android users get apps.

Huawei needs to replace Google code that supports video and other features, said Daly. Then it needs to persuade developers to adapt apps to run on Huawei's new code.

“They're not building from scratch, but they face a big technical hurdle,” said Daly. “Becoming a world-class software maker is a massive challenge.”

Nokia Corp. Took a similar approach with its first smartphone a decade ago but failed to attract enough apps for its system, said Daly. He said Microsoft Corp. Tried again after acquiring Nokia's mobile phone unit in 2013 but faced similar lack of developer interest.

Such difficulties highlight the dominance of U.S. App providers and the very gradual emergence of global alternatives.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/huawei-races-to-replace-google-apps-for-next-smartphone-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/huawei-races-to-replace-google-apps-for-next-smartphone.html

A number of global airlines, including Air India, British Airways, Lion Air and Indigo airlines on Wednesday suspended their flights to Chinese cities as Beijing struggled to contain the rapid spread of the virus.

India, the US, the UK and Germany have already issued travel advisories against travelling to China. Beijing too has been asking Chinese not to travel at home and abroad in view of the virus.

Air India suspended its flights on Delhi-Shanghai route from January 31 to February 14. IndiGo airlines also suspended its flights on the Bengaluru-Hong Kong route from February 1 and on the Delhi-Chengdu route from February 1 to 20.

Over 23,000 Indian students of which 21,000 are medical students are studying in China.

China has ramped up efforts to contain the virus. The country has extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.

244,30-1-20,Australia heatwave renews bushfire worries,"Australia was bracing for a heatwave to sweep across the country's fire-ravaged southeast in the coming days, with the forecast stoking fears the soaring temperatures could inflame bushfires.

Temperatures reached above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday in South Australia state, where dangerous fire weather warnings were issued in several bushfire-prone areas.

The heatwave is then expected to hit Melbourne and Canberra on Friday before parts of Sydney reach 45 degrees Celsius on the weekend.

Authorities say the searing heat, accompanied by dry winds, would bring severe bushfire conditions to parts of New South Wales and Victoria -- where more than 80 fires are still burning across the two states.

""We've had the benefit of some suppressed, benign conditions over the last few days. However, as we've heard, it's going to be hot and dry,"" Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp said, urging residents to be prepared for bushfires to flare.

""If you're gonna wait until you see the smoke or the fire at your doorstep, it's far too late. You've gotta get out early,"" he said.

Storms are forecast to follow the heatwave, bringing rain that could help dampen fires but also the potential for wild weather, including flash flooding.

Extreme weather has battered parts of Australia in recent weeks, bringing giant hail, floods and landslides.

The renewed fire threat came as worst-hit New South Wales announced an inquiry into the catastrophic bushfire season, which has left at least 32 people dead and devastated vast swathes of the country since September.

""The scale of these fires has been unprecedented and we must leave no stone unturned,"" Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

""This inquiry will allow NSW to learn from this season and the catastrophic conditions we've faced, and apply these learnings for the future."" That comes on top of a Royal Commission inquiry announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier in January.

The months-long crisis has sparked renewed calls for Australia's conservative government to take immediate action on climate change, with street protests urging Morrison to reduce the country's reliance on coal.

Scientists say the bushfire disaster was exacerbated by climate change, coming on the back of a crippling drought that turned forests into a tinderbox and allowed blazes to spread out of control quickly.

While the prime minister belatedly acknowledged the link between the bushfire disaster and a warming planet, he has said his government would focus on climate adaption and building resilience instead of measures to cut emissions.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/australia-heatwave-renews-bushfire-worries-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/australia-heatwave-renews-bushfire-worries.html
245,30-1-20,Easter attack: Lanka court extends remand of 61 suspects till Feb 12,"A Sri Lankan court on Thursday extended till February 12 the remand of 61 people arrested in connection with the deadly Easter Sunday bombings.

All the 61 suspects are members of the local Islamist extremist group, National Thawheed Jamaath (NTJ), police said.

The Batticaloa High Court extended their remand till February 12, they said.

Nine suicide bombers on April 21 last year carried out a series of blasts that tore through three churches and as many high-end hotels, killing 258 people, including Indians, in Lanka's deadliest violence since the brutal civil war ended in 2009.

The Islamic State claimed the attacks, but the government blamed the NTJ for the bombings. Nearly 300 suspects have been arrested so far.

A state of emergency was clamped in the country for a period of four months from April to August.

Earlier this week, police recorded the statement of former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the bombings.

The government headed jointly by Wickremesinghe and then president Maithripala Sirisena was blamed for failing to prevent the island's worst terror attack despite prior intelligence.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/easter-attack--lanka-court-extends-remand-of-61-suspects-till-feb-12-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/easter-attack--lanka-court-extends-remand-of-61-suspects-till-feb-12.html

247,30-1-20,Abortion limit raised to 24 weeks for special cases,"Applicable for rape survivors, victims of incest, minors, differently-abled

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a legislation extending the upper limit for permitting abortions from the present 20 weeks to 24 weeks for “special categories of women”, which would include rape survivors, victims of incest, differently-abled and minors.

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 which amends the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 will be introduced in Parliament session to begin from January 31.

While addressing the media after the Cabinet meeting, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the upper limit for permitting abortions has been extended from the present 20 weeks to 24 weeks.

The law will help the rape victims, ill and under-age women to terminate the unwanted pregnancy lawfully. Also, in case of deformity of the foetus, a medical board will provide a safe pathway for abortion,” the Minister said.

He also said this will ensure safe termination of pregnancies and also give women reproductive rights over their bodies.

“In a progressive reform and giving reproductive rights to women the limit of 20 weeks of medical termination of pregnancy has been increased to 24 weeks. This is important because in first five months there are cases where the girl concerned doesn’t realise and has to go to court. This was discussed with various stakeholders.

“This will reduce maternal mortality,” Javadekar said as he pointed out that according to estimates, “eight per cent of deaths in maternal mortality data are due to unsafe abortions”.

A statement issued by the Government here said the “upper gestation limit” for medical termination of pregnancy will not apply in cases of “substantial foetal abnormalities” diagnosed by the Medical Board.

The composition, functions and other details of Medical Board will be prescribed subsequently in rules to be framed under the Act.

“It is a step towards safety and well-being of the women and many women will be benefitted by this. Recently several petitions were received by the courts seeking permission for aborting pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the present permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or pregnancies due to sexual violence faced by women of foetal abnormalities or pregnancies due to sexual violence faced by women” said the statement.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/abortion-limit-raised-to-24-weeks-for-special-cases-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/abortion-limit-raised-to-24-weeks-for-special-cases.html
248,30-1-20,"Kashmiri Pandits not beggars, we stood on our feet: Vidhu Vinod Chopra","Filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra has said the aim behind his upcoming movie ""Shikara"", about the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir, is not to make anyone feel sorry for the community but to present how these people stood tall in the face of tragedy.

At the special 30-minute screening of the movie on Wednesday, the filmmaker said the film showcases how Kashmiri Pandits rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the tragic event.

""All of our homes were snatched. It's quite something that we stood strong on our feet... It took courage to tell this story. And tell it in such a way that people come to watch it. We didn't want to make a film where two people watch and say 'oh look how bad happened to them.'

""We wanted to make a film where you see what happened to us, and despite that we are standing tall, with hope in our lives, we are settled here. We aren't beggars, we didn't open our hands in front of the government, we stood on our feet. It's a big deal, not a small feat,"" Chopra told reporters.

Chopra said the team has made sure that ""Shikara"" is an entertaining film, but one which does not sell its soul to lure people into the theatres.

""It was tough to write this because I always thought I'll write in a way where people go and watch it in theatres. Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman had said, 'you shall entertain. You shall entertain without selling your soul.'

""This is very difficult, to make a film which people watch without selling your conscience. I'm proud that all of us here, my entire crew, didn't sell our conscience. We have shown what has happened,"" he added.

The filmmaker said he dedicates his movie to his mother who passed away in 2007.

""My mother came here for the premiere of 'Parinda' with one suitcase but could not return. She came for a week and couldn't go to Kashmir for ten years. When I was making 'Mission Kashmir', I took her along because I had security. It was then she visited our house, which was by then ruined.

""I've made this film for my mother, and for all the mothers and people whose lives turned upside down in a month, in a day.""

Featuring Aadil Khan and Sadia, ""Shikara"" is slated to be released on February 7.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kashmiri-pandits-not-beggars--we-stood-on-our-feet--vidhu-vinod-chopra-2020-01-30.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/kashmiri-pandits-not-beggars--we-stood-on-our-feet--vidhu-vinod-chopra.html
