0,29-3-20,Sonia asks Rae Bareli DM to use her LAD fund for virus fight,"



|

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to the district magistrate of Rae Bareli, asking the officer to use as much money from her Local Area Development fund as was needed to help people against coronavirus.

The Lok Sabha member from Rae Bareli said that in view of the spread of coronavirus across the country, people of Rae Bareli should exercise caution and strictly follow the directions issued by the Health department and district administration.

Appealing to Rae Bareli district administration, Sonia said that sanitisers, face masks, soaps, etc should be distributed and special care should be taken of daily wage labourers, homeless and elderly people.

She added that as a representative of the people, she was committed towards providing any help needed at this crucial hour.

Earlier, extending her support to Uttar Pradesh government in the hour of crisis due to spread of coronavirus, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that it was the time to rise above differences, unite and fight the situation for betterment of the country.

In a letter to Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath, Priyanka urged him to ensure that people of the state, especially the poor and deprived, did not face any further difficulty.

She said that the situation arising from the virus spread had hugely impacted labourers, construction workers, destitutes, petty sellers, widows, etc and requested the chief minister to ensure that benefits of schemes or announcements made for them, reached them. Priyanka said that numerous people, hitherto working in other states, were now trying to return to their homes by travelling long distances, even on foot.

“The government also made some announcements in this regard and hence I request that ensuring the return of these workers should be conducted in a smooth manner. If large number of people are still in transit, they be given shelter at government schools, colleges and necessary arrangements be made for them,” she added.

Extending her party’s full support, Priyanka said that while following all rules, Congress workers were ready to provide every aid in this trying times. She said that the Congress had readied a team of volunteers and also helplines in each district for helping the needy and the administration at all times and the state government could use their services for relief works.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sonia-asks-rae-bareli-dm-to-use-her-lad-fund-for-virus-fight.html
1,29-3-20,Centre gives relief to power discoms,"In a major relief to power distribution companies (discoms), the Union government relaxed norms for payment to private thermal power generation companies.

The discoms pay their dues through payment security mechanism of Letter of Credit (LC) for ensuring timely payment to power generation companies .

“Many consumers of discoms are unable to pay their dues and this has critically affected liquidity of the discoms. This in turn has affected their financial position and ability to make timely payments to generating and transmission companies and maintaining Letter of Credit,” says an order from the Ministry of Power dated March 27.

“Considering the unprecedented and force majeure situation, it has been decided that power may be scheduled even if payment security mechanism is established for 50 per cent of the amount for which payment security mechanism is to be otherwise established contractually. This order shall be in effect till June 30, 2020,” the Power Ministry order said.

The Union government relaxed the condition to support discoms that are finding it difficult to collect payments for bills raised on consumers in light of COVID-19 lockdown.

All India Power Engineers Federation had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week to intervene in the prevailing crisis due to the lockdown.

AIPEF chairman Shailendra Dubey said that power engineers welcomed the step taken by the Union Ministry of Power. He said that the AIPEF had requested the Centre to issue direction to the RBI to allow state power utilities to defer repayment of principal and interests at least for three months.

As per AIPEF, power demand in the states has come down by 20-30 per cent and their major source of income from high-end earning sources like Railways, industrial and commercial consumers have been blocked due to complete shutdown.

These measures have resulted in a sudden slump in power bill collections of discoms by 80 per cent over the last few days. The sudden fall in collections has rendered the discoms unable to make daily payments not only to generators, which in turn is affecting coal payments and coal transport by Railways, but also debt servicing to banks and financial institutions.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/centre-gives-relief-to-power-discoms.html
2,29-3-20,"UP to release 11,000 prisoners for 8 weeks","The Uttar Pradesh government ordered the release of around 11,000 convicts and undertrials housed in 72 jails of the state to ease overcrowding and thereby prevent the spread of coronavirus.

A high-level committee headed by senior judge of Allahabad High Court, Justice Pankaj Kumar Jaiswal, and two members, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi and DG (Jails) Anand Kumar made the recommendation to the government which was approved by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday.

Of the prisoners to be released are 8,500 under- trials and 2,500 convicts.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered all states to consider the release of convicts on parole, whose punishment was not of more than seven years, so that the jails could be saved from overcrowding to prevent the spread of virus among prisoners.

As per officials, undertrials would be given bail for eight weeks on personal bonds while the convicts would be given parole for eight weeks in a similar manner.

Presently, against total capacity of 60,580 in 72 jails of the state, over one lakh inmates are lodged there. The most overcrowded jails are Jaunpur with 1,221 inmates against a capacity of 320, Lalitpur with 433 inmates against capacity of 122, Saharanpur with 1,650 inmates against capacity of 533, Shahjahanpur with 1,407 inmates against capacity of 511 and Budaun with 1,411 inmates against capacity of 529.

Jails with low occupancy are Gautam Buddha Nagar with 2,795 inmates against a capacity of 3750, Kasganj with inmates 760 against capacity of 1,050, Ambedkarnagar with 264 inmates against capacity of 971, Chitrakoot with 593 inmates against capacity of 862 and Model Jail in Lucknow with 463 inmates against its capacity of 600 prisoners.

With the release of prisoners on bail or parole, jail authorities would be able to ensure safe social distancing as recommended to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

3,29-3-20,VHP calls off 84-kosi parikrama,"



|

Vishwa Hindu Parishad has cancelled the 84-kosi parikrama in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 252-km circumambulation around what is believed to have been Lord Ram’s empire, was to start on April 8 and would have passed through Ayodhya, Barabanki and Gonda.

Ayodhya-based VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said, “Last year, about 1,000 people participated in the parikrama but this year the parikrama has been cancelled as we need to stand in solidarity with the government and society against coronavirus. Religious and social rituals will survive only when the nation is protected.”

The parikrama cannot be postponed as it has to take place in Chaitra, the first month of Hindu calendar.

The decision for cancelling the parikrama was taken by Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust chairperson Mahant Nritya Gopal Das and secretary Champat Rai in consultation with top leadership of the VHP.

“Preparations for the parikrama were complete. Seers from across the country would have been in Ayodhya for it. However, the country and society come first. If they are safe, then the parikrama can happen next year,” Sharma said. The VHP had scaled down Sri Ram Mahotsav celebration this year despite expectation that millions of devotees would congregate at Ayodhya to celebrate the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit.

A section of the media had, however, recently reported that Mahant Nritya Gopal Das had asked devotees to flock into Ayodhya to celebrate Ram Navami on April 2.

Reports also claimed that the local administration had failed to reason with the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust on the enormity of the problem.

But Sharma dismissed them as ‘malicious’.

“Our ancestors have said that it is only when society is safe that religious and social obligations can be followed and places of worship flourish. We stand in solidarity with the government’s decision to enforce lockdown which might be a short term inconvenience,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vhp-calls-off-84-kosi-parikrama.html
4,29-3-20,UP Govt: Nobody will die for want of food,"



|

Declaring that no one would die of hunger in Uttar Pradesh, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that community kitchen and doorstep delivery of food items had eased the situation with the masses getting essential commodities at home.

“Community kitchens have started serving people who are poor and have lost employment due to the lockdown. Till date, 527 kitchens are functioning and catering to 1.37 lakh people,” Awasthi told media persons in Lucknow on Saturday.

The additional chief secretary said that people who were on roads were being fed at every place even as Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath exhorted them to stay at one place so that the district authorities could take care of their needs.

Awasthi said that doorstep delivery of food items had been a success as the number of delivery vans had gone up to 26,298.

“Besides, the government has roped in 8,833 provision stores to deliver products at homes while 8,852 vans are being used for supply of over 15 lakh litres of milk,” he said.

Talking about the supply of foodgrains through Public distribution system (PDS), Awasthi said that of the 3.23 crore ration cards in the state, 1.94 crore had been given foodgrains so far and 70 lakh below poverty line (BPL) card holders had been given free ration.

The additional chief secretary said that 58,552 gram pradhans were contacted through the CM Helpline along with 11,000 counsellors to make them aware about the facilities.

Besides, he said, 11,900 complaints received on CM Helpine 1076 were resolved.

Giving details of the action taken against people for violating lockdown, Awasthi said that 4,642 FIRs were registered against 14,115 accused under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. Besides, he said, 24 FIRs were registered against traders selling products at higher rates.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt--nobody-will-die-for-want-of-food.html
5,29-3-20,"UP govt arranges 1,000 buses for stranded migrant workers","



|

The Uttar Pradesh government has provided 1,000 buses, both state-run and private, for transportation of migrant workers and their kin stranded on Delhi-UP border, some of whom had even started to walk home.

Information Advisor to Chief Minister, Mritunjay, said that the chief minister was quite concerned about the plight of these people since Friday and held a meeting with Transport department officials wherein it was decided that the government would send a fleet of buses to ensure that these people reached their homes.

“We needed almost 1,000 buses as not only people from UP but also from Bihar were stranded on Delhi-UP border. Their evacuation and safe transit were priorities for the government,” he said.

However, politics started over the issue as UP officials claimed that these people were driven out of Delhi and dropped on the UP border.

“This is unfortunate on part of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to dump these hapless people at this crucial juncture as the entire country is fighting against coronavirus. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has written to all chief ministers to take care of people from UP and has said that the UP government is ready to pay for that,” Mritunjay said.

The advisor to the UP chief minister charged that the Delhi government did nothing to provide essentials like food, milk and other necessities during the lockdown and instead triggered rumour that the UP government was making arrangements of buses to ferry them home.

“The Delhi government even transported these migrants from their homes to UP-Delhi border by DTC buses which created a huge problem for UP,” he said.

Mritunjay further said that the migrants had to face severe hardship and some even complained that their electricity and water connections were disconnected and they were virtually forced to starve.

“But the Yogi government took a call and arranged drivers and conductors and sent these buses to the state border to provide relief to these migrants,” he said.

The buses were arranged from Ghaziabad, Noida, Bulandshahar, Hapur and other bordering districts.

“A large number of migrants along with their families were provided food and other essentials at the border along with transportation to their respective villages,” the official said.

Earlier, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that as precautionary measure, district officials were asked to immediately deploy two medical teams at major bus stations and one at small bus stations.

“As soon as any bus carrying labourers from Ghaziabad/Noida arrive, immediate medical check-up should be done without fail,” Awasthi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-govt-arranges-1-000-buses-for-stranded-migrant-workers.html
6,29-3-20,Street vendors to get Rs 3K aid,"Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Saturday announced a financial aid of Rs 3,000 for each of the 65,000 registered street vendors in 114 ULBs cross the State.

Notably, these street vendors have suffered financially as they have kept their shops closed as a measure to maintain social distancing for checking spread of deadly novel coronavirus (COVID-19) for a few days now.

Besides, the Chief Minister also announced that 100 to 200 poor people would be provided cooked food in each gram panchayat from Sunday. SHGs would be entrusted the responsibility of cooking and distributing cooked meals. Poor people can take cooked food from SHGs and eat the meals in their respective houses, said the Chief Minister in an official release.

He said that about 10 lakh poor and distressed people would benefit from the scheme.

On Friday, the Chief Minister had announced distribution of ration items to poor people for three months and old-age pension for four months. He urged people once again to stay home and remain safe from COVID-19.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/street-vendors-to-get-rs-3k-aid.html
7,29-3-20,Lessons to learn,"These are difficult times. More importantly, these are times to learn some most basic lessons which humanity forgot in its ambitious march to conquer everything. As the threat of Covid-19 spreads, mankind realises how vulnerable it is in the face of a crisis that emanates from the nature. The difficulties have their own lessons to offer. They are testing human resilience in times of adversity. That mankind will emerge from this is also certain. History has proved this time and again. Of course, a price was paid each time, but what mattered was the indomitable will to survive from the crises. However, the essential point was that with time the same mistakes that led to those crises were forgotten and the same pursuits went on. Human beings have hardly learnt from their past mistakes and their memories are woefully short. But the micro-organisms keep on learning from their past and continuously adapt to regain their strike power. The multidrug resistant micro-organisms that give rise to the same old diseases that struck humanity ages ago keep on bouncing back. The coronavirus that has struck this time with a vengeance is a grim reminder of this basic fact. The adaptability of the virus is something that must give humanity a lesson or two. There are other lessons, too, that the present crises offers. First and foremost, that despite those geographical boundaries, racial and cultural differences, the uniformity in reaction to this corona threat proves emphatically that humanity has a common thread. And the collective unconscious hypothesis of Carl Jung holds goods. Rightly did Napoleon opine that two things unite humanity — fear and self-interest. Look the way people are reacting globally. Same ‘me first’ mind set where it comes to survival interest, and same ‘me-not’ mind set when it comes to threat. Though it is rather a tall order, yet can we not think of others, for a change? Rather than thinking of buying provisions to last till eternity can we not think of leaving something for the others to buy? An extreme example is that of the people of the United States of America who as per newspaper reports are going for panic buying of guns and cartridges. And the reason is quite strange. It is based on a chain of assumptions. First that the virus threat will last long. Second, if it lasts long there will be scarcity of basic necessities. Third, the deprived will be forced to think of snatching and looting those who have it. So the conclusion is that the guns will have to be used for defense. The point is how much can be stored and how many can be kept at bay by fire power. Sanity is giving way to vanity. To quote former President of the US, John F Kennedy — “If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich”. We need to learn to share our resources in these trying times. In times of crises that threaten collectively, we need to stand collectively. Not just for me and myself but for us. These adversities are times that test not just our wit and grit, but also our character. There is little justification of people running from isolation wards and risking others. Behaving responsibly is what these times call for. Time to be human and act human.

8,29-3-20,Lessons to learn from deferral of Olympics,"Keeping the global preparedness in mind, we all must realise the fact that we need a robust strategy, particularly public health emergency to handle pandemics like Covid-19. Life certainly comes first; therefore creating kerfuffle around such crisis is a folly. Rather, we must gather courage to fight the menace out and look forward to Tokyo 2021 with renewed vigour and conviction

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) at last postponed the Tokyo Olympic 2020 for a year. Echoing the sentiments of the sporting community world over, its president Thomas Bach said, “These postponed Olympic Games will need compromises by all of the stakeholders.” It’s not only Japan, particularly the city of Tokyo, but also thousands of sportspersons and allied agencies who were supposed to be an integral part of this landmark event have all been hit by the deadly Covid-19.

The historic flame of the Olympic was handed over by Hellenic Olympic Committee president Spyros Capralos to Naoko Imoto (former Olympian swimmer), who represented the Tokyo Organizing Committee, on March 19. And the flame reached Japan through a special aircraft named “Tokyo 2020 Go”. As a significant part of the Olympic Movement, the flame is quite often linked to the messages of hope and peace. The Tokyo 2020 torch relay concept known as “Hope Lights Our Way” was designed to unite the entire Japanese people with emotion. But then unfortunately, before the flame was to be started from Fukushima to the rest of Japan on March 26, the IOC took the historic decision to push the Games to the next year. Though it was nearly sure for an immediate cancellation of the Tokyo Games, yet the Japanese Government was hoping against all odds to organise it.

The opening ceremony for the Olympic Games was supposed to start on July 24 and the Paralympics were scheduled from August 25. Interestingly, Tokyo, one of the most populous cities in the world, was going to host the largest sporting event of the globe. By the end of the 2019, the organisers calculated the total cost of the Games around 1.33 trillion yen i.e. 1.12 billion Euros.

And this entire cost was incurred by three parties --- the City of Tokyo, the Japanese Olympic Organizing Committee and the Central Government of the country. But the experts say the real cost of organising this mega event would be ten times higher than what has been revealed in public so far.

The mascot of the Tokyo 2020 “Miraitowa” has a personality inspired by the Japanese proverb, “learn from the past and develop new ideas”. It is taken from Japanese words, “mirai” meaning “future” and “towa” meaning “eternity”. Thus this mascot represents the idea that this game will lead to a future of everlasting hope in the hearts of everyone around the world.

If we look at the history we observe that it was only the historic World Wars that led to the cancellation of the Olympics in the past. But the current trend is that other phenomena such as politics, terrorism and pandemics with global underpinnings have forced all of us to call of such sports extravaganzas. Since the opening of the Modern Olympic Games in Athens (Greece) in 1896, the game has only been cancelled three times --- first during the World War I in 1916, second and third time during the World War II in 1940 and 1944. It must be noted here that until the advent of coronavirus pandemic, that has forced the IOC to postpone the Olympic, the game has weathered all other crises in the past. In 1916, the German Empire was to host the Olympic but with the outbreak of the First World War, it was simply cancelled.

Many of the nations who were to send participants to the games had eventually indulged into the war. In 1940, the Summer and Winter Olympics were to be held in Japan, but it forfeited its rights as it got involved in a war with China. Else Japan would have been the first non-Western country to host the games. Again London was to host the Games in 1944 and because of the Second World War, it was summarily cancelled.

Though opinions vary, economic analysts simply come to one single point: As the Games has been postponed, the toughest task for the Japanese economy would be to wading through the prolonged pandemic in the days to come. Now, the rechristened Olympic 2021 will have to be planned entirely on the basis of a new global sports calendar.

And also Bach clarified that rescheduling is not restricted just to the summer months. All the options are on the table, before and including the summer of 2021. The IOC has given the responsibility to a task force called “Here We Go” to find out all possibilities for organise this historic event held once in four years. The team’s job is to interact with probably 33 sports federations and to look into the world sports calendar so as to plan the grand Olympic 2021.

But what now seems is that the IOC is working with the other sports organisations to arrange a July-August window to fix the dates for Tokyo Olympics 2021. This time could be better as the Tennis Grand Slams of Wimbledon and the US Open slated to end respectively in mid-July and in late August. John Coates, the chief of the Coordination Commission of the IOC is hopeful that within a month the final dates for Olympic 2021 may be locked.

It is also agreed that more or less the same arrangements would be there for the Games in 2021 such as the planning the marathon in northern city of Sapporo instead of Tokyo to escape the heat. This would be finally boosting the lost morale of many investors and sponsors of various events as now they all could focus on channelising their resources.

Hope lies ahead for sure. The health experts, researchers and pharmaceutical enterprises all together are working hard to bring out an effective drug to stop the deadly Covid-19. At this juncture, the world community badly demands leadership and unity among the nations. Accusing one another for spreading the virus and movement of the migrants would not definitely provide us any solution. It’s just a virus and a lethal one. Countering the same requires precaution first and of course timely supply of drugs at an affordable price.

Taking hard decisions and then delivering better is a daunting task. What Bach looks forward is simply this only. Even he is eyeing on all options, and one of them could be planning the games just before the start of the Japanese summer season.

At this gloomy scenario, mixed feelings are being aired by sportspersons all around the world. This deferring may lead to an end of the active careers of our time. Because some of the greats, like Michel Phelps, who have been named as the most decorated athlete in Olympic history, is now talking about the “mental health” of the players across the world. To him the postponement is nothing but a “total bamboozle” so to say. Yes it’s true. Many of them would be suffering from high levels of depression.

Certainly apart from ones who are purely garrulous, we must understand the depth and impact of the Covid-19. Postponing at this moment is not a gaffe; it is absolutely a wise decision.

Fighting this pandemic is like a countering a “Third World War”, but without arms and ammunition. The last two World Wars had witnessed the pouring of large sums of money, muscle power and sophisticated weapons, including the most deadly atomic bombs. But then still we are all looking for an opportunity to fight, though not a real war, but of course a virtual one. Days of sabre-rattling have gone. A real and extremely poisonous threat in the form of Covid-19 has taken a toll on humanity for now.

Keeping the global preparedness in mind, we all must realise the fact that we need a robust strategy, particularly public health emergency to handle such epidemics. Life certainly comes first; thus creating kerfuffle around such crisis would only lead to more panic among the commoners. The global sports community must be really hopeful that this pandemic will teach all of us a strong lesson to usher into a Tokyo 2021 with renewed vigour and conviction.

9,29-3-20,India has not lost its head in corona crisis,"A national lockdown has been successfully undertaken in a country of India’s size and diversity.

I don’t know if the lockdown will achieve its objectives. I pray it does. But regardless of the outcome, how we have conducted ourselves makes me proud to be an Indian. It also makes me proud of our leader

As of Saturday morning (9.45 am), the fourth day of the national lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases in India has touched 873. Does this mean that we are still behind the curve or, as many of the “experts” suggest, this is just the lull before the country experiences the pandemic tsunami?

Like the overwhelming majority of India, I don’t know. Over the past three weeks all of us have been subjected to so many conflicting versions of this global epidemic that has changed the world in ways that none of us thought was possible that we have stopped trying to be amateur pundits. When the WHO announced that every corner of the world was vulnerable to the what President Donald Trump evocatively describes as the “Chinese virus”, every person seemed to have a view of what needed and didn’t need to be done. These ranged from doing as little as possible but acquiring immunity through different means to suggesting policy prescriptions. Today, the voices of the loud know-alls are becoming less and less heard. The “experts” have their views, but no one is sure whether this expert view will outlive 48 hours.

A strange form of collective helplessness is visible. As law-abiding citizens, the overwhelming number of Indians have confined themselves to their homes, hoping that after April 15 they will be able to pick up the pieces and return to the daily routine. Meanwhile, watching a re-run of the Ramayan, what many of us experienced each Sunday morning in the late-1980s, will have to suffice.

In moments such as this, there is an irresistible temptation to outsource decision-making to a higher authority. For most it is God — articulated in different ways. But this unseen force isn’t the only one we bank on. The secular authority we put our trust in moments of anxiety is the Government. Although the trust is never blind, there is the temptation to let others — with information, expertise and resources at their command — take decisions and do the thinking on our behalf. This relationship of the citizen with the state is based on trust and — but only to a limited extent — coercion. If the trust broke down, there is no lathi-waving policeman who would succeed in imposing a national lockdown.

In recent history there are times when either trust breaks down completely or competing authorities start pulling in different directions. I always cite the example of what happened in France in the spring of 1940 when the German army broke through the seemingly impregnable Maginot Line. The authority of the all-powerful French state broke down and produced social chaos. It was this upheaval that led to collaboration with the Germans and the trust placed in Marshal Petain and his fragile Vichy regime.

It may sound politically incorrect to say so, but imminent military defeat does not always lead to social breakdown and chaos. By the beginning of 1945, for example, it was sufficiently clear that the collapse of Nazi Germany was only a matter of time. There was just no way that Hitler’s regime would be able to withstand the combined might of the USA and the Soviet Union. The Germans didn’t give up and fought bitterly, despite the huge military and civilian casualties. But what has escaped attention is the fact that an unending tale of military defeats since mid-1944 and the decimation of nearly every German city by enemy bombers didn’t lead to a social breakdown, as happened with less provocation in France. Till the very end the authority of the German state remained intact.

It is of course possible to read these two experiences with reference to the type of regimes France and Germany had at these moments of upheaval. France in 1940 was democratic while Germany in 1945 was a regimented, totalitarian state. Maybe totalitarian states have a better record of holding a society together in times of crisis. If, for the moment, the theory of COVID-19 being a grand Chinese conspiracy is ignored, it is worth looking at the relative success of the authorities in managing the total lockdown of Wuhan. True, the extent of inconvenience was perhaps understated by the absence of an open media and the rigid control that the state maintains over its citizens. But in the face of the pandemic, such extreme measures can be condoned.

It is the inability of democracies to emulate the Wuhan model that has led to Western European countries shying away from cracking the whip, leaving the last mile to people’s good sense and failing to meet the desired objective. Apart from Northern Italy and Spain where the number of deaths have skyrocketed, most other democratic countries have faltered in imposing lockdowns.

It is in this context that the national lockdown in India must be seen. Frankly, if it hadn’t been Narendra Modi at the helm, lesser leaders would have preferred to have settled for half-measures, citing a combination of economic constraints and human deficiencies. India is a democracy and there is total freedom for intellectuals, contrarians and the fifth columnists to point to deficiencies, real and imaginary. The international media, particularly those based in the Anglophone world, also find it easy to present India as a land of chaos, heartlessness and stupid bigotry. There is enough in the subcontinent to feed this appetite. But what needs careful scrutiny is the fact that a national lockdown has been successfully undertaken in a country of India’s size and diversity. The economic costs of this lockdown will be unimaginably high. But the fact that we have put people over money is reason enough to believe that India hasn’t lost its head in a crisis.

I don’t know if the lockdown will achieve its objectives. I pray it does. But regardless of the outcome, how we have conducted ourselves makes me proud to be an Indian. It also makes me proud of our leader.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/india-has-not-lost-its-head-in-corona-crisis.html
10,29-3-20,Man murdered in Jaunpur,"A middle-aged man was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in Jaunpur on Saturday morning.

The victim’s kin suspect the hand of a local petrol pump manager in the murder and have named him in the FIR lodged in this connection. The body was sent for autopsy and further investigations were on.

As per reports, Ramnath Sharma (50) of Sarai Mohamedeenpur in Jaunpur went missing on Friday evening after he went out telling his family that he was going out for work. The family members tried on their own to search him but failed.

On Saturday morning, a passer-by spotted the body of an unknown man lying near the boundary of a petrol pump, barely 100 metres from Sharma’s house.

Later, Sharma’s family members rushed there and identified the body and later informed the police about it.

There were injury marks on the head and back, suggesting that the victim was attacked with some blunt object.

Suspecting the role of the petrol pump manager in the murder, the victim’s kin lodged a report against him.

The police were investigating the case.

He said only the bigger post offices like General Post Office, Head Post Office and Mukhya Dak Ghars may be opened in skeletal mode with minimum number of staff on roster basis keeping in view the guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Unicef and WHO with full preventive measures to provide the basic services. And this can only help to maintain social distancing and contain spread of COVID-19.

Samal said in Odisha, out of 8,172 post offices, all the 6,976 Rural Branch Post Offices and all bigger offices like Mukhya Dak Ghar, Head Post Office, General Post Office numbering 220 are ordered to be kept open. While use of biometric devices has been dispensed with by Government of India, in a recent order issued by the department on March 25, the department has emphasized to ensure financial transactions in biometric mode and for booking and delivery of accountable articles.

The federation said that there is higher risk of infection as 25,000 postal employees working in 8,172 post offices across Odisha are interacting with hundreds of

customers daily in each post office at the counters and handling lakhs of mails coming from various sources including foreign mails.

The condition is same for 5 lakh postal employees in 1.55 lakh post offices across the country. The federation said that opening the postal services and booking of articles is meaningless at a time when there is absence of any transport facility including rail, air and road.

However, in the past few days with the MCD first shutting its property tax office to prevent crowding and then with the lockdown being imposed, the percentage of property tax submission through the online mode has increased in MCD. According to the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly, “The percentage of people submitting property tax through the online mode has increased by about 10 per cent.” He added that due to the lockdown in the state, more people have started submitting the property tax online in which the percent of residential property taxpayers is more.

This month is apparently the last month for the submission of property tax but due to the threat of COVID-19 the campus of MCD is closed. Therefore, the Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' appealed the people to submit the property tax through online mode.

On being asked about the extension of date in the submission of property tax, 'Gama' said that for now people should keep depositing the tax online and decision in this regard will be announced soon.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/online-property-tax-submission-in-mcd-rises-due-to-lockdown.html

People can now apply online for an e-pass by uploading their details and once the allocation is verified by the district authorities, they can download the pdf file of the permit on their mobile phone, the district collector said.

In future, more such innovations will be available for people so that they don’t have to crowd government offices for acquiring such services, Tayal said.

36,29-3-20,"For peace, accept life as it is, dispel fear","Phantasm and illusion are the misapprehensions of life. Reality of life is something very different from all these. In the present scenario, we need to come out of this mirage and frame an existential life. All the human experiences such as anxiety, alienation and depression imply the presence of mental illness in every individual. But the existential psychotherapy sees these experiences as natural stages in a normal process of human development and maturation. In facilitating this process of development and maturation, existentialism involves a philosophical exploration of an individual’s experiences stressing the individual’s freedom and responsibility to facilitate a higher degree of meaning and wellbeing in one’s life.

No matter what happens around the world or in our individual lives, there is always a look for a place of stability. Searching for a purpose or wondering if anything in life really matters or even if they matter, people seek out a sense of identity, an inner knowledge of who they are. There are a few who hunt for a relationship with God, or a deepening sense of spiritual connection in whatever forms that might take. Many search for connection with other human beings, whether that is friendship, deepened intimacy or someone with whom to grow old with. And a few are those who are searching for a way out -- a way out of pain in all its forms, a way out of disappointment, regret, shame, anger, sadness, loss, anxiety and fear, and at times in the mundane too.

There is exploration for other things that are really nothing at all, like the requirement of ample time, more relaxation and more confidence, less stimulation, more beauty, more happiness, information, knowledge or skills. Maybe peace of mind isn’t something we have or we need to find, but something we do nurture and cultivate in ourselves. Maybe, it’s right under our nose.

Living our lives in alignment with what truly matters to us isn’t about searching, trying to be something other than we are. It is living with ourselves, our histories, and going forward to create a life worthy of our time on this planet. That kind of peace is durable.

We end each day with the news that the stock market is tumbling. The number of corona virus cases is increasing.

The reach of the virus is widening. And it’s creating a kind of preemptive hysteria. The root of these thoughts is that they are “negativity bias” of the brain. It’s an evolutionary trait that served us well while living on the savannah thousands of years ago.

Fear sparks a deep desire to be in control. Inner peace comes not from control, but from letting go of the illusion. There is a direct correlation between the intensity of our resistance to this reality and the amount of suffering that we are experiencing.

In this regard, it’s very obvious to remain confused and automatically the stress moves on searching for a point of releasing the depth of anguish in the form of a trust with something that can purify the stress and can add calmness to mind; or else severe anxiety and stress can result in a complete meltdown. This response can cause long-term damage to our health and lower the ability to perform optimally.

At a point, certain degree of mental and emotional detachment is very much essential to start focusing about the peace of mind. To accept what cannot be changed, can bring back a sense of happiness and freedom. Inner peace eventually leads to external peace. By creating peace in one’s inner world and own life, the same inner peace can be easily shared to the external world and to other people’s lives.

When one is composed, sufficiently practiced and self-assured, one is poised for success. A coping strategy needs to be developed where both our mind and heart need to develop the adjustments for a social connectivity. The time is knocking where we need to end the dilemma that we should not lose ourselves in the labyrinth of the little streets.

67,29-3-20,Psychological lockdown amongst children,"The unprecedented lockdown of 21 days in India to fight out coronavirus has left undeliable marks on the society and specially the impressionable minds of younger generation. Here’s the expression of a 12 year old girl on psychological and societal impact of the lockdown.

Ojasvi Dhillon, Class VII student of Emerald Heights, gives an account of the situation and possible ways to tide over it.

Covid -19 would stay in our memory as a difficult stage that we all suffered. As children, it will stay in our memory as a very boring time. It might not be as boring for parents as they still have to work from home.

Now, the children are listening to the severity of the Covid -19 from their friends, parents, neighbours and most importantly the ‘Head of the Nation’. We children, are really not so naive to not understand it but at the same time we are not even matured enough to absorb all the restrictions on us.

When it started, we were all tensed but there were not many precautions taken, but then it started spreading a lot and everyone was forced to stay inside their houses.

We were told not to go out and play, but the single child in a nuclear family has nothing to do, more so for the children whose both parents are working and they get busy in work from home. In this case, the parents are around but not available.

The children who were overwhelmed with parents’ company are sad now as they are longing even more, to play with their parents and to spend time with them. Every child is different and needs different amount of time to hone their qualities.

The children only want encouragement and support from their parents. This is the best time for finding and embracing your qualities.

At this point of time, when lockdowns are going on, a single child in a nuclear family has nothing much to do, but there are still a few options like movies, music, books, yoga, board/computer games, dancing, hobby activity etc. These can be shuffled during the day to include most of them in your itinerary.

This is also the time to introduce ourselves to new things like household management, healthy cooking, online learning etc. A word about online learning - Udemy and Coursera website/mobile apps offer free online courses in multiple fields.

The courses last for three to eight weeks and children can subscribe to the course which interests them the most, eg photography, public speaking, language, drawing/sketching etc. Lastly, I would like to say that we should utilise this time for learning new things from each other in our family. We should take precautions and whilst in the house think of the positivity of spending time together

71,29-3-20,Ranchiites stay at home in lockdown,"Streets in Ranchi were relatively emptier on Saturday in comparison with the first three days of the lockdown – an indication that awareness about the gravity of the situation and the importance of social isolation was gradually finding buyers in the State capital.

Vegetable markets on Saturday were also less crowded, and even the ones present at the markets maintained safe distance from one another. Vegetable sellers at Morhabadi Bazar said that Bazar was bustling on Thursday and Friday.

However, the number of customers reduced considerably on Saturday. “People were panic-buying on the first three days of the lockdown. Maybe that is why the vegetable markets and grocery shops were overcrowded,” said Bansi Mahato, a vegetable vendor at Morhabadi Ground.

The District Administration has tightened the noose around citizens who tend to violate the lockdown norms and move out of their houses without any genuine purpose. Police personnel deployed across the city dealt with such people with an iron fist on Saturday and ensured that commoners do not move out of their houses. Rakesh Pandey, a police personnel deployed at Harmu Chowk said, “People who have a valid reason to come out of their houses – like buying grocery, medicines or vegetables – are allowed to cross this square. On the first day of the lockdown, many youths came out on bikes, and had to use mild force to force them indoors,” he said.

While many activists are raising concerns over the future of daily wage labourers, the Government has issued phone numbers of different IAS officers to address problems of labourers returning from different States of India.

According to sources working closely with daily wage labourers, the COVID-19 pandemonium has led to return of more than one lakh labourers from across the country to Jharkhand.

The same facility is also available for Jharkhand labourers who are stuck in other States during the lockdown, a press communiqué from the Government said.Although rail services have come to a standstill during the 21-day lockdown, South Eastern Railways on Saturday sanitised bogies of different passenger trains in a bid to ensure that they are safe for passengers when rail services resume, a press communiqué from South Eastern Railways said.

Railway staff was also provided hand sanitizers and masks on Saturday. Different offices at Railway Stations in Ranchi and Hatia were also sanitised on Saturday, sources said.

Meanwhile, hospitals remained vacant on Saturday. Barring a few patients visiting the Outdoor Patient Department (OPD), there was no major rush at any of the Government hospitals. The fear of getting infected by Coronavirus also kept commoners away from private hospitals in the State capital.

The Government has set up isolation wards in all Government hospitals as well as some private hospitals in Jharkhand.

However, no patients has tested positive for Coronavirus in the State so far. Only suspected patients are being kept in the isolation wards across Jharkhand, health officials said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ranchiites-stay-at-home-in-lockdown.html
72,29-3-20,272 in isolation wards across Jharkhand,"At least 272 suspects of COVID-19 were admitted in isolation wards of various hospitals across Jharkhand as of Saturday, an official communiqué from the National Health Mission (NHM) said. On the other hand, a whopping 73,000 odd emigrates with travel history to different affected States in India were kept in home-quarantine across Jharkhand, it added.

While Jharkhand is among the few States that have not reported even a single case of Coronavirus, doctors and health workers here have collected samples of at least 179 patients so far and 175 of them have tested negative.

The lab test reports of the remaining four suspects are awaited, NHM officials said. Besides the 73,000 travelers on home-quarantine and 272 at hospitals, the State has also maintained surveillance on 911 passengers – this mostly includes people who have traveled from foreign countries, sources in NHM said. Out of the 911 passengers under surveillance, 163 have completed their observation period of 28 and came out asymptomatic, health officials said.

The number of travelers identified in Jharkhand witnessed an over 50 per cent increase in 48 hours or so. The number of such “emigrates” reported on Thursday was 45,000 and it rose to 73,000 on Saturday – a pattern that indicates that many residents of other States have traveled to Jharkhand after the Coronavirus outbreak, officials from the Health Department said.

On Saturday, health workers here collected samples of 26 suspects and the lab test reports of 22 of them came out negative, the NHM said in an official statement issued on Saturday evening. Some doctors have also raised concerns over the lack of testing facilities in Jharkhand. They said that the lack of testing could be a reason for no reportage of positive cases.The President of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Jharkhand Chapter has also written to the health secretary, Nitin Madan Kulkarni, here raising concern over the testing procedure followed in Jharkhand.

In his letter, he said that the travelers were screened with a thermal scanner, and the ones who take paracetamol may not get identified even if they have fever. He also said that asymptomatic carriers of the virus may pass on the disease to other people, and therefore, the administration must put every traveler under strict surveillance.

Meanwhile, the State has set up isolation wards with a total of 1469 beds across Jharkhand. The figures include the beds in Government hospitals, private hospitals and other facilities. A 243-bed isolation centre has also been set up at Khelgaon in Hotwar to treat patients if there is a spike in the number of cases in Jharkhand.

As the country is under a lockdown for 21 days, the virus, which entered India through Kerala, has already infected nearly 1000 people and claimed 19 lives in he country.

Coronavirus – a mysterious virus that was first reported in Wuhan City of China – has spread to most of the European nations and claimed several thousand lives.

Tomatoes which just last week was at Rs 25 per Kg are now being sold at Rs 60 for the same quantity. Similarly prices of all green vegetables like bottle gourd, spinach and cabbage has also almost doubled during this period.

“The price rise in the vegetables could be due to the difficulty in movement between two districts as well as two states. Small farmers who would generally get their produce on a cycle to the City are doing so anymore as they could be scared of getting caught by the police.

If there is an increase in the number of positive cases, the government will extend the lockdown most likely and the prices may further increase,” said Deputy Chief Medical Officer (CMO) CCL Hospital, Dr Rajkumar. Dr Rajkumar further emphasised that people should avoid eating uncooked veggies. “In the present situation, it is being advised that raw vegetables should not be consumed. Any vegetables once brought home should be thoroughly washed and cleaned before cooking.”

“Vegetables across Ranchi are easily available in all the localities. Presently, the prices of all vegetables have increased by about 20 to 30 percent. Chances are that the prices may further rise but people don’t need to panic about it. India is a country of farmers with an agriculture based economy.

87,29-3-20,‘I began acting at 8’,"Vardhan Puri | The actor, grandson of Amrish Puri, who debuted with Yeh Saali Aashiqui, speaks with Shalini Saksena about his journey that started with being an assistant director to screenplay writer to an actor

From an assistant director to an actor, how did acting happen?

I had been with theatre since I was five. I used to be an understudy to actors and handle back stage before I got my first minor role when I was eight and a major role at 14. I did a lot of theatre. I then became an assistant director with Yash Raj Films, I became an assistant writer and was part of three films from start to finish. I realised that I didn’t know much about acting in front of the camera despite theatre experience. I went to study that and got my first film —Yeh Saali Aashiqui.

What attracted you to theatre at five?

I was always obsessed with films so much so that I could be glued to the TV for 18 hours. My parents were scared that it would turn my head for the worse because my grandfather (Amrish Puri) was an actor. It was his mentor, Satyadev Dubey, who suggested that I be put into theatre so that I could actually break my ego and learn the art instead of becoming just a filmi bachcha.

How did you come onboard Yeh Saali Aashiqui?

There is a story there. I am the writer in the project. The director, Cherag Ruparel, kept saying why we were looking for the lead when here I was a trained actor wanting to a break in Bollywood. I was not convinced that I could do justice to the character since it has many layers but agreed only after the makers agreed that I give an audition. I auditioned for a week and gave 10 scenes and once I saw the results I was convinced.

Was it easy to do these tough scenes since you wrote the story?

This is a very individualistic approach but yes it helped since I knew the character inside out.

Was it the right project to debut with?

It was something that I was waiting for. I never knew that I would be given the opportunity to act in a film where the lead has such complexities and layers.

Bollywood is quick to typecast. Were there apprehensions in taking up the project?

To begin with yes. But the kind of films that I was being offered are varied, I am signing up for genres like comedy, romance and action-drama. The industry has grown up and so much thought now goes into casting today.

Do people judge because who your grandfather (Amrish Puri) was?

People give you work based on your potential, capability and talent. If this was not the case, I would not have had to start my career as an assistant director and debut as an actor 10 years back. I had to train and prove my worth. One is judged for who you are.

What was the atmosphere was like at home while growing up?

My mother is doctor, my sister is a doctor, my father is businessman and a trained navigator who was in the Merchant Navy, my nani and nana were lawyers. My grandmother was a Government employee, my grandfather was an actor. I am he least educated even though I am a graduate. We spoke about fitness and current affairs. Yes, filmi talk was a large part of the conversation but it was all about dissecting the kind of films that were being made and theatre.

What has been the fondest memory of your grandfather?

I was around 11 and it was my birthday. We used to always celebrate my birthday with my grandparents but they were away because dadu was shooting in London and he told me that it would be difficult for them to be there on that day. But he came even if was for a day. They got me the cutest gift, he played all kind of games with my friends and me – antakshari and dumb charades. We had so much fun that day. It is one of the most memorable days of my life.

Did he advise you?

Oh yes. He told me that acting is always about reaction. He asked me to never forget my roots — theatre. Preparation is key. Be disciplined and your family comes first. Treat your director like God and do your work with honesty.

Your movie released last year and now on TV within six months on &pictures. Is this beneficial?

Things are changing today. Today, films run for five-six weeks maximum. The trend has changed. There are many people who can’t see the film and we want to project the movie to them. The sooner it comes to the satellite platform the better.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-began-acting-at-8----2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-began-acting-at-8---.html
88,29-3-20,Misinformation militates against Covid-19 management,"The Government should rope in social media giants to plan a mechanism that all searches about the pandemic reach the Government/WHO websites in order to stem the flow of canards

While there is a minor issue like a slight mismatch between the figures of Covid-19 cases in India reported by the Government of India and those by global bodies like Worldometer, the more serious and exigent matter is the coronavirus misinformation that is flooding social media.

We are dealing with an unprecedented pandemic and in such a catastrophic situation, we should rely only on authentic sources of information. All data and measures taken or suggested are regularly updated at WHO and the Government of India websites. Accordingly, on issues related to symptoms, treatment and other Covid-19 related management practices, public should pay heed to only that information available on the official resources i.e., Ministry of Health at the Central and State Governments or their appointed spokespersons.

Misinformation which is being spread in the public sphere through various social media channels, intentionally or inadvertently, about Covid-19 is going to hinder the management and treatment of the pandemic.

There have been reports on the social media about some people associated with the Government machinery endorsing unscientific treatments to deal with Covid-19.

We need to learn from the experience of other countries so as to not repeat the same mistakes. Nigeria had faced tremendous problems in managing the Ebola crisis due to misinformation campaign in 2014. Even now despite only 39 cases, the Nigerian Government has found it difficult to control misinformation related to Covid-19.

As per a Global Development Community Media (a well-known media platform associated with reputed world development agencies) report written by William Worley and Vidya Krishnan, the level of misinformation being spread about Covid-19 is the highest in India. It has highlighted a number of incidents of conflicting information coming out of official and non-official sources, besides the social media.

Some samples from their report are: 1) While, the Health Ministry, including the Public Health Foundation of India, is working closely with the World Health Organization to launch a coordinated response, another arm of the Government — AYUSH Ministry — has been at the centre of a large-scale misinformation campaign that undermines the Health Ministry's response. This needs to be corrected. 2) Second incident is that of a politician who was proposing raw cow urine (gaumutra) as a treatment of Covid-19, even while the scientists, including those in India, are battling to find a solution.

Similarly if we scan the social media, especially YouTube, one can find solution being suggested by all and sundry, ranging from outright astrology to homemade remedies, without any scientific backing.

Information of some myths prevailing in the social media domain such as “longevity of coronavirus”, “non-survivability of the virus in hot climate”, “totkas”, “possible alternate medicines to cure Covid-19”, “holding the breath, to check if someone is affected by corona” and so on will only cause complications and problems in management of affected cases. Towards this end, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strong message of not taking any medicines without proper consultation with a qualified doctor hopefully will go a long way in curbing the misinformation campaign.

However, the PM’s call has to be backed by a focused mechanism to eradicate the menace of misinformation campaign. How can we do it? Some of the measures suggested are as follows. 1) Ministry of Health can set up a task force in consultation with Ministry of Information to scan the social media and put out the truth on regular basis in the form of press briefs or press bulletins using all available media networks for countering or clarifying such messages and information. It is not that the task force should respond to every fake and silly news. However, it must put out clarification on any incorrect and fake news item that is likely to cause harm to human lives and national economy. If we do not curb the misinformation campaign in time, the 21-day lockdown may not be fully successful and as PM Modi had warned nation will have to pay a heavy price in terms of unprecedented loss of human lives and economic cost.

2) Second measure could be co-opting the technical giants like Facebook, WhatsApp, twitter and other technical firms to direct all searches related to Covid-19 lead either to Ministry of Health or Ministry Information or WHO sites only, so that people are given correct information. As per the report mentioned above, some of the big technological companies are already helping the WHO in this regard. There is a need for Indian Government to also see the feasibility of doing the same in our context.

3) While the Government has launched an awareness campaign about Covid-19 through caller tunes and advertisements, there is need for a focused nationwide programme on important aspects dealing with the pandemic at a fixed time in the day with repeat broadcast by all TV and radio channels. This slot must capture the highlights of the day and important procedures to be followed in managing Covid-19.

The importance of curbing misinformation can be best understood by the statement made by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He had said recently that “Misinformation about Covid-19 is not limited to India. We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.” Therefore, in this period of infodemic, the safest advice is to stay indoors, wash hands regularly, maintain social distancing, and if in doubt seek early medical assistance and help Government help you in remaining safe.

89,29-3-20,Beat Covid-19 blues,"India is under lockdown for 21 days. This could lead to fear and anxiety in people. MUSBA HASHMI speaks with wellness and mental gurus who tell you how to cope with this and stay calm

While some of us are enjoying this 21 days lockdown and taking it as an opportunity to spend time with our families others are already tired of staying at home. Not only that, anxiety, stress and panic are here to add to all our coronavirus blues.

The fast increasing cases and the 17 deaths that have been reported in India till now are in itself disturbing and alarming. However, all possible measures are taken by the Government to atleast slow down the spread of the virus if not control it completely.

Rishikesh Kumar, fitness expert & founder, Xtraliving says that it is important to stay calm and compose in these hard times and not worry about physical distancing.

“Over the last few days there have been a lot of stress and anxiety among people about the lockdown. People don’t know what to do in such a situation and that is what making them fret a lot. First thing that should be done is such testing times is to abide the rules made by the Government. There are no ifs and buts. The priority should be keeping yourself and your family safe at all times. Proper hygiene should be maintained and handwashing goes without saying. Second, extra care should be shown to people who are more vulnerable to the infection — children and the elderly. Third, boost your immunity. Now, while all of us are locked down, we have to make use of the resources available to us. Nutrition, exercise and proper sleep is the key here,” he tells you. Basic 15 minutes of home workout, he says, is good enough to maintain your fitness.

“Add a lot of dark leafy vegetables along with citrus fruits in your diet. Drink plenty of liquids. This combination helps a lot in keeping one healthy. Good sleep is just as important. For this one have to eliminate stress. We have to just let go things that are happening around us and learn to compromise with the situation because there is nothing much we can do about it. Taking unnecessary stress and angsting about things that are not in your hands is the worst one can do to his body and mind,” he says.

Self-isolation is also adding to the already existing anxiety and fear in people. “Humans are social animals. We need people around us most of the time. Therefore, social distancing is not the right thing to do but physical distancing is. There’s a difference between the two. We should focus on improving our social relationship by reaching out to old friends and family even if you have somehow lost touch with them. Call them up. Connect with everyone you can via internet and mobile phones. The need is for physical isolation not social,” Kumar says.

There are no two ways about it that couples are getting some extra ‘me time’. However, staying together for 24 hours a day is not what most people are used to. “Most couples have never stayed together for this long. It could definitely result in banters. To avoid that, couples can engage themselves in activities that they have always wanted to do. One can pursue their hobby of painting or cooking. This is the right time for giving wings to all your dreams, but by staying at home,” Ritika Jayaswal, mental wellness advocate and founder of Nourish Mantra tells you.

She adds that in order to eliminate fear about the coronavirus, people have limit reading about it. “Continuously reading about the virus and deaths related to it could result in increased fear. However, completely ignoring things is also not a solution. The best way here is to limit your reading or for that matter watching news related to it to just 45 minutes a day. Don’t keep on thinking about the same thing the whole day,” she says.

The other thing that is equally distressing for most people is their child’s extreme exposure to mobiles and technology.

“It is nothing short of a vacation for children. No school, no tuitions and only fun. This could lead to a complete disturbance in their schedule. Children are used to following timetables. Therefore, it is important for parents to make a proper timetable for their children and make them follow that by all means. Limit their screen time. Instead sit with them and play indoor games. Make a schedule for everything, from sleeping to eating to watching TV, everything should be done according to the timetable,” Jayaswal says.

Working on your mental wellness is just as important. “What is working for me during this time is yoga and meditation. It is important to keep yourself busy throughout the day to stop overthinking but that doesn’t mean you cannot relax. Do meditation and yoga or just improve your concentration levels by focusing on anything for few minutes. One can also focus on their breathing pattern. The simple science behind this is when your brain is in a panic mode, you tend to become short of breath. But when you focus on breathing, you force your body to sit down and take a deep breath. This on the other hand helps your brain to relax. There are a lot of people who say that they can’t even sit for 10 minutes and focus on anything. In such a case, they can take help of various apps. These apps have guided meditation, one can just sit and listen to it and that would work. They key here is to not panic and let your brain relax. This time too shall pass soon,” she tells you.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/beat-covid-19-blues-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/beat-covid-19-blues.html
90,29-3-20,‘We shouldn’t force artists to always give a social message’,"MUSBA HASHMI speaks with JATIN and MASSQLINE, about their rap song Bhartiya Rail, that personifies Indian unity and diversity through railways and how the creative idea hit them to give the song a hip-hop vibe

How did the idea of Bhartiya Rail come up?

Jatin: One of our friends was traveling by train. He wanted to travel in the first AC but he was not able to get a ticket and had to travel in third AC. He was telling me anecdotes about his journey. That’s when the idea hit me to write a song about the Indian railways. This is how Massquline and I came up with the song Bhartiya Rail.

How did the collaboration with Massquline happen?

Massqline: We had known each other since our college days. Two years ago we made a web series. It was about college romance where we made music together for the first time. It worked well. We received positive response from the public. That’s when we knew that we had something, some creative synergy that we both share, so we went on to explore it further.

Do you think there is a need for more such songs that give out a social message?

Jatin: I don’t think there’s a need, but yes if an artist wants to make something that has a social message and it’s that is coming from the heart of the artist, then it’s good. But we shouldn’t force artists to make stuff with a message. It’s their choice and after all it comes from the heart and soul, no one can force you to do it.

You both are popular for fusing hip hop and rap and rock in music. Where did you get your inspiration?

Jatin: Massqline comes from a hip-hop background. I’ve been in rock and metal so we fused it together. What makes us so unique is that we don’t try to copy anyone’s style, no matter how popular it is we like to create what we have in our own minds and thoughts. It’s completely original whatever we create. If you see the lyrics, they are very balanced. The amalgamation of hip hop and rock and metal comes out beautifully together which is seen in our music.

What does music mean to you?

Massqline: Music is something that I can connect with. It’s more of an easing force for me and I think for the rest of the world as well. I am actually a doctor by profession and now I am a musician too and music is my way of healing the world.

What kind of songs do you listen to?

Massqline: I like good music from all genres. The kind of music which holds me, which is always on my loop is the one that has an element of poetry in it — rap songs that have content of poetry in it. There is an artist from New York called Immortal Technique, he happens to be my favourite rapper. Eminem, KRS-One, Bohemia. All the artists who have used poetry in their lyrics, I like listening to them.

What are your upcoming projects?

Jatin: There are some Bollywood projects coming up but we have to figure out if we want to do it or not. We would want to focus on independent music. And there are four more songs coming up, every month a new song. We can’t talk about anything in detail at the moment. But one thing is sure, our upcoming tracks will be fresh and exciting.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---we-shouldn---t-force-artists-to-always-give-a-social-message----2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---we-shouldn---t-force-artists-to-always-give-a-social-message---.html
91,29-3-20,The toy story,"In light of the COVID-19 shutdown, all of us are facing the same question right now. How to engage children who are bubbling with energy but cannot go out and play? Here’s a solution that ensures good screen time along with essential skills.

Augmented Reality (AR) has taken the entire world by storm. New-age toymakers have taken to AR and developed toys that are interactive, educational, and of course, entertaining. But what does it mean for us as parents?

Here’s a quick guide on AR toys and how they are revolutionising education, one game at a time.

The link between the real (or physical) and the digital (or virtual) world, augmented reality is an interactive experience that blends both worlds.

In gaming, AR bridges the gap between the physical toy and the smartphone or tablet.

For instance, some games need you to use your smartphone to scan a real-world object to move ahead in the story. If the real-world object is a flashcard of a tiger, the smartphone presents interactive image, video or a 3D figure of the animal on the screen. In some games, the goal might be to find hidden objects by scanning your actual surroundings with your smartphone.

The reasons for the rise of AR toys are multifold. For starters, Gen Alpha kids are techsavvy and have access to smartphones, unlike previous generations. The prospect of bringing an object to life is fascinating and exciting.

If the topic at hand is how animals live in their natural habitat, AR can teach it through 3D models. Younger children can listen to the sounds the animal makes and understand its eating habits, all through stories and simple games. Meanwhile, older children can learn about the food chain and complex ecosystems, through interactive and informative games.

AR makes it possible to explore multiple avenues of learning and present various pieces of information in a visual, easy-to-understand manner. Where a regular map tells you about countries and capitals, an AR-powered globe takes learning to a whole new level. It not only teaches geography, but also introduces you to various cultures, cuisines, monuments, and animals — all at the touch of a button.

The AR technology also helps the child interact with the world around them and creates two-way interactivity, where the child feels like they have control over what they’re learning.

Moreover, AR creates a system of instant feedback that motivates the child to learn more and be more accurate.

With the increasing number of kids, parents, and educators alike who use AR-toys regularly, one thing’s clear. AR-powered learning toys are the next big thing in education, and by the looks of it, they’re here to stay.

93,29-3-20,"Be prepared, PM tells AYUSH professionals","Maintaining that the country must be ready to use the entire healthcare workforce to meet the Covid-19 challenge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asked Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) professionals to be in all readiness so that if the need arises, help from private doctors connected with alternative medicine system may be sought by the Government.

Currently, there are 7,99,879 AYUSH professionals from various streams across the States. It has been observed that Indian rural health system is totally dependent on ayush practitioners and Government hospitals.

The National Health Policy 2017 has already advocated mainstreaming the potential of AYUSH systems within a pluralistic system of Integrative healthcare.

Interacting with AYUSH professionals, he also underlined the importance of countering and fact-checking unsubstantiated claims of AYUSH having cure for the disease. He asked AYUSH scientists, ICMR, CSIR and other research organisations to come together for evidence-based research.

Interacting with AYUSH professionals from around the country through video conferencing, the Prime Minister said that there role has increased manifold in the ongoing efforts to tackle COVID-19.

He also observed that the network of AYUSH practitioners is spread throughout the length and breadth of the country and ""it is imperative for them to utilise this network, while working according to WHO guidelines, to spread the message of good practices which need to be adopted in the efforts to control the spread of the virus.""

Last week, the Union Cabinet had approved the inclusion of AYUSH Health and Wellness Centre (AYUSH HWC) component of Ayushman Bharat in the National AYUSH Mission (NAM). It aimed at establishing a holistic wellness model based on AYUSH principles and practices focusing on preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative healthcare by integration with the existing public health care system.

Modi also praised the AYUSH Ministry in promoting yoga at home to de-stress the mind and strengthen the body during this difficult phase.

Modi also suggested that AYUSH medicine producers could utilise their resources towards producing essential items like sanitisers which are in high demand and exhorted them to utilise the platform of telemedicine to reach out to the public and generate constant awareness to fight the pandemic. He also highlighted the importance of enforcing social distancing with full vigour to counter the spread of the pandemic.

The AYUSH practitioners also lauded the Prime Minister for leading the country's fight against COVID-19 and talked about the impact of these traditional practices towards boosting immunity.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/be-prepared--pm-tells-ayush-professionals.html

Social media is new opium of our masses. A two-way gate, where you listen to people and connect with people, instantaneously. Almost everyone uses it, in some form or the other, consciously or unconsciously guilty of making mistakes. With its rising popularity comes the challenges of bullying, trolling, circulating fake news, misinformation, violence, FOMO (Fear of missing out) and manipulations of facts. In such volatile environments, the onus cannot be put on ‘no one’, but ‘everyone’. It becomes essential that we act ‘now’ to communicate with a sense of responsibility, empathy, care and compassion. The ‘traffic light’ approach-stop, look and go, is the first check point for you.

Stop: Stop before you read, write and post. Pause for a minute. You probably may want to revisit if you want to read, write or post.

When I started investing, I had an ocean of information floating around, later to realise that I do not have enough bandwidth to read, much of it being repetitive and things I never need to know. I pruned it down to two, saving time. Social media is loaded with information. Everything that you read; you forget some, retain some and use some of this information later. What goes in, eventually, comes out in some form. Ensure that you are reading or writing about things which is worthy of your attention and not garbage for your mind, heart and soul. Would you be more interested to read about a celebrity and his Mauritius vacation or a scientific invention that has the potential to change the world? While both are okay depending on ‘who you are, what you want to read and where your interests lie’, thumb rule is to ‘downplay what you do not want to read’. Keep asking, ‘am I enriching myself by reading this piece of information?’ If yes, move ahead, if no, shun it down or block it. Limit yourself to an area or two that interests you. It could be your hobby, research, work or a social group.

The post that you just read is a wonderful piece and it agrees/disagrees to your established thought processes. Your hand itches to put down some comments, give a ‘piece’ of your mind to the author or laud him. Do you want to spend your precious minutes and is it worth doing it? If you are still not convinced, think about the dog who barks when your car passes by. It really does not matter for both. Irrespective of what role you play (dog or the driver), remember that the dog will forget after your car has passed and the driver will not have a second glance on you. When you are hurt, angry, rejected, dejected, in pain, avoid writing. When you want to vent out your frustration, correct someone who is grossly incorrect, bully someone or troll, rethink your decision. Applauding, appreciating, sharing your thoughts can be done without being a miser or sarcastic.

Stop being a virtual source of junk or a JIJO — Junk In, Junk Out. We have this precarious habit of sending out the information to everyone we know, or ‘think’ we know. Stop being the middleman for junk. People probably may be thoroughly offended with the piece of information shared, and you risk losing your personal brand and reputation. Be careful with your action. First, avoid spreading information unless it comes from an authentic source and second, avoid passing it on to others. If at all you need to, ensure that the information you spread around, is not negatively impacting any person, organisation or group adversely.

Look: Look, if your words or actions would demean someone, socially, physically or mentally. Are you being sarcastic, rude or just posting to have fun at the cost of the other? Is your intention good and acceptable?

If you have now decided to write it down, forward or post, ensure that you have a sanity check in place. Avoid the usage of ‘biased’ words. Ascertain your company’s policies on social networking. Avoid posting or writing on topics related to acts that are defamatory, political, or religious in nature. Ensure that the nature of your post is not damaging you or your organisation’s reputation. Are you oversharing, things which are untrue or unverifiable? Are you reacting to events or incidents, especially when things are flaring up? Are you lying or speaking half the truth? If yes, hold your message back. Remember that your image will be associated with ‘your’ content. Would you like to risk your reputation?

Go: Go, only if you are clear of your conscience that this is now ready for sharing, reading and adds substantial value to your readers. Posting to the social media means exposing yourself to everyone. Remember that some organisations as well as governments take keen interest in what you post. Their decisions as well as your future employment opportunities and your image can be severely affected based on what you post or what your interests are.

Communicating in the world of social media is different and complex. The audience is diverse and can reach out to everyone. You also need to keep doing the right things to keep your audience engaged. Here are some tips that are likely to help you:

Get your facts: Have you done your research for what you want to write. If you want people to read, you will need to engage them in a few words. The relevance of your content would matter the most to your audience. Understand your audience before you write and post. Get the right demographics and their level of understanding. Write content that is original or things that people would not have read anywhere. Your audience will check the ‘freshness’ of your post before it is read till the last.

Choose the right social platform: Choose the right platform. While posting on all platforms seems beneficial, it may not actually have the desired results. Find out what works for you. Do not spend money on a medium (if you are running a business) and forcing it to work for you. What works in Twitter, does not work with Facebook or vice versa.

Talk in a language, they understand: If you are a technology consultant writing a blog, you will need to use terminologies that your audience understand. Ensure that you know for whom you are writing and what you are writing. Keep it simple, precise and clear. Remember the KISS principle — Keep it simple, silly. Keep your language simple, easy to comprehend. Use headings, bullets and images. Avoid writing dragging paragraphs with one or two central ideas.

Use the ‘right’ images and videos: Never under play or over play with this powerful tool. It helps you tell a story and a picture is worth thousand words. But when the content is lousy and boring and refuses to engage the audience, it creates negativity. It can make or break your post, therefore use with clarity and be clear about how it helps you achieve your objective.

Call to action: Do you want only likes or upvotes or do you want to hear from your audience, or do you want them to share the content? Prompt your audience with what action you would want them to take. If you have not, then probably they would not.

Cross promote your profile or other content: If you are using multiple platforms or writing on different topics that interests you, ensure that you are cross promoting yourself. Ensure that you link to other articles, posts and write ups that interest you or encourage people to click on other things that you would have written.

In this chaos of engaging in multiple social media platforms and delivering engaging content to your audience you need to be effective and efficient with what you do. If you are the one, who engages mostly into reading and not generating content, you should spend time choosing on what you intend to read or not to read/comment. Follow the traffic light approach and spend a part of your day engaging with social media content.

If you are the one doing both, you may find yourself hard pressed against time. Your effectiveness will be guaranteed when you make the best use of the platforms. Here are things that would help you become effective:

First, give it some quite time of your day. It should not be the first thing in the morning, while driving or on the dining table but some time to respond to the social media activities. Ensure that you are not at the habit of responding immediately nor delaying your responses. You must have something original to offer or a pressing need. If you are talking something which people already know, you will not be able to garner their interest.

Second, cut down on peer pressure to ‘be in’. ‘Are you on Instagram?’ and you immediately start off with an account. You are a member of many such platforms, which you rarely visit or maintain. Can you find out a way to rationalise your social platform requirements? Can it be limited to only three? Ask these questions: First, are my contacts available in the platform I am using? Second, does the connections really justify a new platform? Third, how much of my leftover time will it take to manage this new platform.

Third, if you are managing your business and needs to connect to your customer or stakeholders, you cannot be doing it, alone. Take professional help. Agencies that will help you get your get your word ahead. In case you cannot, fix up a person from your organisation who would be doing that.

Fourth, remember that managing social media for businesses are different from that of individuals. The approach, methodology, purpose, usage, time required would be different. Responding to the messages, creating engaging content and writing is different. Use the most suitable platform. Don’t force it to work. Consider your limitations.

Fifth, acknowledge that social media is a two-way communication method. Just as you write, it is important to listen. When you listen, you tend to understand the likes and dislikes, of your audience, sharpening yourself. This needs a balance with your interests and skills sets. People will read you or follow you only when you are consistent. If you are irregular or spending too little time, posting or writing, your audience will not be incentivised to come back to read. A teaser on ‘what follows next’ can also motivate people to come back.

Use social media effectively to build relationships with people in your areas of interest. Share your expertise, offer help and engage with them. Treat them with the same degree of respect you would give, when you meet them in person. There is no denying that social media is effective in connecting with people and an excellent way to collaborate. But be aware that it is making us indolent and disrupting our need for a great conversation.

95,29-3-20,Beyond political ideologies,"Despite their leanings, spiritually conscious people respect all others on a spiritual plane, irrespective of one’s material position, writes Radhanath Swami

In modern political world there has been a constant conflict between values of conservatism and liberalism, fascism or socialism. The values of right wing are to acknowledge social orders and hierarchies, protectionism of individual’s, capital and property, security. The values of the left wing are egalitarianism — social equality among all strata of society, fairness, etc. Values of either of the wings are important but the question arises, how to make decisions which satisfy interests of the both of the parties.

Spirituality synthesises ideologies of both that is, the left and right wing. Spirituality acknowledges that on physical platforms there has to be hierarchy based on the natural order and individual preferences based on the psychophysical inclinations but on the spiritual platform, everyone is similar in nature beyond the physical boundaries of creed, caste, race, nationality or color. So, while dealing in this world, one may acknowledge differences, and act as per assigned roles and responsibilities, and yet respect the others, understanding their spiritual nature.

Spiritually conscious people respect others on a deep spiritual plane which is irrespective of one’s material position. The spiritual concept of Karma helps one to understand the reason for inequality seen in this world, still encouraging one to live a life with good karmas to have better opportunities for present and future and be not callous for the sufferings of other.

To give another example, left ideologists recommend higher taxes on the high net worth individuals for redistribution of wealth. But it risks of making people dependent on government and lazy. Spirituality aims to achieve same goal of equality by compassion and education. When individuals are educated about the equality of the living beings on the spiritual platform, they can see oneness among all other differences.

For those who learn spiritual path, practicing compassion becomes necessary to go ahead on the chosen path. Sharing of ones gifts with others becomes a source of pleasure and way of furthering ones prospects in the spiritual line. In this way, spiritually conscious people willingly share what they possess to those who need through the medium of God, although, such charity is not meant for lazy ones who want to avoid their duties but for those who are weak links of society or those who are contributing to the world without personal financial gains.

Right wing ideology focuses on preservation of one’s culture and heritage, specifically religiosity through government support, such conservative attitude sometimes results in violence or coercion against those who transgress the traditional norms and customs. Freedom of expression is seen as transgression by rightists when it doesn’t fit in traditional cultural ideas.

Leftists see such a place as a police state where people are controlled with the help of security establishment. Spirituality achieves aim of protection of one’s culture and heritage, religious tenets not through enforcing beliefs upon people by coercive means but by educating them about its importance, benefits and relevance. Such educated people willingly adhere to traditions if they find reasonable logic behind them.

There is no wonder that western world is getting more and more enamoured by the oriental wisdom over the decades, since there has been consistent efforts by various eastern philosophers to logically introduce them with their philosophy and practices, it has resulted in mushrooming of Yoga studios, kirtan clubs and Ayurvedic treatment centers all over the West especially USA. There are 300 million yoga practitioners all over the world including 36 million people in USA itself, it is an indication that people are increasingly adopting an age old practice when results are proven with the help of education and practical demonstration.

Spiritually advanced people know the art of changing the forms of traditions but maintaining the substance to have the same effect. The spiritual education which would happen at Guru’s ashram in forests, now happens in an air-conditioned classrooms of our temples, with the help of various types of media, although the gist of the content remains same. In this way the external aspects may be modified as per the time, place and situations to accommodate more quantity of people, but the core principles remain same to maintain the quality of them.

In this way, spirituality can play a major role in filling the gaps between these ideologies to have a peaceful society.

96,29-3-20,The formula of happiness,"Breathe-Observe-Smartphone fasting — Just add these three principles to life and see the difference it makes to your inner world, says Venugopal Acharya

There are some things that we have known since we were kids, and then there are others that we realise intuitively that guide us to what is good for us and what is not. Yet we never give it a serious try. And that could very well be the cause of our distress. Here are three known but least-tolerated life-changing principles to achieve happiness and contentment

B: Breathe. Just pause

We all breathe but are we conscious of it? In my seminars, I often ask participants to place their hands on their stomach and feel it as they inhale and exhale. When you breathe in, does your stomach come out or go in? What happens when you exhale? The class is often divided with half the students claiming that their stomach goes in during a deep inhale and the other half is unsure. The point driven home is emphatic: we don’t even know how to breathe, something which even animals do so naturally. Our disconnect with our self and nature is acute; we could therefore first learn to breathe normally and consciously.

A simple technique is to inhale deeply to the count of four, hold the breath to the count of eight and then exhale slowly to the count of eight. Focus on the sound of your breath; listen carefully as you inhale and exhale. In no time, you’ll catch your mind wandering. Gently bring the mind back to breathing and in 10 minutes you’ll be surcharged with fresh energy. A five-minute break a few times during the day or even a ten-minute breathing break could make your day more productive.

O: Observe more, judge less

Secondly, you could try simple ‘observations’ where you gently pull the mind back to the present and remove judgements. Once I was on a flight and saw a passenger stand up from his seat. He looked around, his face twitching, and then with a sudden grin, he hurriedly sat down again. A few seconds later, he rose again and paced up and down the aisle, murmuring to himself. He’s definitely angry with his wife, I thought to myself. Then I instantly realised I’d made a judgement. After all, how could I say he was ‘angry’ or she, his ‘wife’? Then I admonished myself for ‘judging’ the man and that again was a judgement! This time I gently said to my mind, “Please come back dear mind and observe without judgement.”

When you observe without attaching labels, you release yourself from your disarrayed mind and enter a higher dimension of reality. This is a platform beyond your own prejudices. Often we err because we observe little and analyse a lot. Instead, if we observe more and judge less, it’s likely we’ll see the real picture and paradoxically, improve our judgement! Observation practices are like bright sunshine; they help us remove the fog of confusion and bring clarity.

S: Smartphone fasting

The overdose of social media and the virtual world could potentially throttle their individuality. An inordinate time on the electronic world tends to disconnect one from his or her feelings and needs.

A modern variant of traditional fasting is giving up your gadgets for some time in a week. In many monasteries, monks occasionally fast from cooked grains and rice. Besides the spiritual benefits, this gives rest to our digestive system. The body releases toxins and you feel an overall sense of wellness. Likewise in our internal world, a lot of clutter gets flushed out when we ‘fast’ from social/electronic media. We could for a change experience ‘real’ exchanges.

More than ever before, we need to now pause, disengage from the loudness of it all, and look at the vast expanse of the sky above our heads, rather than on our gadgets. Let’s connect deeper to our own inner selves and catch the grace around us.

97,29-3-20,Tamoguna is lurking...,"Born of ignorance, tamoguna (or darkness inducing properties) causes delusion to all living entities, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

The Bhagavad Gita explains tamoguna: “The mode of darkness, that is tamoguna is born of ignorance. It causes delusion to all living entities. It binds with carelessness, laziness and sleep. (14.8) Darkness signifies anger (intolerance), greed, idle talk, violence, being a parasite, hypocrisy, excessive physical efforts, quarrel, lamentation, illusion, depression, being pathetic, excessive sleep, false expectations, fear and laziness. (Bhagavad Gita 11.25.4)

When this mode is predominant, absence of illumination, lack of motivation towards duty, carelessness, delusion and foolishness all these arise. (14.13) Consciousness gets covered with foolishness and dullness. Given to lamentation and getting deluded, one sleeps excessively; indulges in false hopes; and displays violence towards others. Awareness gets limited and one is unable to concentrate. The mind gets affected and there is preponderance of ignorance and depression. One, who dies predominantly in this mode is hell-bound, and, ultimately, is born in lower species. Work is impelled by violence and envy, and the strength of wicked people increases.

How do we identity if someone is essentially in tamoguna? One will get angry readily; worships God seeking His help for causing harm to one’s enemies; considers oneself a material body, not the soul that one is; takes shelter of a gambling den; performs acts without considering their consequences; is unable to tell right from wrong; eats food, which is unclean and which causes distress; is hardly conscious during sleep and has faith in irreligious activities. One’s happiness is in delusion and being pathetic; knowledge is at the material level and spiritual knowledge is alien to such a person.

We all have a percentage of this in us besides the mode of passion (rajoguna) and the mode of goodness (sattavaguna). Together they constitute us, and they always try to overpower one another. (14.10)

Have you ever wondered as to why some people commit suicide? Because the tamoguna in them overpowers them. This tamoguna, when it is at its peak, completely possesses and make one do what goes entirely against even our basic instinct of survival. How does it become so powerful inside of us? Because we associate with it its various forms. Beginning with the mind, we harbour sexual thoughts, angry feelings, greedy plans and hateful ideas, etc. One may feel that these are harmless. They are not; they reinforce tamoguna in us. And the punishment is from inside; one implodes. They cause fear, anxiety depression, etc. When such feelings peak, one harms the self helplessly, even to the extent of killing one’s own self.

How should one deal with this vicious internal enemy? Try to avoid associating with it. The mind should be controlled and no illicit or harmful thoughts should be encouraged. Nothing is harmless. Thoughts are also karmas and they cause karmaphalas. Similarly, we have to be careful in what we eat, see, hear, speak, etc. They all count. Eating meat and drinking alcohol reinforces tamoguna. Lust also enhances tamoguna in oneself. The same goes for hearing and speaking. Then the enhanced tamoguna acts from within. It causes fear, anxiety, depression, etc. Once it becomes highly potent, it can kill or force one to commit suicide.

I have realised the dangers associated with tamoguna, and have taken shelter of God. I pray regularly seeking God’s help in controlling my mind and senses. Whenever my mind strays, I chant. Similarly, when I have to make choices in what I eat, see or hear, I seek God’s guidance, and He obliges with the right intelligence. I am determined not to allow tamoguna inside me to cause havoc; I fully intend to tame it with my Lord’s help.

98,29-3-20,Astroturf : Revive age-old hygiene traditions,"The whole world is faced with a panic situation because of coronavirus scare. With over 175 countries in its grip, and the number of casualties heavily mounting, the pandemic is taking a toll on the physical and mental health of people and the state. The entire world is in a lockdown state and all of this is certainly going to take a toll on our economy, which was already hit hard.

Such situations serve as a reminder about the harsh realities of life, which most of us, caught up in the mundanities and routine, often forget. Ancient Indian learned masters, through allegories and similes, tried to raise our consciousness and make us aware that the world is a unified organism. One, that is set into an interdependent framework, where no individual has a reality independent of the entirety. The obvious implication is that resonance of the echoes at one end of the globe shall have far reaching consequences. That makes it imperative that aberration of even a few, knowingly or inadvertently, could threaten our very existence. So, no wonder, what began in China, has spread its wings all across the globe. That calls for remaining conscious about our collective obligation even while pursuing one’s individualistic aspirational urges.

The above concept seems to have gone out of the reckoning of most of the leaders of leading nations, not to say anything on individual beings. Otherwise, they would not be passionately trying to excite emotional chord of people to build up their vote bank, as has been evident in the recent years. The present crisis is a wake-up call for them. If, however, they join hands, quality of human life may improve substantially, not simply in terms of health but economy as well. Statistics available suggest that whenever world trade goes strong, each country’s economy grows. But whenever world trade took a downturn in the past, world war happened.

The universe being a unified organism, would also mean that there remains connect and correspondence between the cosmic line up, continuously changing, and the live world on the earth. That offers us with the opportunity to foresee things expected to happen through prognosis of the changing dynamics of the planetary line up in the cosmos. Most important markers in this respect, in so far as mundane matters are concerned, are major eclipses happening every year.

During eclipse, the Sun, which is supposed to be health manager of the Universe comes under cloud together with Moon which signifies masses. Whenever the Ascendant at time when the Sun and Moon are in exact conjunction, has close linkage with the death indicating 8th house denominator, points to the possibility of heavy mortality. Major eclipses during the years, 1915, 1918, 1920, 1957, 1968, and 2009 bear testimony to the above fact. No wonder pandemic overtook almost the whole world during those years when more than hundred thousand people died because of one form of virus or the other.

Another common factor noticed, except in 1920 was cluster of more than four planets on eclipse axis. But then, in 1920’s chart, death indicating 8th lord Saturn was placed adverse to Rahu. The Sun and Moon were ill-disposed off to mischievous Neptune and Uranus, meaning massive death unusual way. Kindly recall my discussion on eclipse chart of December 26, 2019 in the opening issue of the year. There was a cluster of seven planets — the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Ketu, Saturn, and Pluto on the eclipse axis. Out of them, Saturn and Pluto are death indicating planets, the latter being more lethal. If that would not be enough, even the 8th lord Mercury happened to occupy lunar constellation owned by another death indicating planet Ketu. What further worsened the situation was placement of Rahu in Mercury owned sign Gemini. Even otherwise, Gemini relates to lungs.

Bear in mind: the world is premised on the concept of ‘Unity in Diversity’. Accordingly, it’s time now that we resolve to remember our collective obligations, remain alert, and revive our age-old tradition of maintaining cleanliness. Till recent past, in our villages, whenever somebody came from outside, they washed their hands and feet before entering the house. Even as on date, Muslims wash their hands, feet and face before they enter the Mosque to offer their prayer.

99,29-3-20,Class of 2020,"The deadly Coronavirus has pushed millions of students worldwide to the brink of a lost session. SHALINI SAKSENA explores how online education is being seen as a saviour in these lockdown times

According to a UNESCO report 130 countries have implemented nationwide closure of educational institutes, impacting over 80 per cent of world’s student population. In India, it has impacted 250 million school-going students and millions of college-goers. Though it is of paramount importance that they remain safe and at home, it is just as important that their education is not interrupted.

To ensure students don’t lag behind academically, many educational institutes across the country have shifted from physical classroom learning to online mode for several programmes. The JK Business School (JKBS) has partnered with Google to conduct all its classes and official work online. This means that institute can host meetings with up to 250 participants, live stream to up to one lakh viewers within a single domain and record and save meetings and classroom sessions to Google Drive.

Professor (Dr) Sanjiv Marwah, director JKBS tells you that this global health crisis will not hamper their belief of delivering intellectual excellence to their students. “While students, faculty and staff were told to leave campus after the Holi break to ensure social distancing, they all are today, completely networked and connected through online mode of teaching and learning. We are a socially righteous and technologically advanced institute and believe that digital and virtual space should be effectively used to ensure everyone’s physical safety at the same time, the school stands committed to deliver quality education to its students and we are doing so,” Marwah says.

Like, JKBS, there are several educational institutes that are looking at alternatives. Over the years, many edtech have come up to offer online learning. While there was a lot of lip service that it was a good option, there weren’t many takers since students continued to throng physical campuses. Today, things are different. The campuses are empty. Parents and students don’t lose out academically given the uncertainty for how long the lockdown will continue. The online mode of education is no longer an option but a necessity. The advancement in technology has made it possible for institutes to offer a real live classroom experience sitting at home even though there may be hiccups to begin with.

Nitish Jain, president of SP Jain School of Global Management, which has campuses in Dubai, Singapore, Sydney and Mumbai, tells you that given the present pandemic of coronavirus and social distancing everything has moved online. “It reminds me of the turn-of-the-century times that gave huge boost to the IT industry. This is one such time for online education. People have been looking at the online education for a long time. But it never picked as since students went to a physical campus. We also have a mindset that online classes are boring and going to a physical campus is the only way to learn. To an extent this is true. One would rather see a physical Professor teaching and engage with him. But schools like us have developed online education with high level of technology which is engaging. We call it Engaged Learning Online (ELO). There are two other universities that I know of that uses this technology — Harvard and Oxford,” Jain says.

The technology is such that one can feel the physical presence of a Professor in the classroom. To begin with, there weren’t many takers for this interactive technology. “We needed people to try it but there weren’t any takers since there was no compelling need. Now in the last six weeks we have had 2,000 students who are on to this. While this was not the way we had wanted a breakthrough, but the industry has got the boost it needed,” Jain tells you. While, it is expensive to develop the technology, an expense for the educational institute to invest in, for students there is available at no extra financial burden.

“The ELO allows students sitting anywhere in the world have access to a live classroom and hence a huge benefit They can be in the comfort and safety of their homes and gain knowledge with no compromises,” Jain says.

Jain tells you that it is important to understand the difference between synchronous and asynchronous learning when it comes to online learning. Asynchronous learning means that there are pre-recorded lectures. While MOOCs became popular because one had an Ivy League Professor teaching at no cost, there was a fated flaw and hence only five per cent completed it. When given a choice of when to learn, a student is not going to do so. In synchronous learning, live Professor is teaching. But there are roadblocks here as well since the teaching happened over Google hangout with a headset. Again, not in tune with being in a physical classroom. The ELO puts one is a situation of a live class where one can see one’s peers and the Professor, attendance is taken and students can ask questions. All we need a top-notch Professor, say from Sydney campus, teaching executives sitting in Nagpur. Technology is changing everything including education,” Jain opines.

Does that mean that the country’s education system is in for a revolution? Does this mean that we are looking at a situation where physical classrooms will disappear? Are we looking at a new method of teaching? One is told that that there is no one scenario to fit all. There will some programmes that will totally be taught online and the rest may have a combination of online-offline classes – hybrid classes. “This is because technology has the benefit to reduce tuition fee. Those students who can’t afford to study programmes due to financial constrains now have access to it. Online learning will also ensure a wider reach for the institutes. Also, certain classes, executive programmes and adult education, will go online,” Jain says.

It is not just higher education where subtle changes are taking place. Platforms like Geneo, an interactive digital space by Schoolnet India Limited, have announced free live classes for students of Classes VI to X on its learning platform. It is offering live classes for Math, Science and English based on the first term syllabus of the new academic year of CBSE schools and those schools following the NCERT textbooks. The mentors will conduct topic-wise classes based on the school curriculum. Sessions will include access to learning videos and exploriments on the platform to achieve concept clarity.

Shourie Chatterji, head, Digital Initiatives, Schoolnet India Ltd explains: “With COVID-19 outbreak, the learning lifestyle of millions of students has been affected across the world. Access to quality learning is imperative for holistic learning of the students. We ensure learning never stops and that students continue to receive quality education.” To access the live classes, students can visit www.geneo.in and create a free sign up. Once logged in they should select the appropriate standard and click on join live classes. Students will get access to the classes schedule and all the learning material upon accessing it on mobile phones, PCs, laptops, chrome books and tablets.

Minal Anand, CEO, GuruQ, an online tutoring platform, tells you that their intention is not to replace home tutors but to act as a compliment to the existing system. “Parents have always preferred home tutors. But now, they have had to shift to online since there is no option. This has given edtech a shot in the arm in these sad and tumultuous times. It has helped parents change their mindset that online education is not a waste of time and is good. The online platform offers 24x7 knowledge and students can choose a suitable time and study accordingly. Parents too can monitor what their ward has learnt for that day,” Anand says.

It goes without saying that online learning comes with its share of distractions and disruptions since students are not time-bound to study and there is no regimen which can be a cause of worry. However, there are some online classes where the teacher can cut those students out who are not paying attention or mute them as a sigh of punishment just in a live classroom scenario. Though it all sounds like a scene from a sci-fi movie, the fact is that the shift to hybrid learning has years to go before it can a permanent feature in a country like ours as there are several hindrances to overcome.

First, the parents who have had offline education. “They feel that if a system was good for them, it is god for their child. Second, the infrastructure. Online learning needs a good Internet connectivity. Parents still don’t understand the benefit of high-speed connectivity. One can’t have Rs 400-Rs 500 data package for the entire house and expect good connectivity. Third, broadband companies need to lower their cost to make is accessible to middle class families so that it is conducive for their children to study online,” Anand tells you.

Saiju Aravind, founder of EduBrisk tells you with certainty that physical classrooms are not going to disappear as they offer something beyond knowledge and rote learning. “Schools teach so much more than academics. It teaches life skills and communication skills, how to share things, it is about character building and regimented discipline. So physical classrooms will not disappear and therefore, learning environment will not change. It is a similar situation when computers were introduced in Railways and people feared job loss,” Aravind says.

He sees the present scenario as a blessing in disguise for the online education even though it is bad bargain. “Major developments took place due to constrains. This is a typical case of constrain. While online courses have been there for years, it is all augmented learning. These were great tools in the hands of regular teachers. But now, three things are likely to take place in the near future,” he says.

First, technology empowerment, how people will take to adaptive learning. Second, very high-level of curriculum adaptation by teachers where they will have a lot more at their disposal to play around with the curriculum and an exam system based on them. Third and the most powerful -- the analytics-based intervention. In other words, teachers will teach to the exact needs of the students.

Educationist Dr Shayama Chona tells you that given the present situation, there is no choice but to go online. “There are many free apps from the Government and even CBSE, an effort that needs to be lauded, that one can access for learning and students can utilise their time optimally,” Chona says.

She tells you that online mode is not an option but is a parallel to offline education. “There are many children who are disabled. The online mode is a boon for such students. However, there is no replacement for schools. They are more than just a place where a student goes to gain knowledge. A school is a place where it teaches how to interact with peers, it teaches social quotient and there is sports that adds to a child’s physical development,” Chona says.

Kamini Vidisha, founder ACadru, an online learning platform that offers multi-disciplinary modules and practical experiences, tells you that there are several advantages of e-learning. “It is extremely affordable. Second, accessibility as people have powerful streaming on their mobiles it makes it virtual learning from any place. Third, efficacy. While it is low in e-learning since it is linear but there are many edtech platforms that offer multi-disciplinary modules. This means that even an engineering student has to take up an Arts subject leading to a more experiential learning,” Vidisha says.

Therefore, platforms like Webinar can step in to offer a solution where it is not just Professor to student interaction but also among peers. The future she sees is one where the student may have to go through a pre-recorded lecture first before there is a physical lecture on deeper understanding of the subject with the Professor and peers discussing could be the way forward.

Dr Akhil Shahani, MD, The Shahani Group that provides careers to lakhs of students via its academic initiatives says that due to COVID-19, there is a shift to online mode. “There are many platforms like Zoom and Google Classroom that any educationist can use. Now, people who were giving lip service will have to adapt to these changes and this will lead to major change in the edtech industry, Shahani says.

Even though online education has been there for some time, what needs to be done is to take it to the next level. “Students have now realised that learning is 24X7, just like in the corporate world where there is constant exchange of ideas and emails. Students are now stepping out of physical classrooms and believe that learning can be anywhere and anytime. There will be distractions, A student will want to get up to have coffee or take a bathroom break. He may even have the lecture running and not pay attention. But there are ways to monitor that students actually study. One is to give them assignments and projects to do. Second, go for online doctoring. While this may appear to be intrusive, it is an effective way to ensure students study even while at home,” Shahani tells you.

He doesn’t see this change as a phase. Once the mindset and behavioural change takes place, people will adapt. Once they realise that online learning is just as good and they actually enjoy it, even if they have an option of going offline, they still stick to online. However, Shahani doesn’t see one module that will fit all. What he sees is smaller classrooms with collaborative exchange with 10-15 students. “This is when educationists might realise in the long run that they need smaller building and classrooms with facilitated interaction versus pure classroom learning,” Shahani says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/class-of-2020-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/class-of-2020.html
100,29-3-20,‘Online study an excellent option in present situation’,"SHALINI SAKSENA speaks with AAKASH CHAUDHRY, director Aakash Educational Services Limited about the revolution taking place in education in times of COVID-19

Are we looking at a revolution in how we are going to teach?

There is an absolute change in the mindset of the parents and students. We had kids who had enrolled for our offline courses to begin on March 18 and March 24. We offered to shift them to online mode and all of them agreed.

We started our batches from March 18. Earlier, while the student stayed home, the teachers were coming to the centres. But now, we have shifted the systems to the mentor’s homes who are teaching from morning to late night.

People are experimenting and while this is not 100 per cent replacement to physical education, it is an excellent option in the given situation.

At least e-learning is helping students to gain knowledge and not sit idle.

What are the challenges when you take education to the digital platform?

We have been offering online live classes for the last five years and made ample changes. The platform we are using is fully interactive where a student can interrupt the ongoing class and ask questions.

The challenge comes in the form of the Internet connection and the device the student is using. We try and give free information. Then there are the connectivity issues at tutors’ homes now.

Will online education be a permanent feature or is this a temporary phase?

This will leave some impact on physical classroom teaching. Kids would like to come to centres for lesser number of days for physical classes.

They would prefer to learn from home and come to centres for deeper learning. Physical and digital combination will emerge to redefine how kids will be taught.

What will it mean for the students and coaching institute?

Students choose a coaching institute on the bases of access, proximity and finances. Online mode is cheaper and kids who earlier didn’t have access to quality education will now have that. For the coaching institutes as well, it will mean one can increase more batches and reach out to a lot more students with the online-offline combination. People will not be now just looking at one kind of education mode.

How well-placed and prepared are you?

We have been working in the digital space since 2012. We are fully geared and prepared to teach students in hundreds of thousands from their homes where they are safe.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---online-study-an-excellent-option-in-present-situation---.html
101,29-3-20,Civic body stamps Haasan as ‘home quarantine’ by mistake,"Kamal Haasan, actor-turned-politician — was in for a shock on Saturday morning when he saw the Chennai Corporation’s green sticker warning people pasted on the gates of his house in Alwarpet.

The green coloured “Home Quarantined” sticker was a warning to outsiders to stay off the premises of the palatial house of Ulaga Nayagan (Universal Hero) , as the actor prefers to be addressed by all.

Local TV news channels, who are looking forward for signs of even minute ‘mishaps’ went to the town with Breaking News that the actor has tested positive for coronavirus and has been quarantined at his house.

Within one hour, employees working for Haasan got the sticker removed and told onlookers that it was a case of mistaken identity. The actor himself issued a clarification stating that he was no more a resident of the house at Alwarpet and it is being used as the office of the political outfit launched by him.

G Prakash, Commissioner, Chennai Corporation, told reporters that it was a case of mistaken identity. “It is a clerical error. The concerned officials in Chennai Corporation had received information that the resident of the house had returned from Dubai recently and as part of government guidelines that they have to be in isolation for the next fortnight,” said Prakash.

It was found that Gautami, Tamil filmdom’s lead star in yesteryears who was a live-in partner of Ulaga Nayagan, had given the address of Alwarpet in her passport.

Though the two parted ways some years ago, she did not inform the passport office about the change of address. The civic body officials who were under the impression that the duo were staying in the same house pasted in the sticker cautioning outsiders about the quarantined star.

“The sticker was based on the passport details. One or two instances may happen like this. Please don’t blow it up,’’ said Prakash.

The Saturday morning faux pas brought smiles to the faces of the actor’s neighbors who are familiar with his adventure filled romantic life.

104,29-3-20,Online education on rise since corona outbreak,"With people and students staying indoors ever since the beginning of the country wide lockdown, there has been an increase of users on the digital platforms of education.

According to the HRD Ministry, the digital education initiatives have registered an increase in users and HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said that the access to the National Online Education Platform SWAYAM and other Digital Initiatives has tripled in the last one week.

The increase in the users is also because of the provision of free access. Earlier the courses on SWAYAM were time bound and students needed to register in advance.

The SWAYAM courses can now be viewed by any learner free of cost without any registration. About 50,000 people have accessed SWAYAM since March 23, 2020. This is over and above the 25 lakh students/learners who are already enrolled in the 571 courses of the January 2020 semester of SWAYAM. SWYAM has about 1900 courses which can be accessed by people in over 60 countries. The videos of the SWAYAM Prabha DTH TV channels are viewed by around 50,000 people every day. The National Digital Library is now being accessed by about 43,000 people daily which is more than double of the usual number of persons accessing it. The Education portals of NCERT like Diksha, e-pathasala, NROER and NIOS and the other ICT initiatives like Robotics education (e-Yantra), Open Source Software for Education (FOSSEE), Virtual experiments (Virtual Labs) and Learning programming (Spoken tutorial) are also experiencing very large access rates.

105,29-3-20,Human rights bodies ask police to ensure marginalised are not mistreated during lockdown,"The Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Saturday urged police forces in the country to act with restraint while maintaining law and order during the coronavirus lockdown.

The lockdown has left millions stranded, struggling to search for food and water, Amnesty International India (AII) executive director Avinash Kumar said in a statement. ""Unfortunately for these people, a state machinery has become a larger threat than the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.

This is ""unfortunate"" and the Indian Government must ensure that ""insensitivity and brute force be replaced by people-friendly measures in battling the pandemic"", he said.

Kumar said India should respect and protect the rights of those under quarantine and ensure that their basic needs are met, including adequate shelter, food, water and sanitation.

HRW South Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly too urged Indian authorities to

ensure that everyone has access to food and medical care, and that the poor and marginalised are not mistreated or stigmatised.

""The Indian Government's responsibility to protect its people from the outbreak should not come at the cost of human rights violations,"" she said.

Tens of thousands of out-of-work migrant workers are stranded with rail and bus services shut down in the country. ""Police actions to punish those violating orders have reportedly resulted in abuses against people in need,"" she alleged.

""Indian police should be ordered to act with restraint while enforcing the lockdown. In several states, photos and videos show police beating people who are trying to get essential supplies. In West Bengal,

110,29-3-20,Hyd varsity prof cracks corona code,"Amid a frightening picture being painted by coronavirus concerns across the world, there's a ray of hope emerging from the University of Hyderabad (UoH). In what could be a welcome breakthrough for the country and even the world, a faculty member of the biochemistry department has developed a possible vaccine against the dreaded coronavirus infection.

A statement issued by University of Hyderabad (UoH) states that Dr Seema Mishra, faculty of the Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, has designed potential vaccine candidates, called T cell epitopes, against all the structural and non-structural proteins of novel coronavirus-2 (2019-nCoV) for experimental testing.

These vaccine candidates are small coronaviral peptides, molecules which are used by cells to trigger an immune response to destroy cells harbouring these viral peptides.

Using powerful immunoinformatics approaches with computational softwares, Dr Seema Mishra has designed these potential epitopes in a way that can be used to vaccinate an entire population.

Usually, vaccine discovery takes 15 years, but the powerful computational tools helped in quickly enlisting these vaccine candidates in about 10 days.

A ranked list of potential candidate vaccines, based on how effectively they will be used by human cells to stop the virus, has been generated. With no matches present in human protein pool, these coronaviral epitopes pose no cross-reactivity to human cells and hence, the immune response will be against viral proteins and not human proteins. However, these results have to be investigated experimentally in order to provide conclusive evidence.

These results have been disseminated to the scientific community using ChemRxiv preprint platform for urgent experimental assays.

Acknowledging that currently social distancing remains the best defence against nCov infections, the University of Hyderabad (UoH) stated that vaccination will take some time as further work is needed on the candidate epitopes.

""We are hopeful that our computational findings will provide a cost-and-time-effective framework for rapid experimental trials towards an effective nCoV vaccine,"" the statement said.

The University of Hyderabad clarified that although the research has been disseminated, the scientific community, in vitro studies are required to be conducted for establishing the findings conclusively.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hyd-varsity-prof-cracks-corona-code.html

For its part, the Maharashtra Government has asked farmers to form groups to sell vegetables and other essential items directly to consumers during the lockdown and to allow farmers to ferry the produce. Presently, 1,600- 1,800 wholesale mandis have started functioning partially and fully despite the shortage of labourers. There are 6,900 mandis in the country.

Farmers across the country are in panic because the ripening fruits and vegetables will rot because mandi operations have almost stopped, and labour cannot reach farms due to transport bottlenecks. Marketing of produce is now becoming a challenge for the farmers. Officials of Haryana Agriculture Department said that farmers who usually sell their crops through an established supply chain that was set up by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee’s (APMCs) have adopted a method to avoid market yards and sell their produces from their doorstep. Several farmers have started to sell their products from the farm and started supplying through their tractors.

Yudhvir Singh of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, claimed that most of the APMCs are closed at all major markets. “There are restrictions regarding the movement also. So in a scenario like this, the farmers have no option but to sit at home with their produce lying on the field. Therefore, more and more farmers are now resorting to this mode of trade because they need money immediately so that by March end, they can repay their loan obligations,"" Singh added.

Binod Pandey of All India Kisan Mahasanghthan said that at a time when APMCs are closed and supply chains are disrupted, the off-market sales model may rescue many farmers, who are often found off-guard and are vulnerable in times of natural calamities or market-driven fluctuations. “Therefore, more and more farmers are now resorting to this mode of trade because they need money immediately so that by March end, they can repay their loan obligations”, Pandey added.

Officials of agriculture ministry said that in Haryana, most of the APMCs have been closed. Some of them are opened but facing uphill tasks due to shortage of labourers.

In Gujarat, There was confusions as grain APMCs has been told to open markets on Thursday, but on Friday said that they had spoken to farmers and traders, with all of them having agreed to resume on April 2.

132,29-3-20,Tech volunteers use 3D printers to make crucial virus masks,"3D printer owners across Britain have answered the call of health leaders by teaming up to produce thousands of face visors to protect medical workers from being infected with coronavirus.

The project, known as 3DCrowdUK, launched on Monday after medical institutions raised the alarm about potential equipment shortages due to the closure of supply factories affected by the virus.

“We are basically getting all the people around the country who have 3D printers and we’re enlisting them in our project to create face shields for the NHS,” digital artist and 3D printer owner Seb Lee-Delisle told AFP.

“We literally set it up on Monday and by now we have got hundreds and hundreds of people involved.” The shortage of masks arose after factories in China closed due to the spread of the coronavirus in January and February.

The masks are easy to assemble. Once the 3D printers have created the headband, a plastic film is placed on the front and elastic attached the back to hold it in place.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/tech-volunteers-use-3d-printers-to-make-crucial-virus-masks.html
133,29-3-20,Clashes erupt as people try to enter virus-hit Hubei,"In a rare display of public anger in China, dozens of people in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak till recently, attacked official vehicles after they were stopped from crossing a bridge and travel to neighbouring Jiangxi after the lifting of the lockdown.

Hubei province with over 56 million people was kept under lockdown from January 23 as part of aggressive measures to bring down COVID-19 cases which rapidly spread in the area.

Videos on Chinese social media on Friday showed unprecedented scenes of police from Hubei and Jiangxi clashing on the bridge connecting the two provinces over barricades erected from stopping Hubei people from moving out over fears of coronavirus spreading.

Policemen from both sides argued over how to verify if people were allowed to enter Jiangxi, according to local media reports. It was a major relief for millions of people in Hubei province, when the Chinese Hovernment which kept it under lockdown lifted the restrictions on travel.

The Government will permitted people from the province to travel if they hold a green health code, meaning no contact with any infected or suspected COVID-19 cases.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/clashes-erupt-as-people-try-to-enter-virus-hit-hubei.html

Virus prevention measures have taken a violent turn in parts of Africa as countries impose lockdowns and curfews or seal off major cities. Health experts say the virus’ spread, though still at an early stage on the continent, resembles that of Europe, adding to widespread anxiety. Cases across Africa were set to jump above 4,000 on Saturday.

135,29-3-20,Wall Street tumbles after US tops world in virus cases,"US stocks ended significantly lower amid the fast-growing spread of coronavirus in the country.

On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 915.39 points, or 4.06 per cent, to 21,636.78. The S&P 500 decreased 88.60 points, or 3.37 per cent, to 2,541.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 295.16 points, or 3.79 per cent, to 7,502.38, Xinhua news agency reported. 10 of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors traded lower, with energy down 6.93 per cent, becoming the worst-performing group. Utilities climbed 0.53 per cent, the only gainer among the sectors.

The US became the country with the most COVID-19 cases worldwide on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University. As of 2 pm Eastern Time on Friday (1800 GMT), there were 94,238 confirmed cases in the United States, with 1,438 deaths, data from the university’s Centre for Systems Science and Engineering showed. A shocking number of Americans applied for jobless benefits last week due to the coronavirus outbreak.

US initial jobless claims, a rough way to measure layoffs, were registered at 3,283,000 in the week ending March 21, an increase of 3,001,000 from the previous week’s revised level, the Department of Labor reported Thursday. The reading easily crushed the previous record rise of 695,000 in October 1982.

137,29-3-20,"Virus infections top 6L worldwide, long fight ahead","The number of confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide topped 6,20,000 on Saturday as new cases stacked up quickly in Europe and the United States and officials dug in for a long fight against the pandemic.

The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by John Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 6,07,000 cases and a total of over 28,000 deaths.

While the US now leads the world in reported infections — with more than 1,04,000 cases — five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.

“We cannot completely prevent infections at this stage, but we can and must in the immediate future achieve fewer new infections per day, a slower spread,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in quarantine at home after her doctor tested positive for the virus, told her compatriots in an audio message. “That will decide whether our health system can stand up to the virus.”

The virus already has put health systems in Italy, Spain and France under extreme strain. Lockdowns of varying severity have been introduced across Europe, nearly emptying streets in normally bustling cities, including Paris where drone photos showed the city’s landmarks eerily deserted.

Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, said that Germany — where authorities closed nonessential shops and banned gatherings of more than two in public — won’t relax its restrictions before April 20.

Spain, where stay-at-home restrictions have been in place for nearly two weeks, reported 832 more deaths on Saturday, its highest daily total yet, bringing its total to 5,690. Another 8,000 confirmed infections pushed that count above 72,000.

Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in its worst-hit regions are falling ill at an alarming rate and working nonstop. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected.

“We are completely overwhelmed,” said ambulance medic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona’s Dos de Maig hospital. “Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. ... And the average age is decreasing. They’re not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old.”

“Sometimes you become a bit paranoid, you don’t know any more when you pick up the phone if you have cleaned your hands, if you’ve sanitized them or not. You touch your face with your hands,” Rojo said.

Spain has struggled to get coronavirus tests and protective gear for health workers. The government has started flights to transport the supplies directly from China to reduce waiting times.

As the epicenter has shifted westward, the situation has calmed in China, where some restrictions on people’s lives have now been lifted. Six subway lines restored limited service in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, after the city had its official coronavirus risk evaluation downgraded from high to medium on Friday. Five districts of the city of 11 million people had other restrictions on travel loosened after their risk factor was downgraded to low.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death.

More than 130,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins’ tally.

In one way or another, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike.

On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus.

He said he would continue to work from self-quarantine. Countries are still scrambling bring home some citizens stranded abroad by border closures and a near-shutdown of flights. On Saturday, 174 foreign tourists and four Nepali nationals on the foothills of Mount Everest were flown out days after being stranded on the only airstrip serving the world’s highest mountain.

In neighboring India, authorities sent a fleet of buses to the outskirts of the capital to meet an exodus of migrant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages during the world’s largest lockdown.

Thousands of people had fled their New Delhi homes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown that began on Wednesday and effectively put millions of Indians who live off daily earnings out of work.

In parts of Africa, virus prevention measures have taken a violent turn as countries impose lockdowns and curfews or seal off major cities, with police in Kenya firing tear gas and officers elsewhere captured in mobile phone footage whacking people with batons.

In the United States, New York remained the worst-hit city, but Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.

New Orleans’ sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.

In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalised with COVID-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.

The struggle to defeat the virus will take “weeks and weeks and weeks,” Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center.

President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators.

Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.

Dr. John Brooks of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained “in the acceleration phase” of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk.

She also assured that she will talk to states and ensure that there are no restrictions in the movement of cash, bankers, vendors or bank mitra.

“Appreciate the service Bank Mitra/Banking Correspondents are undertaking across the country. Will talk to states — request no restrictions in their movements. Will speak to all banks to facilitate cash flow. Let’s ensure timely access to all,” the Finance Minister said in a series of tweets.

145,29-3-20,Coronavirus scare: FPIs pull out over Rs 1 lakh cr in Mar,"As the coronavirus pandemic is triggering fears of a global recession, foreign investors have started rowing back from the Indian capital markets by withdrawing a massive over Rs 1 lakh crore in March after remaining net buyers for six consecutive months.

In order to contain the spread of coronavirus, lockdowns have become a norm world over and have led the FPIs to adopt a cautious stance, market experts said.

The depositories data showed that a net amount of Rs 59,377 crore was pulled out from equities and Rs 52,811 crore was withdrawn from the debt segment by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) between March 2-27.

The total net outflow stood at Rs 1,12,188 crore in March, which comes after six consecutive months of investment by FPIs since September 2019.

This is also the highest withdrawal ever since the FPI data was made available on National Securities Depository Ltd.

""With complete lockdown announced by the government, the businesses and trade have come to a halt, which could further slow down the pace of domestic economic growth,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst - manager research at Morningstar India.

On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days as part of efforts to stem the outbreak of coronavirus infections.

""While the world has intensified its fight against coronavirus, the signs of it abetting is yet to be observed. Though several measures have been announced to fight the disease and resources have been put in place, the concerns about the global economy witnessing a prolonged downturn have gained momentum. This is what is keeping foreign investors away from emerging markets like India, which are considered to be more susceptible towards these events,"" Srivastava added.

In the current scenario, FPIs have preferred to take a flight to safer investment options, such as dollar denominated asset classes and gold, as against investing in fixed income securities of emerging markets like India, he said.

Regarding the future of FPI flows, he said the situation should stabilize as and when there are visible signs of coronavirus coming under control. However, until then, this will continue to be one of the major focus areas for FPIs, since it may have a more serious impact on the already slowing global economy.

According to Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO, Groww, ""measures announced by the Finance Minister and RBI are encouraging but we will have to wait and see what impact it will have. We have to keep an eye on future announcements and their effects on the economy.""",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-scare--fpis-pull-out-over-rs-1-lakh-cr-in-mar-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus-scare--fpis-pull-out-over-rs-1-lakh-cr-in-mar.html

147,29-3-20,Defoe backs Gerrard to become top manager,"Rangers striker Jermain Defoe believes his boss Steven Gerrard has the personal qualities that will take him all the way to the top in his management career.

At 37 Defoe is nearing the end of a career that has seen the forward work with the likes of managers Harry Redknapp and Sam Allardyce during spells at several clubs, including West Ham, Tottenham, Portsmouth and Sunderland.

Defoe compared Gerrard, in only his second season as a manager, to both Redknapp and Allardyce, adding the former Liverpool and England captain had a similarly acute understanding of players.

“I think he is going to be a top, top, top manager,” Defoe told Talksport radio.

“He is brilliant, he is a natural. In terms of management he is still fresh and new but you can see that naturally he has got everything.

“He always says to the players that if they want to go and talk to him his door is open. He is approachable which is really important as a manager.

“Sometimes there is things you want to talk about, you might have personal problems but you feel uncomfortable going to the manager but with Steven you can go and talk to him about anything. He is chilled.

“He reminds me of Harry (Redknapp) and Sam Allardyce where you can approach them and speak about anything. It is important.”

Gerrard’s career, in common with much football around the world, is currently on hold with the Scottish Premiership one of several leagues that have been suspended in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

But Defoe, capped 57 times by England, had no complaints about the move given the spread of COVID-19.

“To be honest, there are more important things happening in the world than football,” he told TalkSport.

But, with the pandemic postponing the Premier League season until at least April 30, Rashford has an opportunity to get back in action if the campaign can resume.

“I feel much better.

“I’m in a much better place, I’m much happier than I was about a month ago so things are looking positive.”

Despite government advice to stay at home during the pandemic, Rashford said the situation has had little impact on his fitness recovery work.

“Everyone is just dealing with the circumstances as well as they can,” he said.

“I’ve just been in my house, doing my gym and recovery work, reading books, watching Netflix, just whatever you can do to make the time pass really.

And Brady hopes the domestic season can resume and reach a conclusion, even if games have to be played behind closed doors until July.

“When we — all Prem clubs — last spoke, we agreed to get going again as soon as possible,” Brady said.

“And that games will run into July, if required, to get this campaign finished. This is the plan. This is what we want to deliver. “It may be games have to be played behind closed doors, which no one wants — especially the players and fans.

151,29-3-20,‘I struggled to breathe:’ Dybala reveals coronavirus nightmare,"Juventus star Paulo Dybala revealed on Friday how he “struggled to breathe” after contracting coronavirus which has killed over 9,000 people in Italy.

The Argentine international announced last Saturday he was one of three Juventus players to catch the virus along with Daniele Rugani and Blaise Matuidi, who both had no symptoms.

“I feel better now after some strong symptoms,” the 26-year-old Dybala told JTV channel.

“A couple of days ago I was not well, I felt heavy and after five minutes of movement I had to stop because I was struggling to breathe.

“Now I can move and walk to start trying to train, because when I tried in the past few days I started to shake too much.

“I gasped for air and as a result I couldn’t do anything, after five minutes I was already very tired, I felt the body heavy and my muscles hurt.

“Now I’m fine. My fiancée Oriana (Sabatini) has also overcome the symptoms.”

Dybala has scored 13 goals in all competitions this season, including in league leader’s Juventus’s last game against Inter Milan before Serie A and all sport in Italy was suspended.

“The goal against Inter was the greatest emotion, (Aaron) Ramsey provided the perfect assist — it’s a pity that there was no public,” added Dybala.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---i-struggled-to-breathe-----dybala-reveals-coronavirus-nightmare.html
152,29-3-20,Piedt eyes cricket career in USA,"In an unusual move, South Africa off-spinner Dane Piedt is giving up his career in the ICC elite member nation and will move to the USA, with dreams of guiding the associate into a World Cup one day.

Piedt, who has played nine times for South Africa, will leave for the United States in the next few months to be part of the new Minor League T20 tournament, which is due to launch this summer.

“The USA were given ODI status last year so it’s not completely out of the question,” Piedt told ESPNcricinfo.

“I just signed the deal this morning but no one really knows when I will be able to travel. It was an opportunity I just couldn’t pass up, financially and for lifestyle reasons, but it was still a tough decision to make.”

While he doesn’t see himself being picked in the South African team in the near future after losing ground to other spinners, Piedt fancies his chances in America, where there is a dearth of cricketers with experience of playing in the top-flight.

“Shammo (Tabraiz Shamsi) has really made a mark in white-ball cricket and Keshav (Maharaj) has done exceptionally well for the Test side, he has done exactly what the team needs,” Piedt said.

“And if you look at the schedule, South Africa are not due to tour the subcontinent again soon and that’s the only place where I might get a game.”

The spinner has never travelled to the USA and doesn’t even know where he will be based in the long term.

Piedt said he has been taking tips from former South Africa seamer Rusty Theron, who helped him secure the deal.

Theron has been living in the USA for several years and made his ODI debut for the country last year.

“He has given me some information, especially about the cricket scene there. It’s a decent set-up and I know they have some good cricketers like Xavier Marshall and a few Australians and Indians who played in national Under-19 teams and then moved.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/piedt-eyes-cricket-career-in-usa.html

The three organisations all met on Friday to examine the financial impact of suspending the season, with Britain as a whole in a state of lockdown.

“The Premier League, EFL and PFA met and discussed the growing seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic,” they said in a joint statement.

“It was stressed that the thoughts of all three organisations continue to be with everyone affected by the virus.

“The Premier League, EFL and PFA agreed that difficult decisions will have to be taken in order to mitigate the economic impact of the current suspension of professional football in England and agreed to work together to arrive at shared solutions.”

Some clubs have asked players to defer up to half their wages, while players at Championship leaders Leeds, pushing for promotion to the lucrative Premier League, have volunteered for a wage deferral.

154,29-3-20,Abe says country at critical stage,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says the country is at a critical stage in dealing with coronavirus infections but not at a point to declare a state of emergency.

Abe says Japan has managed to keep clusters under control by carefully following infection routes. But the initial strategy is now having a difficulty, with a rise of infections that are no longer traceable -- an early sign of infection explosion.

He says once there is infection overshoot, “our strategy of slowing down the peak of the infections will instantly fall apart.” He adds “under the current situation, we are just barely holding up. But I understand we are standing on the edge.” Abe convened a taskforce Thursday, the day after Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike made a stay-at-home request to its 14 million residents after seeing a spike in the number of new cases of the COVID-19 to 41.

At 5:00pm (1700 GMT) on Friday, the death toll was 1,019, up from 759 at the same time on Thursday, the health ministry figures showed.

As of 9:00am on Saturday, a total of 120,776 people in Britain had been tested, of whom 17,089 were confirmed positive.

Johnson and his health minister, Matt Hancock, were confirmed on Friday to be among those infected, although both said they had only mild symptoms.

Their cabinet colleague, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, revealed on Saturday that he too had developed mild symptoms and was self-isolating, but had not been tested.

156,29-3-20,Brazil’s Bolsonaro makes life-or-death gamble,"Even as coronavirus cases mount in Latin America’s largest nation, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has staked out the most deliberately dismissive position of any major world leader, calling the pandemic a momentary, minor problem and saying strong measures to contain it are unnecessary.

Bolsonaro says his response to the disease matches that of President Donald Trump in the U.S., but the Brazilian leader has gone further, labeling the virus as “a little flu” and saying state governors’ aggressive measures to halt the disease were crimes.

On Thursday, Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, that he feels Brazilians’ natural immunity will protect the nation.

“The Brazilian needs to be studied. He doesn’t catch anything. You see a guy jumping into sewage, diving in, right? Nothing happens to him. I think a lot of people were already infected in Brazil, weeks or months ago, and they already have the antibodies that help it not proliferate,” Bolsonaro said. “I’m hopeful that’s really a reality.”

A video titled “Brazil Cannot Stop” that circulated on social media drew a rebuke from Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“Do you know what will happen, Bolsonaro? Brazil WILL stop. Your irresponsibility will bring thousands to avoidable deaths,” she tweeted Friday.

“The destroyed lungs of these people, as well as the organs of those who won’t be able to have medical care, will fall on your lap. And Brazil will not spare you.” Bolsonaro, 65, shows no sign of wavering even as the nation’s tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases surpasses 3,400, deaths top 90 and Brazilians overwhelmingly demand tough anti-virus measures. Pollster Datafolha this month found 73% of people supported total isolation, and 54% approved of governors’ management of the crisis. Bolsonaro’s backing was just 33%.

Does Bolsonaro actually believe, as he says, that the virus will be vanquished by a cocktail of drugs and Brazil’s tropical climate? It’s possible, but analysts say a more calculated political gamble may underlie his increasingly defiant position.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/brazil---s-bolsonaro-makes-life-or-death-gamble.html

158,29-3-20,Dhoni’s India ambitions might be over: Bhogle,"With uncertainty looming over the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League, celebrated cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle feels it might be the end of the road for MS Dhoni as far as his ambitions of playing for India are concerned.

“My gut feel is that his (Dhoni’s) India ambitions might be over. I don’t think Dhoni would have been looking to September-October for the T20 World Cup. Maybe if he just had a great IPL but my gut feel is that was beyond him,” Bhogle said while speaking on Cricbuzz.

The IPL, which had already been postponed to April 15, could be cancelled after India went into a 21-day lockdown from March 25 to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Dhoni, 38, last played for India at the 2019 World Cup in England where the Men in Blue were knocked out in the semi-finals. Since then, he has been on a sabbatical and is due to appear on the cricket field in the upcoming IPL edition.

The former India captain who will turn 39 in July was practicing with his team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) but had to cut short his stay in Chennai after the IPL was pushed back.

Bhogle further said that even though Dhoni might not make it to the Indian team for the T20 World Cup, he still may want to contribute for CSK.

“Last year towards the end of the IPL, towards the end of the league stage I got an opportunity of doing a couple of post-match presentations and there was Dhoni and he wasn’t holding back at the presentations which were normally three four minutes but this one seven to nine minutes almost and when Dhoni is in that talkative mode we don’t stop him,” he said.

However, Dhoni’s childhood coach Keshav Banerjee said the wicketkeeper-batsman should be a part of India’s squad for the T20 World Cup.

“In a World Cup, you need experience. Rishabh Pant is still learning an KL Rahul as a keeper for a World Cup, I don’t think that’s the best idea when Dhoni is available for selection,” Banerjee had said.

“This Indian team still needs him in a World Cup. Behind the wicket, he is an asset and in the middle, he still binds the innings together,” Banerjee added, backing his ward who led India to 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 50-over World Cup titles besides winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy as captain.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/dhoni---s-india-ambitions-might-be-over--bhogle.html
159,29-3-20,Virat ‘boss’ of Indian cricket,"Head coach Ravi Shastri has called Virat Kohli the “boss” of Indian cricket and said the support staff is there to “take the burden off” the skipper.

Batting mastero Kohli has been at the heart of India’s world-record 12 Test victories in a row on home soil.

“The captain is the boss, I always believe that. The job of the coaching staff, as far as I’m concerned, is to prepare the guys in the best possible way to be able to go out there and play brave, positive, fearless cricket,” Shastri said.

Shastri was speaking to former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton and Rob Key during a Sky Cricket Podcast.

“The captain leads from the front. Yes, we are there to take off the burden but you leave him to do his job in the middle. The captain sets the tone and is encouraged to set the tone. In the middle, he controls the show.”

Shastri, who took over as the head coach in 2017, largely attributed India’s march to top of the ICC Test rankings to Kohli.

He also spoke about how Kohli’s relentless focus on fitness rubbed on to his teammates.

“When you talk about fitness, the leadership came from the top and that is Virat. He is not a guy to mess around.

“He woke up one morning and said if ‘I want to play this game I want to be the fittest player in the world and compete against the best in all conditions’ and he let his body go through one hell of a lot.”

In recent years, Kohli is one of the very few regulars of the team to have played almost non-stop, across formats.

“It was not just the training but the sacrifices he made with his diet. I could see that change happening all the time. He got up one day and said ‘Ravi, I’m vegetarian!’

“When he sets those standards, it rubs off on others. Test cricket for us is the biggest form. It’s the benchmark. We want to set standards,” Shastri said.

‘welcome rest’

Sport coming to a standstill owing to the COVID-19 pandemic is a “welcome rest” for India cricketers, feels Ravi Shastri, who has spent barely 10-11 days at home since leaving for the World Cup last May.

“(This rest) cannot be a bad thing because towards the end of the New Zealand tour, you could see some cracks coming up when it came to mental fatigue, physical fitness and injuries,” Shastri said.

According to him, the players may use the time to re-energise themselves, especially after a gruelling New Zealand tour where India played five T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests.

“The amount of cricket we have played over the last ten months, that was beginning to take its toll. Guys like me, and some other guys from the support staff, we left India on May 23 for the World Cup in England. Since then we have been at home for 10 or 11 days.

“There are certain players who played all three formats, so you can imagine the toll it has taken on them, especially being on the field, adjusting from T20s to Test match cricket and all the travel that goes with that because we travelled quite a lot,” Shastri said.

After the World Cup, the Indian team travelled to the West Indies, then played a long home series against South Africa that was followed by a full tour of New Zealand.

“So it has been tough but a welcome rest for players,” the coach said.

India is currently in a 21-day lockdown and according to Shastri, his players knew something like this was imminent when the series against South Africa, right after the New Zealand tour, was called off.

“It came as a shock but to be honest, having been on the road during the South Africa series, we guys anticipated it,” he said.

“We knew something was on the cards as the disease had just started spreading. When the second ODI was called off, we knew something was gonna happen and a lockdown was imminent.”

“I think the players knew it was coming, they sensed it in New Zealand. There were apprehensions towards the end of that tour, when flights were coming through Singapore, out of Singapore.”

“By the time we landed (in India), I thought we got out at just the right time. There were only two cases in New Zealand at that time, that has rocketed now to 300.

“The day we landed, that was the first day they were screening and testing people at the airport. So (we came back) just in the nick of time.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat----boss----of-indian-cricket.html
160,29-3-20,Kohli wasn’t only one to struggle in NZ: Hesson,"Former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson feels that India were probably the best equipped team to have played a Test series in New Zealand in recent years even though they ended up losing 2-0. India were completely outplayed by the Kiwis, losing the first Test by 10 wickets and the second by seven. But the former Kiwi coach begs to differ and feels that the conditions were tough.

“I thought India are probably be the best equipped to have travelled to New Zealand, but the conditions were challenging,” Hesson told the Mumbai Mirror. “They weren’t ridiculous in any means, and they were challenging in both games (in the two Tests which India lost).”

India had batted first in both Tests and Hesson said that was an important factor as conditions got better as the matches wore on.

“The New Zealand conditions were challenging for everybody, especially in the first innings. Things certainly got easy later on. The first innings was challenging for anyone coming from overseas,” he said.

Hardly any Indian batsman made a mark in the series, including captain and second ranked Test batsman in the world Virat Kohli. Hesson feels that Kohli and the others simply didn’t get any time to adjust to the conditions

“When the ball seams, there is very little time to adjust. You need time to adjust your technique. He certainly was not the only one (to have struggled). Also, New Zealand’s plans for Virat were exceptional. New Zealand have had the best of attacks for a long time and they challenged the Indians,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-wasn---t-only-one-to-struggle-in-nz--hesson.html
161,29-3-20,Gopi praises SAI’s online workshop for athletes,"The frustration to remain in the confines of their homes amid COVID-19 lockdown is palpable and no wonder SAI’s various training modules of online workshop kept athletes and coaches glued on the opening day, earning praise from none other than Pullela Gopichand.

The sessions on opening day was attended by athletes and para athletes from all sport, including Olympic probables shooters Divyash Panwar, Apurvi Chandela, Abhishek Verma, Anish Bhanwala, boxers Lovlina Borgohain and Nikhat Zarin along with swimmer Srihari Nataraj.

Praising the initiative, national badminton coach Gopichand said: “In these testing times with the Coronavirus, it is important to keep oneself physically and mentally active and find ways to use our time better. These online sessions will certainly help in achieving that.”

“Sport is not only about being competitive, challenges will be thrown up and it is how we face them with the best of our ability and keep moving forward,” the chief national coach said.

The first session of the 24-series workshop started on Friday with physiotherapist Dr Nikhil Latey speaking about how to train at home during the time of Corona, getting over 8K views.

This was followed by a session on nutritional requirements during Corona by Ryan Fernando, which had more than 15K viewership from athletes, coaches and fitness enthusiasts.

Gopichand and former Indian hockey captain Viren Rasquinha were among many others.

Speaking about the sessions, Olympian wrestler Pooja Dhanda said: “The sessions are very informative. It helped me think differently about training while at home and helped me focus on the key areas. I look forward to the other sessions as well.”

Latey on his part said: “For a lot of us, the moment the lockdown is lifted, we can get back to doing what we do, but it's not same for athletes.

“They are unsure if they will be at the same level as they used to be in the absence of regular training and competition.”

“This is why we need to come forward and help our athletes and make them utilise their time and these online sessions initiated by SAI are so useful. With the nationwide reach that SAI has, it will definitely have a positive impact.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/gopi-praises-sai---s-online-workshop-for-athletes.html
162,29-3-20,Tokyo organisers eye July 2021 for delayed Olympics: reports,"Tokyo Olympics organisers are eyeing next July as a start date for the postponed Games, Japanese media reported Sunday, following the historic decision to delay the event due to the coronavirus.

Given the ongoing pandemic and need for preparation time, the most likely plan would be for the Games to begin on July 23, 2021, public broadcaster NHK said, citing sources within the organising panel.

It came after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike raised the idea on Friday of moving the event to a less hot and humid time of year.

She argued that this would make marathons and other races easier to endure, meaning they could be held in the capital instead of in northern Sapporo city, where the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had decided to move them.

The Tokyo 2020 team led by Yoshiro Mori is currently discussing possible dates with the IOC, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.

On Saturday, Mori told a Japanese TV station that ""some kind of conclusion"" would be reached within a week.

The Olympics were scheduled to open on July 24 this year with the Paralympics on August 25, but Japan announced last week it had secured agreement from the IOC to postpone the Games -- a decision unprecedented in peacetime.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they would be held in around a year instead as a testament to humanity's victory over the pandemic.

The decision had been seen to open options for Tokyo, with IOC chief Thomas Bach saying that ""all the options are on the table"" and rescheduling ""is not restricted just to the summer months"".

Meanwhile, NHK said the Olympic flame would be displayed for a month at the J-Village sports complex in Fukushima, which was used as a base camp for thousands of relief workers in radiation protection suits during the 2011 nuclear disaster.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tokyo-organisers-eye-july-2021-for-delayed-olympics--reports-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tokyo-organisers-eye-july-2021-for-delayed-olympics--reports.html
163,29-3-20,"No fuel crisis in India; enough stock of petrol, diesel, LPG available to last lockdown: IOC","India, the world's third largest energy consumer, has enough petrol, diesel and cooking gas (LPG) in stocks to last way beyond the three-week nationwide lockdown as all plants and supply locations are fully operational, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh said.

Singh, who continued to oversee the mammoth operations of ensuring that fuel reaches every nook and corner despite bereavement of his father on the day 21-day lockdown was declared, said there is no shortage of any fuel in the country and customers should not resort to panic booking of LPG refills.

""We have mapped demand for all fuel for entire April and beyond. We have refineries operating at levels enough to meet all of the demand. Besides all bulk storage points, LPG distributorships and petrol pumps are functioning normally. There is absolutely no shortage of any fuel,"" he told PTI.

The nationwide lockdown that has shut businesses, suspended flights, stopped trains and brought almost entire vehicular movement to a halt, has impacted fuel demand with petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) showing negative growth (degrowth or fall in demand).

With most cars and two-wheelers going off the road, petrol demand has fallen by 8 per cent in March while diesel demand has been down 16 per cent. ATF demand has fallen by 20 per cent, he said.

""LPG consumption however continues to grow and we are servicing all customers,"" he said adding refill demand saw more than 200 per cent jump as the lockdown was announced.

The refills sought were a result of panic booking as in the absence of the exhausting existing ones, many could not take deliveries of new cylinders, he said adding even customers with double cylinder connections had ordered for refills without exhausting even one cylinder.

""There is absolutely no need for panic booking. We have enough stocks to meet all demand,"" he said.

""When a customer resorts to panic booking, it puts unnecessary strain on the system as the requirement is immediately transmitted to bottling locations which make additional refills, transport it to bulk location and onward to the distributor.

""Distributors use already stretched delivery boys to physically deliver the cylinder to customer's home only to return back with the filled cylinder as the customer refused delivery because existing ones hadn't exhausted.""

Singh said due to lower demand of liquid fuels, refinery run-rates have been lowered by 25-30 per cent - meaning they would produce up to 30 per cent less of all fuel - petrol, diesel, ATF, naphtha and LPG.

Every barrel of crude oil when processed produces a certain percentage of petrol, diesel, kerosene/ATF and LPG. So, lower processing of crude would result in lower production of all fuel.

""To make up for the shortfall in LPG production, we have tied up for imports to meet the requirement of entire April,"" he said. ""We have mapped requirement of LPG for all of April, including the additional demand that would come from the government's announcement of free cooking gas for three months to over 8 crore Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries.""

On March 26, the government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package to deal with hardships caused by the lockdown. This involved giving free foodgrain and 3 LPG cylinders during April to June to poor.

""We may need 850,000 tonne of additional LPG and we have tied up import for all of it,"" Singh said.

""To make lockdown a success, LPG is the key as without cooking fuel people would not stay home. So we have made adequate arrangements to make it available,"" he said.

IOC supplies to nearly half of the 27.59 crore active LPG customers.

""The terminals and depots, LPG distributorships and fuel stations are well-stocked Customers are advised not to panic or resort to hoarding and panic-buying or visit the showrooms and godowns of their LPG distributorships for obtaining refills,"" he said.

For the past 10 days, IOC has been delivering on an average 25 lakh cylinders every day to the doorsteps of its customers. All state-run fuel retailers together deliver about 52 lakh refills throughout the country.

All 119 Aviation Fuel Stations of IOC across the country are operating with optimum strength and full safety precautions to meet the aviation fuel (ATF) needs of defence aircraft, cargo flights and medical ambulances.

Singh said despite the challenges posed by Covid-19 lockdown, IOC is fully geared to maintain smooth supply of petroleum products to its customers. The firm has put in place robust plans for petroleum movement and stocks at upcountry locations.

Even in the face of restricted movement of people and vehicles, IOC is ensuring loading of petrol, diesel and LPG at its bulk storage/distribution points with optimised manpower.

""Salman's Being Human Foundation has come forward to help daily wage workers. They called us three days ago. We have about 5 lakh workers out of which 25,000 are in dire need of financial help. Being Human Foundation said they will take care of these workers on their own. They have asked for account details of these 25,000 workers as they want to ensure that money reaches them directly,"" Tiwari told PTI.

""The remaining 4,75,000 workers can survive for about a month. We already have huge ration packets for all the workers but unfortunately due to lockdown they are not able to come here to collect it. We are thinking of ways how to reach out to them,"" he added.

Tiwari said FWICE has reached out to several actors and filmmakers to make a contribution.

""We have written letters and also sent messages to various people in the film industry to come forward and help the workers but we haven't received any response from them. Producer Mahaveer Jain has offered to provide help in terms of food and essential items,"" he added.

Earlier in the week, filmmakers and actors, including Karan Johar, Taapsee Pannu, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kiara Advani, Rakul Preet Singh, Sidharth Malhotra, and Nitesh Tiwari pledged their support to a new initiative aimed at supporting the daily wage earners.

The initiative, I Stand With Humanity, started by organisations -- the International Association for Human Values, the Art of Living Foundation and the Indian Film and TV Industry, will provide families of daily wage workers with 10 days of essential food supplies.

On March 18, the Producers Guild of India announced that they have set up a relief fund for daily wage earners impacted by the shutdown of film, television and web productions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Their decision came after many filmmakers, including Sudhir Mishra, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap, raised concerns over the impact of shutdown on the daily wage workers.

According to the Health Ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases rose to 979 on Sunday, with death toll climbing to 25.

166,29-3-20,Sudden lockout has created immense panic and confusion: Rahul to PM,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the sudden lockout announced by the central government to combat novel coronavirus has created immense panic and confusion .

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he highlighted the plight of the poor and called for steps other than total lockdown announced by some developed nations to tackle the deadly disease.

""It is critical for us to understand that India's conditions are unique. We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy,"" he said.

Gandhi said the number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is too large to unilaterally shut down all economic activities in the wake of the pandemic.

""The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from COVID-19,"" he feared.

""The sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion, he said, adding factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, and tens of thousands of migrant labourers are undertaking arduous journey to reach their home states. The Gandhi scion said the labourers have been rendered vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services.

It is important that we help such sections find shelter and provide them with money directly into their bank accounts to help them tide over the next few months, he said.

The Congress leader added that a complete lockdown will almost certainly lead to millions of unemployed youths rushing to their villages, thus increasing the risk of infecting their parents and the elderly population living in villages.

""This will result in a catastrophic loss of life,"" he noted.

Gandhi called for a nuanced approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration.

""Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus, and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of proximity to older people, he said.

With fresh deaths in six states, the death toll from COVID-19 climbed to 25 in the country and the total number of cases to 979 on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sudden-lockout-has-created-immense-panic-and-confusion--rahul-to-pm-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sudden-lockout-has-created-immense-panic-and-confusion--rahul-to-pm.html
167,29-3-20,FIR against AAP's Raghav Chadha for 'defaming' Yogi,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Raghav Chadha was booked here on Sunday for allegedly posting a tweet defaming Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, police said. An FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by UP-based lawyer Prashant Patel Umrao at the Sector 20 police station in Noida, a police official said.

When contacted over WhatsApp after his phone number was found switched off, Chadha did not respond to the PTI query.

The case has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 500 (defamation), 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) and under Section 66 (offensive messages through a computer or any other communication device like a mobile phone) of the Information Technology Act, according to the FIR.

“His (Chadha's) malicious and deliberate act is not only dangerous to the maintenance of law and order but also it will create panic among the people who are going to their native places at this time due to coronavirus epidemic,” Patel claimed in his complaint, citing a tweet allegedly posted by Chadha.

When last checked by PTI, the tweet mentioned in the FIR did not appear on the AAP MLA's timeline, although a screenshot of the purported post was circulating on social media.

The case comes amid thousands of migrant daily wage earners from Delhi and nearby areas gathering en masse at Anand Vihar on UP border leaving for their home towns and villages due to the 21-day countrywide lockdown called by the Centre with an objective to contain the spread of coronavirus.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/fir-against-aap-s-raghav-chadha-for--defaming--yogi-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/fir-against-aap-s-raghav-chadha-for--defaming--yogi.html
168,29-3-20,Delhi Police chief asks his personnel to block exodus of migrant labourers,"Amid the exodus of migrant workers, the Delhi Police Commissioner Sunday instructed his personnel to disallow them from moving out of the city by enhancing picket deployment and stopping buses going outside Delhi, officials said.

SN Srivastava's orders came hours after the Centre asked states and union territories to effectively seal all interstate and inter-district borders to stop the movement of migrant workers. The Centre also asked them to arrange food and shelter from them wherever they are.

On Saturday, thousands of migrant workers thronged the Anand Vihar Interstate Bus Terminus on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border to go back to their villages.

Srivastava has strictly directed his personnel to stop the movement of migrant workers trying to leave the national capital by increasing the number of pickets across the city and in the border areas with the help of additional forces, he said.

“Deployment of pickets should be enhanced on all the roads leading towards Delhi including places such as metro tracks and railways tracks,” he said in an audio message to his personnel.

Many people were seen trying to walk on the railway track at Anand Vihar to go their home towns in Uttar Pradesh.

So, the Commissioner has also directed his forces to deploy more pickets near the tracks to keep a strict vigil on the movement there.

All the DCPs, ACPs and SHOs have been instructed to do extensive patrolling in their respective areas and deploy maximum vehicles for patrolling to check the movement.

The officers have also been asked to make announcements in areas with dense mirgant population that the government will pay their full wages.

The officers also been asked to create awareness among the moving population about the threat of the spread of coronavirus and also to warn them that strict action will be taken if they are seen on the roads.

The police have also been directed to not allow any movement of DTC buses or any other private bus ferrying migrant population outside the national capital.

All DTC buses coming to bus stops and stands should be detained there and not allowed to move outside Delhi, he said.

The officers have been directed to detain and seize the buses at the bus stops and stops even before the transport authorities do it.

The officers have also been directed to make announcements in areas of migrant population that no buses will be going outside Delhi towards Uttar Pradesh.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-police-chief-asks-his-personnel-to-block-exodus-of-migrant-labourers-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-police-chief-asks-his-personnel-to-block-exodus-of-migrant-labourers.html
169,29-3-20,LAFC vetoed Vela’s potential loan to Barca,"Reigning MLS Most Valuable Player Carlos Vela says he had a chance to join FC Barcelona earlier this year but his current side Los Angeles FC vetoed the deal.

Mexico’s Vela said while it would have been a great opportunity for him in January he doesn’t hold a grudge against his MLS employer.

“LAFC did not give me facilities to leave, although it is understandable. In the end, they seek the best for themselves and each for himself.

I tried and it did not happen, and nothing happens because I am more than happy here,” the forward told GQ Mexico magazine.

Vela, 31, said Barcelona offered him a four-month contract.

Vela has emerged as an MLS superstar with LAFC since arriving on a transfer from Spain’s Real Sociedad in 2018.

170,29-3-20,New Tokyo date ‘won’t satisfy everybody’: Coe,"World Athletics president Sebastian Coe admitted on Friday that settling on a new date for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will not satisfy everybody.

“All sports have made it pretty clear they have particular challenges at particular times of the year,” said Coe.

“We are probably not going to reach a solution that meets with the approval of every sport.

“But there does have to be an element of flexibility and there is going to be flexibility for the next two years.”

The 2021 World Athletics Championships, for example, are scheduled to be staged in August next year in Eugene, Oregon.

The 2020 Olympics, which were set for July 24-August 9 this year, were postponed until 2021 by the International Olympic Committee this week.

However, there is no definite date yet for the rescheduled Games with IOC chief Thomas Bach saying on Tuesday the Olympics “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021”.

There have been suggestions even that the rebooted Olympics could be held in the spring and so allow athletes to avoid competing in the brutal heat and humidity of Japan’s summer.

“There are clearly demands for this decision to be taken as quickly as possible — the athletes and the federations need clarity,” added Coe.

“Once the decision is made, we can build (the calendars) around it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/new-tokyo-date----won---t-satisfy-everybody-----coe.html
171,29-3-20,Indian players at physical disadvantage due to space constraint: Gloster,"Indian players could be at a “physical disadvantage” due to lack of enough training space during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, feels team’s former physiotherapist John Gloster.

As athletes all over are self-isolating themselves, several cricketers, including England’s Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, have shared videos of their home workouts.

“The physical constraints that the Indian players are now having seems to be a lot greater than that of the guys in say, South Africa, Australia or the UK,” Gloster told ESPNCricinfo.

“..Because space is an incredible constraint here. I’ve seen some fantastic footage coming out of the players in the UK where they’re in their own gyms and they’ve got lots of space, and I think the Indian boys are going to be perhaps at a physical disadvantage there,” he added.

However, Gloster, who worked with the Indian team from 2005-08, feels post the lockdown every player will begin at a level playing field, without any match practice.

“Every single cricketer, probably for the first time since the second world war, will be starting from exactly the same place in terms of match fitness,” he said.

“This is really interesting, because normally when we enter an environment like the IPL, we have to manage guys who are overloaded, and factor that into their training, as well as guys who are under-loaded and need to match the necessary levels.”

“Whereas on this occasion, everyone will be entering the tournament without any match fitness, which will bring with it a large injury risk because the expectation for all professional sportsmen is that you’ve always got to go at 100 percent.”

The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President also asked the top brass of all the NSFs to share calendar of their athletes’ preparations for the Tokyo Games.

“The qualification events which were postponed will happen again at revised dates once this virus issue is resolved. Draft tentative planning for that. Please share details of all the qualification events yet to happen in your sport,” Batra wrote in a letter to the presidents of all the NSFs.

Batra also said the IOA and NSFs need to plan on the extension of contracts of the coaches whose tenures were to end this year.

The contracts of many coaches, including those from abroad, were to end by August when the Tokyo Games were to end before they were postponed to next year.

“As you are already aware that 2020 Olympics is postponed to 2021. We now need to plan for: Extension of Contracts for HPD (High Performance Director), coaches, support staff etc till end of 2021 as many such contracts are ending in 2020, the process needs to start as soon as possible,” the IOA chief said.

“Draft training calendar for Athlete’s preparation for 2021 Olympics. Please update on the present location of the athletes and their health,” he said in the letter with copies marked for Sports Ministry and Sports Authority of India.

He said under the present circumstances, it will be very difficult to give any confirmations “but this is just to get everyone on same page”.

173,29-3-20,Dovale dons white coat to take on coronavirus,"Journeyman footballer Toni Dovale put his football boots to one side and slipped into a pharmacist’s white coat in the front line struggle against coronavirus in Spain.

The 29-year-old pharmacy graduate and former top-level sportsman had been playing football for a Thai club, but was visiting his family in Spain when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.

So he decided to pitch in his ‘grain of sand’ against the virus using the studies which he had yet to put into practice due to his passion for football.

“I really was packing my bags to go back when things got complicated,” Dovale said.

Travel restrictions trapped Dovale in his native La Coruna in the Atlantic coast region of Galicia, where he started his football career with nearby Celta Vigo. Although Dovale also completed his university studies in pharmacy four years ago, he had never actually worked in the field.

Now with the world of sport in limbo the footballer realised the time was ripe to use his studies to help his homeland.

“I was playing in Asia then; pharmacy is different there and I was never in Spain long enough to work,” he says,

“With football stopped and travel banned I said to myself ‘get some practical experience and do your bit’.”

‘Fear’

The coronavirus is ravaging Spain with a death toll of over 4,800 and some 64,000 registered cases of infection.

There is hope of course with around 10,000 people already cured of the virus in Spains for multimedia clients

“We’re in a really frightening situation. Those of us working with the public are afraid, and the people who come to us for advice are afraid too,” says Dovale, who is working in a pharmacy run by his family.

He has gloves but no mask, and does not appear ready to lose his smile any time soon.

“We all know we are exposed, that this is a pandemic and a complicated situation,” he says.

“But we all know too that our behaviour in complicated situations defines who we are, and for me I need to put fears for my own safety to one side and help in any way that I can.

“There are shortages of many things and we are struggling to get enough of the simple things like thermometers, paracetamol, gloves and hand gels.”

Dovale has played football for Spanish top flight clubs Leganes and Rayo Vallecano, Sporting Kansas City in the United States and also Bengaluru in the Indian Super League before moving to Thailand.

“Right now I’m the same as everyone else in that I train at home jumping over the furniture,” he jokes.

“I start at 7am and I use whatever I can including bottles of water and stuff like that. Then I go downstairs to the pharmacy.

“I hope this is over as soon as possible and that I can go back to playing football again.

“Right now though everything is up in the air and I have no idea when sports will get going again over there (in Asia) or when we Europeans will be allowed to even travel again. “I have no idea how this is going to pan out. Let’s just hope it's all over soon and I can get ack to my normal life playing football.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dovale-dons-white-coat-to-take-on-coronavirus.html
174,29-3-20,Europe mull finishing football season at end of year,"Europe’s football bosses have not given up hope of finishing this pandemic-hit season — even if it might have to be done at the start of the next one.

The novel coronavirus has created an existential challenge to the world’s most widely played and watched sport.

Europe’s football leagues are the planet’s richest and can afford to pay the most money to the biggest stars.

But that system could come crumbling down quickly if there is nothing to show on TV.

Cristian Ronaldo has not had a chance to celebrate goals for Juventus for nearly three weeks because Italy’s Serie A had to shut down.

He and other Italian league stars are thinking of giving up millions of euros in salary to help their teams stay solvent.

UEFA boss Aleksander Ceferin told Italy’s La Repubblica daily that he was holding urgent talks with the continent’s biggest leagues to figure out what can be done.

The Slovenian said all options were under consideration in an effort to salvage the season and preserve the sanctity of the beautiful game.

“We could start again in mid-May, in June or even late June,” Ceferin said.

Any time after that and “the season will probably be lost.”

The idea of the entire season simply being cancelled stirs panic in fans of clubs such as Liverpool — on the cusp of lifting their first title in 30 years.

Ronaldo’s Juventus would probably not be terribly happy either. The men in the famous black-and-white stripes are edging Lazio by a point in their race for a ninth successive title and are still in the Champions League, which they have not won since 1996.

Ceferin said he opposed the idea of playing games in empty stadiums and would prefer to wait out the pandemic.

He also hinted that some big teams appeared ready to delay the start of next season in ordered to finish out this one.

“There is also a proposal to end this season at the beginning of the next one and then start the next one a little later,” Ceferin said.

Serie A and most other European leagues were originally supposed to have finished in May.

Belarus remain the only European nation still playing football in the face of a pandemic that by Saturday had officially claimed nearly 30,000 lives.

‘Think positively’

But the scheduling is growing tricky and time appears to be running out.

Most European leagues are supposed to start their 2019-20 seasons at the end of August.

Italy still has more than two regular months of matches of the 2018-19 season to play out.

A resumption of the current season at the end of June would probably require a delay to the start of the next one until at least September or October.

It would also mean that players get very little rest and would also create problems for those whose contracts are expiring in June.

Italian Football Federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina sounded fine with that.

“We would all be happy to finish the season on the pitch,” said Gravina told Sky television.

“We are in contact with FIFA for contract extensions if we need to go beyond June 30.”

Gravina did not explain why he was talking to the world football governing body and not the European one headed by Ceferin.

But he did conceded that his earlier hope of restarting Italian matches in early May was now almost certainly dashed.

“I am aware that it is still too early,” said Gravina. “But we must think positively.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/europe-mull-finishing-football-season-at-end-of-year-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/europe-mull-finishing-football-season-at-end-of-year.html

176,29-3-20,Migrants march to different tune,"As exodus hits social distancing, Shah asks States to use disaster relief fund to rehab migrants

The panicky march of the thousands of migrant workers is turning out to be major stumbling block for the Centre in its effort to enforce social distancing to curb the spread of coronavirus. With experts warning that such unruly assembly could help the contagion to explode — two migrant workers from Rajasthan tested positive on Saturday — the Home Ministry has come out with a measures to deal with the grave situation.

The measures include raising tents along the highway to accommodate these workers and provide them food and medical assistance. The march of the migrants has alarmed health experts, who feel that it will defeat the very purpose of the lockdown. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also expressed unhappiness over the move by States Governments to arrange buses for migrant workers who want to return to Bihar.

“The entire purpose of lockdown will be defeated if thousands of migrants are sent to Bihar by buses. My Government has already asked the Bihar Resident Commissioner in New Delhi to coordinate with different State Governments and reimburse the cost involved in providing food and shelter to migrants who are on their way to Bihar. We have already announced Rs 100 crore package for them,” said Nitish on Saturday.

Nitish was right in his apprehension. At least two migrant workers, who travelled from Indore to Rajasthan amid coronavirus lockdown in the country, have now been found positive for COVID-19.

Against the backdrop of these developments, Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday spoke to many Chief Ministers to accommodate the migrant labours in the States itself by providing food and shelter, rather than transporting them to their home States. Shah said the Government is committed to offer all support to migrant workers during the lockdown period and suggested that schools and colleges can be used for sheltering the migrant workers.

The Home Ministry changed the guidelines of State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to allow States to use the fund for the purpose of rehabilitation of the migrant workers.

“With the intent of Modi Government to provide all possible support to migrant workers, the Union Home Secretary has again written to States requesting them to immediately set up relief camps for migrant workers/pilgrims, etc, who are returning to their domicile States or trying to do so during this lockdown period. States have been advised to give wide publicity and awareness, using public address systems, technology and by utilising the services of volunteers and NGOs,” said the Home Ministry in a statement.

The Ministry also asked States to set up tented accommodation to ensure that these persons will stay in the relief camps till the lockdown orders are in place. The shelters are to be organised, keeping in view various precautions including social distancing, with adequate medical check up drives to identify and separate cases requiring quarantine or hospitalisation.

Meanwhile, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gakari asked NHAI chairman and toll operators to provide all help to migrant workers by providing food and water. “I have advised chairman NHAI and Highway Concessioners/ toll operators to consider providing food, water or any kind of support to migrant workers/citizens who are trying to reach to their respective native places. At this time of crisis we have to be compassionate for our fellow citizens,” he said.

Commerce and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal has appealed to Industries and trade bodies to take care of their workers and not allow them to go to home States in the time of crisis. In a video conference, Goyal said, “Don’t let your workers go away” to the industrialists across the country. Talking to representatives from various manufacturing, industry and trading associations, He said they are not only their assets and resources, but also could become potential carrier of COVID-19, if they are allowed to migrate to leave en-masse during this pandemic.

Goyal exhorted the associations to show the spirit of service and selflessness, and participate in protecting the nation and society. He said the Government is fully committed to support all the sections of society and is taking relief and confidence-building measures.

Meanwhile, four migrant workers from Rajasthan were crushed to death and three seriously injured when a tempo ran over them as they were walking along a highway in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on Saturday.The victims were among hordes of migrants who were stopped at Maharashtra-Gujarat border and sent back as they were trying to return to their home States amid lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/migrants-march-to-different-tune-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/migrants-march-to-different-tune.html
177,29-3-20,‘An actor should never say never’,"Known for shows like Kalash and Bepanah Pyaar, APARNA DIXIT loves experimenting with roles and genres. She speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about her latest show and how she has evolved

What is your role in Pyaar Ki Luka Chuppi?

I play Srishti, a small-town girl with values. She is extremely talented but when it comes to love and family, she is emotional and thinks only from her heart. Her satisfaction lies in little pleasures of life and is family-oriented who believes in success but not at the cost of relationships. A lot of people will find the character relatable.

One thing that you like and dislike about your character?

I love everything about my character. From being soft spoken to respecting everyone, Srishti is a love driven person and has no anger or ego issues. The only thing that I dislike is, how she allows people to take her for granted which she will start realising soon. With different experiences in life, she is now learning to take a stand for herself.

From Mahabharata to now Pyaar Ki Luka Chuppi, how has your journey been?

My journey has been beautiful. I have played some amazing characters in the past and made friends for life in this journey. I feel grateful to be a part of this industry which has blessed me in ways for which I can’t be thankful enough.

What was the most challenging project?

The most challenging project is also the one that is close to my heart — Kalash. I loved the graph that my character had. I got to play various shades and try different looks.

How do you think you have evolved as an artist?

An artist is always evolving. With every new character that you play, a new project that you do, you learn something new. You become better at the craft day by day. As an artist, I am always on the go to learn and explore new things. It is a never-ending process.

How do you think TV has evolved?

The last couple of years have seen an evolution in content with the shifting paradigm. Over the last decade, television has evolved progressively. The industry is witnessing a revolution by portraying strong independent female protagonists. Serials are being made where the conversation is around strong women characters. There are stories of empowerment of women from small towns and villages of India which are finally being told. Content on TV is progressively influencing the lives of audiences who are now readily accepting strong headed women who are finally speaking up for themselves.

Having explored different genres, which one did you enjoy the most?

Having played various characters over the years, daily soaps have been the most enjoyable to me as I get to dramatise all emotions and the situations and story lines are also quite relatable. I absolutely enjoy every bit of my time on the sets which makes me enjoy my work all the more.

A role that you would say no to.

I believe as an actor it is important to explore every role. An actor should never say never.

Upcoming projects.

Currently, I am only focusing on my show Pyaar Ki Luka Chuppi which airs on Dangal TV. If you engage yourself in different projects at the same time, you tend to lose focus. Therefore, I want to concentrate only on this show first. Rest only time will tell.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---an-actor-should-never-say-never----2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---an-actor-should-never-say-never---.html

Puja and Kunal’s wedding was supposed to take place in a traditional Bengali ceremony. However, the couple is now contemplating postponing their nuptials due to the coronavirus scare.

According to sources, Puja had applied for leaves and production house had granted her the same. As of now their wedding shopping has also come to a halt and Puja is spending time at home with her family due to lockdown situation in the city.

Puja shares: “The situation is such that we have to sit with our families and decide the situation after March 31.”

Well let's hope, Puja and Kunal get married soon and their fans get to witness this grand moment in the coming days.

Meet kannika’s best friend

Kanikka Kapur, also known as Suman from the most loved show of Sony Entertainment Television Ek Duje ke Vaaste 2 reveals on how she would select her partner. Kanikka is her Daddy’s princess and certainly would not take any decision without considering with her father and she has the same clause for her future boyfriend.

Kanikka is best friends with her father and shares all aspects of her life with him. Her father too understands her and supports her and guides her wherever the need be. Kanikka who recently turned 25 has revealed that her father has no problems with her dating somebody. It is just that the guy should follow some clauses set by her father. Speaking about the same Kanikka Kapur aka Suman said: “I am comfortable sharing my personal life with my parents and they have been supportive of it. I am currently not dating anyone but my father has surely set some clauses for me if I date someone in the future.” When asked about what kind of a guy she or her father wants, she said: “The guy should be as responsible as I am. Currently I am focusing on my career and I expect the guy to do the same. Looks doesn’t matter to me, but the guy should focus on building up his own career and support me in what I do. It is okay for me to date a guy who is outside of the industry, he should also respect my parents and treat them like his own. Also, he should have my father’s approval. In short, my king will select my prince charming.”

The current track of Kanikka’s show is taking a major twist as Shravan’s secret would be revealed in Anish’s party and the new friends Suman and Shravan would be seen fighting while Suman slaps Shravan. What is this secret? Will the two star-crossed lovers unite back?

Ent specialists on IBD

Sony Entertainment Television’s latest offering, India’s Best Dancer is garnering a lot of positive attention for its interesting content and the variety of talent that is being showcased on the dance show. The contestants who have come from different cities across the country are battling it out with each other only to bag the coveted title of India’s Best Dancer. While the judges, Malaika Arora, Geeta Kapur and Terence Lewis are evaluating contestants on three factors mainly ENT, which is Entertainment, Newness and Technique, they are having a tough time scrutinising them considering the phenomenal talent that is being featured in the show.

One such talent who left the judges spellbound with her performance is Swetha Warrier from Kerala. Swetha performed western-classical fusion along with choreographer Aishwarya on the song Dilbar. She got positive comments from all three judges for her act. However, Malaika was quite intrigued by her performance and was happy to know that both Swetha and her choreographer Aishwarya hail from Kerala, which is also where Malaika belongs to. So much so that Malaika even coined a term for the two, she said on the show she would like to call them “Malla ke Mallus.” Seeing them perform took the dancing diva back to her roots in Kerala and she even complimented their act in Malayali.”

Swetha, who was happy to receive good remarks from judges, said: “I started dancing when I was three and half. My mother is my inspiration. She is a professionally trained dancer and I still learn from her.” Swetha’s mother was touched seeing her daughter perform on stage and the mother-daughter duo later even performed Bharatanatyam on the song Aami Je Tomar in front of the judges.

Siddhaanth’s transformation

Siddhaanth Vir Surryavanshi has been a popular TV face for years now and he has a massive fan following, especially amongst the ladies. Being part of several top shows, we've seen him don several looks. But for Zee TV's upcoming fiction show — Kyun Rishton Mein Katti Batti, the actor wanted to have a slightly different look. Playing a dashing, jet setting businessman on the show, he had to look a certain way and the makers experimented with several looks with the actor before arriving on one!

To be the hot and happening Kuldeep as they had envisioned, Siddhaanth had to reinvent his fitness regime. He along with the makers wanted to break the image of onscreen fathers and hence, they planned to make him look like a desirable man with quite the physique. Thus began the actor's transformation where he had to lose some of his belly fat, build six pack abs and gain some muscle. For the same, he went on a special diet and worked out regularly for a period of six months and, well, the results speak for themselves. But the transformation wasn't easy for Siddhaanth! The actor had recently undergone a surgery and just as soon as he recovered, he took on the role and committed himself to playing it to the hilt!

The actor revealed: “You know, there is this notion in everyone's mind that all the fathers on TV shows look a certain way. But who says dads can't be sexy? So, to break this mindset, we finalized on a ripped look and I knew there was a lot of hard work in store for me, especially post my surgery. After being diagnosed with stage one arthritis in my shoulder last year, I had to get a surgery done for the same. In fact, when the show was offered, I was still undergoing rehab. But my transformation phase helped me notnonly get into the skin of the character but also feel fitter overall.”

Talking about his regime, Siddhaanth mentioned: “I just worked out regularly for six months, not missing one day or one session. Having three different trainers allowed me to focus on all the aspects of my body and they helped me tone down and get into the shape that we envisioned for Kuldeep. I also focused on my diet, which comprised of healthy alternatives and protein-rich food which helped us achieve the ripped body look.”",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tellytale-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/tellytale-tellytale-2020-03-29.html

I know the time is not right and everybody is on panic mood and scared. Even though we understand that being completely locked-down at one place and being home-bound is not easy to bear for so long but I would request all to avoid stepping out. We know the way Covid-19 is increasing day by day and people are falling sick and dying and we need to do our part to save us and others around us. Also, if you step out from your building to buy grocery, please get it for elderly in your society too and don't let them go out.

These are tough times. While we can’t physically fight this virus, we can all do our bit and prevent it from spreading further by staying indoors and strictly observe social distancing. Given the schedule that we normally follow, it surely gets difficult to stay put indoors but this too shall pass. On the positive side, I’m spending a lot of time with my family and we are ensuring ways and means to keep ourselves occupied. From board games to movies to gardening and DIYs, we have been at it. I hope and pray for the well-being of everyone.

Currently, I am reading a book that comprises of the most unusual poetries written that I started reading a couple of weeks ago. I hope to complete reading this book in the coming week. Other than reading, I also love folk music. I intend to sing and upload videos of it on my social media channels to keep myself as well as my fans entertained.

Most of it includes trying all her craft DIYs (laughs) which she likes watching. Besides that cooking some delicious meals for her and my husband. Although I would have loved visiting my extended family back in Indore with her but looking at the current scenario it is in our best interest to stay at home. And this is something I would like to urge all our viewers too. Please take all the necessary precautions and stay indoors…Kyunki hum ghar ke andhar, toh corona bahar! Stay safe and stay indoors.

Due to shoot schedules, my fitness regime would often get neglected and I was able to work out for one or two days in a week. Now that I’ve got some time off, I have begun exercising at home and I’m enjoying it. Prior to taking up the character of Anjani in &TV’s Kahat Hanuman Jai Shri Ram, I was pursuing Yoga which is performed in an extreme hot environment. I have once again begun practicing it at home where I switch off the A/C and fan and do the regular yoga asans. It helps in maintaining my weight plus brings an abundance of positivity especially at a time when we are enveloped in an environment of serious health concerns. My sincere urge to everyone is to take good care of your health by staying indoors and keep up with the exercise routines.

181,29-3-20,"France reports 319 more virus deaths, PM warns 'battle only starting'","France on Saturday reported 319 more deaths in hospital caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total toll of the epidemic in the country to 2,314.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe warned that the ""battle"" against the virus in France was only just starting, warning the first two weeks in April would be even tougher than the last fortnight of March.

There are now 37,575 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in France, up 4,611 on the day before, according to a daily update published by the government.

There are now 17,620 people in hospital, with 4,273 of them in intensive care, it added.

Both the death toll and the number of infections are likely higher than the official figures.

The number of those who died counts only those who died in hospital -- not retirement homes or at home -- while only those deemed at high risk are currently being tested.

""I want to say how things are with clarity and frankness. The battle is only starting,"" said Philippe at a news conference with Health Minister Olivier Veran to outline the government's strategy.

""The first 15 days of April will be even more difficult than the 15 days that are coming to an end now,"" Philippe said.

He said France's twin aims were to increase its intensive care capacities and to flatten the curve of the virus's spread.

Veran vowed that France would ramp up its testing in the weeks to come, promising that there would be 50,000 traditional tests and 30,000 rapid ones carried out daily by the end of April.

He said that after placing an order for five million rapid tests, France would be able to carry out 100,000 such tests daily by June.

With the government criticised for a lack of sanitary masks -- especially for health workers -- Veran added that France had now ordered a billion of them, including notably from China.

He said that France was only able to produce eight million masks a week.

""Our reserves are not infinite,"" he added.

The pair's press conference in Paris was given to just one journalist, who pooled questions from colleagues, as a health precaution.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic and officials have repeatedly warned it will take time for the measures to bear fruit.

Philippe had announced on Friday that the lockdown would be extended by another two weeks to April 15 given the gravity of the crisis. (AFP)

183,29-3-20,Saudi forces intercept missile over Riyadh: state media,"The Saudi-led military coalition intercepted a missile over Riyadh late Saturday, state media said, after AFP reporters heard three explosions in the capital.

""A ballistic missile was intercepted and destroyed over Riyadh,"" state-run Al-Ekhbariya television reported.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Yemen's Iran-aligned Huthi rebels have previously launched missiles, rockets and drones on the Saudi capital and other cities.

At least three blasts rattled Riyadh, according to AFP.

The assault comes after all parties in Yemen's long conflict offered support on Thursday for the United Nations' call for a ceasefire to protect civilians from the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Saudi Arabia, the Yemeni government and the rebels all welcomed an appeal from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for an ""immediate global ceasefire"" to help avert disaster for vulnerable people in conflict zones.

The call coincided with the fifth anniversary of regional power Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen's civil war, at the helm of a military coalition supporting the internationally recognised government against the Huthi rebels.

Yemen's broken healthcare system has not so far recorded a case of the COVID-19 illness, but aid groups have warned that when it does hit, the impact will be catastrophic in a country already regarded as facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Saudi Arabia is scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. The kingdom's health ministry has reported 1,203 coronavirus infections and four deaths from the disease so far.

184,29-3-20,"Delhi-UP border choked as labourers rush to Bihar, UP","Kejriwal says Govt has arranged buses for migrant workers, but urges them to stay on

Left without any source of income, thousands of migrants mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Saturday hit the streets and highways connecting Delhi-NCR in hope to get support from the Government to reach their homes.

Their exodus choked Delhi-UP border at Ghazipur and Anand Vihar bus terminal was crowded with people trying to get into buses to head for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said his Government has arranged for buses to transport migrant workers who were already walking back via roads to their respective home States.

Also, the CM appealed to migrant workers leaving Delhi to stay back. Kejriwal in his Press briefing on Friday announced that food will now be served in 325 Government schools after which the Government will officially have the capacity to feed 4 lakh people across 500 centres.

Delhi Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam went to Anand Vihar to meet migrants.

There he requested them to stay back in the city as the Delhi Government has made special arrangements for their food and other basic necessities in various shelters across Delhi. In the video uploaded on Minister’s official Twitter account, he is seen making an appeal to the labourers.

“My appeal to the people walking back to their villages is to return to their homes in Delhi. The Delhi Government has ensured that each one of you has an adequate supply of food. We have arranged for food and other necessities in our night shelters as well as in various Government schools. There is no need to worry,” said Gautam.

The announcement came at a time when hundreds of migrant workers living in Burari, Sant Nagar, Shakarpur and other several places across the city on Saturday morning gathered at Noida and Ghaziabad borders with an aim to move to their States.

At Ghazipur border (Delhi and Ghaziabad) the Delhi Police was seen sending the migrants workers in batches toward UP border, where a public transport was available to ferry them.

Similar scenes were witnessed at Ghaziabad’s Loni, Raj Nagar extension, Kaushambi, Sahibabad and inter-State bus stand at Anand Vihar.

The buses were all crowded and people jostled with each other for space, some even sat atop the buses. Hailing mostly from Bihar and UP, the labourers said they will be not able to pay their rent in comings days and they had no choice except to vacate accommodation with a little money left in their hand to survive and move towards their native houses.

“We labourers are paid on daily basis. With no work it was not possible for me to pay next month rent for my house in JJ cluster at Rangpuri so the only option was to leave for home. We have limited money with us now and it is better we should leave for our village,” said Ramesh Kumar (37), a native of Sitapur district in Bihar.

Forced by unprecedented situation, the migrant labourers said they were feeling trapped with no one paying heed towards their plight.

“The day lockdown was announced we (12 people including children) all packed our luggage and left for the bus stand but when we reached here, the bus services were suspended, leaving us with no other option but to spend our nights here but now we are being provided transportation so it’s better we will reach our home,” said Bhure Lal (43), who used to work as a labourer in city and hails from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

“Most of us had left towards their homes on foot due to unavailability of transport system. There is no food and even roof, so what would one do. I have two children but I can’t walk towards Kanpur along with them on foot. Now bus is available I can reach my home now,” said Vijay, a resident of Kanpur.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-up-border-choked-as-labourers-rush-to-bihar--up-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/delhi-up-border-choked-as-labourers-rush-to-bihar--up.html
185,29-3-20,"Cases cross 1K, fight stepped up","The count of confirmed COVID-19 cases raced to 1,029 on Saturday, but the Centre maintained that India is yet to witness community transmission of the viral infection and it is focusing on management and prevention of the disease by ramping up Covid-19 hospitals, sample testing, contact-tracing besides intensifying social distancing measures.

According to Statewise confirmed case tallied by different monitoring sites, the total number of positive cases stood at 944 on Saturday evening. However, the Health Ministry’s Saturday morning count showed 938 positive cases in the country. The tally was not revised till late in the evening. The pandemic has claimed 20 lives in the country.

With cases on the rise, the Centre has asked the State Governments to set up health check-up camps and tents for migrant labourers who are travelling back to their native places to prevent them from spreading the disease, if any.

Giving details of the steps being taken to combat coronavirus which has killed over 28,000 people across countries, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal said that doctors from the States are being trained on management of Covid-19 patients with the help of AIIMS in Delhi while rigorous contact-tracing is underway. Many States are in the process of setting up dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.

They have also been asked to ramp up their capacity to manage an increasing number of cases. At least 17 States have started work on it.

Incidentally, the number of coronavirus cases may have been surging with a few patients in Bihar showing no traceable source of exposure but Raman R Gangakhedkar, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at ICMR, said that there is no conclusive evidence to suggest social transmission of coronavirus has begun in India.

“There are some sporadic instances where cases have not revealed any history of exposure. But the numbers are not so exponential that we take it to mean that the virus is spreading rapidly,” he said.

“It is all dependent on a person’s memory and also whether they want to reveal their history or not. Some people didn’t even reveal that they tested positive while others hid their travel history. Till we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not overinterpret things,” Gangakhedkar added.

However, he said that testing criteria has been expanded with all patients having severe acute respiratory illness are also being tested for Covid-19.

According to experts, the term community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases.

Maharashtra has reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases at 167, followed by Kerala, and Karnataka and Telangana. A 74-year-old from Hyderabad tested positive for coronavirus after his death, making him the first fatality from the virus in Telangana. Kerala also recorded its first death - a 69-year-old man who returned from Dubai and was under treatment at the Kalamassery Medical College following symptoms of pneumonia. The man’s wife and the cab driver who took them from the airport to their house are also infected and undergoing treatment at the same hospital.

“The States have been asked to work for creation of separate hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients. The States are also creating isolation wards,” said Aggarwal.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases crossed six lakhs on Saturday while over 28,000 people have been killed due to the infection which has engulfed almost every country across the globe.

Replying to a query, Aggarwal said that comorbid conditions are major factor for the deaths cases while it has been found that, as per reports world over also, elderly people are at a higher risk. He also said that chronic patients with associated ailments will be delivered medicines at home.

Meanwhile, the Health Minister inaugurated 24x7 national tele-medicine facility 9115444155 at AIIMS for better COVID-19 management. Union Health Minister Dr Harshvardhan said, “We have opened a COVID-19 National Teleconsultation Centre today for doctors who are treating people with virus so that they can get in touch with other doctors for consultation regarding treatment of any patient. Helpline number is 9115444155.”

The Ministry has also released guidelines for telemedicine. “People who cannot go to hospitals but need advice regarding medicine they are taking or any other medical problem can take telephonic advice from doctors. It has also been given legal sanctity by our policy,” he said.

On the question that why antimalarial drug Hydroxycholoquine is being recommended to the Covid-19 patients, an ICMR official said that reduction in viral load has been observed in such patients who were given the drug.

In the meantime, SRL Diagnostics on Saturday said that ICMR has allowed their two clinical reference labs, at Mumbai and Gurgaon, to conduct tests for COVID-19.

SRL Diagnostics CEO Arindam Haldar said in a statement that the lab has initiated testing, but currently there is a shortage situation for approved commercial kits for testing and PPE for sample collection, and, “we are trying our level best to bring the supply situation to match possible demand.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cases-cross-1k--fight-stepped-up-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cases-cross-1k--fight-stepped-up.html

187,29-3-20,Govt procures 5 lakh testing kits from US,"Amid clamour over lack of coronavirus testing facility in India, the Government has been able to procure five lakh additional testing kits from the US.

R Gangakhedkar, the Head of ICMR, said on Saturday the country has now 111 Government testing labs and only 30 per cent of facilities are put to use so far.

He said 44 private laboratories have been given approval for testing and 400 people have been tested in private sector.

Gangakhedkar added that the country is now fully equipped to deal with the situation.

The Modi Government faced a lot of criticism for testing fewer people for coronavirus.

“More than 5 lakh probes that were imported from the USA have arrived, which means we can test an additional 5 lakh people. More so, labs have still have reagents to test more than one lakh patients,” Dr Gangakhedkar said.

Gangakhedkar said currently ICMR is utilising 30 per cent of its testing capacity. He added that serological test procurement has been revised from 10 lakh to 5 lakh, and the process is ongoing to validate Abbott’s Point-of-Care testing kit.

The ICMR announced that the medical body was changing the criteria for testing of coronavirus. India will now be switching from random sample testing to testing of all patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). By testing 15 people per million, it is testing the lowest number of people in the world.

ICMR initially tested only those people who had travel history and showed symptoms. Currently, the Government testing capacity stands at about 10,000 samples a day. In contrast, South Korea is testing 20,000 samples a day. Officials said that India’s initial testing protocol for coronavirus was narrow: till March 20, the country was only testing symptomatic patients with international travel history and those who had come in contact with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases.

In an urgent communication, the Centre has asked all States to earmark hospitals only for treating COVID-19 patients and ramp up their capacity to manage an increasing number of cases. At least 17 States have started work on it.

On March 17, ICMR scientists stated India had 1.5 lakh testing kits. One million probes - an integral part of the testing kit - had been ordered from Germany and another one million probes had been requested from the World Health Organisation, they added.

It listed 12 approved rapid testing kits, with 11 having certification from the European regulator. The test kits certified by the European regulator include those by one Singapore-based firms Sensing Self Ltd, two US-based firms BioMedomics and CTK Biotech Inc, and at least five China-based firms like Getein Biotech, Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co Ltd and Beijing Tigsun Diagnostics Co Ltd. Another Chinese firm Wondfo got its test kit validated by National Institute of Virology in Pune.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-procures-5-lakh-testing-kits-from-us.html

189,29-3-20,Two Indians among 70 new COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore,"Two Indians were among the 70 new confirmed novel coronavirus cases reported in Singapore on Saturday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 802, according to the Ministry of Health.

Out of the fresh cases, 41 are imported with travel history to Europe, North America, ASEAN and other parts of Asia.

Two Indian nationals, a 21-year old male and a 55-year old female, were among the confirmed coronavirus patients in the ministry's Saturday list.

The latest cases brings the total number of COVID-19 infections in the city-state to 802, it said.

Of the 420 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Nineteen are in critical condition.

Fifteen more patients were discharged from hospital, taking the total number of recoveries from disease to 198.

A 1-year-old Singaporean girl is among the 41 imported cases. She has a travel history to the UK and France.

While more links have been made to previous cases or clusters, 67 locally transmitted cases still remain unlinked.

Contact tracing is under way for these cases, the ministry said.

On Saturday, the authorities urged people in a WhatsApp message to stay at home and only visit shopping malls for essentials like food.

This comes a day after large crowds were seen outside malls, as mall operators implemented stricter safe-distancing measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, reported Channel News Asia.

The government also called on foreign workers and foreign domestic workers to stay inside on their rest days and reminded people to stay 1mtr away from each other, avoid gathering at public spaces and visiting crowded areas.

Stiffer regulations that came into effect on Thursday introduced jail terms and fines for individuals, event organisers and owners of premises who flout safe-distancing measures, as stipulated by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce.

Twenty people have been arrested over a one-and-a-half month period for their alleged involvement in e-commerce scams involving products such as masks and hand sanitisers, according to media reports.

Victims have lost more than SGD 440,000 in the scams, which have been on the rise on digital platforms such as Carousell and Facebook Marketplace as Singaporeans sought some of these essential products.

The city-state authorities have also told all long-term pass holders to seek an entry approval before entering or returning to Singapore from Sunday at 11.59pm.

The additional precautionary measures are in view of the risk of imported COVID-19 cases into Singapore, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM).

190,29-3-20,"India shifts staff in Herat, Jalalabad to Kabul in view of COVID-19 cases in Afghanistan","India has shifted its diplomats and staff from its consulates in the Afghan cities of Herat and Jalalabad to Kabul in view of the fast-spreading coronavirus cases in Afghanistan, which shares a long border with Iran, one of the worst-hit countries by the pandemic.

Government sources said all Indian staff at the two consulates were brought to Kabul as part of precautionary measures following the swelling number of coronavirus cases in the country.

According to the figures given by the Afghan government, a total of 110 people have been infected by the virus in the country, although the real figures are believed to be far higher.

Health experts believe the actual number could be higher as several provinces in the country do not have facilities to carry out a laboratory test to check the infection.

Two foreign diplomats and four officials of the NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan were among the positive cases in the country, according to Afghan media reports.

The sources said the Indian staff from the two consulates were shifted to Kabul as the two provinces do not have adequate medical facilities.

Afghanistan shares a long border with Iran, which is among the very few countries reporting a large number of coronavirus cases and struggling to combat one of the world's worst outbreaks.

Over 2,500 people have died and more than 35,500 have been infected across Iran since February. There have been reports of a large number of Afghan refugees crossing over to Afghanistan from Iran in view of the deteriorating situation in Iran.

The coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed nearly 28,000 people and infected close to 6,00,000 people in 183 countries.

Justin Trudeau has been giving daily news conferences outside his residence. He said earlier Saturday that his wife was in in fine form.

""From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes. And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love,"" she said.

The prime minister suggested Saturday that he would continue to work from home to set an example for Canadians who are being asked to stay at home.

Ontario, Canada's most populous province, meanwhile, said Saturday that it is prohibiting gatherings of five people or more. The order was effective immediately and replaced one that prohibited public events of over 50 people. It does not apply to households with five or more people, and funerals will be permitted with up to 10 people at one time.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said if the virus is to be stopped, extraordinary measures are needed to ensure physical distancing. The province has already closed all nonessential services.

193,29-3-20,Sea of corona queries floods Govt helplines,"Left locked down within the four walls of homes and flooded with scary information from various platforms on coronavirus, scared citizens are hankering for credible inputs on precautionary health measures and treatment practices online.

The Government’s websites seems to be the most reliable at this difficult phase as on Friday itself, 28 crore people logged in to the Union Health Ministry portal seeking answers to the range of queries they have on their mind about the viral infection.

Talking about the high online traffic, Lav Aggarwal, Joint Secretary Union Health Ministry said just a few days ago, around 22 crore people had clicked on the Government website while on Friday, nearly 28 crore hit the Government portal.

He was responding to complaints that many times the helplines launched by the Centre and States crashed. Obviously such issue arose from overloading.

“As the situation has evolved by every progressive day, we have increased the number of helplines. But load has increased,” he said.

For the benefit of people and to ensure that their problems are sorted out at the earliest, the Ministry has raised the number of helplines. “We had started from 10 helplines which we increased to 30. But now, in view of increased load on the existing ones, the Ministry has expanded helpline services to 150 which keep on ringing,” said a senior health official.

Plans are afoot to increase the lines to reach out to maximum number of people.

Aggarwal, however said that people can approach the Ministry through e-mails and letters or any medium as well. “We will try to resolve the problem,” he assured.

Since the coronavirus outbreak, the Government and States have launched a number of helplines besides apps and upgraded their websites, and put up circulars and advisories to raise awareness and answer questions about the Covid-19 pandemic.

For instance, the Union Health Ministry along with the Government initiative MyGov has launched a helpline number on WhatsApp. Users across the country can reach out to the Health Ministry on +91 9013151515 for credible information.

In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, many digital health care companies in the country too are trying to reach out to people to promote remote diagnosis.

Ratnesh Sharma from CallHealth Services said, “During these trying times, we are witnessing a high surge in virtual services including doctor consults, special consult etc. In line with that, we have created a dedicated helpline “CallHealth Line for Covid-19”. Anyone across the country, rather from anywhere in the world, can call the helpline @ 91 33 55 77 99 to avail a free doctor consultation if they display or have queries pertaining to Covid-19 symptoms.”",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sea-of-corona-queries-floods-govt-helplines-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/sea-of-corona-queries-floods-govt-helplines.html

204,29-3-20,British PM writing to every UK household to urge them to stay home in fight against coronavirus,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after testing positive for the coronavirus, will send a letter to every UK household, warning them the pandemic crisis will get worse before it gets better and seeking their full cooperation in saving lives during the national emergency.

The letter will land on the doorsteps of 30 million households this week.

It is expected that the letter, which also warns that lockdown restrictions could get even tougher, will cost 5.8 million pounds to print and distribute across the UK.

In the letter, Johnson outlines the guidance that everyone should follow and the measures the government has put in place to fight coronavirus and to support businesses and workers.

His letter follows criticism over the clarity of government advice to date, BBC reported.

The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019, with a further 260 deaths announced on Saturday. There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK.

""From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time. We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do,"" he writes in the letter.

Tough measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and the closure of shops selling non-essential goods, were introduced last week.

""But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal.""

We must slow the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment in order to save as many lives as possible. This is why we are giving one simple instruction you must stay at home.

Johnson says it is vital that nobody cheats by meeting friends or relatives who do not live under the same roof.

He repeats the only reason to venture outdoors must be to buy food, take exercise once a day or seek medical attention.

Experts have said they expect the number of coronavirus cases and deaths to continue to rise for the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact.

In his letter, Johnson describes the pandemic as a ""moment of national emergency"".

The prime minister acknowledges the restrictions will have a financial impact on families.

""The government will do whatever it takes to help you make ends meet and put food on the table,"" he says.

Johnson also praises the work of doctors, nurses and other carers as well as well as the hundreds of thousands of people who have volunteered to help the most vulnerable.

The leaflet sent alongside the letter includes guidance on handwashing, an explanation of coronavirus symptoms, the government rules on leaving the house and advice on shielding vulnerable people.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has pledged to protect victims of domestic abuse, who she says are particularly at risk during the pandemic because of the need to stay at home.

The Foreign Office said it was working ""around the clock"" to support British travellers stranded in India amid a government lockdown.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma also announced insolvency rules would be changed to allow firms greater flexibility as they faced the coronavirus crisis.

Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack, is also self-isolating after he developed coronavirus symptoms. He is said to be experiencing mild symptoms but has not been tested for Covid-19.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock is also self-isolating after testing positive for the virus. The UK's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is also self-isolating, but has not tested positive.

206,29-3-20,Video conferencing app Zoom to stop sending data to Facebook,"Popular video conferencing app Zoom has updated its iOS app to remove the software development kit (SDK) that was providing users data to Facebook through the Login with Facebook feature.

Earlier this week, a network traffic analysis carried out by Motherboard said that Zoom for iOS was sending data to Facebook without making any mention of the practice in its privacy policy.

""Zoom takes its users' privacy extremely seriously. We originally implemented the 'Login with Facebook' feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform. However, we were recently made aware that the Facebook SDK was collecting unnecessary device data,"" a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in a MacRumors report on Saturday.

""We will be removing the Facebook SDK and reconfiguring the feature so that users will still be able to login with Facebook via their browser. Users will need to update to the latest version of our application once it becomes available in order for these changes to take hold, and we encourage them to do so,"" the spokesperson added.

Zoom has become popular as a video conferencing solution for both work and more social settings owing to the new coronavirus pandemic as most people are now working from home globally.

Some of the collaboration tools that have gained increased traction due to remote working in India include Zoom.

Zoom also has several offerings for educators, learners, as well as those working from home.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/video-conferencing-app-zoom-to-stop-sending-data-to-facebook-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/video-conferencing-app-zoom-to-stop-sending-data-to-facebook.html
207,29-3-20,"Coronavirus global death toll crosses 31,000","The worldwide number of officially confirmed fatalities from the novel coronavirus rose to 31,412 on Sunday, according to a tally compiled by AFP from official sources.

Four persons were tested positive in Noida alone, which, with its total number of 31 corona-positive cases till now, accounted for nearly half of the total number of infected people in the state, they said.

In a statement issued here, Joint Director-cum-State Surveillance Officer under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Dr Vikasendu Agrawal said, ""As many as 11 new patients have been confirmed as positive for Novel coronavirus. This includes four in Noida, two in Ghaziabad, four in Meerut and one in Bareilly.""

The total number of samples found positive in the state till now is 72, Dr Agarwal said, adding 31 of them are from Noida (Gautam Buddh Nagar).

The break-up of the total 72 cases in the state till now is Noida - 31, Agra - 10, Lucknow - 8, Ghaziabad - 7, Meerut - 5, two each in Varanasi and Pilibhit, and one each in Lakhimpur-Kheri, Moradabad, Kanpur, Jaunpur, Shamli, Baghpat and Bareilly.

As many as 14 patients have recovered and discharged till now in the state, including seven in Agra, two in Ghaziabad, four in Noida, and one in Lucknow, he said.

Speaking to reporters earlier in Lucknow, Principal Secretary (Medical and Health) Amit Mohan Prasad had said, ""A total of 68 coronavirus positive cases have been reported so far from UP of which 14 patients have been discharged so far.

""The condition of patients in the state is such that they do not require intensive care or need to be put on ventilators. Most of the cases are mild. The condition of all the patients undergoing treatment is stable.""

Replying to a question on community transmission, Prasad categorically said there is no community spread (of COVID-19) in the state.

""All patients in UP can be traced back to a person who returned from abroad. In Noida, where people of a factory have been infected, all the case could be traced back to the United Kingdom. All the cases of the state could be traced back to a foreign country,"" he said.

Prasad said people coming to UP from other places will be screened in their districts.

""If they are suspected of being a coronavirus carrier, they will be isolated in the hospitals, and asymptomatic people will be placed in quarantine facilities in schools, dharamshalas etc. DMs have been told about this. After they complete the quarantine facility term, they will be allowed to go to their villages,"" he said.

Cautioning that there is no need to panic, the principal secretary said people just need to stay alert and adhere to the social distancing norms.

He also said facilities are being continuously ramped up in the state.

""We have already sent a proposal to purchase 200 additional ventilators,"" he said, adding, ""We will also engage private sector hospitals in this treatment of COVID-19 cases.""

""We are preparing a package for them. A number of private sector hospitals have approached us to treat COVID-19 patients and make their hospitals a COVID hospital. They will also be turned into dedicated-COVID hospitals. The patients of such private hospital will either be shifted or discharged,"" said Prasad.

Referring to the three-tier hospital system devised by the state government, Prasad said, ""Every district will have L1 (level one) hospitals. This is ready, it will be located at the CHC, which has been made a dedicated COVID hospital. In some districts, the number of such hospitals is more than one.""

""The L3 hospitals are super speciality hospitals like the 200-bed SGPGI Lucknow, KGMU Meerut and BRD Gorakhpur spread across the state and will be five to seven in number. Critical cases will be attended to in these hospitals,"" he said.

216,29-3-20,"Coronavirus: Positive cases near 1,000-mark; Govt orders sealing of state, district borders to check mass infection","The central government on Sunday ordered the sealing of state and district borders across the country in a bid to stop community transmission of coronavirus by migrant workers, and warned that violators face 14-day quarantine. But thousands continued to march on highways as the nationwide positive cases neared 1000 with at least 25 dead.

As the 21-day lockdown entered its 5th day, the exodus of migrant workers from big cities continued unabated, desperate to return to their villages after being left jobless and many of them without food or shelter.

Charitable organisations, volunteers, religious institutions and government bodies including Railway Protection Force fed tens of thousands of people across the nation but many more remained outside the safety net.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his 'Mann Ki Baat' radio broadcast, sought the nation's forgiveness for the hardships caused by the stringent nationwide lockdown, saying it was necessary because the country was fighting a battle between life and death.

He, however, expressed confidence that ""we will definitely win the battle"" against the coronavirus menace and praised the front-line workers in this fight against as well as countless workers delivering the essential services.

The total number of positive cases rose by 106 in the last 24 hours and six deaths reported in this period, according to official figures. The new cases, which included a SpiceJet pilot with no history of international travel, were reported from the national capital's satellite town Noida, Bihar and Maharashtra, among other states.

A migrant worker reportedly died of heart attack in Uttar Pradesh after walking more than 200 kms on way to his hometown in Madhya Pradesh from Delhi.

A panic-like situation emerged due to mass exodus of migrant workers from various parts of the country, including the national capital, Maharashtra and Kerala, where thousands of people came out of relief camps and demanded being allowed to go to their homes.

""People are talking about the danger of some virus which can kill all of us. I don't understand all these. As a mother, I am pained when I cannot feed my children. No one is there to help. All are equally worried about their lives,"" Savitri, 30, a New Delhi slum dweller, told PTI as she walked along the Mathura Highway carrying her belongings on her head.

""We will die of hunger before any disease if we stay here,"" she said, determined to walk 400 kms to her village in Uttar Pradesh's Kannauj district.

Hundreds of migrant workers also gathered again near the Anand Vihar terminus near the Delhi-UP border, hoping to board buses to their villages but they were turned back by police. A large number were seek walking in groups on highways and even on railway tracks.

Concerned over such movements causing the risk of a community spread, the Centre asked state governments and Union Territory administrations to effectively seal all state and district borders and warned that those violating the curbs will be sent to 14-day quarantine in government facilities.

During a video conference with chief secretaries and DGPs, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla asked them to ensure that there is no movement of people across cities or on highways as the lockdown continues.

""There has been movement of migrant workers in some parts of the country. Directions were issued that district and state borders should be effectively sealed,"" an official statement said.

States were directed to ensure that there is no movement of people across cities or on highways and there should be strict implementation of the lockdown.

Only the movement of goods and of those involved in delivery of essential services is allowed during the 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Modi on March 24.

States have been also told to ensure timely payment of wages to labourers at their place of work during the period of lockdown without any cut.

House rent should not be demanded from the labourers for this period. Action should be taken against those who are asking labourers or students to vacate the premises, the government statement said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Maharashtra's Uddhav Thackeray, among other state leaders, asked migrant workers in their respective states stay put and promised them food and other facilities.

The Indian Railways said it will now run special trains of parcel vans to ferry essential commodities.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also wrote to Modi, saying the sudden lockdown has created immense ""panic"" and ""confusion"". He called for steps other than a total lockdown announced by some developed nations to tackle the deadly disease.

Gandhi said the number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is too large to unilaterally shut down all economic activities in the wake of the pandemic.

""The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from COVID-19,"" he feared.

The Prime Minister's Office said Modi is interacting with over 200 people on a daily basis to get a first-hand feedback on India's fight against the coronavirus crisis. These include phone calls to governors, chief ministers and state health ministers, as also with doctors, nurses, health workers and sanitation staff in various parts of the country.

Several ministers, as also various government departments, announced donations towards the coronavirus fight, while a number of corporates also announced their own contributions to relief funds. The government said such contributions by companies would qualify as their statutory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending.

While the total number of deaths in India is still low compared to many other countries, there are widespread concerns including among the experts that the count may see a sudden spike and social distancing remains the only way to prevent community spread.

Globally, more than 30,000 people have died with more than 20,000 in Europe itself, while Spain and Italy have reported more than 800 deaths in a day. Nearly one-third of the world population is under lockdown to check the spread of this virus with the jobs, manufacturing and all economic activities coming to almost a standstill.

221,29-3-20,"Coronavirus deaths in US could top 100,000: top health expert","The US government's foremost infection disease expert says the country could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the coronavirus pandemic.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday, offered his prognosis as the federal government weighs rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been as hard-hit by the outbreak at the conclusion of the nationwide 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus.

“I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 cases,” he said, correcting himself to say he meant deaths.

“We're going to have millions of cases.” But he added “I don't want to be held to that” because the pandemic is “such a moving target.”

About 125,000 cases of COVID-19 in the US had been recorded as of Sunday morning, with over 2,100 dead. It is certain that many more have the disease but their cases have not been reported.

Dr. Deborah Birx, head of the White House coronavirus task force, said parts of the country with few cases so far must prepare for what's to come. “No state, no metro area, will be spared,” she said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”

Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalisation.

The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-deaths-in-us-could-top-100-000--top-health-expert-2020-03-29.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/coronavirus-deaths-in-us-could-top-100-000--top-health-expert.html
