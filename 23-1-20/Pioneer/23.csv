0,23-1-20,A never-ending crisis,"As more details about the Boeing 737 MAX emerge, it is becoming clearer that a fair dose of arrogance pushed the American plane-maker

Boeing’s internal documents, which revealed that executives mocked aviation regulators and airlines across the world, including India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), were hugely damaging for the American planemaker and marked a torrid start to 2020 after a horrific 2019. The year began in the aftermath of the Lion Air 737 MAX crash in Indonesia. Using “friendly” media sources, Boeing executives said that poor pilot training (and the lack of it) was the primary cause of the crash. While there may have been an element of truth to that, the second 737 MAX crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, seconds after takeoff from Addis Ababa, dealt the final blow.

As a result, Boeing’s 737 MAX fleet was grounded worldwide, some regulators doing it sooner than others, but the aircraft manufacturer kept on producing planes, even though they could not fly. Planes kept coming off the production line at over 20 a month, leading to over 200 aircraft being parked at Boeing’s plant in Renton, Washington. However, with little space to keep so many airplanes — Boeing was also forced to park planes in employee car parking lots — the American manufacturer decided to suspend production a few weeks ago.

It is extremely fortuitous that the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX has not collapsed the global aviation industry. It is noteworthy here that the MAX was still a new aircraft and had not been fully integrated with fleets across the world. The grounding is now beginning to impact growth opportunities for airlines. With large American carriers like American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are the largest operators of MAX, now delaying the re-introduction of the plane all the way till the middle of this year, this crisis is not going to end anytime soon. Boeing’s nose has been grounded to the tarmac, its reputation ruined.

In most other industries, such a crisis might have been fatal for a company but the global airliner manufacturers’ duopoly between the American Boeing and the European Airbus, where the latter has smartly and carefully not uttered a word or even celebrated the former’s woes, makes the Coke-Pepsi duel look like a violent conflict in comparison. While the Chinese and the Russians are trying to up their game in the civilian airliner market — some could even argue that Boeing’s fall has given them an opportunity — they are far from being an effective contender. It takes several billions of dollars and an army of engineers to develop a new aircraft. Right now nothing can beat the entrenched players.

But at the end of the day, the entire MAX crisis that has engulfed Boeing comes down to the fact that the manufacturer did not want to spend a huge sum of money on developing a new plane. The Boeing 737 is a design that dates back to the early 1960s, the airworthiness certificate given to the aircraft is one that was issued almost seven decades ago. The Boeing 737 has been an immensely successful plane. During 2018, Boeing delivered its 10,000th 737 with a backlog of close to 5,000 aircraft remaining in its books. It has been off the competition over the years as well. The McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Douglas MD80 family could not keep up with the success of the Boeing and eventually Boeing acquired McDonnell-Douglas.

However, the Airbus A320 family, developed by the European planemaker in the early 1980s, was a different kettle of fish. With its highly advanced wing and computerised fly-by-wire technology, Boeing had to develop new technology to keep the 737 competitive. So when Airbus decided to refresh the A320 with modern new high-bypass ratio engines, which would reduce fuel consumption, it got a lot of interest from airlines. While Airbus has had its share of problems over the years, particularly around the A380 superjumbo, the A320 has been a money-spinner. With modifications in new engines — the New Engine Option (Neo) — it would become even more attractive. Despite the problems that India’s low-cost carrier IndiGo has suffered with Neo aircraft, nearly a thousand such planes are in service currently. Boeing had to do something to keep up with the rising competition. Neo’s efficiency gains over the existing generation 737 were massive.

But Boeing had a problem. When it started developing the 737 in the 1960s, it did not have to face much in terms of ground clearance and kept riding low to the ground. This made it easier for planes to service at smaller and less prepared airports, which were all but common in the 1960s and the 1970s. In fact, it was this very ability, coupled with it having lower engines, that made it attractive to the airlines. Even when the 737 was improved, few changes were made to this end. The problem with high-bypass ratio turbofan engines today is that to gain a perfect ratio, the front fan has to be massive. The 737’s basic architecture made fitting such a new engine nearly impossible. And while Boeing should have ideally developed a new aircraft altogether, market realities made that an impossibility. It took it over a decade to develop the 787 Dreamliner with an overly optimistic entry into service schedules. The subsequent delays left the company with a bloody nose.

The 787 is an immensely successful aircraft today, hundreds of them forming the backbone of airline fleets across the world. But Boeing did not have the time and its management thought of developing a new aircraft. A better option, no matter what the physics, would have been to re-engine the current airframe with minor modifications.

Well, the modifications were not simple. In order to fit a larger fan, Boeing engineers had to move the engine further forward and above the wing. This caused some major problems to the aerodynamic properties of the 737 but these could be solved. Pilots could be trained to deal with the changes. Then came another problem. One major selling point for airlines is to calculate the number of additional training pilots needed when they move to a new type of aircraft. Pilots trained on the regular Airbus A320 could fly the new A320 Neo with just a couple of hours of orientation. Boeing promised pretty much the same even though it was obvious — something that the stash of internal emails revealed — that pilots should have taken many more hours of training for the MAX, even some hours inside the simulator.

The issue, as many people know now, is that Boeing decided to integrate much more software into the MAX to augment flying characteristics. One of those pieces of software was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which in low-speed conditions, usually after take-off, would keep the plane from stalling. With the engines of the 737 MAX being shifted so much further forward, the centre of gravity of the plane, too, being far forward, only software could resolve it. As we know now, the MCAS system depended on good data from the sensors outside the aircraft. Sensors can fail and usually those failures should be notified, as on cars, to cite an example. But Boeing just made an alert system for a sensor data mismatch, an optional extra on the 737 MAX, even though it was but a software switch. The MCAS system made some sudden changes to the planes flightpath and without proper training to recognise the software intervention, pilots onboard had no clue how to deal with the issue. With little altitude, the pilots of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines aircraft slammed to the ground.

At the end of the day, a company, once known to be extremely fastidious on the engineering front, made a stupid mistake. A firm that almost bankrupted itself while developing the Boeing 707 and then almost did so again with the Boeing 747 — which has proven that it can redefine the market even in contemporary times with the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 — has ruined its reputation, thanks to the unnecessary shortcuts it took. As is being made clear in the emails for the public to see, sheer arrogance of its executives made matters worse.

It is being made apparent that the Boeing 737 MAX will not make it back into the service before mid-year. A freshly empowered Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the civil aviation regulator in the US, will not be in the pocket of Boeing as it was once. It is unlikely that a company so vital to America’s trading interests and its defence industry will be allowed to collapse. But the arrogance on display at the company was little different from that displayed by the bankers before the financial industry collapse of 2008. Boeing has to do a lot to repair its reputation and salvage the image of Boeing 737. Being humble shall make for a very good start.

1,23-1-20,Miffed allies,"Slighted by the BJP over seats, the Akali Dal and Dushyant Chautala refuse to contest Delhi polls

The allies are proving to be an itch again for the BJP in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections and though it may not be betting big on them, the mutual differences are worsening its arrogant and abrasive image. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), its long-time ally, which was hoping to context six seats, has now decided to withdraw from the race altogether, citing irreconcilable differences on several issues, primary among them being the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The SAD is dead against the religion-based conditionality in the new law and wants all minority communities (some Ahmadiyyas are in Punjab) to be included. Besides, the BJP was pushing it to contest under the lotus symbol, clearly intended to subsume federal parties under its umbrella than that of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Ever since the Akali leadership has passed into the hands of Sukhbir Singh Badal and the SAD has been pushed down the ladder of political dominance in Punjab, it has slowly and steadily been asserting its independence. By choosing to end the alliance in Delhi, it hopes to douse the fire of criticism in Punjab that it is now being guided by the Hindutva ideology and supporting contentious issues like the abrogation of Article 370 and CAA without looking at the bigger picture. Its core constituency feels these issues serve a predominantly Hindu voterbase and do not find much resonance among Sikhs, who have been shortchanged. This has become more pronounced after the Akal Takht jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, publicly lambasted Hindutva, going so far out as to seeking a ban on the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).

Already Congress Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, by passing an Assembly resolution against the CAA, has pushed the Akalis into a corner. As for Delhi, there are around 10 lakh Sikh voters, who could potentially affect the results in about 10 of the 70 Assembly seats. Question is whether this slippage would impact the BJP vote share. Rifts between the Akali Dal and the BJP have been widening ever since the seat-sharing fiasco in the Haryana Assembly elections, with the latter attempting to poach some of its candidates. While all of these moves may seem hurtful to the coalition dharma, fact is the emaciated SAD needs the BJP’s majoritarian weight to have a stake in both Central and State politics. The BJP, post the mammoth Lok Sabha verdict of last year, is not looking to be overtly dependent on the Punjabi vote in the city. In fact, it doesn’t see too much of a community drift, arguing that the presence of the Akalis could have led to an ideology-based split. It claims the neutral Sikh vote would come its way and is, in fact, hoping to divide the Sikhs as those with Panthic loyalties and those that are non-aligned. In that sense, it is trying to undercut the Akalis. Besides, the Delhi BJP, which once thrived on the anti-Sikh riots sentiment to draw the Sikh vote towards it from the Congress and had the Punjabi Hindu vote with negotiators like Madan Lal Khurana, is now much more dependent on other community votes like the Purvanchalis while consolidating its hold among Baniyas. The shift in the power axis is apparent from the fact that the BJP has accommodated both the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), allocating three seats between them, clearly with an eye to the Bihar elections. However, both these allies are not with their fair share of troubles. JD(U) senior leader Pavan K Varma has sought “ideological clarity” over the seat-sharing with BJP in Delhi while colleague Prashant Kishor continues asking questions on CAA. Other than the SAD, the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP), the BJP’s newest ally in Haryana, will also not be contesting the Delhi elections. Led by the fiery young descendant of the Chautala clan, Dushyant Chautala, it claims it didn’t get the electoral symbols of its choice and is, therefore, withdrawing from the race. But there were murmurs of the party wanting to contest at least 12 seats. There is a sizeable Jat population that can swing the results in Najafgarh, Mundka, Mahipalpur, Mehrauli, Nangloi, Badarpur, Devli and Chhattarpur. And while Dushyant may not openly challenge the CAA, fact is he is finding it hard to justify a relationship of convenience politically. The BJP may not need the allies numerically now because it has stepped out of the pretend politics of Modi 1.0 and is gung-ho about its solo majority status. But it cannot consolidate its India map without its federal partners given its recent drubbing at the State polls. And with its oldest ideologically-friendly ally, Shiv Sena, walking out, it certainly could do without more friends turning foes and eroding popular trust in the process.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/miffed-allies-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/miffed-allies.html
2,23-1-20,Another deadly virus,"With complex strains emerging in China, we should ask why this is happening at all when dealing with public health risks

It looks like every second year, a new deadly contagion emerges in China. First, it was SARS, then Avian Flu, which was followed by Swine Flu and now, a new coronavirus has taken over the Chinese city of Wuhan. This new virus is estimated to have infected over 400 people, nine of whom have died. Thanks in no small part to the boom in international air travel within and outside China, which connects even secondary cities such as Wuhan, cases have spread in several countries now, including across the Pacific in the US. Earlier viruses like Avian Flu or Bird Flu were thought to have originated in illegal poultry farms where animals were kept in unhygienic conditions. In the case of Swine Flu, too, the emergence of the virus was in pig farms. Avian Flu led to the killing of millions of birds at poultry farms as they were culled. With the emergence of Swine Flu, where the virus was thought to have passed from domesticated pigs to humans, thousands of pigs were eliminated as well. And now, this latest virus, which does not have a moniker as yet, appears to have emerged from the illegal trade in marine wildlife in that Chinese city.

All of this does raise questions about hygiene standards and food quality issues that many towns and villages in China face behind the new glass and concrete skyscrapers. In this part of the world, illegal trading of animals and bird farms is common, often next to human dwellings. It should not be a surprise then that when pathogens do the dreaded inter-species skip, such an environment becomes an enabler. It is, therefore, contingent upon the Chinese authorities to get to the bottom as to why these new pathogens are emerging. This should be done on an urgent basis because the next outbreak may not be as contained or worse but more virulent and deadlier. Public health officials have been warning about the potential of a next global pandemic to rival the Spanish Influenza of exactly a century ago when an estimated 50-100 million people died, including around 17 million people in India. This is one reason why Indian authorities must be vigilant. During the Avian Flu crisis, authorities pre-emptively culled millions of chicken in poultry farms across the country. It is good to know that passengers arriving from China are being scanned at Indian airports. However, we have to stay on our toes and urge the Chinese to clean up their act.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/another-deadly-virus-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/another-deadly-virus.html
3,23-1-20,The changemakers,"Young innovators Manav and Swati Subodh are empowering entrepreneurs to undertake social experiments, job creation and meaningful development in their communities

One of the dispiriting features of the modern development model is that despite oceans of research and studies, there has not been a substantive transformative impact on marginalised communities. Much of the outcomes have been purely academic and we need more dedicated, courageous and purpose-driven champions who can creatively apply their core competencies and new knowledge to enhance people’s well-being. Similarly, we need to design tools and techniques that can help translate these insights into effective public policies and professional practices that can sustainably deliver quality outcomes on an exponential scale.

There is now a tribe of passionate entrepreneurs who are collaborating with like-minded allies and with those with different perspectives, to build a colleagueship of expertise to address pressing human challenges and accelerate the transition of the underprivileged from subsistence to sustainability in emerging economies. Some of them are bright people working to uncover and scale breakthrough disruptive solutions for leapfrogging meaningful social change. They have the vision to see the world the way it should be and create what is missing. They are combining business acumen with their conscience to solve problems in the community and foster a fairer society in an efficient and sustainable way.

A brother-sister duo, Manav Subodh and Swati Subodh, with diverse backgrounds and with careers on the cusp of steady and promising trajectories, decided to change track and pursue something that had relevance and meaning to the wider world, and in particular to the underserved communities. Manav was Global Manager, Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Corporate Affairs at Intel but found the canvas dimming his social horizon. Swati obtained her post-graduate in biotechnology and did her doctoral research in genomics at AIIMS. It was here that she had her moment of epiphany. Her laboratory was opposite the outpatients department where the daily sight of struggling patients stirred her and fired the imagination to furrow a path of concrete action. Manav and Swati realised that their path was never going to lead to the right level of fulfillment, because they were not doing something that exactly fitted the values they had cultivated over time.

Since it wasn’t possible to change their values, they knew they needed to switch their careers. Manav was the first to take the plunge when he conceptualised the 1M1B (1 Million for 1 Billion) Foundation, an initiative to inspire a million young leaders, educators and entrepreneurs to generate jobs that will create better lives for a billion people in the underserved communities. The idea was to empower entrepreneurs who would undertake social innovations, job creation and meaningful development in their communities so that each in turn would create jobs and more stable economic lives for a thousand more.

With Swati’s expertise in healthcare and Manav’s expertise in entrepreneurship education and ecosystems, a social entrepreneurship model was conceptualised. They visualised that a million entrepreneurs — spanning different geographies and sectors — can come up with the right solutions that can impact one billion people. Everyone, according to them, is a natural entrepreneur and can play a vital role in promoting resilience in their communities. They believe that with relatively simple and inexpensive tools we can put the needle on tough problems but interventions fail to reach the right person at the right time. Sharing them equitably across the world to maximise the impact is a big challenge. Addressing these and other burning social problems requires understanding and reframing them with a fresh view. It is here that entrepreneurs like Manav and Swati are stepping in and filling the vacuum. With a team of like-minded people who share this passion 1M1B started taking shape.

Manav and Swati understand that interventions for rural regeneration cannot be played out in the same way that society perceives the poor: Desperate citizens who need to be rescued by the elite. “We have to understand the local challenges to improve their composite livelihoods. You can’t solve the problems of the last mile from the headquarters,” explains Manav. According to him, it takes local entrepreneurs, empowered to adapt easily to the nuances of local culture, to create and drive change sustainably on the ground. The 1M1B Foundation is serving as a micro-accelerator for grassroots entrepreneurs by giving them skill training, access to technologies, finance and then helping them launch their own micro-enterprise. “We scan the local environment to get better assessment of needs of the area and prospective interventional aspects and partner with these entities to provide our know-how and execution pipeline to enable last mile access to maximise impact”, he adds.

There are several interventions being promoted by 1M1B across segments. The Skills Accelerator programme helps individuals develop relevant skills to ensure that they are in line with the market needs. Fifty per cent of the participants get formal jobs and 15 per cent of them land up starting their own business. 1M1B is honing the leadership skills of micro-entrepreneurs along with building rural co-innovation labs. It helps accelerate the access of indigenous technologies to rural markets by pairing these entrepreneurs with mentors who help them in developing their ideas. It also connects global start-ups to rural markets. This access and exposure allows them to test their solution on the specific populations through other village-level players. The programme provides training in computer skills, communication, accounting, finance, access to technologies and hands-on growth support to help them launch their own micro-enterprises. 1M1B believes that communities of artisans, particularly women, deserve economic opportunities and aims to keep alive the rich tradition of their craftsmanship. The foundation is working with Kalamkari weavers to provide a more robust economic base to the weaver community. It is also an implementation partner on providing training in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to 5,000 schoolchildren in New Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Students are encouraged to come up with project ideas on how AI can be applied for societal good. Those selected are given access to the AI Youth Lab to advance their projects and create prototypes.

The Future Leaders programme is dedicated to identifying and nurturing the next generation of leaders committed to positive change. The target group comprises high school students and undergraduates who have the potential to have a meaningful influence on topics of relevance. During the course of the programme, they are imparted high-impact leadership development skills to develop the knowledge, resources and network needed to become an inclusive and socially-minded changemaker. These skills include thinking critically and from multiple perspectives, collaborating inclusively, communicating effectively and becoming empathetic leaders. The coaching also exposes them to an array of educational experiences that broaden their world view.

The latest batch participated in the fifth annual 1M1B Activate Impact Summit at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The summit provided them the opportunity to learn about leadership through the lens of the experiences of leaders of civil society, government, industry, non-government bodies, private entities, venture funds, entrepreneurs and influencers.

The foundation is a UN-accredited non-profit organisation with special consultative status to the UN Economic and Social Council and associated with the UN Department of Global Communications.

The foundation has a very innovative business development programme, called Business Raja (king). An AI-enabled chatbot, it is guiding aspiring entrepreneurs in rural India to grow their nascent ideas, raise funds and run their businesses successfully. It is simple in design. For the user, it is just another contact on WhatsApp they talk to about their ideas in three languages — Telugu, Hindi, and Kannada — as of now.

The chatbot asks a user about their ideas, how they came up with it, measures the person’s personality and attains a complete profile. It also assesses their responses to tough questions — a sort of psychometric test.

An aspiring entrepreneur needs to follow a three-step process: First, share a business idea. The chatbot will provide reference resources that need to be completed. Then, the candidate will have to design a financial plan such as product pricing. Finally, if the idea works well, the chatbot will help in raising funds. A final score of investment readiness is then sent to the lending institution.

“The idea of Business Raja emerged while our team was working with grassroots innovators and helping them navigates the challenging entrepreneurial landscape. The AI chatbot and the resources associated with it help to do this, at scale so we can enable more entrepreneurs faster”, explains Swati.

It doesn’t require a flash of genius or invention of any radical idea to change the story line. What is ultimately needed is practical compassion. Most revolutionary solutions have been evolved by people like Manav and Swati who looked at the familiar landscape with fresh eyes. They saw promise where others saw hopelessness.

4,23-1-20,The tech-savvy road to health,"Technology has not been a disruptive force in senior healthcare but that story is set to change over the next six years, says Sushant Reddy

We have just celebrated our entry into a new decade. The defining theme of the first two decades of this century was the rise of technology start-ups and their transformative change in our lives. Just 10 years ago, none of us could have imagined the lifestyle changes created by internet-enabled platforms and aggregators like Uber, Amazon, Swiggy, Zomato, Hotstar or Netflix. However, there are some sectors where technology hasn’t had such a transformative effect, yet. One such is healthcare and more specifically, healthcare for senior citizens. What is senior healthcare? This in itself is a very generic term; in fact, the term is so generic that everything, from an Out Patient Department to in-hospital care to the pharmacy can be grouped into this category.

Broadly speaking, senior healthcare can be classified into four areas: Hospital care, preventive care, home care and healthy living.

Hospital care: This is what everyone easily relates to as traditional healthcare. Episodic events such as emergencies, illness, injury treatments at a hospital come under hospital care.

Preventive care: All aspects of healthcare that are preventive in nature such as diagnostic tests, pharmacy, doctor consultations, disease management (diabetes, hypertension), health insurance and so on fall in the category of preventive care.

Home care: Healthcare services delivered at home such as nursing, physiotherapy, home Intensive Care Unit (ICU), dialysis and chemo-therapy services, medical devices and so on come under this.

Healthy living: Services that enable a healthy lifestyle for seniors such as custom-designed senior homes, smart tracking devices, companionship services and so on come under this tag.

The fact remains that senior healthcare is a massive challenge. India is in the middle of a rapid demographic and cultural transition — senior citizens above 60 years are over a 100 million today and constitute eight per cent of the total population. This figure is expected to grow to 350 million, an estimated 20 per cent of the total population by 2050, a dramatic rise in the older population, both in size and proportion.

Another massive factor driving this transition is a mass migration, both domestic and international, of educated, urban youth that happened during the 80s, 90s and the first decade of the 21st century. The country recorded over 30 million international migrants and 139 million domestic migrants as of 2017.

These challenges have increased India’s senior healthcare burden exponentially and the problem is compounded by the fact that despite massive technological advances in this century, it has not yet created a disruptive impact in the senior healthcare industry. This is because of three main reasons, fragmented and localised service providers, low tech savviness of seniors and language barriers.

Fragmented and localised service providers: Traditionally senior healthcare services have been very human-intensive. The role of care provider was and still remains extremely critical and everything else was not a deal breaker.

Low tech savviness of seniors: All things equal, technology adoption of millennials is much higher than that of senior citizens. While seniors are comfortable with popular apps like WhatsApp and YouTube, adoption of other technology in general has been less than spectacular.

Language barriers: English is not a preferred conversational medium for most senior citizens and as most technology platforms are designed for urban, English-speaking customers, this becomes a major mental obstacle not only for senior citizens but also for care providers.

So, the big question is, how can technology transform senior healthcare? There are multiple areas where technology can become a real force-multiplier.

Smart medical alert system: India does not have a reliable 911 emergency service that can be accessed by senior citizens. Having smart medical alert systems that can provide emergency support at the push of a button will be a great value addition for seniors.

Doctor-on-call services: Senior citizens usually avoid visiting a doctor for minor health issues because of mobility and logistic issues. A “doctor-on-call” service where general physicians and specialist doctors can talk over a voice/video call will be a great value proposition for senior citizens.

Internet of Things devices and smart tracking: Senior citizens have a higher risk of falls, rapid heart rate, breathlessness, low blood pressure and so on. Smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices that can track regular health vitals, detect abnormal patterns and alert care providers is another major opportunity in this space.

Smart senior living homes: The concept of senior living was a social taboo until recently. With realty developers revisiting the concept of “senior living”, a lot of Indians are taking a fresh look at this concept.

Intelligent voice platforms: Voice is a major breakthrough when it comes to senior citizens. Easy, intelligent voice-based platforms to order medicines, schedule doctor appointments or health check-ups will be a major opportunity in future.

Technology has not been a disruptive force in senior healthcare but that story is set to change over the next five-six years. With rapid advances in voice-enabled platforms, artificial intelligence and IoT devices, start-ups are burning the midnight oil to come up with smart, easy-to-use technological solutions that create an impact in the senior healthcare industry. It is not a question of “if” anymore, it’s just the “when” that needs to be answered.

5,23-1-20,Vote for the environment,"The spectre of climate change is looming large and pollution cannot be stopped by turning a blind eye to it. In the February 8 Assembly polls, Delhiites need to elect a Government that makes environmental policies its priority

Delhi is heading for polls on February 8 to elect 70 members to the Legislative Assembly and needless to say, campaigning by political parties across the national Capital is expected to reach a fever pitch soon. Like always, this election, too, will witness a plethora of populist issues being made a poll plank by the candidates and their star campaigners as they do the rounds of the city. Populism has become an integral aspect of elections mainly due to the fact that the people of one of the world’s largest democracies have become used to being wooed with sops and benefits. Whether it is regularisation of illegal colonies and structures or subsidised electricity and so on, we just lap it up.

However, do we ever stop to think what the cost of these sops is and who is footing the bill? The answer is that we the people or the electorate are eventually going to pay for the sops, collectively. The sole beneficiary in this will be the political party we elect, who will be laughing all the way to the seat of power, for the next five years.

We, as voters, must critically evaluate the promises being made by the Government in power and all the other contending parties and see what their commitment is for pressing issues such as climate change and the environment. And, we also need to look at the environmental cost of an election. This also needs to be audited and made public in order to ensure that the people realise the environmental costs of this democratic exercise and which parties have had the smallest carbon footprint. This will usher in a positive change in the thinking of the voter which will in turn compel the parties to shun anti-environmental activities in the form of excess use of fuel, plastic and paper during campaigning. The people of Delhi need to question the Government and ask it what it has done to safeguard the environment and also asses what the environment-related promises and assurances other contesting parties are bringing to the table. The subject of pollution in Delhi has been a hotly debated matter, with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claiming tremendous success in reining in the same with the help of the vehicle rationing initiative the Odd-Even Scheme. However, as is the norm in politics, these initiatives have been heavily criticised by the Central Government.

Both the Centre and the Delhi Government have been trading charges over this key issue and blaming each other for the sad state of affairs in the Capital.

As the common man continued to suffer the impact of the pollution shrouding the city in a pall of smog, the judiciary took it upon itself to express reservations on the efficacy of the scheme in controlling the spiraling pollution levels in Delhi-NCR and pulled up the Centre, the Delhi Government and even the neighbouring States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the environmental crisis caused by crop residue burning by farmers.

The Supreme Court also directed the Central Government to assess the feasibility of the use of hydrogen-based fuel technology in the Capital to mitigate air pollution.

However, the fact remains that things should not have come to such a pass. We need clear, tangible and more-importantly quantifiable results against efforts undertaken to protect the environment by all stakeholders. The city is what we will leave to the future generations and it cannot be inhospitable due to pollution that has reached unmanagable levels and turned it into a “gas chamber”, choking and killing the people that reside in it.

The spectre of climate change is looming large and pollution cannot be stopped by turning a blind eye to it. Combatting pollution and climate change need a concentrated and sincere effort by the Government in power that has the resolve and the firm mandate of the people behind it. So this time let us elect the environment. A Government that makes environmental policies its priority will then automatically get elected.

6,23-1-20,‘Release subsidy for paddy procurement’,"Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Ranendra Pratap Swain has written to Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan urging him to release subsidy for paddy procurement in the State.

Swain mentioned that more than 30 lakh metric tonne of paddy has already been procured and Rs 5,400 crore towards MSP transferred to the bank accounts of farmers during the current Kharif Marketing Season 2019-20 and non-release of subsidy by the Centre has disturbed the procurement process.

“Due to non-release of funds, the Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC) has faced difficulties in taking up further procurement. The Centre has released subsidy of Rs 1434.90 crore only against claim of Rs 4307.17 crore for the quarter ending December, 2019. Rs 2,872.27 crore is yet to be received. The advance subsidy (Rs 1400 crore approximately) for the quarter ending March, 2020 is being submitted within a couple of days. Though as per norm advance subsidy is released in the first month of a quarter, no such subsidy has been released during the entire FY 2019-20,” mentioned Swain.

Swain requested Paswan to personally intervene and ensure pending subsidy and advance subsidy released to the State soon. “Since all the resources, including sanctioned limit of bank finance, have already been exhausted, further paddy procurement from farmers may be severely affected, if the subsidy is not received at the earliest,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---release-subsidy-for-paddy-procurement---.html

8,23-1-20,Ganjam DM's move on land registration decried,"The Bharatiya Bikash Parishad, which leads an anti-corruption movement in Ganjam district led by its State president Surendra Panigrahi held a Press meet here on Wednesday against the reported circular of the district Collector to all Sub-Registrars of the district not to allow the registration of any immovable property, be it land or house, without submission of Record of Right (RoR) of the property.

Panigrahi expressed serious concern over the recent circular.

Panigrahi said that the circular issued by the Ganjam Collector on 1.11.2019 not only violates Sub-Section-2 of Sec.22-A of the Registration Amendment Act 2013 of Odisha, but also the the verdicts passed by the Orissa High Court vide Writ Petition WPC No.9997/2014 ( Petitioner Dhabal Prasad Pradhan vrs. State of Odisha) .

The Parishad described the DM’s circular as “Kongaru” circular which is discriminatory and unilateral applicable only for Ganjam district which violates the principles of equality.

It may be recalled here that, the district administration reportedly had convened a meeting on October 14, 2019 on implementation of ORERA Act and Rules on registration of immovable properties in the district in which the builders, realtors and deed writers and Sub-Registrars of the district were present. The district administration then had made clear in that meeting to strictly adhere to the provisions of ORERA Act and Rules pertaining to the registration of immovable properties. As a result, the Brahmapur Builders’ Association, the Deed Writers’ Association and the Legal Cell jointly earlier had also alleged that consequent upon the said circular, the Sub-Registrars of the district were not accepting the document presented before them for registration of immovable property without the presence of RoR, causing inconvenience and loss to the public.

The Government has spent Rs 800 crore from its exchequer for purchasing and developing advanced software to develop a most comprehensive database of land records and for smooth and timely issue of RoRs to the public in least possible time, but in vain, Panigrahi charged. He said that, the Government takes one year to one and a half years time to issue the RoR to the owners/public, instead of one week or one month. If a RoR is not issued to the public within a week time or so, then what is the use of the software, he questioned.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ganjam-dm-s-move-on-land-registration-decried.html

10,23-1-20,Capt sends Hitler's autobiography to Sukhbir,"Even as he questioned SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s logic in interpreting his criticism of party’s stand on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as being ‘anti-Sikh’, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday sent him a copy of ‘Mein Kampf’. Chief Minister advised him to read Adolf Hitler’s autobiography to understand the dangerous implications of unconstitutional legislation passed by the Central Government, of which the Akalis are a part.

Given the current attempts by the Centre to replicate Hitler’s agenda is India, it was important for the SAD leaders to read the former German Chancellor’s autobiography before coming out with irrational reactions on the CAA, said the Chief Minister.

The recent statements of various Akali leaders, including Sukhbir, clearly exposed their ignorance on this sensitive issue, with grave repercussions for the nation, said Capt Amarinder, urging Sukhbir to read the book and decide “whether it’s country first or political expediency”.

“Supporting the bill in both houses of Parliament and in the Vidhan Sabha and opposing it on other platforms is unbecoming of a political leader,” the Chief Minister said in a letter sent to Sukhbir along the book.

In the letter, Capt Amarinder recalled that, during the last Vidhan Sabha session, he had promised to send the Akali Dal copies of Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’, which in English translates to 'My Struggles’.

“These were his (Hitler’s) beliefs which he sold to the German people in his rise to power, which later became his government’s policy, when his Nazi party assumed office,” wrote the Chief Minister, adding that “Apart from destroying Germany in World War II, to fulfil his territorial ambition, from the time he assumed office in 1933 to the end of the war in 1945, his purification of the German race by his ethnic cleansing, led initially to the removal of his main opposition, the communist parties, followed by persecution of the intellectuals, and finally to the extermination of the Jews”.

“Read the book, as one always learns from history. The world has changed and our television and other media are powerful, and certainly different to that of Germany in the 30s under Joseph Goebbels. Nevertheless, the talk of camps and a national register to eliminate the Muslim and Jewish communities is ominous,” Capt Amarinder further wrote, adding that while some of the political parties, including the Congress, were protesting everyday along with universities across the country, “it is time now that others, too, join this movement.”

Meanwhile, taking the SAD president head-on over his remarks, the Chief Minister also asked him to explain how his (Captain Amarinder’s) demand for the Akalis to quit NDA over CAA amounted to “subservience” to the Gandhi family.

“Or are you trying to say that the lakhs of people out on the streets to protest against CAA are doing so simply out of subservience to the Gandhi family,” he asked Sukhbir.

Retorting to Sukhbir’s ‘saving his chair’ jab, the Chief Minister said that his chair was quite secure. “But apparently, you are worried about your wife Harsimrat’s chair in the Union Cabinet and do not want her to lose that at any cost,” quipped Capt Amarinder, adding that this could be the reason for SAD refusing to walk out of NDA despite claiming to take a stand against CAA.

Dubbing Sukhbir’s remarks as a blatant case of double standards, the Chief Minister pointed out that the SAD chief was deliberately twisting his (Captain Amarinder’s) statements in a bid to fool people on the government’s stand on CAA.

“Or is he so ignorant that he does not understand the difference between seeking an inclusive legislation, which allows citizenship for all communities, including Muslims and Sikhs, and a law that excludes certain sections such as the Muslims and Jews etc?” asked the Chief Minister.

He said that Sukhbir need to clarify his and SAD’s stand on CAA, considering their outrageously contradictory statements on the issue over the past several days.

“First they support CAA wholeheartedly in the Parliament, then some of them (Akali leaders) say they want Muslims in CAA (why they did not say so in Parliament is beyond comprehension), then one of their leaders says they won’t fight Delhi polls because they are not ready to review their stand on CAA. But nobody knows what their stand on CAA really is,” quipped the Chief Minister, asking Sukhbir to give clarity, once and for all, on the controversial issue.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-sends-hitler-s-autobiography-to-sukhbir.html

12,23-1-20,"All 7 Hry Independents meet, oppose case against Meham MLA","Murmuring of dissent amongst the Haryana Independent MLAs, on whose support the BJP-JJP Government survives, has begun.

All the seven Independent MLAs who had given unconditional support to the coalition Government, held a meeting under the chairmanship of independent MLA from Rania and Haryana Power Minister Ranjit Singh Chautala in Chandigarh late on Tuesday evening apparently to discuss the case against against Meham's independent MLA Balraj Kundu and his brother.

However, talking to reporters in Chandigarh on Wednesday, Chautala downplayed the meeting and said it was held on general issues. He, however, refused to disclose anything regarding Kundu’s case.

Sources said that in the meeting, while the independent MLAs supported Kundu, Chautala and Nayanpal Rawat, an independent legislator and chairman of Haryana Warehousing Corporation suggested that the issue should be discussed with Chief Minister Manohar Lal before taking any decision.

Winning from the Meham constituency, Kundu is another BJP rebel. He had sought a BJP ticket but when it fielded Shamsher Kharkara, he chose to fight as an Independent and won. The meeting of independent legislators is considered to be important after Kundu had given a warning two days ago to the coalition government to withdraw support. Sources said that a strong objection was expressed to the case registered against Kundu and his brother by independent legislators. Independent legislators have indicated that they would pressurise the government on the matter.

Kundu and his brother have been booked for allegedly cheating their business partner Narender Dhankar and not paying back Rs 10.50 crore they owed to him. Kundu had earlier said, “The police had booked me in a false case due to political pressure and former MLA Manish Grover is exhorting pressure on administration to implicate me in a false case.”

Two days ago, Kundu had threatened to withdraw support to the BJP- JJP government in Haryana if chief minister Khattar fails to order a probe into allegations of corruption against former cooperatives minister Manish Grover within a month. Grover is counted among the BJP leaders close to Khattar.

Kundu said he had demanded inquiry against Grover for allegedly allotting development projects in Rohtak to his relatives and favourite contractors by ignoring rules and regulations. He also alleged that Grover was also responsible for large scale irregularities in sugar mills across the state during his tenure as cooperatives minister.

The Haryana Police has charged Kundu and his brother Shivraj Kundu for allegedly cheating a Rohtak resident. A case was registered on January 17 against Balraj and his brother Shivraj under relevant Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to cheating, conspiracy and criminal breach of trust on a complaint lodged by one Narender Dhankhar.

Dhankar had alleged that the brothers, who run a construction company, were not paying money to him which they owed to him during business transactions.

Kundu had alleged that he was being framed in the case due to political vendetta at the behest of a BJP leader from the state, who is a former minister. ""I have been raising my voice against corruption. Such false cases will not suppress my voice,"" he told reporters in Rohtak.

Independent MLAs supporting the government include Kundu from Meham, Ranjit Singh Chautala from Rania, Nayanpal Rawat from Prithla, Sombir Sangwan from Dadri, Randhir Golan from Pundri, Rakesh Daulatabad from Badshahpur and Dharampal Gondar from Neelokheri.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-7-hry-independents-meet--oppose-case-against-meham-mla.html

14,23-1-20,Punjab to replace over 15-yr-old 3-wheelers with electric or CNG autos,"To control air pollution, Punjab’s Environment and Climate Change Department, under Tandrust Punjab Mission, has decided to ensure replacement of more than 15 years old three-wheelers with electric or CNG autos.

Informing this, Tandrust Punjab Mission Director Kahan Singh Pannu said that it has been observed that a large number of three wheelers, which are more than 15 years, are operating in the state of Punjab. “But as per Rule 68 C of the Punjab Motor Vehicle Rules-1989, three wheelers auto rickshaws cannot operate beyond 15 years,” he said.

He said that Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has already banned the registration of new diesel or petrol three wheelers in the districts of Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, and Mohali since January 2019.

“In fact, the case for banning such vehicles in the districts of Patiala and Bathinda is also under PPCB’s consideration and CNG supply stations have recently been setup in these two districts to meet the upcoming demand,” he said.

Pannu said that all the three wheelers, which are more than 15 years old, are not just illegally operating in the State but are a major pollution hazard in addition to being accident prone. “In major cities of Punjab, CNG supply stations have been setup and in addition, electric three wheelers have also become available,” he added.

He said that Deputy Commissioners of all major cities have been asked to undertake measures to weed out the old three wheelers and to provide opportunity of having gas or electric based three wheelers to the owners of old three wheelers.

Pannu said that to facilitate the transition, under Tandrust Punjab Mission, it has been proposed that a committee consisting of officers from District Police traffic wing, PPCB, Transport Department and Lead Bank officer of the District may be constituted by Deputy Commissioner under the chairmanship of a senior officer of the District Administration.

“The residual value of old three wheelers is dismally low as these have outlived their life. However, major gas or electric three wheelers companies have agreed to offer a price ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 for old three wheelers, which shall be scrapped by them in the shredding or furnace units, so that these are permanently put off the roads,” he said.

Pannu added that it has been suggested that the owners or drivers of old three wheelers who are desirous of getting new gas or electric three wheelers, should be facilitated to obtain loans at concession rates from commercial banks under the Mudra Scheme or any other scheme of Government or Banks. Even camps of such applicants can be organized.

He said that action, as provided under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, shall continue to be taken against the vehicles running in violations of the Act.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-to-replace-over-15-yr-old-3-wheelers-with-electric-or-cng-autos.html
15,23-1-20,K’handi youth shoots video before suicide,"Pratap Barik, a youth from Lanjigarh of Kalahandi district, who had committed suicide at the Titilagarh railway station on January 18 by jumping before a train, had allegedly lost Rs 70,000 in an online fraud in the name of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC).

The startling fact was revealed from a video recorded by the deceased Pratap himself prior to his suicide.

Sources said Pratap received a call from a person, who identified himself as Rana Singh of KBC’s Kolkota office, informing that he had won Rs 25 lakh lottery in KBC. However, the caller asked Pratap to deposit Rs Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000 in four installments as tax if he wanted to claim the Rs 25 lakh.

In the video, Pratap claimed that he was forced to end life after he failed to contact Rana Singh and realised that he was cheated. He urged the police to nab the fraudster, so that no one else falls prey.

20,23-1-20,"Odisha least corrupt State, international tourism hub","There is big news about Odisha being the least corrupt State of India. The enigmatic Naveen Patnaik's Government has always been firm on a ‘zero tolerance' approach to the malaise right from the day he occupied the loftiest executive chair. Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, West Bengal, Kerala and Goa are in the same respectable league after Odisha.

The corruption survey was conducted by the Transparency International India, and the Local-Circles, a community social media platform to figure out the level of corruption in the country as perceived, felt and experienced by ordinary citizens. The survey also says that Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Punjab are now known to be extremely corrupt.

Two lakh respondents drawn from different sections of the society including 36 per cent women had replied to queries. More than 1.20 lakh responses were analysed for the study. Across the States, 70,000 respondents shared their views on corruption by Governments.

Fortunately, bribe incidents in India have reduced by 10 per cent over the past one year with around 51 per cent people having paid a bribe in the last 12 months. India’s ranking in the Corruption Perception Index 2018 released by the Transparency International has improved three places over the previous year. India is now 78th clean country among 180. While the introduction of systems in public services has largely reduced corruption in centralised services like securing a passport or buying a railway ticket, most citizen services at the state and local levels are still ridden with bribery and kickbacks, says the survey report.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has taken severely stringent action against corrupt officials, no matter how big. In the old times, even Indians of other regions would hardly know Odisha. Most of them believed it was like an African forestland with only tribal communities chasing animals with bows and arrows. After Independence too, the perception about Odisha has not changed much. Only, a few educated people across India knew the Jagannath Temple popular from the ancient times. Guru Nanak in the 15th century and Raja Ranjit Singh in the following one had turned devotees of the Lord believed to be a living one. So, Hindus and Sikhs across the Indian subcontinent knew Odisha because of the unique deity; others knew the State for its beautiful coastline as the temple town of Puri is on the sea.

Legendary Biju Patnaik became one of the youngest Indian Chief Ministers in the early 1960s and shot Odisha to big fame by presenting it as an important region. He set up the deepest port at Paradip, a godforsaken place then, brought several Defence establishments, set up a Sainik School and so many other eye-catching, enviable projects. He stepped down in honour of the Kamraj Plan and many of his dreams of making Odisha a foremost State remained unfulfilled.

Subsequently, a number of spineless and shaky governments came and went without being able to last a full five-year term until 1980 when Janaki Ballabh Patnaik arrived as Chief Minister. He was shrewd and knew the art of keeping everyone happy for hassle-free survival. He was of course a visionary but with a few terrible personal blemishes. Sycophants, crooks and scoundrels virtually kept sticking to him and misled him on countless fronts. His Government, doing so fine in the beginning, degenerated into one of the most corrupt regimes.

Then, Naveen Patnaik happened. He became CM in 2000. Odisha gradually began regaining the lost glory of being a clean State again. Naveen knew from the beginning that the career politicians are essentially a spoilt lot across India who exploit situations to keep power and make money by guile so as to win the next election without trouble. They first master the art and craft of abusing power and intimidating the ordinary citizens as if they are above law. Even today, in most corrupt States, ordinary legislators make senior police officials and administrators behave like slaves to them. Unfortunately, civil servants having no option left toe the line and join the looting act or leave job and run away. So, Naveen fixed the politicians first. Thus, he told the law-knowing senior bureaucrats to take complete charge. This handful of trusted lieutenants would not only guide the Government but also keep watch over erring politicians who are perpetually hungry for money and power to be used for personal gains. As time rolled by, legislators and Ministers became aware of the fact and began behaving accordingly. The bigger reason for their agreeing to be tamed was that Naveen is perceived as a messiah by the people for his simple lifestyle and gentlemanly reticence. Naveen began kicking out any Minister found guilty of taking bribe and giving undue favours to anyone. This beginning was so dramatic as to send chill down the spines of all politicians who came to power politics only to make merry.

By now, critical bureaucratic guidance is the key to governance in Odisha. And the people have liked it too well though there is quite a great deal of murmur about the State being run by bureaucrats. Ordinary citizens need to know that the Naveen regime runs on the rule of law mode which is only possible if the executive is law-conversant and understands the spirit of the Constitution. But most politicians including Ministers cannot distinguish between ‘executive and legislature' if suddenly asked to do so.

Naveen has his own likes and dislikes. His trusted lieutenants have no right to override him on his preferences. They have only the duty to figure out his vision and dreams. And then start slugging to keep the Ministers on toes by telling them what not to do. Ministers with commonsense and fundamental knowledge have a smooth sailing. The dumb ones have to keep quiet and go by what’s told by the seasoned bureaucrats. Hence, Odisha is the cleanest State today.

Odisha became the sports capital of India two years ago. It is already a great tourist destination globally. The Puri-Konark-Bhubaneswar triangle is truly a golden triangle now. The face of Puri has been lifted so magnificently as to turn the bitterest Naveen critic his ardent fan now. Not surprisingly, the national meet of Tourism Ministers and secretaries is being held on January23 and 24 at the most-talked about ‘Eco Retreat' on the marine drive near Konark. Best policies are expected to be made and contentious issues resolved jointly at the out-of-the-world facility on the sea.

Evidently, Odisha is truly the ‘best kept secret’ in India!",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odisha-least-corrupt-state--international-tourism-hub.html
21,23-1-20,Bangladeshi sex workers racket: Ibrahim’s aide held,"Police on Wednesday arrested one more accused involved in the high-profile sex racket busted here on Tuesday. The arrestee was identified as Prasant Parida.

Parida is a close aide of the sex racket’s kingpin Sheikh Ibrahim, who was arrested by the Special Task Force (STF) of Crime Branch.

Sources said Parida was the linkman between Ibrahim and notorious pimp Sunil Meher, who is presently lodged in a jail. Sunil was allegedly trafficking the girls from Bangladesh with Parida’s help to operate sex trade in Bhubaneswar.

The matter came to the fore after a woman was allegedly assaulted in a hotel at Old Station Bazaar in the city in December last.

During course of investigation, the Commissionerate police found that victim was an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh and working as a sex worker in the capital.

Later, she was arrested for staying illegally in Bhubaneswar without valid documents. Reports said that she had come to Odisha on basis of a fake Aadhaar card which she had obtained during her stay in West Bengal.

The subsequent investigation revealed that apart from her around 20-25 girls from Bangladesh were also engaged in the sex trade.

23,23-1-20,Punjab tableau at R-Day to propagate basic philosophy of Guru Nanak Dev,"Kirat Karo', 'Naam Japo', 'Vand Chhako' is the theme of the official tableau of Punjab for the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on January 26.

''The tableau of the state government at the Republic Day-2020 is dedicated to the ideology of the first Sikh Guru Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji to mark the year long celebrations of 550th Prakash Purb of the founder of Sikhism'', an official spokesperson said here on Monday.

This showcases the basic philosophy of the first Sikh Guru in terms of the eternal message of 'Kirat Karo' (earn livelihood by honest means), 'Naam Japo' (constant chanting of Name of God), 'Vand Chhako' (share the fruits of labour), to create an egalitarian society, the spokesman said.

The spokesperson said the entire tableau gives a serene aura of all pervasive teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

The tractor portion starts with a larger than life hand depicting the concept of ‘Oneness of God’. The trailer portion comprises three principles namely ‘Kirat Karo’, ‘Naam Japo’, ‘Vand Chhako’ which form the cornerstone of the Sikhism.

The trailer begins with the message of ‘Kirat Karo’ which pertains to earn an honest, pure and dedicated living by exercising one's God-given skills, abilities, talents and hard labour for the benefit and improvement of the individual, their family and society at large. Next comes in the middle portion of the trailer ‘Naam Japo’.

In Sikhism, it refers to the meditation, vocal singing of hymns from the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji in praise of the Lord and in gratitude to the various bounties bestowed on mankind or contemplating the various Names of God especially the chanting of the word Waheguru, which means ""Wonderful Lord"". Behind that is seen ‘Vand Chakko’, which lays emphasis to share what you have and to consume it together as a community.

The end of the trailer depicts a Gurdwara, a place of worship.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-tableau-at-r-day-to-propagate-basic-philosophy-of-guru-nanak-dev.html

Had the governments provided the necessary financial assistance and machinery to dispose of the straw as per the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), they would not have to resort to burn the farm dust, they said.

Sandhwan said that unless and until the government did not fix bonus for Rs 200 per quintal on the minimum support price (MSP) to disposal of the paddy straw, there would be no solution to the problem.

He said that the farmers were left to bear the whopping cost of Rs 6,000 to 7,000 per acre, which, he said, was beyond the financial reach of common farmer already fighting the financial difficulties.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-seeks-withdrawal-of-cases-against-farmers.html

28,23-1-20,AYOS meet supports new citizenship law,"The Academy of Yoga and Oriental Studies (AYOS) organised a seminar on “Citizenship in India” here on January 19. The meeting was presided over by Sudarsan Nayak. AYOS director Dr Indulata Das, in her introductory speech, said the AYOS has always extended moral support to causes concerning the identity of India and Indian culture.

AYOS president Sudarsan Nayak explained every detail about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the false propagation of a group of persons about it. Granting citizenship to the persecuted minority of Pakistan and Bangladesh was a longstanding demand. It was advocated by Gandhi, Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, etc., he added.

Scholar Arun Kumar Upadhyaya said 19th January is the 30th anniversary of holocaust and exodus of Kashmiri Pandits. The country was divided because Muslims did not want to live with Hindus. Where is the question of Muslims getting citizenship in India again?

Dr Indulata Das said the persons who are agitating against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are ignorant. But they are misguided by people who are sympathisers of infiltrators and miscreant elements hiding in the country.

Every participant in the meeting shared his views about the CAA and reiterated that the law is harmless and causes no inconvenience to any citizen of India. The participants also expressed a unanimous view that the NRC is the basic need of a nation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ayos-meet-supports-new-citizenship-law.html
29,23-1-20,LS Speaker: MPs should ensure uninterrupted House proceedings,"Speaker of Lok Sabha, Om Birla on Wednesday said that all public representatives should take pledge to ensure that the proceedings of the house are not interrupted even for a minute.

Speaking as a Chief Guest on the closing ceremony of two-day orientation programme for the training of all the Members of Legislative Assembly organized by Haryana Vidhan Sabha in association with Parliamentary Research and Training Institute for Democracies (PRIDE), Lok Sabha Secretariat, he said discussion on various topics including budget estimates and suggestions before presenting the budget would enable the elected representatives to effectively put forth the aspirations of people before the government.

While expressing concern over the comparatively less sittings in the State Legislatures, he said that if this situation continues to happen, the public representative would not be able to discuss issues in the interest of people. In these circumstances, the step of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar to increase the sittings of the House is praiseworthy.

He said that it is the public representatives who directly connect with the public and if the sittings are not increased, they would not be able to put forth their issues before the government in an effective manner. Quoting example, he said that in the 12th State Assembly only 56 sittings (approximately 10-12 sittings per year) held in five years, which is a not good sign for a healthy democracy.

He hoped that despite being a small House, the Haryana Vidhan Sabha would become a role model for other State Assemblies in the country in terms of constructive debates, uninterrupted proceedings and increase in the number of sittings. He said that all the public representatives should take pledge to ensure that the proceedings of the house are not interrupted even for a minute.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ls-speaker--mps-should-ensure-uninterrupted-house-proceedings.html
30,23-1-20,"Top cops of Punjab, Chandigarh, Hry to meet once in three months","In a bid to ensure better coordination on law & order front, the top cops of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh will meet once in every three months.

The Director General of Police (DGPs) of neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana and their joint capital Chandigarh will meet to discuss issues related to interstate gangsters, to tackle drug menace, safety of women among others.

Apart from this, SPs of two states and the union territory will meet once in a month for better coordination on law and order front especially in the interstate gangs related crimes while the field police officers will meet more frequently for coordination and cooperation in crime case investigations.

These decisions were taken at the meeting of Apex Committee for coordination of tricity held under Punjab Governor and Chandigarh Administrator VP Singh Badnore on Wednesday here. Punjab Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh, Haryana Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora, Manoj Parida, Advisor to UT Administrator and other senior officers of Civil and Police Administration from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were present at the meeting.

During the meeting which lasted for more than one and a half hours, the Chandigarh Administration recommended establishing a special unit involving senior police officers from two State Governments and UT Administration to deal with crime by interstate gangsters.

Apart from this, the Administration suggested extension of e-beatbook system in the tricity (Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) and integration of emergency response support system.

“It has been decided that DGPs will meet once in three months to ensure better coordination between three authorities. The need to establish special investigation units, integration of emergency response support system and other requirements for better policing system will be discussed at DGPs’ meetings,” said a senior officer of UT Administration after the meeting.

The coordination committee discussed about various law and order issues like the participation of both the neighbouring states in tackling the crimes committed by the interstate gangsters, snatchings and thefts in the tricity. It was also suggested that there should be special hotline for seamless transfer of border area calls in the tri-city, the officer said

The Administration has also recommended that the security audit of public places for women safety should be done on various safety parameters like lighting, openness, visibility, security, public transport and setting up of powerline for women and child safety and adopt the best practices on same lines from other states including Uttar Pradesh.

At the meeting, Chandigarh Administration apprized the neighboring State Governments that no action was taken from their side to prevent the entry of agitators from joint border even after prior information was given to them and stressed on better coordination and cooperation.

Some of such incidents mentioned by the Administration included entry of Kissan Majdoor Sangharsh Committee Pidi Group entering Chandigarh from Punjab border and reaching Prime Minister’s rally place at Sector 34 here in May last year and agitators from BKU Kadiyan Group, Joint Action Committee of Punjab and UT Employees and Punjab Govt pensioners, Gazetted and non-gazetted SC/BC employee federation , BKU Lakhowal Group entering the city from Punjab border on various occasion for protests last year.

Apart from law and order issue, discussion was held on construction of outer ring road, inner ring road and traffic management issue. Not keen on implementation of metro project, the three authorities maintained their earlier stand on project, considering the non-viability and high cost.

Following a discussion on this, it was decided that the committee under the Advisor to the Administrator will look into various agendas discussed and resolve the health and transport issues of the tricity. The Administrator directed that this Committee should meet more frequently.

At the meeting, the Administration has recommended that the speed limits of the major roads connecting Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali should be same. The UT Administration also insisted on action against plying of auto rickshaws without permit especially diesel run autos, mandatory QR code for auto rickshaws, taxis and public transport for the safety of passengers especially women.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/top-cops-of-punjab--chandigarh--hry-to-meet-once-in-three-months.html

32,23-1-20,Institutions for women safety face infra crunch in Hry,"Even as crime against women is rising in Haryana, proper infrastructure is not in place at the institutions set up especially for women and children for their safety, security and welfare.

The stark reality came to light as Haryana State Commission for Women chairperson Pratibha Suman conducted inspections of various Working Women Centres (WWCs), One Stop Centres (OSCs), Mahila Ashram, Safe Houses, Women Police Stations (WPSs) and other centres set up for Women in Rohtak.

Data of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW) suggests that crime against women has increased in Haryana this year in comparison to previous two years, triggering concern. Referring to NCRB reports, the opposition leaders have accused the State government of insensitive attitude towards women’s security and said that Haryana has stood at third rank in crime against women across the country.

Talking to The Pioneer, Commission chairperson said, “Along with members of district level service authority and the Commission, we conducted inspections at One Stop Centre, Mahila Ashram, Women Police Station and other centres set up for women in Rohtak. Several shortcomings were found at these centres. The inspection report will be submitted to Chief Minister for further action.”

Pratibha Suman said that in course of inspection at the centres, it was observed that women of the region were unaware about institutions set up for them. Due to this, very few complaints were registered at these institutions. Moreover, these institutions were being operated without adequate staff and had inadequate basic infrastructure.

Suman said that at the Safe House, Rohtak, proper arrangement for women living there was not in place and there was poor sanitation at the premises. In one room, four women were accommodated. They were facing inconvenience. Washroom was not properly maintained, she said, adding that at Women Police Station, Rohtak, some women staff were seen sitting in the sun and gossiping. When asked about this, they replied that they joined here few days ago after completing their training but work has not been assigned to them by the authorities concerned.

The Commission chairperson further said that during inspection it was found that one-stop centre for women ‘Sakhi’ is facing shortage of staff, basic infrastructure, causing problems to victims of sexual assault, dowry and domestic violence even though such centre is getting around Rs 1.50 crore each year.

At One Stop Centre, Rohtak, shortcomings were found like shortage of staff, visitor’s register was not maintained; office’s register was poorly maintained; one security guard was deputed here but he was on duty sans uniform; only 27 complaints were registered in one year; staff was not adequately deployed and also not trained properly and other necessary infrastructures were missing, the Chairperson of the Women's Commission said.

The Commission informed that one Stop Centre, also known as ‘Sakhi’ is a project of the Union government under the Nirbhaya Fund for providing police, medical and legal help to women victims. As per government order, this centre resolves any issue related to distress and violence against women. It also provides integrated services and facilities at a single point, saving the victims from unnecessary harassment and delay caused by hassles involved"", she said, adding this centre specifically deals with issues involving crime against women and minors, including rape, molestation, domestic violence, child marriage, child abuse, sexual assault, kidnapping and dowry complaints. Despite allocation of fund of around Rs 1.50 crore, such institutions are without basic infrastructure.

Suman said such inspection drive will continue for ten days. She said a drive has now been launched to know and review the actual status of the execution of centre and State Government sponsored schemes being operated for the safety, security and welfare of the women and children. For this, team members led by Commission member would conduct surprise inspections across the State. After inspection, reports will be sent to the State Government for further action.

The Commission received seven complaints of gang rape from various parts of the State over the last six months. As many as 99 rape cases were reported at Commission from April 15 to December 15 last year. The Commission had received around 150 complaints of sexual harassment of Women at work place from various parts of the State over the last six months.

The NCRB data shows that year by year, crimes against women in Haryana are increasing. The recently released figures of the year 2018 by NCRB reveal that in the year 2018, crimes against women increased by 26 percent as compared to the year 2017. In 2018, there were 14,326 crimes against women which is an average of 39 crimes against women were committed each day. According to the NCRB data, 1099 rape cases were reported in the year 2017 which increased by more than 17 percent in 2018.

Gupta said every year, about 1 crore applications are received online in Haryana. More than 70 lakh are received through the Antyodaya Saral platform. More than 1 lakh queries and grievances regarding schemes and services are resolved every month through the Antyodaya Saral Helpline (1800-2000-023).

More than 15 lakh SMS are sent to citizens every month to inform the status of applications. On an average, departments have got a rating of 4.3 out of 5 for citizen satisfaction through the feedback calls made to citizens every month.

38,23-1-20,Three Odisha girls to get Bravery Award,"Three girls from Odisha among 22 children would receive the ICCW National Bravery Awards 2019 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the eve of Republic Day this year.

While Purnima Giri (16) and Sabita Giri (15) of Kendrapada district would get the ICCW Dhruvi ward for their heroic act of saving 12 persons from drowning in a river full of crocodiles on January 2, 2019, Srimati Badra (10) of Angul district has been chosen for the ICCW Prahalada Award for helping a friend who lost her right leg in a train accident.

Soon after a picnic boat carrying 52 persons sank in a river in Nipania village on January 2, Purnima and Sabita dived into the river and saved as many as 12 persons from drowning. As many as 11 picnickers had died in the incident.

On November 27, 2018, Srimati along with Pramila Munda were crossing a railway track when a stationary goods train suddenly started moving. Thoug Srimati successfully crossed the track, Pramila fell down and lost her right leg. Srimati pulled Pramila forcefully out of the track and carried her on her shoulder for 300 metres up to her residence. Thereby she could be saved.

On Wednesday, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik conveyed his greetings to Sabita and Purnima for being chosen for the National Bravery Award.

43,23-1-20,State of Medical Education in India,"The troika of health, education and nutrition are the basic needs of each and every individual irrespective of the caste, creed, race, gender, religion and region. All these three are interrelated.

The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed January 24 as the International Day of Education. The right to education is enshrined in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The declaration calls for free and compulsory elementary education. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted in 1989 goes further to stipulate that countries shall make higher education accessible to all.

The international community recognised that education is essential for the success of all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. These goals are concerned with poverty, health, education, nutrition and other basic infrastructure. There are 104 sub indicators for these 17 goals. I would like to touch only education. Secret of success of any individual in day-to-day life lies in application of behaviour knowledge and skill. All these three can only be acquired with education only.

The adjusted Net Enrollment Ratio from class I to X in India is 76 per cent while the target is 100 per cent enrollment. Under the universal health coverage the target is 100 per cent however India could achieve 29 per cent according to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). Tendulkar committee estimated in 2011-12 that 22 per cent of Indian population lives below poverty line while SDG target is 11 per cent.

Hunger is a big problem in India which is causing stunting in children. About 35 per cent of children under-5 years are stunted according to the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey report 2016-18 of the ministry of health and family welfare. Similarly mortality under-5 year per 1,000 live births is 50 which should be 25 as per SDG target. Unemployment rate for 2017-18 in India stands at 6 per cent which should be 0 per cent.

Being a medical doctor and having worked in scores of medical institutions of India and abroad in last 40 years in different capacities from trainee to teacher and examiner to advisor in various medical bodies, I will confine my views mainly to medical education.

According to a report published in 2018, there are 374 medical colleges. There are 31,385 under graduate seats in Government and 60,105 in private medical colleges. But the ratio of doctor and patient is not matching with WHO standard which is 1:1,000. Over population is diluting this ratio though country is training the maximum number of the doctors in the world.

Rupees 300-400 crore is needed to establish a medical college and approximately Rs 50 crore annually to run it. Our medical colleges are mainly located in the rural areas particularly most of the private medical colleges. The cost of the land is exorbitant in urban areas hence the owners prefer to establish the medical college in rural and remote area. But then it becomes difficult to get the patient in such sparsely populated rural areas and to get the well established experienced doctor, as a full time faculty in that area.

The younger generation newer teachers do not prefer even well equipped medical college of rural and remote areas because of non availability of quality education for their children and other basic facilities like shopping, recreational and entertainment facilities for their children and their families. They rather prefer small and poorly equipped setup in urban areas. The frequent shifting and premature promotion of faculty again leads to the further deterioration in the medical training and teaching and this becomes vicious circle.

Recently, the medical infrastructure is becoming more and more expensive and health care services are becoming more and more technology oriented hence colleges are ill equipped. Therefore, they are unable to provide the quality medical education as expected.

There is mismatching of money and merit in India. It is a paradox in medical education sector in the current scenario. The government colleges are having well educated and experienced faculty but there is lack of newer or advanced technical support. However many private colleges are well equipped but they are not having properly educated trained and experienced faculty hence in both scenarios the quality of education is compromised.

According to Dr BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian constitution and educationist, the education ought to be brought within the reach of everyone, hence, education should be cheapest in all possible ways and to the greatest possible extent.

But contrary to above views most of these private medical colleges are run by businessmen on business principles while the concept of medical education is lacking. The owners of the medical education institutions are working as the investors and they want to make more money from these organisations. The medical colleges have become centres to mint money. Fee for full MBBS course in private medical college is ranging from Rs 50 lakh to more than Rs one crore in certain colleges.

Practice of cheating, copying and impersonation was prevalent in Xth and XIIth board examinations but now it seems that these malpractices has come in medical entrance examinations as well. Here I would like to remind you about Madhya Pradesh medical entrance examination scam of 2013 which was named as Vyapam scam.

A single national level National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test by Government of India for undergraduate (NEET-UG) was introduced in 2013 to get rid of existing menace of capitation fees and other fraudulent activities which were prevalent in medical entrance examinations across the country. Here, I would like to share one more fraudulent incident of Tamil Nadu NEET impersonation scam reported in October 2019 in mass media. It is alleged that the son of a doctor got admission in Theni Government Medical College in Tamil Nadu by managing and engaging a proxy candidate to simultaneously write the exam for him with same credential from another centre.

A report by Reuters in 2015 stated that one out of every six (17 per cent) of medical college in the country has been accused of cheating, according to Indian government records and court filing. These incidents could be the tip of the iceberg. One can imagine the quality of medical education being imparted.

If the status of the medical education is analysed seriously in detail then it seems that there is problem in our education system. Most of the brain functions are developed in childhood. Interest of the education in any children develops in primary schools. The children not only learn the skill of the reading and the writing but they learn ethical values as well and they themselves develop the skill of further improvement in them. Old habits die hard.

We should try to improve not only the medical education but emphasis should be given to the primary and secondary education. If we improve primary and secondary education then we can definitely improve medical education along with them.

Health, education and nutrition are the three basic pillars of the growth and development of any nation. Education is one of the important pillar of the growth of an individual and ultimately of the family, society and the nation. Health, education and nutrition in modern times have become sellable products which are bought by the money only. Money can be earned by the employment especially for those who don’t have the funds to start as an entrepreneur and therefore employment can only be achieved by quality education.

John Dewey, an American educationist said whatever role is of food and reproduction in existence of physical life of humans, similar role is that of education in their social life. Horace Mann an American educational reformer said where anything is growing, a former is worth of a thousand reformers.

If we analyse overall causes of poor results of medical or surgical treatment then they are mainly attributed to the lack of quality basic medical education, training and the experience of that particular doctor. The quality of the work depends upon the quality of the worker. The aim of the government should be not only to provide the education but equitable quality education. Although this is relevant for all kind of education but it is more relevant in case of medical education as medical doctor deal with the life of human beings and many times decisions have to be made at an instant which may change the life of the individual.

This disaster risk reduction programme resonates with our state government’s recent call to corporates and NGOs to take ownership of schools, and help improve the quality of infrastructure and education.

We can ensure safety with the help of awareness. It is a proved significant tool towards the safety of children.

It is important to make the stakeholders aware of their rights as well as information that can help them become risk prepared.

We have planned to build wooden buildings for schools in Uttarakhand to save our children from hazards and risks; it will be economical as well.”

SEEDS co-founder Manu Gupta said, “We are pleased to partner with the government of Uttarakhand to bring our programme to Dehradun and Haridwar. The Honeywell Safe Schools programme is built on SEEDS’ child-first approach towards risk reduction, empowering children to become change agents for building resilience in the communities.”

53,23-1-20,Edu dept starts enrollment campaign in Govt schools,"In view of the declining number of students in the government schools, the education department has undertaken a drive to identify out of the school children in the state and admit them in the government schools. The department alarmed by loss of interest of parents in admitting their children in the government schools and decision of state government to close schools with less students has directed the teachers to initiate enrollment campaign in right earnest. In the campaign, the teachers would visit households in their areas and request the parents to send their wards to the government schools.

The department had asked the education officers to ensure that all the children between age group 6 to 14 are enrolled the schools. During the campaign, the teachers would inform the parents about benefits like Mid Day Meal (MDM), free textbooks, free uniforms and better quality of teachers. Apart from them, the co-curricular activities, sports, scholarship programmes, computer education and child health programmes would also be told by the teachers to the parents.

The enrollment campaign started on January 1 would continue till April 31. The director academic research and training, Seema Jaunsari told The Pioneer that in the first phase the teachers would prepare a list of all such children who are out of the school.

This phase would end on February 15. In the second phase enrollment of the listed children would be done.

Teachers of the schools having less than ten students are taking special interest in the enrollment campaign as they know that further decrease in number of students would lead to closure of their school and their transfer.It is pertinent to mention here that education department was forced to close 800 schools in last 19 years due to low enrollment of students. It is learnt that there are 2800 schools in the state which have less than ten students.

55,23-1-20,Absence of CT scan facility at GDMC hospital,"The indecision on part of the authorities in installation of CT scan machine is adversely affecting the patients and tarnishing the image of the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital here.

The important radio diagnostic machine of the biggest Government hospital of the State is non-functional from February 2019. However repeated pleas of the hospital administration to replace the old error prone machine with a new one have failed to yield any result.

It is learnt that some senior officials of the health department are unduly interested to hand over the facility of CT scan to a private player under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.

However the process is said to be stuck creating problems for the patients and the hospital administration.

Considering the patient load in the hospital and the fact that the GDMC is planning to start PG courses, at least two CT scan machines are required.

In its recent visit, the team of Medical Council of India (MCI) had expressed shock over the absence of the radio diagnostic facility in the hospital. Interestingly the GDMC has started a diploma course in radio diagnosis in absence of a basic machine like CT scan.

When contacted, the Principal of the GDMC, Dr Ashutosh Sayana said that the state administration has to take the decision on handing over the centre in PPP mode or purchase a new machine. “All we have requested that the GDMC hospital needs the CT scan service restored,’’ he said.

The CT scan machine was installed in the hospital in the year 2004 and as per the norms this machine has become obsolete and needs immediate replacement.

The hospital administration has requested the state administration to replace the machine with modern Coronary CT Angiography machine. However instead of providing a new machine, the state administration deliberated on the option of handing over the centre to a private player on PPP mode which has resulted in delay.

More than 50 CT scans were done by the lone machine daily when it was operational and in absence of this facility the patients are forced to visit expensive private hospitals and diagnostic centres to get the CT done. In absence of CT scan facility in the hospital, the doctors in some cases were advising MRI scans for the patients resulting in extra load on the MRI machine.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/absence-of-ct-scan-facility-at-gdmc-hospital.html

However, the delay in the process of decision making- whether to go for PPP mode or purchase a new machine- at the highest level is creating problems for the patients arriving at the radio diagnostic department of the medical college hospital for CT scan.

One expert said, “What more can reflect the dismal state of health services in the Himalayan state than the fact that an important machine like CT scan is non-functional from last one year in the biggest hospital of the state situated in provisional state capital? Immediate corrective measures are required in health system.’’",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/love-for-ppp-mode-in-health-dept-raises-eyebrows.html
57,23-1-20,Govt not to bow down before protesting doctors: Singhdeo,"State health minister TS Singhdeo on Wednesday clarified that the state government was not going to bow down to the pressure tactics being applied by doctors, opposing double OPD in Chhattisgarh.

He was addressing a press conference at his official residence.

Singhdeo also shared a comprehensive result of intensive anti-malaria drive underway in Bastar region- where highest numbers of death due to malaria are reported every year.

“In past four days 12,108 people were found malaria positive during special malaria screening drive carried out in Bastar region,” the health minister told reporters.

He explained that earlier it was estimated that between 40,000 to 45,000 people are affected by Malaria annually in Bastar region.

According to Singhdeo all blocks of Sukma, Bijapur, Narayanpur and Dantewada were covered in the drive. Also, those blocks in Bastar who had API (annual parasitic index) above 10 were also covered in the programme.

“I believe people in Bastar will get a big relief from this programme,” he hoped.

According to the minister, 1720 groups of Mitanin and health workers have been deployed that are going visiting Bastar hinterlands to check malaria.

Our target is to reach 13.56 lakh people, he mentioned.

To a query about the protest of Chhattisgarh in-service Doctors Association (CIDA) against double OPD, he said I feel they should not go on strike.

“This decision has been taken in public interest. We are not asking doctors to work more than seven hours,” he added.

“Actually, double OPD is six hours duty only. Also, if anyone is attending OPD in morning and is in operation theater in the evening, then it is not necessary that they need to attend OPD in the evening hours,” the minister clarified.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-not-to-bow-down-before-protesting-doctors--singhdeo.html

Considering the congestion in Paltan Bazaar due to two-wheelers, MCD had decided to restrict two-wheelers in the area.

However, the members of Udyog Vyapar Mandal said that the traders and merchants of Paltan Bazaar do not agree with the idea.

According to president of Udyog Vyapar Mandal, Pankaj Kumar Masson, “There is not much congestion in the area. People do not stay for hours in the market to shop or buy things so the vehicle that enters the market also leaves shortly.

But if the entry of two-wheelers is banned, it will be difficult for people, especially the old and women with kids to walk all around the market.”

However, the customers in the market have different opinions. According to Pallavi Mishra, “It would be great if the entry of any kind of vehicle is banned here.

The place is always congested and vehicles just take the congestion to another level.

At times we do not get proper space even to walk which feels suffocating.

So I have no problems with walking some distance in the market.”

“It is already very difficult to walk, drive or do shopping in the congestion of Paltan Bazaar so I am sure most of the people would not mind walking in open space,” added Pankaj Rana.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/traders-request-mayor-to-keep-paltan-bazaar-open-for-two-wheelers.html

81,23-1-20,Artificial colour found in food samples: SFL Report,"In order to keep a check on the quality of food especially during festivals like Dusshera and Diwali, officials from the Department of Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare visited various shops across the State capital collecting food samples from shops and street side food vendors.

However, the reports released three months later by SFL Namkum show that some shops in Ranchi have used artificial colour unsafe for human consumption.

As per the direction of Ranchi Deputy Commissioner, the samples were collected to check for adulteration by Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) Lokesh Mishra from vendors, shops and manufactures across the State capital.

The report presented by SFL Namkum on Tuesday states that three shops in the city have used prohibited colours espically in items like boondi laddu.

The shops include Jodhpur Mishthan Bhandar in Harmu and Maa Tara Sweets in Piska More.

Apart from these samples of turmeric powder collected from Ashok Nagar’s Pahelwan Hotel was also found to be harmful for human consumption.

“Organic food colour should be used in food items but there are some shops which use industry colour which is unpermitted and also unfit for consumption. A show cause notice has been issued to these shops regarding the same and further action will also be taken by the Health Department. The matter will also be dealt with in the judicial court and negligence in preparing food items will be taken strictly,” said Dr SS Kullu, Food Safety Officer (FSO), Ranchi District.

The district administration had sent teams to conduct surprise check operations in various shops. Samples were collected from nine shops while at around 30 places food items were tested on the spot.

Consciousness regarding the use of edible food colours is being stressed upon as industrial colours not just damage the organs but can also cause cancer. For this the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has made food safety training and certification mandatory for all food traders in the City.

The training will include information about the correct way to use edible food colours, packaging, serving clean food, and storing perishables in a proper way.

83,23-1-20,Priyanka returns fire to Mayawati,"Ignoring Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati’s barbs against her for not visiting Kota in Rajasthan after the death of over 100 infants a fortnight back, Congress general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra returned the fire to the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.

“Union Home Minister is challenging a leader for debate on CAA who had not even stepped out of her house for election campaign to fight for her party,” tweeted Priyanka without naming Mayawati.

The Congress leader also replied to Mayawati over her (Vadra’s) silence on the deaths of infants in Rajasthan.

“The challenge was given to a party leader who raises issues of other states and took least interest towards problems in her own,” she tweeted, indirectly targeting Mayawati for showing concern over deaths in Rajasthan but being silent over lawlessness, rising prices, unemployment, problems of farmers etc in Uttar Pradesh.

Interestingly, minutes before Priyanka’s tweet, the BSP chief, through a tweet, accepted the challenge of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for a public debate over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Shah had thrown the challenge to leaders of all parties, including the BSP, for a debate on the CAA on any public platform while addressing a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow.

Last month, Mayawati had flayed Priyanka for her double standards, saying that while Congress leaders were visiting families of CAA protesters in UP, they were not visiting Kota where over 110 infants died in a short time.

Mayawati also said that the top leader (Priyanka), who was in Rajasthan to attend a function, could have taken some time out to go and meet the family members of Kota victims.

Meanwhile on Wednesday, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi arrived in her parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli for a two-day visit to participate in the ongoing training camp of Congress workers led by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

Sonia and Priyanka arrived at Fursatganj airport on Wednesday afternoon and drove straight to Unchahar to meet the family of former MLA Ajay Pal, whose son died recently.

After expressing condolences to the family, their motorcade headed to Bhueymau guest house where the training camp is currently underway. Congress district and city unit chiefs of east UP are undergoing training at the camp.

Wednesday was the third day of the training camp and beside district and city chiefs, office-bearers of newly formed UP Congress Committee also participated in the camp.

The camp was also attended by UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’, Congress Legislative Party leaders in state Assembly and Council, Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’ and Deepak Singh respectively, veteran leader Pramod Tewari and others.

The camp will conclude on Thursday after which both Sonia and Priyanka will return to New Delhi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-returns-fire-to-mayawati.html
84,23-1-20,LSWA criticises new excise policy,"The Liquor Sellers’ Welfare Association (UP) criticised the new excise policy (2020-21), saying that it would adversely affect their business across the state.

LSWA leader Kanhaiya Lal Maurya said that the new policy did not address their demand to increase time of sale of liquor.

“We had made representation on a number of occasions in the past to put forward our demand to increase the sale timing. Senior officials and the excise minister had promised to do so but it has not been done,” he said.

Maurya also criticised the government policy to not allot more than two shops to a businessman. “Earlier, there was such provision at the district level and it was feasible. This way the government has limited the prospect of those interested in liquor business,” he said.

Maurya said the government had increased excise duty by 4 per cent in the sale of desi liquor and thereby slashed the profit of the licencees to another low.

Maurya said that the new policy would force a licencee to take stock for IMFL and beer, failing which he would face cancellation of allotment and penalty for failing to meet the quota.

“This will make the business difficult as the seller hardly has any business through push sale,” he pointed out.

The LSWA leader further said that all fees like fee for renewal, fee for licence and excise duty had been increased which would cut into the profits of a licencee.

“The rate of a pint of desi liquor has also been increased by Rs 5 in the new policy,” he said.

On Wednesday, members of Liquor Sellers Welfare Association held a meeting to discuss their future strategy on the issue.

“Liquor sellers are already passing through an adverse phase in business due to strictness and police raids at model and liquor shops. The sale is not as high it used to be earlier. Under these conditions, the news excise policy will prove to be the final nail in the coffin for liquor sellers,” Maurya said.

A delegation of the LSWA will meet the excise minister soon and submit its demand seeking relaxations.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lswa-criticises-new-excise-policy.html

87,23-1-20,XLRI features in top 30 global business schools,"XLRI — Xavier School of Management has featured in the first edition of Positive Impact Rating 2020, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.

The Positive Impact Rating (PIR) is a radically new student-based rating measuring the positive impact of business schools. It aims to change the thrust of existing rankings from leading schools to be the best in the world to be the best for the world. It addresses the ongoing critique of existing rankings to support mainly economic and selfish goals of already privileged actors, without reflecting the schools’ role as an important social actor.

The Positive Impact Rating was initiated in 2017 by a large global group of academics and institutional leaders from the management education field (GRLI, PRME, HESI, GBSN) with the intention to support fundamental change in the business school sector with regards to the schools’ societal responsibility and impact.

It is the first time that students around the world assess their business schools on how they perceive their positive impact in the world. The positive impact of business schools goes beyond their contribution to business and the economy; it addresses the need for their positive impact for society.

The purpose of this PIR 2020 is to measure how business schools contribute to solving societal challenges by energizing the school and its culture, by educating current and future leaders, by providing relevant research results and offers for continuing education, by participating in the public debate and by being a role model institution. Fr. P. Christie, director, XLRI commented, “We are happy to see that XLRI has featured in the list of 30 leading Global Business Schools in the First Edition of Positive Impact Report 2020. This PIR rating would inspire us to work more diligently towards attaining our Vision and Mission. Millennial B-School students have clearly expressed their views on the importance of Positive Impact on society at large. This benign realization marks a paradigm shift and would foster a collaborative ecosystem and make the process of management education more meaningful and purpose-oriented.”

In fact, XLRI’s tagline - For the Greater Good is a constant reminder to all our stakeholders of why we exist and how XLRI can be a force for greater common good in shaping the management education sector and the community at large.

“Encouraging whole-person growth across intellectual, social, emotional and spiritual levels are important aspects of XLRI’s DNA. For over seven decades we have been consciously working upon these four aspects through our teaching, culture, curriculum, and interaction with each other to help realize our vision to be an institution of excellence, nurturing responsible global leaders for the greater common good and a sustainable future”, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/xlri-features-in-top-30-global-business-schools.html

Murmu, the former Member of Parliament said that as per Article 163 of Constitution, State Government is run in the name of Governor and Chief Minister who is head of the Council of Ministers. Murmu in his letter has highlighted the various provisions necessitated for constitution of council of ministry after the election.

Murmu said it has been nearly a month since the election results were announced but is depressing that even after passing of more than one month that the Chief Minister is yet to form his cabinet. Murmu claimed that recently Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren had talked about implementation of domicile policy based on 1932 Khatiyan and also reserving Class III and IV posts for local people having 1932 land documents.

Murmu said, “Unless and until there is government formation with full cabinet taking shape Shibu Soren’s vision of implementation of domicile on basis of 1932 Khatiyan is not successful.” The former MP said that there has been mixed reactions from different political parties on implementation of 1932 Khatiyan. While Chief Minister Hemant Soren had not said anything on the issue, former chief minister Babulal Marandi had asked to implement domicile based on 1932 Khatiyan. However, Jamshedpur East MLA Saryu Roy had protested the implementation of domicile on the basis of 1932 Khatiyan and equated this with British Government.

Murmu claimed that some people are saying that main reason behind delay in expansion of cabinet is Shibu Soren remark on implementation of domicile based on 1932 Khatiyan, but the main delay is there is pressure tactics from both the alliance partners for cream portfolios.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/salkhan-writes-to-guv-over----delay----in-cabinet-expansion.html

92,23-1-20,Akhilesh ready for debate on CAA,"A day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah challenged opposition parties for an open debate on Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav picked up the gauntlet, saying that he was ready for a debate with Bharatiya Janata Party leaders on the CAA and NRC (National Register of Citizens).

Akhilesh, however, maintained that the BJP should also debate on issues like economic slowdown, unemployment, poverty and death of people due to demonetisation and government harassment.

“I challenge the BJP for a debate on development and ask them to fix a place or a forum with their favourite channels and anchors. We samajwadis are ready for it. Why did they not want a debate on the state of economy and demonetisation. Since the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh, it has failed to protect farmers,” the SP chief said.

Addressing a gathering on the death anniversary of socialist leader Janeshwar Mishra, also known as ‘Chhote Lohia’, at a park named after him in the state capital on Wednesday, Akhilesh alleged that the BJP government had violated the basic structure of the Constitution by the CAA.

Accusing the BJP of discriminating on the basis of religion, the SP chief said, “Those who understand the soul of the country are opposed to the new citizenship law. The BJP is playing with the Constitution as it has a majority in the Lok Sabha. As far as the CAA is concerned, not only the Samajwadi Party but all those who understand the soul of the country are opposing it.”

“I am glad that women have taken the lead and youth are protesting in large numbers but the BJP is trying to suppress their voice. Democracy will be strengthened by the voice of the people,” he said.

“Mahatma Gandhi and Dr BR Ambedkar were against discrimination. But the ruling BJP is doing just that,” Akhilesh alleged.

Accusing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of using words like ‘thok diya jayega’ in speeches, the SP chief said, “This cannot be the language of a politician”.

On former BJP chief Amit Shah advising him to remain silent, Akhilesh said, “They don’t need top officers. Direct a constable, ask him to put ‘ganja’ (cannabis) in my pocket and send me to jail.”

The SP leader said this referring to the case of a Kushinagar-based painter who was allegedly sent to jail in a similar way by the police.

The SP chief alleged that Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of custodial deaths, fake encounters and notices from National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

On being asked about allegations that the SP was speaking the language of India’s enemies, Akhilesh said, “I have never met (Pakistan Prime Minister) Imran Khan. If you talk about Pakistan, I want to tell that we samajwadis are Bharatiya.”

Asked about the BJP’s allegations that money was being paid to women protesting against the CAA, the SP chief said, “The BJP men used to spend money to bring crowds to their rallies. Those who have gathered to protest against the CAA came on their own.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-ready-for-debate-on-caa.html

As per the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal migrants but given Indian citizenship. It does not include Muslims.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Indian Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with National Register of Citizens (NRC) is intended to target the Muslims in India.

However, the Central government has dismissed the charges, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone’s citizenship.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mayawati-accepts-shah---s-challenge-for---debate-on-caa.html
94,23-1-20,"3,500 acres land acquired for defence corridor: Min","Uttar Pradesh government has acquired nearly 3,500 acres of land for its flagship defence manufacturing corridor project that is estimated to attract public and private sector investments to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.

“While we have already acquired 3,500 acres land near Jhansi for the proposed defence manufacturing corridor, similar steps are in the pipeline at other places,” UP’s Industrial Development Minister Satish Mahana said on Wednesday.

In the recent past, the Yogi Adityanath government has speeded up the process for acquiring land for the defence corridor as UP will be hosting the 11th National Defence Expo in Lucknow between February 5 and 8 this year.

Top defence manufacturers from the USA, Russia, Australia, Israel, Germany and other countries are expected to participate in the event, which is being organised in the state capital on the initiative of Defence Minister and local MP Rajnath Singh.

During his recent visit to Lucknow, Singh had said that this edition of Defence Expo would be the largest in terms of exhibition area and number of national and international participants, apart from the value of Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) expected to be signed.

On February 15, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation of the Defence Corridor in Jhansi district and announced the setting up of Defence Corridor at the inauguration ceremony of UP Investors’ Summit in Lucknow on 21 February, 2018.

The defence manufacturing corridor is expected to create about 2,50,000 new job opportunities.

India is the world’s largest military hardware importer and among top military spenders. For meeting modernisation needs of he Armed forces, India will acquire equipment worth US $250 billion by 2027.

However, the current delivery capacity of domestic defence sector is merely US $75-80 billion annually, indicating huge potential for indigenous industry.

On November 27, 2019, a five-member delegation led by Director of the UK-based Defence and Security Organisation (DSO) in the Department for International Trade (DIT), Mark Goldsack, had visited Lucknow and evinced interest to invest in UP Defence Corridor, which spans six nodes at Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Kanpur, Lucknow and Chitrakoot.

Meanwhile, Mahana inaugurated Manthan’’, a two-day brainstorming and leadership development programme for UP’s top bureaucrats, being held in association with Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow.

The minister noted that in view of the state targeting to become a 1-trillion dollar economy by 2024, it was imperative for UP to spur industrial development.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/3-500-acres-land-acquired-for-defence-corridor--min.html

In this programme, an introductory visual of the museum was screened and Dr P Sankara Rao, Asstt Keeper delivered an insightful introduction of the museum with special emphasis on the Tribal Habitat Open Air Exhibition of IGRMS which has been chosen to be the study area for the Senior Fellows.

On this occasion, Prof Amareshwar Galla, Director, International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership, Anant University, spoke about the relevance of choosing IGRMS as the site of study. He maintained that IGRMS sets a perfect place example to know about 'what is National about the National Museum. It connects people and truly represents the indignity of Indian Culture. He emphasised on the need to work on 'decolonizing the heritage discourse'. Collections in the museum largely appear to have focused on the tangible heritage, which is very much a colonial perspective.

The legacy of western colonialism still continued and we need to work with our pride sense of indigenous wisdom. Citing examples from South Africa, New Zealand where 'Heritage' is given the due focus on the values of intangible culture. ""When you ask them what is your heritage, they proudly respond- ""we breathe the values we received through our intangible heritage; we breathe through our ancestors. This inter-generational transmission also appears strong to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The reply to the Right to Information (RTI) by Saurav Das, a member of the National Campaign for People's Right to Information (NCPRI), under life and liberty clause, said the main server of JNU at the Centre for Information System (CIS) was shut down on January 3 and had gone down the next day due to power supply disruption.

The university said its reply to the RTI was related to the specific location and questions sought by the applicant. It also clarified that the servers were damaged by a group of miscreants on January 4.

""As per the complaint filed by administration on January 3, 2020 about the incident in Centre for Information System (CIS) Data Centre, JNU has not claimed about damage to servers on that day. The RTI answers are correct and specific to the questions asked,"" University administration said.

The RTI response also clearly states that servers are located at CIS Data Centre not in CIS office, which seems to be ""conspicuously ignored while highlighting the matter in the media"", they said.

""All FIRs and other complaints filed with police are in-line with the actual incidents that took place on January 3 and do not deviate from actual facts,"" said University administration.

The JNU administration reiterates that a group of masked students came to CIS Data Centre premises on January 3 and forcibly evicted the technical staff, switched off the power supply, locked the premises and squatted in front of the main entrance to the CIS Data Centre without providing any access to the centre, the varsity said.

Before evicting the technical staff out of CIS Data Centre, the masked students forced the technical staff to shutdown the systems, it said.

""This led to the discontinuation of the winter semester registration affecting thousands of students of the university. When CIS technical staff got an access to CIS Data Centre on the morning of January 4 with the help of security, it took more than four hours to restore the entire system of CIS,"" it said.

Damage to the CIS Data Centre server room was caused on January 4 by ""a group of miscreants"" who broke open one of the door-windows of the CIS premises and entered the server room, it said.

Once inside, they turned off the servers and severely damaged the fibre optic cables, power supplies, broke the biometric systems inside the room, it added.

""The miscreants then started sloganeering and intimidated the technical staff from entering the server room,"" the varsity said.

Biometric systems and CCTV cameras at the server room were not vandalised in the first week of January, contrary to the claims made by the Jawaharlal Nehru University administration that students had destroyed them on January 3, the varsity has said in a RTI reply.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/firs-in-line-with-jan-3-incidents--jnu-admin.html
108,23-1-20,Meet Rly officer known for returning lost items,"An octogenarian, Gurcharan Singh Guron, was in a rude shock when he attempted to alight the Amritsar Shatabdi at Chandigarh. He had lost his favourite companion of years Rs walking stick' in the train and it was unmanageable for him for a day until he got the pleasant surprise that it was traced and delivered at his residence the very next day.

Like Gurcharan, Meena Patel too had lost her ornaments and cash amount in Kashi Vishwanath Express but 'found' through similar mechanism the way passenger SR Gupta of Ludhiana got his imported jacket and unbelievable Rs 4 lakh cash bag back which he had left in a Jammu Tawi-bound train from New Delhi. Last week, a resident of Varanasi got his travel ticket, besides $ 2,100, RMB 2200, some Indian currency, 10 debit cards and a passport.

Minal Shah, who had come from Kenya and was travelling from New Delhi to Amritsar, lost her I Pad in the Shatabdi and was surprised when she received a call from New Delhi Railway Station that it was found. Talking over phone from Kenya, Minal said she couldn't believe her I Pad was traced and appreciated the efforts of railways.

From delivering information and objects like laptops, jewellery, costly mobile phones to cheap pens and ornaments, New Delhi Railway Station Manager (SM) Rakesh Sharma slogs into the track for the ""real"" owner and hand them their objects with pride protecting the image of Indian Railways and the country together. Laptops and I phones have been delivered at Australia, London and United States too by Rakesh's efforts.

In his this effort, he has two effective and trustworthy tool — the pantry car waiters/attendants and the use of technology. As SM of New Delhi railway station Rakesh has earned a name for himself as he has successfully tracked down more than 135 people including foreigners on social media mostly on Facebook and returned their belongings that passengers had misplaced or mistakenly left either inside the train or on the platform premises.

113,23-1-20,Rare migratory guests give bird watchers reason to cheer,"Migratory birds, which arrive in thousands every year in the city, have registered a pleasant beginning this New Year. The flight of migratory birds to the city from Russia, Baluchistan, Myanmar and the foothills of Himalaya got delayed this season. However with the spotting of some of the rare birds, the bird lovers are cheering.

According to bird watchers, due to recent cold wave in European and Asian countries rare species of birds have been forced to migrate to warmer areas. A number of aquatic birds — Common Teal and Shoveller from Myanmar and Cotton Teal and Brahminy Duch (commonly known as Lalsar) from the foothills of Himalaya have been spotted at Dimna and Jubilee lake.

KK Sharma, incharge of Jharkhand and Bihar chapter of Ornithology Society of India, birds have been staying away from the city due to increased human activities. However, he has spotted several migratory birds at Sitarampur Dam at Gamharia.

“During my visit I have witnessed several rare species of at Sitarampur Dam. Several non-aquatic birds, including Wage Tail from Russia and Red-headed Bunting from Baluchistan, have arrived,” conceded Sharma. He said that availability of food and sense of security are the two main reasons that attract the birds in and across the city.

Meanwhile, Bird Watchers Club at XLRI that also keeps a track on the birds informed that they have spotted some of the migratory birds near their campuses.

“Every year we have spotted numbers of birds at our campus area. This year too we have tracked some of the rare birds that migrate from colder regions. Though due to noise pollution the numbers have diminished over the years but this year the numbers are good,” said a member.

Avik Prasad, a city-based avid bird watcher said that extreme cold conditions force these birds out of their habitation during the winter season.

“Migratory birds generally come from South-East Asia and the Siberian region which, at this time of year, reels under severely cold conditions. To protect themselves, these birds migrate thousands mile to warm regions. They stay for four months of winter and then return to their original homeland,” he added

Among the popular varieties that are sighted include Ruddy Shelducks, Great Crested Grebes, Coots, Tufted Pochards and Bar-Headed Geese.

Though egrets and ducks can be seen in plenty but their counter parts, which migrate from nearby areas, are appearing in thin strength, complained few bird watchers and members of Nature’s Trail, who regularly come to the zoo for morning walks. These migratory birds generally arrive at the lake around October and stay still February.

Members of the Nature’s Trail are confident that with further chill in the air migratory birds would be tempted to fly into the city for safer destination, which would give the bird watchers a visual treat.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rare-migratory-guests-give-bird-watchers-reason-to-cheer.html
114,23-1-20,City boy designs country’s first indigenous Menstrual Cup,"Ranchi based 22- year old Pramod Priya Ranjan has designed an innovative menstrual cup, which also happens to be the first such product to be designed in India. His startup- Care Form Labs is a registered company with the government of Jharkhand.

Ranjan’s startup was selected among the top 14 finalists at the National Innovation Challenge in New Delhi on January 19 for Youth Co:Lab supported by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and NITI Aayog. The young entrepreneur has also got a grant of Rs 50,000 and fellowship with a monthly stipend of Rs 25,000 from NITI Aayog- AIM.

“Currently there are about 200 startups which sell menstrual cups across the country but the product is mostly imported from China and USA. The products available are generally not used by the masses. During a survey conducted by my team- Alomi k Parikh, Shreya Yengul and myself, we came across two problems faced by the users which were mainly insertion and removal and later cleaning the cup post use. Identifying this as opportunities, the product has been designed accordingly,” said Ranjan.

The product will soon be available with a case, which will also work as a cleaning kit for the cup. The case made of silicone will have indicators marking the water level and will be manufactured soon. The product is made of 100 per cent medical grade silicone.

“A provisional patent has been filed for the menstrual cup. The prototype is being made in Bangalore so it is a ‘Made in India’ product,” added the designer. The prototype has been tested by users and has received about 10 expert reviews so far.

“While working for an NGO in Pune, I was making a sanitary napkin incinerator - a machine which is primarily installed in colleges and hostels and is used to burn the pads. The machine though useful emits harmful smoke and is also difficult to maintain. That was the first time I heard of menstrual cups and was quite shocked to discover that it is not a very popular product among menstruating girls and women,” added Ranjan.

The pilot project will be launched in March after which the product will be available on leading E- Commerce platforms by the end of 2020.

“In the coming years, I hope to be among the top three companies on leading E-commerce websites selling this product. I want to reach the rural women, so hopefully in five years time after creating awareness on menstrual hygiene and with active participation from the government, NGO’s and self help groups, I hope to reach my target audience. Other health care products like pregnancy test kits are also in the pipeline,” said the young designer.

Born and brought up in Ranchi, Ranjan has done his schooling from Delhi Public School and is a graduate in Bachelors of Design from MIT Institute of Design, Pune. A resident of New Pundag, his father Vinod Kumar Ranjan is a fine arts teacher at Delhi Public School while his mother Tapasi Ranjan teaches Hindi and political science at Vivekanand Vidya Mandir, Ranchi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/city-boy-designs-country---s-first-indigenous-menstrual-cup.html

118,23-1-20,Matiala to see triangular fight,"Delhi elections are being fought on the “model of development”. Matiala constituency nestled in West Delhi is gearing up to witness tough triangular political fight among Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP's) candidate Gulab Singh, Rajesh Gehlot of the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and Congress candidate Sumesh Shokeen. Matiala is a constituency of hundreds of unathorised colonies and also boasts of world class 'Dwarka' sub city having total number of voters 1,46, 92, 136.

The Pioneer visited in the constituency where people spoke about their grievances on poor drainage system, pathetic roads, less water supply, transportation, traffic, few Delhi Government schools, garbage disposal system which are challenging the AAP's development narrative.

Interestingly, in Matiala, people of different economic, social and political background live, instance - Kakrola, the village which is having a deep history associated with Patuadi, Dwarka sectors where Central government employees from across India settled and people, living in unathorised colonies who are happy with AAP and BJP both having double advantage of free electricity /water and ongoing registration process turning their property values in Lakh overnight.

However, a rift between the ruling AAP and the BJP is always visible on the civic issues, Matiala people face challenges everyday to deal with garbage disposal problem. ""Garbage is big issue here as both MCD and BJP fight each other, corporation employees do not work at ground and we have to hire private garbage collector,"" said a Dwarka resident, Radhakrishan who lives in Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats.

Matiala residents also questioned Kejriwal for AAP's effort to combat air pollution. ""No government is putting genuine effort in dealing with air pollution problem be it Congress, AAP and BJP. Why tress is being cut and what AAP has done for road dust, main cause of pollution,"" said Ananya, an employee of Central Ministry.

Importantly, Matiala people deal everyday traffic problem during peak hours. ""There are no adequate exit routes from Dwarka resulting in heavy traffic congestion every morning and evening on Dwarka Palam road,"" said a government employee, residing in Dwarka Sector 6.

Grievances of Matiala voters are related with Public Works Department (PWD) and MCD where people are going out of the way and joined hand with self-help groups for the maintenance of pavements in a bid to avoid accidents.

""Broken pavements may cause accidents; the area is well connected to highways, the difference between service lane and main roads and sewage lines should be visible, no government machineries visit here,"" said a resident near Dwarka Metro station.

Mansa Ram Park, another area in Matiala where rainy season halts the lives of the poor is beset with poor drainage system and water network. Many of the area residents said, neither AAP government nor BJP ruled civic agencies have doen anything in this regard.

While the BJP and AAP are fighting it out, the Congress candidate Sumesh Shokeen sounded confident of his win, ""I will be back with majority as I have done alot for the unauthorized colonies during my tenure as the area MLA.

Accusing his counterpart Gulab Singh, the AAP candidate, Shokeen said that there were 101 unathorised colonies here in Shiela Dixit regime. ""With DSIDC, we worked for these colonies and brought pipeline network here,"" said Congress candidate mentioning about two new Kendriya Vidyalaya in Matiala which he inaugurated.

Measuring both AAP and Congress in one weighting machine, Rajesh Gehlot, the BJP candidate who had won this seat in 2013 elections, said that both have played well on unathorised issues. "" Why Congress remained silent on the issue while ruled for fifteen years in Delhi and AAP has set a limitation as in Matiala, no progress has been made under AAP rule,"" Gehlot said.

Meanwhile according to Election Commission of India (ECI), Matiala votes will be polled at 13,750 polling stations which would be set up at 2,689 centers.

The Rs 10 crore solar power plant has been constructed in three years. On November 2017, the JSCA signed an MoU with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), a German federal enterprise for international ties, for a 400 KW solar power plant the deal being a first for the State.

At the inauguration of solar power project, apart from Chief Minister Soren, local hero and former team India captain MS Dhoni too was present. Inaugurating the solar power project, Chief Minister Soren heaped praise on Dhoni for brining Jharkhand in the international map of cricket. He said, “It was a matter of immense pride for the State that under the captainship of our hero MS Dhoni India won two cricket world cups.”

The country and state acknowledge Dhoni’s contribution for brining Jharkhand in international cricket map. Soren said, “Jharkhand is bestowed with natural beauties, resources and human resources, but Jharkhand is yet to find place in the list of developed States. The State can attain progress and development only if the youth took a pledge to work for the development of State.”

The Chief Minister also asked the people to change their mindset and work earnestly for the progress and development of State.

Team India former captain MS Dhoni on the occasion urged the Chief Minister to create best sports infrastructure facilities for youths so that they can excel in sports. MS Dhoni, who has been left out of the BCCI’s central contacts list for players announced recently, reached the stadium at time but was inside gymnasium. He reached the stage only when the Chief Minister Hemant Soren arrived at the venue. The function was to start at 4 pm but was delayed by two hours as the CM was holding an important meeting.

Apart from Dhoni, JSCA former president and ICC Board member Amitabh Choudhary too was present on the occasion.

Sources said with the setting up of 400 KW solar plant the solar power generated at the plant will, be used during non-match days.

During non-match days, the average power consumption at the stadium complex is 500-1,000KW per hour depending on events held. Once the solar plant is commissioned, we will be able to reduce power use by 30-35 per cent.

Also, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) company has installed solar plants at 12 stadiums in Germany. In India, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) has already embraced renewable power at its Bangalore stadium. Mumbai Cricket Association, Cricket Association of Bengal and Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association are following suit.

JSCA stadium hosted its 1st ODI match on 19 Jan 2013 between India and England and since then it has hosted several ODI, T20 and Test matches. Ranchi is the only venue for international cricket in Jharkhand after Jamshedpur’s famous Keenan Stadium stopped hosting matches due to squabble between Tata Steel, the owner of Keenan Stadium and Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA).",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-gifts-400-kw-solar-plant-to-jsca-stadium.html

Their bodies were found on Tuesday with their throats slit, police said.

Soren had called for an emergency meeting with top officials of various law enforcement agencies in the State on Wednesday in the wake of the murders. “I understand that police cannot be everywhere. But all the law enforcement agencies should try and prevent the occurrence of any such incident in the State in future,” Soren said.

He also extended his support to the kin of the diseased men and asked the district officials to provide all possible support to the families of the men who were killed. “The purpose behind the killing is not clear yet. Following the directive of the CM, we will constitute an SIT under the concerned Deputy Superintendent of Police to probe into the case,” said Additional Director General (Operations) Murari Lal Meena.

The Pathalgadi movement, which has its epicenter in Khunti, advocates the idea of having liberated lands in the interiors where the administration’s interventions are prohibited. In 2017, villagers in parts of Khunti district held Pathalgadi –a practice of demarcating the borders of a village and declaring it as liberated land through writings on stone plaques — and allegedly prohibited entry of the administration in their villages. Some villagers had also reportedly held a few cops hostage during the process. The government had swung into action and launched a massive drive against the movement which resulted in arrest of several Gram Pradhans and Pathalgadi supporters.

Cut to 2020, the Pathalgadi supporters are running a campaign to make villagers reject facilities under various welfare schemes of the government, said officials from West Singbhum, adding that the surrender of identity cards was a part of the campaign. The West Singhbhum administration has identified at least six people involved in advocating the idea of Pathalgadi through muscle power in the villages and will soon launch a manhunt to nab them.

This is the second incident of crime related to Pathalgadi that has shaken the State. Earlier in June 2018, five women activists were gangraped by Pathalgadi supporters in Khunti for protesting the movement. A local court sentenced all six accused in the case to life imprisonment in May 2019.

The incident has mounted pressure on the CM to take immediate actions as it comes close on the heels of his decision of withdrawing sedition charges leveled against Pathalgadi supporters in Jharkhand during the former BJP regime here.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-directs-sit-formation-to-probe-west-singhbhum-killings.html
123,23-1-20,Hemant hints at Cabinet expansion soon,"Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday hinted towards the expansion of his Cabinet in next couple of days. Soren, while talking to media person at Birsa Munda International Airport on his return from New Delhi said, “There is no confusion on cabinet expansion. The opposition is yet to recover from its shocking defeat in Assembly election.”

“The Opposition is upset with its loss and is spreading rumour that there are differences between JMM and Congress over Cabinet expansion. I want to make it clear that Grand Alliance is united and there are no differences between us,” added Soren.

Soren’s remark on Cabinet expansion assumes importance as the Opposition has been targeting JMM and Congress for delay in cabinet expansion. The BJP targeting Soren’s government has claimed that both the parties are yet to finalise their cabinet as Congress is exerting pressure on JMM demanding plum portfolios.

State BJP spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo had claimed that Soren is dancing on the tune of Congress as the party is demanding key portfolios in the cabinet. Shahdeo said that due to the blackmailing of the Congress, Chief Minister Hemant Soren spent almost half of his 25-day tenure visiting Delhi Darbar. Shahdeo claimed that the selection of ministers and allocation of portfolios is the prerogative of Chief Minister, but the way in which Congress is exerting pressure on Chief Minister for getting plum portfolios is condemnable.

Meanwhile, sources said that both the parties — JMM and Congress — have finalised the shape of new Cabinet. Soren on his recent visit to Delhi for receiving ‘Champion of Change’ award from former President Pranab Mukherjee had discussion with senior Congress leaders on Cabinet expansion. Sources said the Cabinet expansion will be done on January 28.

The Hemant Soren Government in State comprises three Ministers who took oath along with him on December 29 along with two ministers from Congress quota (Alamgir Alam and Rameshwar Oroan) and one minister Satyanand Bhokta from RJD camp.

Sources said the delay in Cabinet expansion is mainly due to both parties failing to reach consensus on number of ministerial berths and key departments. While the Congress wants five ministries, the JMM is willing to give only four. The Congress also wants important ministries, like health, education and rural development.

Also, Hemant Soren has to deal with the Congress demands, meet the aspirations of his own party legislators as well as balance the caste factor. Also, there are over half a dozen JMM legislators who have won the Assembly polls four-five times and are aspiring to be in the ministry.

The JMM, the Congress and the RJD won 30, 16 and 1 seat, respectively, in the recently concluded Assembly polls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hemant-hints-at-cabinet-expansion-soon.html

At the same time the State BJP also demanded immediate arrest of the culprits.

Addressing a press meet, BJP Scheduled Tribe Morcha National Vice president, Arun Oraon said that an attempt is being made to create atmosphere of unrest in the entire State by brutally killing seven innocent tribals at Burugulikera Village under Guddi Block of West Singhbhum District.

“The coalition Government in the State, which describes itself as pro-tribal and indigenous friendly, has not spoken yet. On the 25th day after the formation of this Government, massacre of seven tribals took place, which shocked the entire State. BJP strongly condemns this massacre and demands that the State Government should immediately arrest the culprits,” said Oraon.

He added soon a Central team will be formed by the BJP, which will reach the spot to examine the facts of the incident.

Speaking on the occasion, National Secretary of BJP Scheduled Tribe Front and Torpa MLA, Koche Munda said that the Government is engaged in only participating in meetings in Delhi, which has completely disrupted the legal system of the State. “This incident of West Singhbhum District shows the real situation of law and order of the State. It shows how anti-social elements are getting stronger,” he added.

Munda added only constituting a committee will not bring back the innocent men who were killed.

State BJP Scheduled Tribe Morcha president, Ram Kumar Pahan said that the entire Jharkhand is hurt by this brutal massacre in the State. He said that the BJP demands that the State Government should immediately arrest the people involved in the massacre without any delay and work to curb such anarchic elements and organizations across the State. Expressing condolences to the family of the deceased, Pahan said that at least Rs 10 lakh compensation should be given to the deceased by the State Government.

Seven villagers, including a deputy village head, were abducted on Sunday for allegedly protesting the Pathalgadi movement in Burugurikela village. Some Pathalgadi supporters, police said, had asked the villagers to surrender their Government identity proofs and the abducted men had shown vocal resistance to the demand.

127,23-1-20,"2-time winner turncoat Surender has edge over AAP, Cong?","Delhi’s Timarpur constituency appears to be locked into a straight fight between the ruling AAP and the BJP. The AAP has fielded Dilip Pandey — who unsuccessfully contested Lok Sabha election from Northeast seat last year — while, the BJP has fielded Surender Singh Bittoo — a Sikh leader who had won this seat on Congress ticket twice.

The AAP is trying to woo voter by doling out more freebies such as — laying new pipelines to provide 24 hours supply of potable water, developing infrastructure for educational institutions and construction of public toilets, whereas, the BJP is not leaving any stone unturned to win this seat as its workers are convincing voters to vote on nationality.

On the other hand, the Congress has fielded Amar Lata Sangwan, local municipal councilor, who is yet to establish her identity among voters. Timarpur is home to Tibetans, Saansi tribe, labourers from UP and Bihar and students who come to Delhi to become part of Indian Bureaucracy. Initial trends indicate, this seat is in for a humdinger of a contest as both the AAP and the BJP are not willing to concede even an inch.

Interestingly, even after elected as a councillor from Timarpur ward , Congress candidate Amar Lata Sangwan is yet not known in this constituency. “You can never reach Sangwan in any circumstances. Whenever you dial her number, it is her husband who picks the call. The condition of all the stretches in our locality is pathetic and all the efforts to reach her are failed. Why would we vote for her,” said Ram Naresh, who resides in the same area.

The residents of Gopalpur Village acclaimed the work done by the Kejriwal Government especially construction of a public toilet in the area and providing uninterrupted water supply after laying new pipelines in the area.

Meena, a resident of Gopalpur Village said she used to search bushes or isolated places for answering nature call that too during her pregnancy but after the Delhi Government constructed public toilet here, life has become easier.

There are many like Meena, who talked about toilet as one of the factor they are going to vote for in upcoming Assembly polls.

“The Kejriwal Government has done good work in some of the sector but still we need an experience leadership in the Capital. Bittu jee has been a good candidate as he is very polite and listen to everyone. The AAP’s sitting MLA has never visited the area after winning the seat.

But during the Congress rule, we could easily visit Bittu’s residence for any problem related to our areas,” Manohar Nishad, a resident of Nehru Vihar said.

The AAP vote share has increased from 35 per cent in 2013 to 51 per cent in 2015. The BJP’s vote share has seen a fluctuating trend as it got 34 per cent in 2015, 32 in 2013, 41 in 2008, 43 in 2003 and 37 in 1998.

While, the Congress vote share has seen declining trend in last five Assembly elections, the party secured 52 per cent in 1998, 54 per cent in 2003, 44 in 2008, 29 in 2013 and reduced to just 11 per cent in 2015.

AAP candidate Harish Khanna who contested the poll in 2013 won the seat and secured 35 per cent of vote share. The party fielded Pankaj Pushkar in 2015 Assembly elections and he managed to win the seat securing 51 per cent share of votes. BJP’s Rajender Gupta had won the seat in 1993 with 51 per cent of vote share. Since then this seat has gone to the Congress for three terms and twice to the AAP.

The voting in the Delhi Assembly Election will be held on February 8 and the counting of votes will take place on February 11.

The last Assembly election in Delhi was held in 2015 in which the AAP won with a thumping majority securing 67 seats out of 70 seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-time-winner-turncoat-surender-has-edge-over-aap--cong-.html

These projects are in Odisha, Telangana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Bihar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh.

These include three from Railways, five from the Road Transport and Highways and one from the Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.

Modi also reviewed the performance related to insurance schemes — ‘Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana’ (PMJJBY) and ‘Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana’ (PMSBY).

The progress under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) project, which is a comprehensive and integrated system for effective policing through e-governance, also came up for review.

In the last 31 ‘Pragati’ interactions, Modi has reviewed a total of 269 projects with a total investment of Rs 12.30 lakh crore.

129,23-1-20,BJP calls Cong ‘Muslim League Congress’,"Charging the Congress with “Muslim appeasement” and “insulting Hindus”, the BJP on Wednesday quoted Maharashtra Minister Ashok Chavan’s comments on installation of a non-BJP coalition Government in the State to say the party should be termed “Muslim League Congress”.

Citing Chavan’s reported remarks that the Congress joined hands with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra as Muslims also wanted the party to stop the BJP from coming to power, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra accused Congress of betraying interests of Hindus and appeasing Muslims.

“The Congress leader says they joined the Government for Muslims. What is the sin of Hindus, Sikhs and others. The Congress has insulted Hindus and this comment has exposed it,” the BJP leader claimed.

At his press conference Patra referred to comments of many opposition leaders, including those from AIMIM, to allege that they were “abusing” Hindus in the name of anti-CAA protests and sought apology from Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP’s Sharad Pawar.

Patra also drew attention to the reported comments of AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, whose brother Asaduddin Owaisi heads the party that Muslims ruled over the country for eight centuries to refer to him as Jinnah, Pakistan’s founder

For his part, Union Minister Giriraj Singh reacted saying, “Wo Mughal lutere thay. Aap Bharat ko darane ka kaam na karein. Jinnah ke raaste par na chalein, Bharatvanshi ab jaag chuke hain.”

Asked about Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge’s reported jibe at the RSS for its “non-participation” in the freedom movement, Patra shot back, asking if parents of Sonia Gandhi, who is of Italian origin, had fought in India’s independence struggle.

The Indian National Congress, he said referring to the opposition party’s full name, should be called “Muslim League Congress”. The Congress does “Muslim appeasement” for the community’s votes but has never done any good for it, he claimed.

Pointing to a report in an Urdu daily, Patra said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had once described his party as a “party of Muslims” and its leaders coined terms like saffron terror. Since 1946, Patra claimed the Congress has done “Muslim vote bank politics”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp-calls-cong----muslim-league-congress---.html
130,23-1-20,BJP’s focus is only ‘Loot & Scoot’: Cong,"The Congress on Wednesday said the “Suit-Boot” BJP Government’s focus is only on the Industry of “Loot & Scoot” and under is rule “Common man is in pain but Con-man is in gain”. The party questioned whether the BJP-led dispensation is involved in Frost International Bank Scam of Rs 3,592.48 crore and in the escape of its directors.

The Congress alleged the total bank fraud during the BJP’’s tenure amounted to over Rs 2.7 lakh crore.

The party stated political accountability must be fixed on Prime Minister and Finance Minister for Rs 2,70,513.49 crore public money looted from banks and Rs 5,00,000 crore written off of willful defaulters.

Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill slammed the Government for not taking timely action against the directors of Frost International which is alleged to have defrauded banks to the tune of Rs 3,592 crore. He alleged that it was the Government that prevented the lodging of complaint in the scam.

“When the consortium of lending banks had authorised registration of complaint on June 15, 2019, why did it take more than seven months to register a complaint?

Was someone in the BJP Government preventing the registration of complaint?” Shergill questioned at a Press conference.

“When the PSBs having Government nominees on board were aware that the company is unable to return the money, why did it take them a year to request the MHA to issue a lookout notice?” he said.

The grand old party also queried as to why the lookout notice was delayed.

“Despite issuance of LOC on January 18, 2019, why and on whose directions in the BJP Government did the investigating agencies not register a case till January 19, 2020, for an entire year against the suspected offenders who remain untraceable till date?” Shergill said.

Former party chief Rahul Gandhi too accused the Government of risking people’s future by damaging Life Insurance Corporation and destroying the public’s trust in it. His attack on the Government came over a media report which claimed that LIC’s NPAs have doubled to Rs 30,000 crore in five years.

“Crores of honest people invest in LIC because they trust it. The Modi Government is risking their future by damaging LIC and destroying the trust the public has in it,” Rahul said in a tweet. “These short sighted actions create panic & can have catastrophic consequences,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bjp---s-focus-is-only----loot---scoot-----cong.html
131,23-1-20,"NPR good when UPA brought it, bad under BJP, wonders Javadekar","Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday hit out at parties questioning the National Population Register (NPR) saying it was welcomed in the past when the then Congress-led Government introduced it but is being dubbed as “bad” when the NDA regime is repeating it.

He also said the provision of “naturalisation” to grant Indian citizenship to foreign nationals in the principal Citizenship Act of 1955 still remains and Pakistani singer Adnan Sami became an Indian citizen due to that.

“That provision (of naturalisation) still remains. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) takes note of persecuted minorities in three countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan) who came to India seeking justice ... The amendment is about giving citizenship and not taking it,” Javadekar said at a briefing of the decisions taken by the Union Cabinet.

Kerala and West Bengal are some of the States who have opposed the NPR exercise. The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay the amended citizenship law without hearing the Centre. Responding to a question on the issue, Javadekar said, “Those who are opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act made have their own views, but the Supreme Court decided not to give it (CAA) any stay,” he said.

Responding to questions on the NPR, he said giving date of birth or place of birth of parents is optional in the exercise. “If you don’t have it or don’t remember, don’t give it ... Many questions are optional,” he said.

Referring to the origin of the NPR, he pointed out that it was introduced by the Congress-led UPA Government in 2010. “Then you all welcomed it. They bring it, it is good. When we bring, it is bad. This cannot be the case. This is not fair,” he said. The Minister said the National Register of Citizens is limited to Assam and it was brought by then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

“They brought it (NRC) so it is good. We did not bring, so we are bad,” he quipped.

To a question, the senior BJP leader said at one point of time, thousands of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka were given Indian citizenship.

Responding to a question on “proposed” police action in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, he said no action is on in the area.

“No action is being taken in Shaheen Bagh, there is a complaint... Police went to Jamia (university) there was a complaint, they did not go (enter) the JNU (campus), there is a complaint. This is not done (Aisa toh nahin chalta hai),” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/npr-good-when-upa-brought-it--bad-under-bjp--wonders-javadekar.html
132,23-1-20,India bans toxic chemical hydrochlorofluorocarbon,"With an aim to combat climate change, India has banned import of toxic chemical hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141b used in the production of rigid polyurethane (PU) foams by foam manufacturers from January 1, 2020.

Since HCFC-141b, greenhouse gases that damage the earth’s ozone layer, was not produced in the country, all the domestic requirements were being met through imports. However, the Union Environment Ministry issued a notification last year in December seeking ban on import of the foam manufacturing companies. With this, India has completely phased out the important ozone-depleting chemical, said an official from the Ministry.

HCFC comprises inert compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and fluorine, and it is used instead of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as it is less destructive to the ozone layer. At present, HCFCs are used in various sectors like refrigeration and air conditioning (RAC) and foam manufacturing. These sectors are directly related to urban development, agriculture through cold chain, and industrial development.

Simultaneously, the use of HCFC-141 b by foam manufacturing industry has also been closed as on 1st January 2020 under the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2014, said a senior official from the Union Environment Ministry.

Nearly 50 per cent of the consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals in the country was attributable to HCFC-141 b in the foam sector.

The Ministry had adopted a structured approach to engaging with foam manufacturing enterprises for providing technical and financial assistance in order to transition to non-ODS and low GWP technologies under the HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP), said the official.

Around 175 foam manufacturing enterprises have been covered under HPMP out of which, 163 enterprises are covered under stage II of HPMP. The complete phase-out of HCFC 141 b from the country in the foam sector is among the first at this scale in Article 5 parties (developing countries) under the Montreal Protocol.

The implementation of HPMP through regulatory and policy actions, implementation of technology conversion projects has removed around 7800 Metric Tonnes of HCFC 141-b from the baseline level of 2009 and 2010 of the country, he said.

The phase-out of HCFC-141b from the country has twin environmental benefits viz. assisting the healing of the stratospheric ozone layer, and towards the climate

change mitigation due to transitioning of foam manufacturing enterprises at this scale under HPMP to low global warming potential alternative technologies.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-bans-toxic-chemical-hydrochlorofluorocarbon.html
133,23-1-20,Speak the truth about it: Didi to Shah,"A day after Amit Shah attacked her for spreading disinformation about the Citizenship Amendment Bill inviting her to an open national debate on the issue, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday lashed out at the Union Home Minister for talking big but hesitating to come out with the truth about the CAA.

Banerjee who led an anti-CAA rally in Darjeeling with more than a thousand people referred to Shah’s speech saying “yesterday I heard the Home Minister making tall speeches saying that I am telling lie about CAA and National Population Register… Now if we are lying let him tell the truth to the people. Let him tell whether

CAA is a selective Act which discriminates among people. Let him tell about the conditions mentioned in the NPR. Let him mention whether those who will be granted citizenship will have to live as foreigners for the first five years or not.”

“And if such be the conditions then he will have to say whether the people will lose jobs because aliens cannot work in India… whether the children will lose their school certificates and whether the citizens will lose their rights to property they now own.”

Wondering whether most of the people in the crowd had the date of births of their parents, Banerjee asked, “Do you have date of births of your parents? Is this how a responsible Government works. They do not even the same thing at the same time. In the something they say something and in the evening they other something. They say date of birth is not mandatory. If it is not mandatory, why is it there in the columns?” she added.

Referring how thousands of Nepali speaking people had been banished from the National Citizenship Register, Banerjee said, “People are scared that if CAA and NRC are implemented they will be uprooted. I want to tell the hill people not allow NRC and CAA.”

Referring to the rising inflation and decreasing jobs Banerjee said, “see what they have made of the Indian economy. They promised acchhee din (good days) but where the jobs. Why so many people are unemployed today. Why the farmers are not getting their due and respect. Why Government factories like ordnance factory (in Kolkata) are being shut down… They are selling the country… and to hide these all they are raising the issues of CAA.”

Claiming that in order to turn the attention of the people from grim economic scenario and failed promises she said, “they are setting people of one religion against the other. They are dividing the people to rule but implementing CAA, NRC and NPR,” adding those who are protesting are being termed anti-Indians.

“The students are being beaten up if they raise their voices, the Opposition is harassed by the Agencies (read CBI, ED etc) when they are raising the contentious issues. They are calling them Pakistanis. I want to ask why do you always bringing in Pakistan. Do you have extra love for that country to invoke its name always?” Banerjee asked.

She said the BJP leaders always were foul-mouthing her for protesting against their polices. “I want to tell the BJP that foul-mouthing me all the time will not work. Tell us whether you will withdraw CAA or not. If CAA is not a mischievous Act then why did you leave out Assam and Tripura, the States ruled by BJP? Why are these BJP-ruled states out of the purview of CAA?” There would be no CAA, NRC or NPR in Bengal she insisted.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/speak-the-truth-about-it--didi-to-shah.html
134,23-1-20,Prashant Kishor dares Shah over CAA-NRC,": Poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor fired a fresh salvo at the BJP on Wednesday, daring Union Home Minister Amit Shah to “go ahead and try implementing” the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register for Citizens which the latter had “audaciously announced to the nation”.

Kishor, who is the national vice president of the JD(U), is helping Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party for the upcoming Assembly polls even though his own party headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has tied up with the BJP to take on the less than a decade old party.

“Being dismissive of citizens dissent couldnt be the sign of strength of any Govt. @amitshah Ji, if you dont care for those protesting against #CAA_NRC, why dont you go ahead and try implementing the CAA & NRC in the chronology that you so audaciously announced to the nation!”, Kishor wrote on his twitter handle.

The 42-year-old, whose first claim to fame was his handling of Narendra Modis spectacularly successful election campaign in 2014, made the remarks in the backdrop of Shahs assertion at a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow that “CAA is here to stay and it will not be taken back”, countrywide protests by opposition parties and others notwithstanding.

The Bihar BJP was, expectedly, rankled by the latest outbursts of Kishor, who joined the JD(U) about two years ago, got elevated to the top party post within weeks, and has been taking a public stand on the burning issue that has embarrassed the NDA. “There is no move on #NRC by the Govt but #CAA is now a legislation made by Parliament. Respect the Constitution. Dont worry. The Supreme Court has agreed to listen to the voice of dissent. Just to satisfy the professional ego and political frustration why creating hue and cry”, state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said replying to Kishors tweet.

“You have all the right to disagree but selective propaganda on religious lines to suit the Congi (sic) style politics of Muslim appeasement must not be encouraged. The Gazette notification to start the process of #NPR and implement #CAA is published. Won’t be taken back at any cost, Anand added.

The JD(U) did not react to Kishor’s comment.

137,23-1-20,CRPF facing critical shortage of armoured troop carriers,"Amid heightened threat to its troops and Amarnath Yatra pilgrims later this year, the CRPF — the lead agency for internal security and conduct of Yatra — is facing a critical shortage of armoured troop carriers to transport the paramilitary personnel in Jammu & Kashmir.

Officials said, the paramilitary is facing a shortage of up to 40 per cent of the sanctioned strength, a figure being withheld in order to avoid any risk to the troopers from the terrorists in the Valley.

The preparation for the Amarnath Yatra begins in March and a meeting was held in the Home Ministry for procurement of the armoured troop carriers, sources said.

The shortage of the armoured troop carriers has accrued over the years as the paramilitary has not been able to procure bullet proof vehicles from Original Equipment Manufacturers during the last one decade, leading to an alarming shortfall in such vehicles, they said.

The security forces especially the CRPF is facing enhanced threat from the terror groups post-abrogation of Article 370 and reorganisation of the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories — J&K and Ladakh, officials said, adding approvals for procurement of the specialised vehicles are yet to see the light of the day despite the Pulwama incident last year in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed while travelling in a convoy consisting of non-armoured buses.

“The sanctioned numbers of bullet-proof bunker vehicles are badly needed as additional deployment of 25 battalions of the CRPF was made in the Valley in anticipation of aggravated law and order situation following nullification of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir,” an official said.

The Amarnath Yatra that is held between July and August is estimated to be tough from the security perspective as it will be the first such Yatra to be conducted after change in the special status of J&K.

The terror groups are also seeking to find traction among the youth as the jehadi ranks are facing crisis due to the wiping out of the terror leadership in the Valley owing to counter-terror action by the security forces in the last two years.

Last year, the Amarnath Yatra was called off midway ahead of the decision to scrap Article 370 on August 5 as a well calculated move to avoid any risk to the pilgrims.

In 2017, Amarnath pilgrims were targeted by the terrorists in July 2017 in which eight religious tourists were killed and over 30 others injured.

Likewise, in June 2016, the banned terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyeba ambushed a convoy of CRPF vehicles in Pampore and killed eight uniformed men of the paramilitary and injuring over 20 others.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/crpf-facing-critical-shortage-of-armoured-troop-carriers.html

139,23-1-20,Children in J&K are nationalists not culprits: Rajnath,"Days after Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said girls and boys between the age group of 10 and 12 years were being radicalised in Jammu & Kashmir, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said the children from there are “nationalists” but sometimes get motivated in the wrong direction and those guiding are the “culprits.”

Rawat had also said the misguided youth have to be weaned away by lodging them in deradicalisation camps.

Dispelling the notion of radicalisation, the Defence Minister said those youngsters “should not be seen in any other way.” Making this observation when asked about his opinion on the children from Jammu & Kashmir being motivated to join the National Cadet Corps (NCC), he said, “Youngsters are youngsters only. Sometimes, the way they should be motivated, people do not motivate them. In fact, they are motivated in the wrong direction.”

“That is why the kids should not be blamed for this. The ones who are wrongly motivating them should be blamed. The ones who are motivating them in wrong direction are the culprits,” the Defence Minister added. He made these remarks after attending the Republic Day annual camp of the NCC.

In his address during the Raisina Dialogue here last week, Rawat had said children as young as 10 to 12 years are being radicalised in Kashmir and there is need to isolate those completely radicalised and put them in deradicalisation camps.

He said radicalisation can be countered by looking at where it is happening and who are behind it. The CDS also said radicalisation is happening in schools, universities, religious places and sites and then there are people spreading this. “First we need to get to the nerve of who is radicalising people. You can start isolating these people gradually and then start a counter radicalisation programme by identifying people who have been radicalised, to what degree...” he had said.

Meanwhile, addressing the NCC cadets, the Defence Minister said Indian values consider all religions equal, and that is why the country is secular and never became a theocratic state like Pakistan.

“We (India) said we would not discriminate among religions. Why did we do that? Our neighbouring country has declared that their state has a religion. They have declared themselves a theocratic state. We didn’t declare so.” “Even America is a theocratic country. India is not a theocratic country. Why? Because our saints and seers did not just consider the people living within our borders as part of the family, but called everyone living in the world as one family,” the Minister said.

Singh underlined that India had never declared its religion would be Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist and people of all religions could live here.”They (saints and seers) gave the slogan of ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam’ — the whole world is one family. This message has gone to the whole world from here only,” he added. He later presented Raksha Mantri Padak and commendation cards to NCC cadets and observed band and cultural performances of NCC cadets. Praising the parade and various performances of cadets, the Defence Minister said it has been able to boost the sense of national pride among Indian youth.

He also said the NCC plays an unparalleled role in transforming the youth into future leaders. “Today, NCC cadets can be found in almost every field, including Armed Forces, politics and sports. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is taking our country to newer heights, was an NCC cadet,” Singh said. He also recalled his days as a cadet of the largest uniformed youth organisation in the world.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/children-in-j-k-are-nationalists-not-culprits--rajnath.html

142,23-1-20,Protesters ‘lathicharged’ by police in Etawah,"People protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act were allegedly lathicharged by police in a Muslim-dominated area in Uttar Pradesh’s Etawah district even as demonstrations continued against the legislation in Lucknow and Aligarh.

A video of the Etawah incident, where policemen can be seen using batons and chasing away protesters in the area on late Tuesday night, has also gone viral on social media.

Violence broke out when police tried to disperse the protesters who were observing a sit-in since Tuesday morning in Pachraha area, defying prohibitory orders imposed there.

“Police used force against us while we were holding a peaceful protest. Our brothers and cousins were beaten up and we were abused. We were physically tortured. We have a right to protest,” one of the women protesters said.

Responding to the allegations, police said the protesters had staged a dharna defying prohibitory order imposed in the area and pelted them with stones. Police said they had to use mild force to chase the protesters away.

In the video, policemen can be seen entering houses and shops.

The sit-in was organised in solidarity with the women protesting at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi against the new legislation.

“Police are citing prohibitory orders to end our protest. What about the large public meetings being held by ministers,” another protester said. In Lucknow, protesters at the Clock Tower (Ghantaghar) in old city area of Lucknow held a symbolic ‘havan’ with Hindu women joining them.

With the Tricolour painted on their cheeks and bands on their wrists, they took part in the ‘havan’ carrying banners with “CAA wapas lo” (take back CAA) written on them.

Women also observed a ‘roza’ for the withdrawal of the act. The protest, which has been going on uninterrupted since Friday, saw people expressing themselves against the controversial legislation holding balloons painted in black with ‘No CAA, No NRC’ written on them.

143,23-1-20,No scope for third party mediation: Govt sources,"As President Donald Trump yet again offered to “help” India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue, New Delhi on Wednesday categorically asserted that there is no role for any third party on the issue.

Government sources also said India’s long-held position has been that Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.

Responding to Trump’s offer, they said there is no question of any mediation or intervention by any third party. This assertion came after the US President, while addressing the media with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in Davos on Tuesday, said the US was watching the developments relating to Kashmir “very closely” and repeated his offer to “help” resolve the dispute.

It was Trump’s fourth offer in last five months to help both the countries resolve the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two union territories.

“What’s going on between Pakistan and India… if we can help, we certainly will be willing to. We have been watching it very closely,” Trump said. Official sources said India’s clear and consistent position has been that there is no role to play for any third party on Kashmir.

144,23-1-20,Mumbai gets nod to remain open 24x7 from January 27,"After initial resistance from certain quarters, the Maharashtra Government on Wednesday approved the implementation of its much-discussed ‘Mumbai 24x7’ or ‘Vibrant Mumbai Nightlife’ policy from the intervening night of January 26 and 27.

At a weekly meeting presided over Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the State Cabinet gave a go-ahead for the ‘Mumbai 24x7’ policy without tweaking the current excise rules which permit service of alcoholic beverages only till the existing time limits of 1.30 am.

In effect, the new ‘Vibrant Mumbai Nightlife’ policy will not be applicable to bars, pubs and restaurants serving liquor, which will be permitted to serve alcoholic beverages only till the existing time limits of 1.30 am.

The new ‘Mumbai 24x7’ policy — which is a brain child of Shiv Sena leader and current Tourism and Environment Minister Aditya Thackeray — will allow malls, multiplexes and eateries in the designated areas to function round-the-clock.

State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who had initial reservations about implementing the Mumbai 24x7 because of security reasons and on the ground that bars and restaurants cannot serve liquor, came around after Aditya — at a meeting held a few days — convinced him that the policy could be implemented without tweaking the current State excise rules and imposing a lot of burden on the city police force.

Addressing a news conference jointly with the State Home Minister after the State Cabinet gave a nod for the Mumbai 24X7, Aditya said: “Mumbai’s identify is being that of a safe city. In Mumbai, you can get to see women and women moving around Marine Drive and other places safely at around 2 am or 3 am. Mumbai police perform their duty well. But, take the case of tourists coming to Mumbai, they would not be in the city for more than 36 hours. To increase the employment and tourism in Mumbai, we came up with the Mumbai 24x7 proposal in 2013. We are implementing it after seven years”.

“We will implement this policy in malls and mill compounds coming under the Shops and Establishment Act. The malls and mill compounds are in non-residential areas. The people do not live inside these places. There are facilities like parking lots, CCTV, decibel limits, solid waste management. All the establishments there are licenced ones. We are giving permission to all these establishments to remain open for all 24 hours”.

In fact, the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 2017, allows all establishments to operate around-the-clock.

“There would not be any change in the excise rules. The liquor will be served only up to 1.30 am in bars and restaurants. We are changing that. We are providing facilities who want to eat out, go for shopping or movies. The MVA Government is a people’s Government. We are Government of aspirations. Unlike the BJP Government, we want to encourage the youngsters,” the Tourism Minister said. Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said that that the State Government would ensure that there was no stress on the police force.

“We do not enforce anything here. If some units are not able to keep their establishments for all 24 hours, they can do so. It is not the job of the state government to increase the footfalls. We are enabling the owners of these establishments. Mumbai being an international city, we are giving a 24x7 facility,” Aditya said.

“London’s nightlife economy is 5 billion pounds. In Mumbai, there are five lakh people who directly employed in this service sector. When we say that employment will increase because of

Mumbai 24x7, it is because the owners oif these establishments will have to employ their staff in three shifts. Going that logic, we will have an employment potential of 15 lakh people or at least 10 lakh people in this service sector. Keeping these establishments open, state revenue will increase through various taxes,” he said.

“I do not think there will be tension for the police. Currently, the police personnel do is to track if the establishments are open beyond the stipulated hours rather than controlling crime. Now they do not have to do that job and can concentrate on the job they are meant to do. If the establishments want more security, they can employ private security or hire police security by paying money,” Aditya said.

Public distribution and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that Mumbai Police Commissioner and Municipal commissioner would decide where nightlife would be allowed. “During the meeting a lot of suggestions came in. Like in some of the railway stations of Mumbai where there is rush for 24 hours, people come and go, eateries could remain open there,” Bhujbal said.

Earlier this week, at the bi-annual crime conference, Uddhav, along with his Cabinet colleagues and bureaucracts, held a meeting with the city police officers Mumbai 24x7 proposal.

Among those present at the meeting were Anil Deshmukh, minister of state for home Satej Patil, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, director general of police Subodh Jaiswal and Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Barve.

Last week, Aditya had held a meeting with the Mumbai Police Commissioner and municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi to thrash out issues relating to the Mumbai 24x7",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mumbai-gets-nod-to-remain-open-24x7-from-january-27.html

According to ground reports, massive searches were going on in the Khrew area after the initial gunfight with terrorists resulted in killing of two soldiers. Due to bad weather and poor light conditions, the search operations were halted and the same were resumed early Wednesday morning.

After the fresh contact was established with the hiding terrorists,the security forces tightened the cordon and eliminated at least one of the terrorists in the ensuing encounter, official sources said.

Confirming the elimination of one of the terrorists, twitter handle of the Jammu & Kashmir police posted a message which read, “Police & Security forces killed one of the killers of Martyred SPO Shahbaz Ahmed and Martyred Rifleman Rahul in this operation even before bodies of these martyrs reached their respective homes.Operation is going on at Nagander one kilometre away from yesterday encounter site”.

Official sources claimed, security forces were conducting random searches in the area since Wednesday morning to track down the foot prints of the terrorists hiding in the area. Meanwhile, mortal remains of both the soldiers were dispatched to their native places after a formal wreath laying ceremony in Srinagar. Senior police and Army officers paid their tributes to both the martyrs. Interacting with the media in Srinagar, DGP Dilbagh Singh said, the security has been beefed up in Kashmir.

“We have strengthened the security measures in Srinagar ahead of the Republic Day,” he added. In the run up to the Republic day celebrations, a high alert has been sounded in Jammu and Kashmir after intelligence inputs suggest of possible terror strikes.

149,23-1-20,Raut: Uddhav to visit Ayodhya on completion of 100 days of power,"In an apparent effort to indicate that it has not deviated from its Hindutva path after forming a Government with the Congress and NCP, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday announced that its president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray would visit Ayodhya after the MVA Government completes 100 days in office.

Announcing the Chief Minister’s impending visit to Ayodhya, Shiv Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut tweeted: “Chalo Ayodhya ! CM #UddhavThackeray will visit Ayodhya on the completion of 100 days in power! @OfficeofUT”.

In another tweet, Raut said: “Our government has begun performing its duties in great vigour. We shall complete five years in office. After government completes 100 days. CM Uddhav Thackeray shall go to Ayodhya. After seeking blessings of Lord Ram, will decide on future course of action”.

Uddhav, who had announced after the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayoidhya dispute case that he would go once again Ayodhya on November 24, 2019, had postponed his visit then, owing to the impasse in the government formation in the state. The public perception was that the Sena would soft-peddle its Hindutva agenda as long as it is running the government in the state with the Congress and NCP.

It may be recalled that Uddhav had on November 25, 2018 – along with his wife Rashmi and son Aditya, had visited Ayodhya. On June 16, 2019 year after the Lok Sabha polls, he once again visited Ayodhya and offered prayers at the makeshift Ram Lalla shrine.

However, atmosphere has changed after he joined hands with the “secular” and NCP to form a Maha Vikas Agadhi government in Maharashtra. The perception that has been gaining ground in the state political circles that in order to ensure that there is no threat to its government in the state the ruling Shiv Sena is pursuing the Hindutva as vigorously as it was doing earlier. So much so that its erstwhile ally BJP has been taking pot shots at the Shiv Sena for giving up on its Hindutva agenda for the sake of power.

Interestingly enough, Raut came out with a tweet a day ahead of the first grand convention of the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). It is speculated that at the convention, MNS chief Raj Thackeray embrace the Hindutva path and change the colour of his party flag.

Raj had recently met former Maharashtra chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, sparking speculation about the possibility of the MNS joining hands with the Amit Shah-led party.

Meanwhile, talking to media persons, Raut extended invitation to Congress’ former president Rahul Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar to accompany Uddhav Thackeray to Ayodhya. “We want that our alliance leaders should also come along. Rahul Gandhi also visits severaltemples”.

On her part, BJP national spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi had earlier in the day wanted to know if Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray wouldl also take Congress leaders along with him to Ayodhya. How the alliance partners of the Sena react? How will he show his face to them – to the ones who questioned the very existence of Lord Ram, even went to the Supreme Court stating the same,”she said.

Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Shatabdi Nagar here, he also questioned those opposing the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and said the government has not discussed it.

Dismissing allegations that the Centre is pursuing a “divisive agenda” through the CAA, Singh said the BJP doesn’t do politics on religious lines for selfish gains.

“In Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, religious minorities are living a life of misery. India has fulfilled its moral duty (by enacting the CAA),” he said.

“The entire world is accepting India’s power. We don’t do politics on the lines of religion for selfish reasons,” he said.

The citizenship law is being viewed from a Hindu-Muslim perspective, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks of justice, he added.

Singh said the NDA had prepared the citizenship legislation in its first tenure, but it could not be enacted.

On the NRC, Singh said, “The government has had no discussion on the NRC. And suppose it has, then what is the problem with having a register of citizens.”

“Shouldn’t there be a register of citizens? Shouldn’t there be a document for people to seek benefits of government schemes,” he asked the crowd at the rally.

Singh said the BJP wants to do politics by winning people’s hearts and asserted that the party is working to fulfil all its promises.

“Whenever a political party contests elections, it makes various kinds of promises. I was given the responsibility to prepare the BJP’s manifesto for the 2019 (Lok Sabha) elections. Within seven months of being elected, the BJP has been rapidly fulfilling its promises,” he said.”I want to assure the people of India that our party will deliver on whatever it promises. We do not want to cheat the people,” he said.”By the end of 2022, every house will have a pucca roof. Tap water will reach every household by the end of 2024. PM Modi put Rs 6,000 each in the bank accounts of farmers,” he added.

The minister said the the BJP had also taken steps for farmers’ welfare.”Farmer brothers need not worry, we will pay you every single penny for your hardwork,” he said.

The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before 2015 to escape religious persecution there.

Muslim migrants don’t figure on this list.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted minorities from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone’s citizenship.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/rajnath--india-fulfilled-its----moral-duty----by-enacting-it.html
151,23-1-20,Khadi fights back to prevent misuse of trademarks globally,"The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has stepped up efforts to prevent misuse of its brand and symbol both within the country and on foreign soil. KVIC is proprietor of over 100 trademarks including the symbol of ‘Charkha’ in India and other countries like Russia, China, Germany, Australia, UK and Bhutan.

These trademark and symbols have been misused time and again by private players. In an initiative to prevent such misuse, KVIC has taken up the matter with the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Permanent Mission of India at UN, Geneva seeking International Trademark protection of symbol of ‘Charkha’ under the article 6ter of the Paris Convention.

Article 6ter of the Paris Convention for the protection of Industrial property of 1883 (1967 Stockholm Act) safeguards armorial bearings, flags and other State emblems as well as official signs and hallmarks of the States party to the Paris Convention. The signs published with World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) under this act are prevented from being registered or used as trademarks, across the world, without authorisation.

Speaking about the initiative, Chairman KVIC VK Saxena said, “KVIC is one of those unique institutions in India that links the nation’s past, present and future on its functional plane, through - self-reliance and sustainability. Ever since the pre-independent era, Khadi has been considered as the national symbol for Swadeshi. The word marks KHADI, KUTIR, “SARVODAYA and the logo of Khadi India and Charkha are the harbinger of this spirit of Swadeshi, hence, must be protected at all cost.”

Saxena said that due to the negligence of earlier Governments, some private entities managed to register these symbols to fulfill their personal material motives. This initiative to prevent wrongful use of the trademarks will help reinstate the dignity and pride attached with Khadi and the symbols representing it, he said.”

Saxena has written to Commerce Minister Shri Piyush Goyal seeking his intervention so as to expedite the matter pending with the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade(DPIIT) which comes under the Ministry of Commerce.

KVIC is fighting cases in several countries for violation of the Khadi Mark Regulations. The regulations issued in 2013 by the Ministry of MSME, empowered KVIC to grant ‘Khadi Mark’ registration and take royalties from any producer using the Khadi Mark. In continuation, KVIC has issued notices against 600 entities in India, including a renowned garment chain and 3 entities in the International market for misusing these symbols and indulging in unfair trade practices in the recent past.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been endorsing Khadi and due to his appeals the sale of Khadi has gone up manifolds,” Saxena said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/khadi-fights-back-to-prevent-misuse-of-trademarks-globally.html
152,23-1-20,CBI registers four fresh cases against Chhota Rajan,"The CBI has taken over the probe into an attempt to kill a veteran journalist in 1997 and three other fresh cases allegedly involving jailed gangster Chhota Rajan.

Noted crime reporter in Mumbai Baljeet Shersingh Parmar was severely injured when motorcycle borne shooters of Rajan allegedly attacked him outside a building at Antop Hill on June 12, 1997.

The agency has taken over the Mumbai police FIR in the case filed under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder).

The agency has registered two more cases of extortion by alleged gang members of Rajan and one case related to issuing threats to life, according to the FIRs.

The agency has booked Rajan and his henchmen Guru Satam and Suresh for allegedly demanding Rs 20 lakh as extortion money from businessman Devang Bipin Parikh in 1995.

The other case pertains to alleged demand of Rs 25 lakh in 1998 from a man named Ghisulal Jain by Hemant, who is believed to be a member of Rajan gang, officialssaid.

The Mumbai police had filed charge sheets in both the cases but Rajan remained absconding, they said.

The last case is related to threats issued to the life of builder Shabbir N Patel and his son in 1996..

In November last year, the CBI had taken over 10 cases, including those of extortion and murder, in which Rajan was an accused. These cases were registered in a 14-year period since 1992.

These cases include killing of trade union leader Datta Samant in 1997 in Mumbai in which Rajan’s role is suspected.

Rajan was arrested at Bali airport in Indonesia on October 25, 2015, and deported to India.

He is an accused in around 70 cases in Maharashtra, including the J Dey murder case in 2011.

153,23-1-20,Pavan Varma’s conduct an act of indiscipline: senior JD(U) leader,"Janata Dal (United) leader Vashishtha Narayan Singh on Wednesday took strong exception to party colleague Pavan Varma questioning ‘in publi’ the tie-up with BJP for the Delhi Assembly polls by extending the alliance beyond Bihar, calling it ‘absolutely’ an act of indiscipline.

Singh, a Rajya Sabha member and the head of the JD(U)s state unit, asserted that the decision to align with the BJP was taken after “due deliberation”.

He further said although the party respected freedom of thought of every member, it was ‘anuchit’ (inappropriate) on part of the career diplomat-turned-politician to make public his letter to the Chief Minister and national president Nitish Kumar.

“I consider his (Varmas) conduct as inappropriate and will put forth my views forcefully whenever a party meeting takes place”, Singh told a news channel. He also said “if there were any reservations, these ought to have been expressed in a party forum. People may have their individual opinions and the party respects that. But airing these in public is something I do not approve of”.

He also said Varma had ‘absolutely’ committed an act of indiscipline by sharing on the social media his two-page letter to Kumar in which the chief minister was reminded of the unease he had been allegedly expressing ‘in private’ over the BJPs ideology and agenda.

Varma had also mentioned that JD(U), which has been contesting separately from the BJP in states other than Bihar, recent examples being Haryana and Jharkhand, has allied with the saffron party in Delhi where an old NDA constituent like Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has refused to do so. Notably, unlike the JD(U) the SAD is a part of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The party has opposed the exclusion of Muslims from CAA and refused to contest the Delhi assembly polls, despite a large population of Sikhs in the city, in protest against the BJPs refusal to pay heed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pavan-varma---s-conduct-an-act-of-indiscipline--senior-jd-u--leader.html
154,23-1-20,KPCC to announce jumbo office bearers list this week,"The Kerala Congress which has been without a proper committee will be announcing the list of office bearers by this week end. While State Congress chief and former Union Minister of State for Home, Mullappally Ramachandran was adamant for a “One man, One post” rule to be implemented in the list of office bearers, the powerful “A” and “I” group managers of the party scuttled the move.

The “A” group led by former Chief Minister Oomen Chandy was somehow accommodative to the suggestion of the KPCC president, but the “I”group led by the Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala did not budge for the “One man,One post” theory and hence the party will once again be having a jumbo list of office beares.

In addition to the KPCC president, there will be five working presidents in Kodikkunnil Suresh, PC Vishnunath, K Sudhakaran, KV Thomas and VD Satheeshan. There will be six vice presidents and thirty general secretaries in the list followed by sixty secretaries. The number of state executive members of the party is yet to be decided.

With the advent of Sonia Gandhi back as the AICC president, senior leaders of the party had a major say and it was after much confabulations and inter party discussions, the list is to be finalized. However it is learnt that KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran was adamant that party leaders with criminal antecedents will not be accommodated as office bearer which was met with stiff resistance from the group managers.

Interestingly in the agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), Mullappallly has taken a stiff position that there will not be any joint agitation with the CPM. This was after the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had taken the initiative for a joint agitation with the CPM and other left forces and Oomen Chandy supporting this. Mullappally had stayed out of the meeting.

Incidentally the AICC highcommand - read Sonia Gandhi - had stood by the position taken by the KPCC president and in the press conference held at Kerala house, New Delhi both Chandy and Chennithala had to bite humble pie and subscribe to the position taken by the KPCC president. In the list of party office bearers also, the KPCC president had done his maximum to reduce the number of contenders and sources in the Congress party told The Pioneer that the list would have been double the present figure had not Mullappally taken a strong stand.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kpcc-to-announce-jumbo-office-bearers-list-this-week.html
155,23-1-20,"Antony, Venugopal, Mullappally axis developing in Kerala Cong","A new troika has emerged in the Kerala Congress scheme of things with two powerful leaders of the party, AK Antony, CWC Member and close confidant of Sonia Gandhi and KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary (Organisation) and close associate of Rahul Gandhi putting in their weight behind the beleaguered KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran who was being pushed around by the “A” group and “I” group.

Sources in the Congress told The Pioneer, that it was the strength of these two leaders that Mullappally had took on both Chandy and Chennithala on the CAA issue and raised the red flag for the joint agitation with the CPM.

To solve the vexed issue of announcing the list of office bearers, both these leaders had thrown their weights behind the KPCC president and at the same time carefully seeing it to that the group managers are not offended.

The support of these two powerful leaders who have a major say in the organisational affairs of the Congress party has given a fresh impetus to Mullappally who is fast emerging as a major power centre in the state Congress.

With the state going to polls in 2021 and the Congress led UDF all set to replace the LDF Government led by the CPM, there are possibilities of Mullappaly being considered as the Chief Minister candidate as there is bound to be fight between Ramesh Chennithala and Oomen Chandy for the CM post.

There is already a suttle whispering campaign in the corridors of State Congress that an Ezhava leader has not don the mantle of Chief minister of the Congress since R Shankar who was Chief minister from 1962-64.

With the Congress led UDF winning nineteen of the twenty loksabha seats in the last general elections, the graph of Mullappally Ramachandran has gone high and the seven term loksabha member who has won the parliamentary elections from the CPM bastion of Vatakara is keeping his fingers crossed. “These are early days to comment on the Chief ministership and my primary responsibility is to work among the grass root and to strengthen the party machinery. 2020 we have to face the local body elections and in 2021 the assembly elections and these two are my present priorities”, Mullappally told The Pioneer.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/antony--venugopal--mullappally-axis-developing-in-kerala-cong.html

159,23-1-20,Sensex slips as investors cautious ahead of Budget,"The market gauge Sensex on Wednesday fell for the third straight session to mark its lowest level in over five weeks as participants moved to the sidelines exercising caution ahead of the federal Budget.

At close, the 30-share Sensex was down 208.43 points, or 0.50 per cent, at 41,115.38 — the lowest level for the index since December 16. After starting the session on a high note, the BSE gauge kept on shedding gains and touched the day’s low of 41,059.04.

Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty settled 62.95 points, or 0.52 per cent, lower at 12,106.90 — marking its fourth straight session loss.

Both benchmark indices bore the brunt of heavy selling mainly in energy, financial and auto stocks.

A subdued corporate earnings season and banks’ stressed assets situation have made investors realign their investment strategy, analysts said adding that the upcoming Budget will decide the course of the market in the near to mid-term.

Further, global agencies slashing India’s growth outlook is also weighing on domestic investor sentiment, they added.

On the Sensex chart, ONGC was the top loser, tumbling 5.13 per cent, followed by NTPC, Kotak Bank, Maruti Suzuki, HDFC, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.

On the other hand, Nestle India, TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech, SBI and Bharti Airtel ended with gains of up to 1.86 per cent.

Sectorally, BSE metal, oil and gas and power were among the major losers — dropping as much as 1.57 per cent.

While BSE IT, teck and telecom indices ended up to 1.09 per cent higher.

In the broader market, midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 0.32 per cent.

“Domestic markets after opening higher failed to hold on to gains amid profit-booking across finance, auto, metal and pharma stocks; while FMCG and few IT stocks remained in green zone. Uncertainty ahead of Budget has resulted in investors’ being cautious for the time being,” Paras Bothra, President of Equity Research, Ashika Stock Broking, said.

Besides, fears of contagion after the US announced its first case of a new virus that has claimed six lives in China also remained in hindsight, he said.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said, “Banks, auto and midcaps are consolidating due to marginal slippage in NPAs and earnings growth than anticipated earlier.

The Q3 result had solid expectations but actual results are marginally below expectation for sectors like IT and banks, this is impacting the market. A lot will depend on the actual outcome of Budget for further direction, market is turning cautious before the big event.”

On the currency front, the Indian rupee closed marginally up at 71.19 against the US dollar.

Global benchmark Brent crude fell 0.67 per cent to USD 64.16 per barrel.

Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended with gains.

160,23-1-20,"‘GDP to grow by 5.5 pc in FY21, downside risks persists’","India’s growth rate is expected to be marginally higher at 5.5 per cent in 2020-21 against the estimated 5 per cent for the current fiscal on the back of strong policy push coupled with revival in demand, a report said.

Citing an NSO report, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said said the slowdown is a combination of several factors including an abrupt and significant fall in lending by non-banking financial companies close on the heels of a slowdown in bank lending and reduced income growth of households coupled with a fall in savings and higher leverage.

Although some improvement in FY2020-21 is expected, these risks are going to persist, India Ratings and Research principal economist Sunil Sinha said.

As a result, the Indian economy is stuck in a phase of low consumption as well as low investment demand, it said.

“A strong policy push coupled with some heavy lifting (even if this requires using the escape clause as suggested by the FRBM Review Committee headed by N K Singh) by the government is required to revive the domestic demand cycle and catapult the economy back into a high growth phase,” it said.

The government has announced a slew of measures recently to prop-up the economy, but Ind-Ra believes they will come to aid only in the medium term.

The shortfall in the tax plus non-tax revenue to result in the fiscal deficit slipping to 3.6 per cent of GDP (budgeted 3.3 per cent) in FY2020, even after accounting for the surplus transferred by the RBI, it said.

“A continuance of low GDP growth even in FY’21 means subdued tax revenue and limited room for stepping-up expenditure. Ind-Ra believes the government will have to construct the FY21 budget in a way that expenditure is rationalised and prioritised and all avenues of revenue generation are tapped,” it said.

While rationalising, the focus of expenditure has to be on creating direct employment and putting more money in the pockets of the people at the bottom of the pyramid, it said, adding since their marginal propensity to consume is close to one, they are likely to spend what they receive.

“This will support the consumption demand. Therefore, budgetary allocation to heads such as rural infrastructure, road construction, affordable housing and MNREGA must be prioritised and allocation for non-merit subsidy/expenditure less critical for growth be rationalised,” it said.

Also, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) has become government dependent, as incremental private capex has been down and out, it said, adding, despite the fiscal constraints, the government has not shied away from infrastructure spending in the past and even resorted to fund them through extra budgetary resources.

Ind-Ra, therefore, believes the government will continue to focus on infrastructure spending and leverage all possible options — budget, off budget including National Infrastructure Investment Fund, it said.

Also, since a larger part of the government capex now takes place at the state government level, it will be important to keep a tab on the state government capex as well, it added.

With regard to inflation, it said, retail and wholesale inflation expected to be 3.9 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively as compared to 4.4 per cent and 1.4 per cent in the current fiscal.

Though oil prices are stable, retail food inflation after remaining subdued and in single digit for 70 months since January 2014, entered into double digits in November 2019 and accelerated to 14.12 per cent in December 2019, it said.

This means, in the near term, further monetary easing is ruled out and we may have to brace for an extended pause on the policy rate, it added.

While observing that external environment continues to be challenging for exports due to the trade friction and protectionist policy pursued by many developed economies, it said, as a result, exports of goods and services are likely to witness negative growth of 2 per cent the current fiscal.

“With some breakthrough in the US-China trade talks, Ind-Ra expects external environment to improve somewhat in FY21. This is likely to help India’s exports of goods and services to grow by 7.2 per cent and the current account deficit to decline marginally to USD32.7 billion, 1.1% of GDP in FY21 (FY20: USD33.9 billion, 1.2% of GDP),” it said.

In view of these developments, Indian rupee is expected to average 73 against the dollar in FY’21, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/---gdp-to-grow-by-5-5-pc-in-fy21--downside-risks-persists---.html
161,23-1-20,Govt approves pact with foreign countries for seafarers’ certificate,"The government on Wednesday said it has approved a model pact with foreign countries for recognition of seafarers’ competency certificates.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi here.

This will pave the way for mutual recognition of maritime education and training of seafarers by the countries involved.

“The proposed bilateral MoU will enable India and another country with which such an MoU may be entered, to mutually recognise maritime education and training, certificates of competency, endorsements, documentary evidence of training and medical fitness certificates, issued to the seafarers who are citizens of respective countries,” the Shipping Ministry said in a statement.

The pact will facilitate unilateral recognition certificates issued by the Directorate General of Shipping to Indian seafarers by another country, without seeking similar acknowledgment by India of the certificates issued by that country, it added.

Under the pact, Indian seafarers will be eligible to be placed on ships under the flag of that country for employment, thus leading to increased employment opportunities, the ministry said.

The bilateral MoU would therefore, make the seafarers of both the countries to be eligible for employment on ships of either party based on the certificates so recognized, it added.

“The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the Model Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for unilateral/bilateral recognition of Certificates, pursuant to Regulation 1/10 of International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) for Seafarers, 1978 as amended to be signed between the Directorate General of Shipping, Government of India and its counterparts in foreign countries, with the approval of Minister-in-charge of Shipping and the Minister of External Affairs,” the statement said.

India being a seafarer supplying nation with large pool of trained seafarers will stand to be benefitted.

To make it look more attractive to MNCs to opt for domestic electronics manufacturing in India, the Budget may dish out production-linked subsidies for companies involved in semiconductor fabrication. This is aimed at inviting global semiconductor, and microprocessor companies to set up plants in India.

Earlier also, the government had announced schemes for setting up semiconductor plants in the country.

The National Policy for Electronics, 2019, argues for special support for developing core competencies in the strategic sub-sectors like fabless chip design industry. The Government could provide tax incentives to high-tech manufacturing plants in the fields of solar photovoltaic cells, lithium storage batteries, solar electric charging infrastructure, computers, servers, and laptops.

For ‘Make in India’, there may be investment-linked income tax exemptions under Section 35AD of the Income Tax Act and other indirect tax benefits.

Many global semiconductor companies such as ARM, Qualcomm, Intel, Cadence and Texas Instruments have set up design and software development infrastructure here but per se, chip manufacturing plants are still elusive for India.

Intel, AMD and ARM for microprocessors, and Qualcomm, Samsung and MediaTek are the names in this segment globally who also cater to the telecom segment and their chips are imported by Indian companies.

The Indian requirement for chips are completely met through imports. The Indian semiconductor component market is expected to be worth $32.35 billion by 2025, growing at a compunded annual growth rate of 10.1 per cent between 2018 and 2025, according to the Indian Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), an industry body.

China, on the contrary, is building a homegrown chip programme, eyeing adoption of local semiconductors in 70 per cent of its products by 2025, up from 16 per cent currently.

In last few years, the Indian government has launched a slew of schemes to boost local manufacturing of electronic goods. Total production of electronic goods in value terms more than doubled from $31.2 billion in FY15 to $65.5 billion in FY19, led by mobile phones, shows data from the Reserve Bank of India’s report.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/budget-may-offer-production-incentives-for-fabless-chip-cos.html

166,23-1-20,Ministers' visits mere eyewash: Panthers Party,"The Jammu & Kashmir Panthers Party here on Wednesday termed Union Ministers' visits to the newly carved Union Territory an “eyewash”, accusing them of avoiding disgruntled people and troublesome areas in the aftermath of the scrapping of the J&K's special status over five months ago.

Addressing a rally in Ramnagar of Udhampur district, JKNPP chairman and former Minister Harsh Dev Singh said the Ministers “randomly select places of their tour in consultation with their local party colleagues, ensuring that troublesome areas were omitted from their itinerary and disgruntled people are avoided”.

“The ministers' visits to Jammu & Kashmir are only an eyewash and have nothing to do with aspirations of people,” he said, adding that these trips proved to be “pleasure trips”.

“The ministers were supposed to make people aware about benefits of the abrogation of Article 370 provisions but such awareness was more required in Kashmir region than Jammu. Interestingly, central ministers has shown their disinclination towards Kashmir as only five of 36 Ministers were reported to have planned visits to the Valley,” Singh added.

Even in the Jammu region, he said Union ministers were indulging in the inaugurations of petty development works with their speeches full of “tired shibboleths”.

“It was not understandable as to how the same could help them achieve their objective of educating people. It was further not clarified as to what prompted them to visit J&K with the aforesaid motive five and a half months after the scrapping of the special status and downgrading of the state into UTs,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ministers--visits-mere-eyewash--panthers-party.html

Speaking at the Kolkata Literary Meet here, Tharoor also claimed the real “tukde tukde gang” is the ruling party which is dividing the country into “bits and pieces”.

“With no development on its agenda, the ruling party is making a complete exposition of its agenda to create a Hindu rashtra,” Tharoor, also an acclaimed author, claimed.

The present central government does not have the mentality for development, the Congress leader alleged.

“The real tukde tukde gang is the ruling party which is dividing the country into bits and pieces. The party wants to divide us further the way the British Raj did through the divide and rule policy”, he said.

“Tukde tukde gang” is a term often used by the right- wing parties to attack those who they think are out to divide the country. The term was coined and used against the Left and

Left-backed outfits during the campus unrest at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2016.

“Should religion be a determinant for nationhood? Mahatma Gandhi went for a secular India, unlike Pakistan which went on to become an Islamic state. “Our Constitution reflects dignity and equality for all. The Constitution reflects that and also essentially rejected the idea of religion-based citizenship,” Tharoor said.

For the first time in India, religion is considered as a determinant for citizenship and excluding one religion, Islam, the former Union minister said.

“The onus will be on us to prove that we are Indians,” the Thiruvananthapuram MP claimed.

“But BJP has reduced this to six faiths and three nations”, Tharoor said.

172,23-1-20,Relief to Indians on card as New Jersey to lower college costs of H-1B visa holders’ children,"The US state of New Jersey will enact a legislation that will make college and universities more affordable for the children of H-1B visa holders, mostly Indian IT professionals, bringing a huge financial relief to them.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Tuesday signed the legislation “S2555”, allowing New Jersey students, who are the children of H-1B visa holders, to qualify for in-state tuition at public institutions of higher education.A majority of H-1B visa holders are Indians and this legislation comes as a significant relief to them, amidst an environment of stringent immigration laws and scrutiny under the Trump administration.

“New Jerseyans deserve equal access to higher education, and today we are taking another step towards making that possible. I’m proud to sign the legislation to help our students achieve their education goals, pursue a successful future and live their dreams here in their home state,” Murphy said.

The legislation exempts dependent students whose parents or guardians hold H-1B visas from paying out-of-state tuition provided they meet certain criteria, including having graduated from a New Jersey high school and having attended a New Jersey high school for at least three years. New Jersey is home to prestigious institutions such as Princeton University.

Secretary of Higher Education Zakiya Smith Ellis said New Jersey is working to make college affordable for New Jerseyans and the legislation will expand postsecondary opportunities to more residents such as dependents of H-1B visa holders. India’s Deputy Consul General in New York Shatru Sinha welcomed the legislation, saying in a tweet that it is an “important initiative for the Indian community”.

Primary sponsors of the legislation include Indian-American Democratic Senator Vin Gopal, Senator M Teresa Ruiz and Assembly members Raj Mukherji, Daniel Benson, and Robert Karabinchak.

President and CEO of Edison-based health technology company HealthEC Arthur Kapoor welcomed the legislation, saying it will tremendously benefit the Indian diaspora in New Jersey.

“Indian diaspora welcomes this bill since H-1B visa holders pay enormous amounts of taxes as well as social security contributions which they are never able to use as they return to India before they are eligible to receive benefits. This bill will allow their kids access to the best education,” Kapoor said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/relief-to-indians-on-card-as-new-jersey-to-lower-college-costs-of-h-1b-visa-holders----children.html

Responding to a question about the downward revision of India’s growth rate by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said the economy is on the path of “revival” and nobody should have a pessimistic view about it.

“From the Union Budget, you will get Government’s plan of action.

Our fundamentals are very strong. Therefore, nobody should create a pessimistic view about Indian economy,” the Information and Broadcasting minister said at a briefing after the Union Cabinet meeting.

Asserting that the economy was on the path of “revival”, he said there are ups and downs in world economy, and it has reflection on economy of countries.

The IMF had on Monday lowered growth estimate for India to 4.8 per cent for 2019, citing stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth as the major factors for the downward revision.

176,23-1-20,"New CEO stands by 737 MAX, eyeing reset at troubled Boeing","Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun sought to pivot from a bruising period of crisis and scandal on Wednesday, pledging a renewed commitment to safety and transparency and endorsing the long-term viability of the 737 MAX plane.

""I commit to you to be more accessible than the team has been,"" Calhoun said at the outset of an hour-long conference call with reporters, the first such event with a Boeing executive since the MAX was grounded in March following two deadly crashes.

Calhoun vowed a ""safety first"" culture and promised investment in the firm's engineers, who critics say have lost influence in the company's zeal to boost its share price.

Without safety ""there is no shareholder value, there is no profit-sharing,"" Calhoun said a day after the company's decision to push back the timeframe for the MAX's return until at least midyear.

Calhoun reaffirmed his commitment to the MAX, saying ""I believe in this airplane"" and pointing to positive feedback from pilots as he dismissed speculation it could be grounded permanently.

A former General Electric and Blackstone Group executive who has been on the Boeing board since 2009, Calhoun took the corner office at Boeing this month after the company ousted Dennis Muilenburg in December.

Analysts have broadly supported the move, although some have questioned whether Calhoun's lengthy board tenure makes him an ideal agent of change.

The appearance came ahead of the first flight of the Boeing 777X, a key step in trying to jump-start a new model that has missed earlier deadlines.

Late Wednesday Boeing said the first flight, scheduled for Thursday, would be delayed ""due to weather"" but the company was assessing a possible Friday flight.

Sources have said the flight is scheduled to leave from Seattle, where rain was forecast for Thursday.

Calhoun's appearance also came hours after bruising comments from US President Donald Trump, who called Boeing a ""very disappointing company"" because of the MAX crisis.

Calhoun responded to sometimes pointed questions from reporters with greater ease and less defensiveness than the more technocratic Muilenburg.

The former boss was savaged by lawmakers at congressional hearings and lost the confidence of airlines and regulators with a series of too-rosy predictions about the MAX that damaged credibility.

But Calhoun dismissed a question on whether Boeing would suspend or cut its dividend as a way to signal a shift in the company's orientation, saying the company has the financial capacity for the payoffs.

The policy will persist ""unless something dramatic changes,"" he said.

And he largely downplayed a series of troubling internal emails in which employees ridiculed regulators, airlines and Boeing's safety culture.

The ""appalling"" messages were from a small group of employees and don't reflect the overall corporate culture, which is ""good,"" he said.

""Our employees care about safety a lot but their confidence is shaken. I have to restore it.""

The appearance came a day after Boeing announced it does not expect regulatory approval to return the MAX to service before mid-2020. The company this month suspended production on the jet, its top-selling plane.

Calhoun described a production ramp-up plan that will begin some months before mid-year, with the company's supply chain engaged ""well before that."" Calhoun said Tuesday's new timetable followed a decision earlier this month to endorse simulator training for MAX pilots and reflected customers' desire for a more realistic schedule after Boeing missed MAX target dates repeatedly in 2019.

While there were multiple factors behind the two crashes, Calhoun highlighted in particular a wrong assumption by Boeing and regulators that pilots could quickly respond to the malfunctioning of a flight handling system and reassert control over the plane.

That system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, has been singled out as a central factor in both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, which together claimed 346 lives.

Calhoun predicted the flying public would come around on the MAX after the jet gets a rigorous once-over from regulators and pilots.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/new-ceo-stands-by-737-max--eyeing-reset-at-troubled-boeing-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/new-ceo-stands-by-737-max--eyeing-reset-at-troubled-boeing.html
177,23-1-20,"RBI buys Rs 10k cr of long-term securities, sells Rs 2,950 cr of short-term govt bonds in 4th special OMO","In the fourth special open market operation (OMO) auctions, the Reserve Bank of India on Thursday bought Rs 10,000 crore worth of long-term securities and sold Rs 2,950 crore worth of short-term government bonds.

Last week, the RBI had said it will simultaneously purchase and sell government securities under open market operations (OMO) of Rs 10,000 crore each.

In the OMO purchase auction, the RBI received bids worth Rs 26,887 crore for two types of securities -- 7.32 per cent-2024 and 6.45 per cent-2029 -- but accepted only Rs 10,000 crore of bids.

For 7.32 per cent-2024, it got 157 bids and accepted 40 bids. The RBI got 147 bids for 6.45 per cent-2029 bonds but accepted 105 bids.

The cut-off yield for 7.32 per cent-2024 was 6.408 per cent, while for 6.45 per cent-2029, it was 6.5780 per cent.

The RBI offered to sell two government securities -- 7.80 per cent-2021 and 7.94 per cent-2021 -- through the OMO.

It received Rs 35,375 crore of bids but accepted Rs 2,950 crore of bids.

In terms of number of bids, the central bank received 85 bids for 7.80 per cent-2021 and 70 bids for 7.94 per cent-2021 but accepted 3 and 7 bids, respectively.

The cut-off yield for 7.80 per cent-2021 was 5.6714 per cent and for 7.94 per cent-2021 was 5.7192 per cent.

178,23-1-20,"Senate OK’s impeachment trial rules, puts off witnesses","The US Senate plunged into President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial with Republicans abruptly abandoning plans to cram opening arguments into two days but solidly rejecting for now Democratic demands for more witnesses to expose what they deem Trump’s “trifecta” of offenses.

Trump himself claimed he wants top aides to testify, but qualified that by suggesting there were “national security” concerns to allowing their testimony.

“We have a great case,” Trump said on Wednesday at a global economic forum in Davos.

In a press conference before returning to Washington, Trump said his legal team was doing a “very good job.”

He appeared to break with Republicans efforts to block Democratic motions to immediately call witnesses and subpoena documents. Instead, Trump said he’d like to see aides, including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, testify as witnesses Trump said he’d leave the “national security” concerns about allowing their testimony to the Senate.

Tuesday’s daylong session started with the setback for Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell and the president’s legal team, but it ended near 2 a.M. On Wednesday with Republicans easily approving the rest of the trial rules largely on their terms.

With the rules settled, the trial is now on a fast-track. At issue is whether Trump should be removed from office for abuse of power stemming from his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter as Trump was withhold aid to the country, and for obstructing Congress’ ensuing probe.

Chief Justice John Roberts gaveled open the session, with House prosecutors on one side, Trump’s team on the other, in the well of the Senate, as senators sat silently at their desks, under oath to do “impartial justice.” No cellphones or other electronics were allowed.

As the day stretched deep into the night, lawyerly arguments gave way to more pointedly political ones. Tempers flared and senators paced the chamber. Democrats pursued what may be their only chance to force senators to vote on hearing new testimony.

After one particularly bitter post-midnight exchange, Roberts intervened, taking the rare step of admonishing both the Democratic House managers prosecuting the case and the White House counsel to “remember where they are.”

“I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and the president’s counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world’s greatest deliberative body,” Roberts said.

He told them that description of the Senate stemmed from a 1905 trial when a senator objected to the word “pettifogging,” because members should “avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse.”

Over and over, Republicans turned back Democratic amendments to subpoena documents from the White House, State Department, Defense Department and budget office. By the same 53-47 party-line, they turned away witnesses with front-row seats to Trump’s actions including acting White House chief of staff Mulvaney and Bolton, the former national security adviser critical of the Ukraine policy.

Only on one amendment, to allow more time to file motions, did a single Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, join Democrats. But it, too, was rejected, 52-48.

As the visitors’ gallery filled earlier with guests, actress-and-activist Alyssa Milano among them, and Trump’s most ardent House allies lining the back rows, the day that began as a debate over rules quickly took on the cadence of a trial proceeding over whether the president’s actions toward Ukraine warranted removal from office.

“It’s not our job to make it easy for you,” Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee leading the prosecution, told the Senate. “Our job is to make it hard to deprive the American people of a fair trial.”

White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the president’s lead lawyer, called the trial “a farce.” He scoffed that the House charges against Trump were “ridiculous.”

The White House legal team did not dispute Trump’s actions, when he called Ukraine and asked for a “favour,” which was to investigate Biden as he withheld military aid the ally desperately needed as it faced off with hostile Russia on its border. But the lawyers insisted the president did nothing wrong. “Absolutely no case,” Cipollone said.

Schiff, the California Democrat, said America’s Founders added the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution with “precisely this type of conduct in mind - conduct that abuses the power of office for a personal benefit, that undermines our national security, and that invites foreign interference in the democratic process of an election.”

Said Schiff: “It is the trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment.’’

The other lead lawyer on Trump’s team, Jay Sekulow, retorted, “I’ll give you a trifecta,” outlining complaints over the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry process.

In Davos, Trump repeated his attacks on Democratic House managers serving as prosecutors in the trial, saying he’d like to “sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces” on the Senate floor during the trial but that his attorneys might have a problem with it.

And he said he wants to deliver the State of the Union as scheduled on February 4 even if the trial is ongoing, calling the address “very important to what I am doing” in setting his administration’s agenda.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/senate-ok---s-impeachment-trial-rules--puts-off-witnesses.html

“We are adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe,” he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, adding that the names of the new countries would be announced “very shortly”.

180,23-1-20,India falls to 51st position in EIU’s Democracy Index,"India slipped 10 places to 51st position in the 2019 Democracy Index’s global ranking, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit, which cited “erosion of civil liberties” in the country as the primary cause for the downtrend.

India’s overall score fell from 7.23 in 2018 to 6.90 in the Index that provides a snapshot of the current state of democracy worldwide for 165 independent states and two territories.

On India, the report said, the country dropped ten places in the Democracy Index’s global ranking to 51st. The primary cause of the democratic regression was an erosion of civil liberties in the country.

The index is based on five categories — electoral process and pluralism; the functioning of government; political participation; political culture; and civil liberties.

Based on their total score, the countries are classified as one of four types of regime: “full democracy” (scores greater than 8); flawed democracy — scores greater than 6 and less than or equal to 8; hybrid regime — scores greater than 4 and less than or equal to 6; authoritarian regime — scores less than or equal to 4”.

India was included in the “flawed democracy” category.

Meanwhile, China’s score fell to 2.26 in the 2019 index, and the country is now ranked 153rd, close to the bottom of the global rankings.

“Over the past year discrimination against minorities, especially in the north-western region of Xinjiang, has intensified. Digital surveillance of the population continued apace in 2019, representing a further constraint on individual freedoms,” the report said.

Among other emerging economies, Brazil was ranked 52nd with a score of 6.86, Russia stood at 134th with a score of 3.11.

Meanwhile, Pakistan was ranked 108th on the overall list with a score of 4.25, while Sri Lanka was at 69th place with a score of 6.27, Bangladesh (at 80th with 5.88 score).

The overall list was topped by Norway, followed by Iceland and Sweden. Other countries in the top 10 include New Zealand at the fourth place, Finland (5th), Ireland (6th), Denmark (7th), Canada (8th), Australia (9th) and Switzerland (10th).

183,23-1-20,India advances 8 places to 72nd spot on Global Talent Competitiveness Index,"India has moved up eight places to the 72nd position in the 2020 Global Talent Competitiveness Index that measures and ranks countries based on their ability to grow, attract and retain talent.

Switzerland topped the list of 132 countries, followed by the US and Singapore.

“Although more could be done to improve the country’s educational system (68th in Formal Education), India’s key strength relates to growing (44th) talent, due to its levels of lifelong learning (40th) and access to growth opportunities (39th),” the Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) report noted.

The country’s highest-ranked sub-pillar is employability, but the ability to match labour market demand and supply stands in contrast to the country’s poor “mid-level skills”, which result in a mediocre score in vocational and technical skills, the report said.

India’s greatest challenge is to address its weak ability to attract and retain talent, where strengthening the role of minorities and women would raise the level of internal openness, it added.

The GTCI report was launched by INSEAD, a partner and sponsor of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Tent in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday.

Switzerland topped this year’s ranking, followed by the United States, its highest position yet, while Singapore is the third most talent-competitive country.

At present, a stock exchange is allowed to charge a maximum amount of Rs 10,000 for each violation of listing norms that need to be complied with by companies.

According to a Sebi circular, exchanges can impose a fine of Rs 50,000 per instance for non-compliance with respect to obtaining in-principle approval of bourses before issuance of securities.

The bourses can levy a fine of Rs 25,000 each in cases of non-disclosure of dividend distribution policy in annual reports and on the websites of the entities.

The amount would also be applicable in the cases of non-convening of annual general meeting within a period of five months from the close of a financial year and for not taking exchange’s approval before filing request for change of name with Registrar of Companies (RoC).

The new framework would come into force with effect from compliance periods ending on or after March 31, 2020.

The move is aimed at maintaining consistency and adopting a uniform approach in the matter of levy of fines for non-compliance with certain provisions of the listing regulations.

Besides, the exchanges can impose a penalty of Rs 10,000 for delay in furnishing prior intimation about the company’s board meeting as well as delay in non-disclosure of record date or dividend declaration, and non-compliance with norms pertaining to having a functional website.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/sebi-comes-out-new-framework-to-check-non-compliance-of-listing-rules.html

Following the October 24 Supreme Court ruling that non-telecom revenues of telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea should be included for considering payments of Government dues, the telecom department asked OIL to pay Rs 48,000 crore in principal dues together with interest and penalty. The dues sought are double the net worth of OIL.

“OIL had obtained a National Long Distance Service Licence (NLD Licence) to establish Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA System) for control, management, and protection of OIL’s pipeline network used for transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products,” the company said in a statement.

The NLD licence is predominantly used for the SCADA system and only the spare bandwidth capacity is leased out to other telecom operators.

“As per the licence terms, licence fee is to be paid on gross total revenue from services provided under the NLD licence. Since the award of NLD licence, the cumulative revenue of Rs 1.47 crore is earned by OIL from the leasing of spare bandwidth capacity on which all applicable licence fee and other statutory dues as per licence terms have been paid by OIL regularly,” it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-india-moves-sc-against-dot-seeking-rs-48k-cr-payment-on-rs-1-47-cr-revenue.html

187,23-1-20,Lanka Prez Gotabaya wants civil war disappearances probed: President’s office,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa wants a probe into the disappearances of over 20,000 people in the country’s brutal civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels, his office has said in a clarification after the Sri Lankan President declared the missing persons “dead” in a first-ever admission to a UN official.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former wartime defence secretary who played a key role in ending Sri Lanka’s nearly 30-year civil war with the Tamil separatist rebels, told UN Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer last week that after the necessary investigations are completed steps would be taken to issue death certificates to the missing persons.

The President’s office has said Gotabaya Rajapaksa had explained to the UN official that he will have the matter investigated, but added, “however I can’t bring back the dead”.

The President told the UN official that as a result of the census carried out by the government at the end of the conflict in 2009, it had emerged that most of the missing persons had been conscripted by the LTTE, the statement said.

“Their families attest to being witnesses of their loved ones being taken by the LTTE. However, thereafter they do not have any information as to their fate. Therefore, as far as they are concerned these people are missing,” the statement quoted the Sri Lankan president as saying.

“The unfortunate truth is that these people had died during the battles. Even in the security forces there are about 4,000 personnel listed as missing. But in reality these people had died during the fights, but their bodies had not been recovered,” it said. Rajapaksa told the UN official that after the conclusion of the necessary investigations, steps would be taken to issue death certificates and after that the families would be given the necessary support to rebuild their lives.

According to the government figures, over 20,000 people are missing due to various conflicts including the three-decade separatist war with Lankan Tamils in the north and east which claimed at least 100,000 lives.

The Tamils alleged that thousands were massacred during the final stages of the war that ended in 2009 when the Government forces killed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/lanka-prez-gotabaya-wants-civil-war-disappearances-probed--president---s-office.html
188,23-1-20,A rich haul,"Saffronart to auction businessman Nirav Modi’s seized artworks, luxury watches and handbags on behalf of the Enforcement Directorate

The Enforcement Directorate roped in Saffronart, an international auction house, to host two auctions featuring the seized assets of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi. While the first sale, a live auction, will be on February 27 in Mumbai, the second will be an online sale on March 3 and 4.

The auctions will feature 15 artworks by significant modern and contemporary Indian artists as well as a selection of luxury watches, handbags and cars.

Highlights of the auction include a 1,935 masterpiece by Amrita Sher-Gil, which has never been auctioned previously and a significant oil on canvas by MF Husain from his Mahabharata series. Both the artworks have been estimated to be priced at Rs 12 crore or Rs 18 crore.

The exhibition will also showcase a serene blue painting by VS Gaitonde from 1972, which is estimated to be priced at around Rs 7 to 9 crore and a vivid red depiction of Krishna by Manjit Bawa (Rs 3 to 5 crore).

Apart from the modern artworks, important watches will also be on sale including a Jaeger Lecoultre Men’s Reverso Gyrotourbillon 2 and a Gerrard Perregaux Men’s Opera One wristwatch. More than 80 branded handbags are there in the auction, out of which several are from the Birkin and Kelly lines by luxury retailer Hermes.

CEO and co-founder of the auction house, Dinesh Vazirani, said, “We are honoured to lend our services and expertise to the Enforcement Directorate. We are working with the ED to assess and evaluate each item and put together the catalogue for both the sales, which include a distinguished line-up of artworks, too.” He added that some of the brands offer the most popular luxury items internationally and have witnessed a great demand from celebrities and collectors.

This is the first time that the Enforcement Directorate has appointed a professional auction house to conduct an auction of seized assets in India. Earlier, in March 2019, the Income Tax Department had appointed the same auction house for the bidding that raised Rs 54.84 crore.

Selected items from the forthcoming auctions will be exhibited at the Saffronart gallery in The Oberoi, New Delhi, during the India Art Fair later this month.

189,23-1-20,Making of Netaji’s INA,"Actors Sharvari Wagh and Sunny Kaushal say that even though their characters in The Forgotten Army might be fictional, the story and events that the audience will experience are real

I don’t believe in enacting a character without knowing him or his background story,” says actor Sunny Kaushal, who is set to make his debut with Amazon Prime Video’s web series The Forgotten Army. So he studied deep. “There is always some blurred information that you have because of what you have read about history in school. But you would have never known the details of everything, including their betrayals, struggles and fights and even some part of their personal lives. We started reading and researching about everything through the 1999 documentary as well as internet and books. We collected a lot of material to educate ourselves on the topic,” says he.

The series showcases the formation of Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army after British army’s defeat in Singapore during World War II. It has been told through the perspective of soldiers. Playing the role of soldiers could be highly taxing and challenging for debutantes. So how difficult did they find it to master all the moves? “For a week, we learnt how to live the way Army does. We had regular training on how to handle the gun and create formations. We worked on the standing postures, learnt what angles to hold and keep the gun so that you actually look like one from the Army. Apart from that, psychologically too, there was a lot of preparation to understand what soldiers have gone through in those three years during war,” says Sunny.

Director Kabir Khan brought the story out to the public for the first time through the eponymous 1999 documentary, which also became the first reference for the actors to prepare for their respective roles. Ever since Khan passed out of film school he wanted to tell the stories of these soldiers. He says, “Twenty-seven thousand of them died fighting to liberate the country. Just imagine their patriotism and valour. They are a forgotten chapter in our history and this story is an effort to make people realise their existence.”

Sharvari tells us, “The 1999 documentary really helped us get into the skin of our characters since they are based on real lives.”

However, Sunny points out that even though the characters might be fictional, the story and events that the audience would experience are real. Surinder Sodhi, played by him, might not have existed in reality but has been inspired by real people. Sunny tells us, “My character is an amalgamation of Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, Shah Nawaz Khan and Prem Kumar Sahgal, the three faces who were charged in the Red Fort trial. So different elements from their stories have inspired Surinder’s story.”

Maya, played by actor Sharvari Wagh, is a civilian who later becomes a part of the INA. She is inspired by one the leaders of the Rani Laxmibai Regiment, which comprised women “who fought shoulder to shoulder with men and stood till the end. They have been trained very well and how to fight with guns and all kinds of weapons. I am very glad that my first project has been inspired by such a powerful story.”

Since it’s a period drama, the personal lives and stories of the soldiers, their war rooms and battle set-up have been created based on archival footage and images to recreate the real history. But why is it that there are so many films and series being made around chapters of Indian history today given the recent trend in Bollywood? “With the growth of good content, we are fortunate enough to have come in the industry at such a time when history is being valued so much,” Sharvari says. Sunny goes on to add that another reason why history is making its way into mainstream cinema is because of the enhanced technology that we are equipped with today. “We are much better equipped today to create such content. What the director envisions, he can bring it alive the same way he has imagined. To recreate those times really needs a lot, including the right kind of animation, costumes and set-ups. You need a lot of means to do that. It’s only now that they are able to express their creative vision. The biggest instance is of Kabir Khan himself, who has been working on this script for 20 years since his 1999 documentary.”

Sharvari, who is set for her Bollywood debut with Bunty Aur Babli 2, talks about her take on sequels and whether they revive the essence of an old blockbuster or just take away its originality. She says, “The second part will revolve around the story which happens 10 years later. Might be their kids (laughs). It’s like a time lapse. It’s somewhat the same storyline and same characters but just the people and their approaches are different this time. I think that it’s going to be a fun thing and something that people wouldn’t have watched. So a sequel always has something to add of its own while maintaining the originality of both the versions.”

(The series releases on Amazon Prime on January 24.)

190,23-1-20,Trend Blazer,"Developing my own stories: Shweta

Actor Shweta Tripathi started the year by signing her next project, which she will be announcing soon. She is also working on developing her own concept and stories.

“As an actor, who is constantly surrounded by stories and good writing, story ideas keep popping out every now and then. I came up with two ideas, which I closely believe in and I thought it's time to invest some energy and heart into them and see these ideas bloom into full-fledged stories,” said Shweta.

“I am aware that it will be a time-consuming process but I want to put in that effort into developing these stories because I believe in them. I will actively participate in conceiving the story ideas with the help of Ashish and I am hoping by mid-2020 I am in a position to speak more about them,” she added.

I can never pay back what Kangana did for me at that tender age. My parents used to faint everytime they saw my face. But she stood by my side, and after years of struggle when things got better, she buried her face in my lap and cried. I am glad she did because strongest people often forget to share their pain.

—Rangoli Chandel

Veteran actor Bharati Achrekar feels that Indian television continues to lack good content, as a result of which the young audience is moving towards web shows.

She says, “Good content is a rare thing in television these days. Mostly stories revolve around a single character. I don't blame anyone, even they have to survive. There are so many channels, so there is a tough competition. Also, people's taste has changed owing to western influence. You have to cater to the urban and the rural audience too, whose mindset and tastes are different.”

191,23-1-20,From memories of childhood,"Chanel delves into founder’s orphanage days at its couture show

A humble stone fountain, overgrown shrubs and flowers, and white sheets drying on a line met Pharrell Williams and other curious guests at the Chanel show inside the Grand Palais.

The set recreated the landscape house founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel viewed as a child after her mother died and her father sent her away to an abbey orphanage.

If such a lowly — and sad — setting seemed like an unusual choice to showcase high-priced and normally joyous couture, it was an intentional move by designer Virginie Viard to demonstrate how Chanel mixed high and low in her fashion.

Here are some highlights from the second day of Paris Fashion Week haute couture shows for spring-summer 2020.

CHANEL DELVES INTO FOUNDER’S ORPHANAGE CHILDHOOD

Chanel, Viard discovered, had been profoundly inspired in all her designs by the ancient Cistercian Abbey of Aubazine, in the French region of Corrèze — with its flowers, uniforms and stained-glass artistry.

The theme made for a more haunting collection than normal — a mood emphasized by loud, spooky music and models that slowly crisscrossed the courtyard like they were in a trance.

A take on a convent schoolgirl uniform opened the show as a signature Chanel tweed skirt-suit. It was cut sharply, with a round ecclesiastical white collar and baggy white preppy ankle socks. Mosaic patterns in panels evoking stained glass appeared on an equally strict jacket in pastel blue and sand. Apart from the occasional flash of colour, most of the designs came in black and white.

“What interested me in this (abbey) was the paradox between the sophistication of haute couture and the simplicity of this place,” Viard said. “The strict suits of the pupils rub shoulders with structured dresses of an ethereal finesse.”

Viard has less humour and a stricter aesthetic take than the flamboyant Karl Lagerfeld, her predecessor who died last year. And this more austere theme gave the French designer a platform to design more naturally with her own voice.

GIVENCHY’S TIMELESSNESS

Musicians were suspended mid-air while seated on chairs attached to stone columns for Givenchy’s historic Left Bank show venue.

They played dramatic classical music to accompany spring’s equally dramatic couture — an accomplished series of varied designs that made it seem as if designer Clare Waight Keller can’t put a foot wrong.

The clothes spoke for themselves, without the need for cultural references, through deft plays of proportion.

A long charcoal tuxedo coat had a magnificent shape, with a truncated full skirt billowing out unexpectedly at knee level in a clever reinterpretation of a known silhouette.

Vividly coloured silk ruffles didn’t just appear as details on gowns, but Keller used them to construct the structure and silhouette of trapeze-shaped garments that teemed like dense, oversize petals.

ALEXIS MABILLE ‘TEESES’ HIS GUESTS

Burlesque superstar Dita Von Teese opened the show for Alexis Mabille in a black tuxedo with sensual decollete that dripped down the leg with brooding black sequins.

The French couturier this season used Von Teese — and her styles — as the touchstone for a collection that explored corsetry, lingerie and seductive undressing.

A white satin bustier was covered gently by a see-through lace chemise. A white floor-length gown had a bold dropped shoulder in which the segments seemed to fall off the bust, as if the model were in the process of undressing.

Mabille also used his signature bow theme to produce a gargantuan abstract neck bow whose proportions drowned the model. It was highly inventive.

ARMANI LOOKS TO COLOUR, ASIA

The iconic Place Vendome square was the enviable location for Italian design legend Giorgio Armani’s latest display.

For Armani, couture is about celebrities and razzmatazz, and Tuesday was no exception as actresses Reese Witherspoon and Juliette Binoche held court.

The Asian-themed designs, though beautifully constructed, were secondary to that, sadly, and tended toward the repetitive.

Statement colour — sometimes overly bold — also defined the spring aesthetic. But the exhaustive show held no surprises.

A structured white silk tuxedo in a crossover design opened the show. The model wore a stiff black wig, a styling feature that appeared throughout the show.

The signature tuxedo led to a terracotta obi belt on hot pink loose pants and a V-neck tuxedo in imperial blue.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/from-memories-of-childhood-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/from-memories-of-childhood.html

195,23-1-20,Death toll in China’s coronavirus outbreak rises to 17,"The death toll from the new coronavirus outbreak in China nearly doubled to 17 with the confirmed infection cases sharply rising to 444 on Wednesday, even as the cases of the deadly pneumonia were reported from the US, Hong Kong, Macao and Mexico.

Chinese authorities have warned that the disease could spread further in the ongoing holiday season during which millions travel at home and abroad amid official advisories to people of Wuhan, the epicentre of illness, not to leave the city.

Seventeen people have died due to the virus, state-run China Daily reported on Wednesday.

The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

Common symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the WHO.

The Chinese health authorities announced that 444 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday.

Considering its potential to spread to different countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is holding a rare emergency meeting Geneva on Wednesday to consider declaring Wuhan virus as an international public health emergency, as it did with swine flu and Ebola.

Such a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.

The festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/death-toll-in-china---s-coronavirus-outbreak-rises-to-17.html

Health secretary Sophia Chan said the 39-year-old man was “preliminarily positive”, but a final test result would only be known on Thursday.

“We decided to announced the case (early) due to heavy public concern,” Chan said.

The man and four family members had taken the high-speed railway from Wuhan to Shenzhen on Tuesday before transferring to another train that brought them to Hong Kong.

He was put in isolation in hospital after tests, but Wednesday when his relatives showed no symptoms after a night at a city hotel they were allowed to leave for the Philippines.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/hk-reports-first----preliminary-positive----case-of-new-virus.html
197,23-1-20,3 African nations meet to draft deal on Nile dam dispute,"Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan started US-monitored talks on Wednesday in the Sudanese capital to try hammer out a draft deal to resolve their dispute over a Nile dam that Ethiopia is constructing, an Egyptian spokesman said.

The $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam project on the Blue Nile, which promises to provide much-needed electricity to Ethiopia’s 100 million people, has been a contentious point among the three main Nile Basin countries.

The issue is critical for Cairo as Egypt seeks to protect its main source of freshwater for its large and growing population, also about 100 million.

The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia into Sudan where it joins the White Nile near Khartoum, to form the Nile River. Eighty-five percent of Nile waters originate in Ethiopia from the Blue Nile, which is one of the Nile’s two main tributaries.

According to Muhamed el-Sebai, a spokesman for Egypt’s irrigation ministry, technical and legal teams from the three countries are to “prepare a draft deal” on how the dam’s reservoir would be filled and how the dam itself would operate.

The meeting in Khartoum would last two days, he said. There was no immediate indication on whether it would succeed after several previous rounds of talks failed. But at the talks in Washington last week, the three countries said they had reached a preliminary agreement.

The US and World Bank are acting as observers at the Khartoum talks after Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi last year pleaded with Washington and the international community to mediate a solution for the years-long dispute. Egypt claims that filling the dam’s reservoir too quickly could significantly reduce its share of the Nile water. A joint statement after the Washington meeting said the filling should occur in stages during the rainy season, which generally runs from July to August, thought it did not give details on how long it would take to be completed.Another two-day meeting in Khartoum is planned for next week, with the goal of reaching a final agreement.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/3-african-nations-meet-to-draft-deal-on-nile-dam-dispute.html
198,23-1-20,Told Trump war with Iran will be disastrous: Imran Khan,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said he has told US President Donald Trump that a war with Iran would have disastrous consequences.

Asked whether Trump agreed with him, Khan said the US President did not say anything but he probably understood what he meant.

“Afghanistan is yet to be resolved and Iran would be much bigger (if war starts),” Khan said.

Khan met Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) summit here on Tuesday.

Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated in the wake of the killing of powerful Iranian commander General Qasem Soleimani by America on January 3.

“If there is conflict between Iran and the Western world it will be a disaster — it will cause poverty in the world — and who knows how long it may go on. In my opinion it would be insanity,” Khan said.

“I spoke to President Trump yesterday and I told him it would be a disaster,” Khan said.

The Pakistan Prime Minister also said he does not understand why countries try to resolve their differences through military conflicts.

“The moment you start a military conflict, you don’t know where it will finish. It has unintended consequences,” he said.

After meeting Khan, Trump on Tuesday had said the US is watching the developments between India and Pakistan over Kashmir “very closely” and repeated his offer to “help” resolve the longstanding dispute between the two neighbours.

Trump told Khan, whom he referred to as “my friend”, that he would speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the ongoing Kashmir issue. Trump is expected to visit India in the coming weeks, marking his first visit after assuming office.

“What’s going on between Pakistan and India … if we can help, we certainly will be willing to. We have been watching it very closely and it’s an honour to be here with my friend,” Trump had said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/told-trump-war-with-iran-will-be-disastrous--imran-khan.html

Philip Jacobson, 30, was initially detained last month after attending a hearing in Borneo involving the local parliament and the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, Indonesia’s largest indigenous rights advocacy group, the website Mongabay said.

This week, Jacobson was formally arrested and told he faced up to five years in prison for visiting Indonesia with the wrong visa, it added.

He had travelled to the country on a business visa, according to Mongabay.

200,23-1-20,Macron loses cool with Israeli security in ‘Chirac moment’,"When French President Emmanuel Macron visited Jerusalem’s Old City on Wednesday, he also trod in the footsteps of one of his predecessors, Jacques Chirac, by engaging in a heated argument with Israeli security.

The altercation broke out when Israeli security forces pushed past the French detail and were first to enter the Church of Saint Anne, which is French state property.

“Everybody knows the rules. I don’t like what you did in front of me,” an animated Macron loudly told the Israeli personnel, speaking in English, in the crush to enter the building, which remains French territory under international treaties. “Go out — outside please!” he added in a raised voice in scenes captured in video footage that quickly spread on social media. The Roman Catholic church, located at the start of Via Dolorosa in the Old City’s Muslim Quarter, has been part of France’s territories in the Holy Land since the 1850s. The rules that have been in place “for centuries”, Macron told the Israeli officers, “will not change with me, I can tell you, OK? So everybody, respect the rules.” Macron will on Thursday attend a ceremony to commemorate the liberation 75 years ago of Nazi Germany’s Auschwitz death camp in what was then occupied Poland.

Wednesday’s tense scenes recalled a 1996 Jerusalem visit by late former president Chirac during which he also lost his cool with Israeli security agents who were pressing him to move on.

Chirac heatedly told them their actions were a “provocation” and angrily asked: “What do you want? Me to go back to my plane and go back to France, is that what you want?”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/macron-loses-cool-with-israeli-security-in----chirac-moment---.html

203,23-1-20,Mathews 200* hurt Zimbabwe,"Angelo Mathews struck his highest Test score with an unbeaten double century on Wednesday as Sri Lanka left Zimbabwe battling to save the series opener going into the final day at Harare.

Former skipper Mathews eclipsed his previous Test best of 160 and finished 200 not out after a marathon knock spanning 468 balls, as Sri Lanka declared their first innings on 515 for nine.

Zimbabwe, playing their first Test since November 2018, ended the fourth day on 30 without loss and trailing by 127 runs after Brian Mudzinganyama was drafted in as a concussion substitute for opener Kevin Kasuza.

Debutant Kasuza, who made 63 in the first innings, suffered a delayed concussion after he took a blow to the helmet while fielding at short leg on Tuesday.

Mudzinganyama became the fourth Zimbabwean to make his Test debut in this match. He was unbeaten on 14 with Prince Masvaure 15 not out at stumps.

The 32-year-old Mathews brought up his 10th Test century, his first since December 2018, in the morning session and steadily added to his total with considerable support from Dhananjaya de Silva and Niroshan Dickwella.

De Silva and Dickwella both scored 63 but two quick wickets for Sikandar Raza, who finished with three for 62, hastened the declaration as Mathews reached 200 with a sweep to the square leg boundary.

With one day remaining, the visitors appear the only team capable of victory although the pitch looks likely to have the final say.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mathews-200--hurt-zimbabwe.html
204,23-1-20,Southee ‘looking forward’ to India series,"New Zealand’s veteran seamer Tim Southee is “looking forward” to the India challenge, leaving behind the disappointment of being dropped for the final Test of Australia series earlier this month.

“It’s about making that adjustment. What’s gone is gone and it was very disappointing, the guys would have learnt from it, and now we’ve got to look forward to the Indian series,” Southee was quoted as saying by stuff.Co.Nz.

Then, coach Gary Stead had said it was felt Henry would offer more pace than Southee.

But the 31-year-old is expected to lead the New Zealand attack when the five-match Twenty20 series against India starts at Eden Park on Friday.

He admitted he was disappointed not to have played in Sydney but said he has moved on.

“It’s disappointing. You’re gutted every time you’re left out.

206,23-1-20,Laporte surprised to be back in action,"Manchester City defender Aymeric Laporte admits he has returned from his serious knee injury earlier than he expected.

The Frenchman was a surprise inclusion in Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up against Sheffield United, having not been involved with the first team for almost five months.

He required surgery after suffering a knee injury during City’s home win against Brighton on August 31.

Laporte’s comeback in the 1-0 win for City at Bramall Lane lasted 78 minutes and he is now looking forward to the rest of the season.

“Normally it would have been later but I spoke with the manager and tried today (Tuesday) and he told me I would play so I am very happy to be back as soon as possible and have minutes and help the team,” said Laporte.

“It was very important for me to try to be with the team, to be involved. It was a good test of fitness. The game was difficult because they are very strong, a good team.”

“It was difficult for me (being out), my team-mates see me suffering,” he added. “But now I can help the team out and give my best.”

City have had problems at the back in Laporte’s absence and his return helped City record their first clean sheet in any competition since December 29.

After the match, Guardiola admitted his team had missed the 25-year-old and described him as the best left-sided central defender in the world.

Laporte said: “It’s great to hear that from this manager as he is one of the best in the world, if not the best. I am very happy to hear that but I have to work to stay there and keep going.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/laporte-surprised-to-be-back-in-action.html

The fifth seeded Saina lost to unseeded Kjaersfeldt 13-21, 21-17, 15-21 in a hard fought 47-minute contest. World number 18 Saina had a 4-0 head-to-head record against the number 29 Dane before Wednesday’s match.

With Saina’s defeat, India’s campaign came to an end in the BWF World Tour Super 300 event.

In the men’s singles, the trio of Kidambi Srikanth, Sameer Verma and H S Prannoy, too, faltered in the first round.

Verma lost to Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia 16-21, 15-21 in a 39-minute men’s singles match. The story went on similar lines for the fifth seeded Srikanth, who went down to Shesar Hiren Rhustavito of Indonesia 21-12, 14-21, 12-21, in a match that lasted 48 minutes.

208,23-1-20,Last gasp drama,"Ten-man Arsenal slowed Chelsea’s charge for a Champions League place on Tuesday as Manchester City kept up their distant pursuit of Liverpool with victory at Sheffield United on a dramatic evening of Premier League football.

Fourth-placed Chelsea twice took the lead against Arsenal, who were reduced to 10 men after former Blues defender David Luiz took out Tammy Abraham when he was through on goal.

Jorginho put Chelsea 1-0 ahead from the penalty spot in the 28th minute but Gabriel Martinelli equalised for Arsenal in the second half.

Cesar Azpilicueta put Chelsea 2-1 up with just six minutes remaining but Arsenal levelled only three minutes later through Hector Bellerin.

The 2-2 draw leaves Chelsea six points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United having played a game extra while Arsenal are in 10th spot, seemingly out of the running for a place in the top four.

Aguero spares blushes

Pep Guardiola’s City, with defender Aymeric Laporte back in the side, looked as though they might rue Gabriel Jesus’s squandered first-half penalty but their Argentine hitman Sergio Aguero came to the rescue.

Despite the 1-0 win, second-placed City remain 13 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, having played two games more, and their bid to defend their title appears hopeless.

City’s French central defender Laporte has been out of action since suffering a knee injury at the end of August and he was a surprise inclusion at Bramall Lane.

Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson denied Jesus from the penalty spot about 10 minutes from half-time after a foul on Riyad Mahrez.

But City made amends when substitute Sergio Aguero, on for Jesus, tapped in from Kevin De Bruyne’s cross in the 73rd minute.

Southampton’s 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace, thanks to goals from Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong, continued a remarkable turnaround for the club, who hit rock bottom earlier this season in a 9-0 defeat by Leicester.

Watford took the lead against Villa when Troy Deeney headed in Gerard Deulofeu’s cross but the home side hit back in the second half through Douglas Luiz.

Tyrone Mings scored a dramatic late winner for Villa deep into stoppage time to end Watford’s recent revival under Nigel Pearson.

Moise Kean scored his first goal for Everton since his arrival from Juventus in the 30th minute of their match against Newcastle and Dominic Calvert-Lewin doubled the lead in the second half.

Everton were cruising deep into stoppage time but threw away the three points, with Lejeune striking twice.

Bournemouth, who had lost their previous four matches, all against relegation rivals, beat Brighton 3-1 thanks to goals from Harry Wilson, an own goal from Pascal Gross and a second-half Callum Wilson effort.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/last-gasp-drama.html

210,23-1-20,Why not follow Vedas?,"What an astonishing preach exists in Vedas — Anti santamnajahati, Anti Santamnapashyati — which means that even though the soul of a human being is closest to god yet he can’t leave or see him. Indeed, soul can never be away from god at any time. This eternal fact is also stated in Yajurved mantra that god is near to yogis because they follow Vedas and practise Ashtang Yog, which let them feel god’s presence. On the contrary, god is not close to those who are sinners and against Vedas. He knows every pious and sinful deed of the soul and accordingly awards each person in the form of happiness or sorrows respectively.

If we deeply study Bhagwad Geeta under the guidance of acharya of Vedas, we find that Bhagwad Geeta at every step inspires readers to follow Vedas. Rigved mantra preaches that soul cannot destroy his sorrows and can never experience pleasure until he realises the presence of god, which can only be attained by following the Vedic path. Rigved mantra also preaches that without following the Vedic path no one can attain happiness.

Further, Samved mantra points that when an aspirant listens to Vedas from Brahma, he can actually feel the presence of god. But nowadays, it is sad that people misled by so-called saints. Hence, there occurs a problem. We must thank god that he mercifully has enlightened all human-beings with knowledge of four Vedas to feel his presence and to destroy all sorrows of life. It becomes our utmost duty, which is entrusted on us by god himself that we follow the Vedic path. Otherwise peace cannot be maintained among public.

The knowledge of Vedas emanates directly from god and like god it neither gets destroyed nor becomes old. It is immortal and has been preached by god to us to attain salvation. Nowadays people don’t pay attention to invaluable Vedic knowledge. As a result, they get stressed, dishonour women, thefts increase and many such problems arise.

It is mentioned in Ramayana that earlier daily Vedic preach and agnihotra was performed in every house. As a result, there was no man or woman who was affected with vices like anger, greed, meanness and many others. So during those days there was no question of insulting women or disgracing their honour which is observed nowadays. Why can’t Vedic atmosphere be everywhere now?

Manusmriti shlok and Bhagwad Geeta shlok state that all karmas or rather duties emanate from Vedas and they emanate from god. So why don’t we follow the Vedas to destroy corruption and sins from the society?

This fact is very well clarified in Rigved mantra that the human-life only achieves its motto when a it attains salvation along with pious worldly pleasure.

211,23-1-20,History repeats itself,"In 1969, history was written in the Punjabi film industry with the release of Nanak Naam Jahaz Hai. New records were created at the box office, which were never broken. People removed shoes before entering theatres. The film was an unprecedented hit across the globe.

After breaking all box office records, the film went on to win the coveted “National Award” too! Now after 50 years of its release, producers Maann Singh Deep and Kalyani Singh are going to produce a new film under the same title Nanak Naam Jahaz Hai. Before becoming films producers, Maann and Kalyani were famous journalists.

Talking about his thought behind making this film, Maann said that at a time, when people are spreading hate in the name of religion, caste, language and colour, he wanted to make a film which depicts compassion, love and true faith in god.

“Whenever I can’t seek solutions for my problems, I go to the Gurudwara to stay calm. I love the shabads recited there. Sikhism preaches love for mankind, irrespective of religion, caste, language and colour. “When I read the writings of Guru Nanak Dev ji, I was lost in the magic of Gurbani. Every word was so pure and touching, (The only holy book that has great writings of six gurus and saints of all religions) that I wanted to spread this message of faith and love all across,” said he.

He feels that the best way to spread this message was through a film because he has a deep understanding of it.

“Initially, I discussed the idea with my wife Kalyani Singh who is a writer-director and has avid knowledge of Sikhism. She loved this idea and came out with a beautiful story,” said Maann.

It took them a while to get to this title but they feel that Baba Nanak blessed them with it. They worked on the story till the time they were convinced that it was perfect to plan a film. They went on to hire the best people who could execute this task. “We were not looking for the perfect team only from the commercial point of view but we also wanted the team which believed in the spiritual and social teachings of Guru Nanak, fit perfectly to the characters of our story and join us not as professional actors or technicians but as a member of our mission,” he said.

The shooting lasted for 42 days in various parts of Punjab including Golden temple at Amritsar. “I hope this film will be remembered as one of the best devotional and social films,” he added.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/history-repeats-itself.html
212,23-1-20,Lightning quick,"Rana’s unbeaten 68-ball 105 helps Delhi beat Vidarbha by 6 wickets in 347 run chase

Nitish Rana played the “best knock” of his first-class career as Delhi shocked defending champions Vidarbha by six wickets in an incredible final day run chase in the Ranji Trophy here on Wednesday.

With this memorable run chase on day four, Delhi handed Vidarbha their first outright defeat in a first class game after three years.

Chasing 347, Rana, who has made a name with his big-hitting exploits in the IPL, smashed an unbeaten 105 off only 68 balls as Delhi reached the target in 73 overs, leaving Vidarbha gutted.

Delhi now have 16 points and stay in hunt for a quarterfinal berth while Vidarbha stay put on 17 points.

The chase was set up by openers Kunal Chandela (75 off 146) and Hiten Dalal (82 off 146) with a steady stand of 163 in under 49 overs.

The left-handed Rana then took charge and sent the Vidarbha bowlers including fancied Umesh Yadav (0/85 in 19 overs) on a leather hunt with eight fours and seven sixes.

“I had promised our coach (KP) Bhaskar sir that if its 75 overs and around 320 runs, we will win. This is the best first class knock that I have played. I haven’t forgotten the 2017 final in Indore, which Vidarbha won without playing outstanding cricket.

“I knew I can hit their spinners out of the ground,” Rana told reporters having ripped opposition off-spinner Akshay Wakhare (64 off 9 overs) with slog sweeps, cuts and drives.

Vidarbha coach Chandrakant Pandit took a gamble with a sporting declaration but it backfired as a side with its back to the wall produced the best performance of the season.

Openers Kunal and Hiten played confidently without taking pressure on an eased out track.

Once Rana came in, Vidarbha sensing danger, deployed a negative field ‘7-2’ (seven on the off side) field.

Their pacers Rajneesh Gurbani (0/64 in 12 overs) started bowling on an imaginary seventh off stump line.

The umpires started calling no ball and then Delhi started attacking as they were forced to change the line.

“I knew they would bowl negative line but what I didn’t like was time wasting tactic. Once they started bowling within the stumps, I knew I will blast them if it’s in my arc,” said KKR’s dependable middle-order batsman.

“This is my natural game and I don’t like advise if people come and tell me to change my mindset. I only welcome advise when I need them,” he said.

Maiden triple hundred

Mumbai: Staying true to his words, young Sarfaraz Khan stuck his maiden triple hundred to single-handedly give Mumbai the crucial first-innings lead and grab three points on the last day of their Elite Group B match against Uttar Pradesh.

Uttar Pradesh had posted a humongous 625/8 declared in their first-essay courtesy wicket-keeper Upendra Yadav’s unbeaten maiden double-ton.

But Sarfaraz’s (301 not out off 391 balls; 30x4; 8x6) herculean task overshadowed Yadav’s double-ton on a flat track, which had absolutely nothing for the bowlers even on the final day.

Right-handed Sarfaraz was the cynosure of all eyes at the Wankhede Stadium, as he batted for as long as 633 minutes and hammered 30 fours and eight sixes.

What is more special about his knock is that the pint-sized batsman was suffering from fever two nights ago, but he came out to bat and did the job for his team.

Sarfaraz, who had played for Uttar Pradesh and returned to Mumbai, had all shots in the book.

But more importantly, contrary to his style, he showed restraint and respected the good balls.

Sarfaraz, in the process, became the seventh Mumbai batsman to score a triple ton in first-class cricket and joined the illustrious list comprising Wasim Jaffer (301 and 314 not out), Rohit Sharma (309 not out), Ajit Wadekar (323), Sunil Gavaskar (340), Vijay Merchant (359 not out) and Sanjay Manjrekar (377).

The hosts resumed the final day on overnight score of 353/5 needing 273 more runs to overhaul Uttar Pradesh’s first innings total, with 22-year-old Sarfaraz unbeaten on 132 in company of his skipper Aditya Tare, who was unbeaten on 9.

Sarfaraz first got able support from Tare (97 off 144 balls, 14x4) and then Shams Mulani (65 off 82 balls; 5x3; 1x6), as they took the game away from Uttar Pradesh.

While Sarfaraz and Tare added 179 runs for the sixth wicket, he and Mulani added 150 runs for the seventh wicket and it was their partnership that ensured Mumbai crossed Uttar Pradesh’s first-innings total.

Sarfaraz, who had completed his individual 250, took a single, as Mumbai surpassed Uttar Pradesh’s mammoth total and celebrated like the team had won the match.

Then Mumbai allowed Sarfaraz to complete a well- deserved 300.

He completed his triple ton with a six over wide long on, after which the match was called off.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lightning-quick.html

214,23-1-20,Tri-series before WC will help in team composition: Smriti,"Playing in a tri-nation tournament before the Women’s World T20 will help in strategising and team composition, senior India player Smriti Mandhana said on Wednesday.

The marquee event will start in Australia next month but before that, the country is hosting India and England in a tri-series. “Most of them have played in Australia, I think India A touring Australia last month is also going to be a big help (as) four-five players were part of that team as well,” Mandhana told reporters.

She added, “The tri-series is going to be a really important tournament, thinking about the team composition or what is needed or what target we need to aim at on Australian wickets.”

The left-handed batswoman said the tri-series matches could tell them a lot about what will be a safe target during the World Cup. “How can our bowlers plan better, all those things we are going to understand once we land in Australia and play the tri-series.

“Specially the targets, tri-series will define the targets, like what the scoreline will be for the World Cup.

“England, Australia and India is always going (to be challenging). We are going to aim at good targets so I think that (tri-series) is an important tournament leading up to the World Cup,” the 23-year-old said.

According to Mandhana, the team has been thinking about the WorldT20 for the past one year.

“Last one year, whatever we were doing during the matches, we were thinking about the World Cup, so finally we are leaving for the World Cup, it is quite exciting.

“I’m looking forward to playing this World Cup with this team as it is a new team with a mixture of experienced and new players,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tri-series-before-wc-will-help-in-team-composition--smriti.html
215,23-1-20,"Shaw, Samson celebrate senior team call up","The in-form Prithvi Shaw flourished yet again as India A notched up a convincing five-wicket victory over New Zealand A in the first unofficial ODI here on Wednesday.

A day after being picked as the injured Shikhar Dhawan’s replacement in India’s ODI squad for the assignment against New Zealand’s senior team, the 20-year-old Shaw smashed 48 off 35 balls to lay the foundation for the visiting team’s chase.

Wicketkeeper Sanju Samson, who replaced Dhawan in India’s T20 squad, blazed away to a 21-ball 39, while Suryakumar Yadav hammered 35 off a mere 19 deliveries.

Chasing 231 after opting to field, India completed the task with more than 20 overs to spare at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval.

With the ball, Mohammed Siraj was the most successful bowler for India A, picking up three wickets for 33 runs in 6.3 overs, while there were two wickets apiece for Khaleel Ahmed and Axar Patel.

Their efforts helped India A bowl out New Zealand A for 230 with nine balls to spare in the 50-over match.

Quite a few home team players got off the blocks easily but could not go on to make substantial contributions. Rachin Ravindra top-scored with 49 off 58 balls and skipper Tom Bruce made 47 off 55.

India A got their chase off to a brisk start with Shaw and his opening partner Mayank Agarwal (29) picking the gaps at will.

The visitors had raced to 79 in 9.1 overs when Shaw fell to James Neesham. The 20-year-old Shaw, who came into the match after a 100-ball 150 in a practice game, hit five fours and three sixes.

Captain Shubman Gill (30) got out after getting his eye in and after that, Samson showed his prowess, smoking two maximums and three boundaries.

Mumbai player Suryakumar, who can also use the big handle to good effect, struck three fours and two sixes to take his team close to victory.

Vijay Shankar (20) and Krunal Pandya (13) then got the job done as India A took lead in the three-match series.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shaw--samson-celebrate-senior-team-call-up.html

The lively 19-year-old is also striving to hone her backfoot skills ahead of the marquee event, starting in Australia next month.

“I’m working more on my back foot, developing my back foot more and trying to increase my bat speed. Because looking at my size, you can make out I don’t have that much strength to hit the sixes ... But I’ve been working on that for quite some time,” said Jemimah in a Road To The T20 World Cup podcast.

Since making her international debut in 2018, she has consistently put in commendable performances to established herself as a key member of the team.

India take on defending champions Australia in the opening game of the tournament in Sydney on February 21, and the youngster believes her side will have to be mentally strong against the hosts.

“I think when it comes to Australia, you got to be the best or you can’t play. That’s the kind of team they are. My favourite team to play against is also Australia. It’s more of a mind game than just skills (when you play them on the field),” Jemimah said.

Jemimah, who will be playing her first World Cup, is looking forward to play in the final of the tournament, which will mark an important milestone in her life.

“I can’t put it in words, how important it will be for me to be a part of the Indian team that plays in a World Cup final. It’s quite exciting. I’m really looking forward to it,” she said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/jemi-working-on-increasing-bat-speed-to-hit-big-shots.html
217,23-1-20,Lyon down Lille on penalties,"Lyon beat Lille on penalties after a dramatic 2-2 draw at the Groupama Stadium on Tuesday to reach their sixth French League Cup final, setting up a possible clash with record eight-time winners Paris Saint-Germain.

Renato Sanches dragged what proved to be the last penalty of the shootout wide to send Lyon through.

This is the final season of the League Cup after the French league voted to suspend the competition from next term to ease fixture congestion.

Lyon will bid to lift the trophy for the second time when they take on the winner of second semi-final between Reims and PSG on April 4 at the Stade de France.

Portugal midfielder Sanches gave visitors Lille a 13th-minute lead with a low left-footed strike from outside the area to score his second goal for the club since joining from Bayern last August.

But the hosts were gifted a way back into the game four minutes later when centre-back Gabriel handled inside the area.

Moussa Dembele drilled the spot-kick into the top corner to grab his sixth goal in five games.

Houssem Aouar appeared to have fired Lyon into the final with a fine long-range strike with five minutes remaining.

There was another twist in the tale, though, as despite a lengthy delay for a VAR review, Lille were awarded an injury-time penalty for what appeared to be an excellent tackle by former Manchester United full-back Rafael on Jonathan Bamba.

Loic Remy, on as a 78th-minute substitute, stepped up with a cool Panenka finish down the middle of the goal to force more spot-kicks.

But Ciprian Tatarusanu, playing in place of usual Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, saved Bamba’s opening penalty before Sanches’ miss sealed Lille’s fate.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/lyon-down-lille-on-penalties.html

""On 23rd January 1897, Janakinath Bose wrote in his diary, 'A son was born at midday.'

219,23-1-20,"Always maintained CM is supreme, he can take away or divide any dept: Vij","Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Thursday said he has always maintained that the chief minister is supreme and can take away or divide any department, hours after he was stripped of the charge of CID.

The portfolio of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has been allocated to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, a Haryana government statement said here on late Wednesday night.

""Governor of Haryana, on the advice of the chief minister, has allocated some new portfolios to the chief minister and to two ministers. As per a notification issued by the chief secretary, the portfolios of the Criminal Investigation Department, and the departments of Personnel and Training and of Raj Bhawan Affairs have been allocated to the chief minister, Manohar Lal, in addition to his existing portfolios, with immediate effect,"" the statement said.

Apart from this, the portfolio of Elections has been allocated to Transport Minister Mool Chand Sharma while the portfolio of Art and Cultural Affairs, hitherto allocated to Sharma, has been allocated to Education Minister Kanwar Pal, in addition to their existing portfolios.

""Thus, the home minister, Anil Vij, will cease to hold the portfolio of Criminal Investigation Department and the transport minister, Mool Chand Sharma, will cease to hold the portfolio of Art and Cultural Affairs,"" the statement said.

When asked to comment on being stripped of the charge of CID department, Vij told PTI, ""I have always maintained chief minister is supreme and he can take away or divide any department.""

He declined to comment on the matter any further.

Earlier, Vij had said that there were no differences between them and the chief minister was his ""best friend"".

Vij, who had expressed unhappiness over not being briefed or given feedback by the CID, appeared satisfied and said on Wednesday, ""Today was the first time that an SP-rank officer briefed me. Now he will be briefing me daily.""

His comments came after the Bharatiya Janata Party said the differences between Khattar and Vij over the CID's control have been resolved.

""The issue has been resolved. The chief minister is the head of the government and he can keep whatever (departments) he wants to have,"" BJP general secretary Anil Jain told PTI.

The Haryana home minister in an informal chat with the media on Wednesday evening said, ""The chief minister is my best friend. I never had any differences with him. I had some issues with the (CID) department but that too have been resolved.""

However, Vij said, there was no going back on the demand of disciplinary action against the state chief of the agency.

The minister has demanded that state CID chief Anil Rao, who is an ADGP-rank officer, be replaced with Shrikant Jadhav, another senior IPS officer, after charging the former with ""disobedience and negligent behaviour in official duty"".

Vij also refuted media reports that he had aired grievances pertaining to the CID issue with newly-appointed BJP president J P Nadda when he went to congratulate him in Delhi.

""There was no talk on this issue. I had gone to congratulate him,"" Vij said.

Rising tensions between the minister and the state CID chief had triggered a tug-of-war between Vij and the chief minister over the control of the department.

Khattar recently said the CID remained under the chief minister's control during the terms of Bansi Lal and Devi Lal, an assertion that appeared to counter the home minister's claim over the department.

Khattar, however, sought to downplay the row.

Vij had taken exception to two state government websites showing the CID was held by Khattar.

""Governments are not run by websites. They are run by the rule of law,"" Vij had said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/always-maintained-cm-is-supreme--he-can-take-away-or-divide-any-dept--vij-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/always-maintained-cm-is-supreme--he-can-take-away-or-divide-any-dept--vij.html

222,23-1-20,"Resolutions against CAA 'political gesture', states hardly Have any role: Shashi Tharoor","Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that bringing in resolutions against the CAA is more of a ""political gesture"" by the states as they hardly have any role in granting citizenships.

In an interview to PTI, the lawmaker said that in the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed nationwide NRC, the states will have a vital part as it will be their officials who will conduct the exercise because the Centre doesn't have the required manpower.

""That's more of a political gesture. The citizenship is given by the federal government only and obviously no states can give citizenship, so it has nothing for them to implement or not implement,"" Tharoor said.

""They (the states) can pass a resolution or go to the court but in practice what can they do? The state governments can't say they won't implement CAA, what they can say is they will not implement NPR-NRC as they will have a crucial role in it,"" he added.

Tharoor's party colleague Kapil Sibal raised a storm last week by saying there is no way a state can deny the implementation of the CAA when it has already been passed by Parliament. Later, he termed it ""unconstitutional"" and clarified there was no change in his stance.

Punjab, where the Congress is in power, passed a resolution against the CAA last week. It also supported a similar move by the Left government in Kerala. In West Bengal as well, Tharoor's party has been demanding an anti-CAA resolution, which will be brought in by Mamata Banerjee's government on January 27.

The Congress has hinted that it may pass similar resolutions in other states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh where it is in power.

Maintaining that the Supreme Court not directing a stay on the Citizenship Amendment Act has ""not at all diluted"" the protests against it, Tharoor welcomed the top court's decision to set up a five-judge constitution bench.

""This Act by naming religions in relation to citizenship has violated the Constitution... But at least the five-judge constitution bench will hear all the arguments and look into the merits of it. That's the only way we can resolve the fundamental disagreement,"" he said.

""There are only two ways this law can be struck down -- one, if the Supreme court declares it unconstitutional and strikes it down and second, if the government itself revokes it. Now, the second option is not viable as the BJP would never accept its mistakes,"" said the Thiruvananthapuram MP who was in the city to take part in the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet.

He said the protests are largely spontaneous and if the government makes it clear that no religion is being targeted then many would lose their reason for protesting.

However, the diplomat-turned-politician said the government needs to do much more than just removing the religion clause in the CAA.

""It needs to say we will not ask questions about place of birth and citizenship and will not prepare the NRC,"" he said.

On the country's opposition, Tharoor said their unity has never been easy in Indian politics as many parties may have a similar stand at the Centre but may differ in the states.

""In my opinion, it would be simply better to present a united front to the nation rather than a divided front,"" he said, asserting that no one should feel threatened by the Congress.

Asked about the Gandhi family and the role of the present leadership in reviving the party, Tharoor said Congress is more than a family, and it is not only a major mass movement but also a set of coherent ideas.

""Yes, when we ask people to vote for Congress, some vote for the family, some vote for individuals, but above all they vote for a certain set of principles and convictions,"" he said.

Tharoor said the Congress stands for inclusiveness and is the only viable and reliable alternative to the ""divisive politics"" of the BJP.

""We have just lost the national elections. We have a four-and-quarter year to go before we can prove our qualities on the national stage. In the meantime, there are state elections... So there will be a constant opportunity for referendum against the BJP's non-performance,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/resolutions-against-caa--political-gesture---states-hardly---have-any-role--shashi-tharoor-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/resolutions-against-caa--political-gesture---states-hardly---have-any-role--shashi-tharoor.html

Kumars blunt remarks came two days after Varma, a former Rajya Sabha member, sent him a two-page letter on the issue and shared screenshots of the same on his official twitter handle and facebook profile despite it containing details of conversations the two were claimed to have had ""in private"".

Varma, who had sought ""ideological clarity"" from Kumar the JD(U)s national president had arrived in the city later in the day on a private visit during which he could not meet the chief minister but demanded from him ""a full statement"" on CAA-NPR-NRC in view of the country-wide movement against the same.

Kumar made the comment when mediapersons approached him at the historic Gandhi Maidan here, where he had come to attend a function organized on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses birth anniversary.

""He (Varma) is a scholarly person for whom I have enormous, personal respect. But the types of statements he has been giving.. It has left me flabbergasted,"" he said.

""There should be no confusion on the stand taken by the Janata Dal (United) on issues. Our stand is always very clear.

""But if he had any reservations, he could have expressed the same in a party forum. And the reference to conversations made in private! Would I ever go public with what he has said to me in private"", Kumar said with obvious displeasure.

""Nonetheless, I have lots of respect for him. He can go wherever he likes"", Kumar said with smile on his lips, concealing the bitterness caused by the recent development.

This is the first time that the Bihar chief minister has chosen to speak about voices of dissent emerging from his party in the wake of the JD(U)s decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament in the winter session, less than a year after having opposed the same.

Besides Varma, poll strategist-turned-JD(U) vice president Prashant Kishor has also been venting displeasure over the party's stand on the contentious law.

Varma, in his letter, had written in detail about the views claimed to have been expressed by Kumar during their ""private"" conversations about ""divisive"" agenda of BJP, the leadership of Narendra Modi, who had become a polarizing figure in the wake of post-Godhra riots and reminded him of his past efforts at making an ""RSS mukt bharat"".

Varma also wrote about Kumar having complained that ""the current leadership in the BJP has humiliated him and expressed a ""personal"" view that there was need for ""democratic and socialist forces"" to ""regroup"" against the saffron party and also about having ""actually assigned a senior party official"" the task.

Varma, who had resigned from the Indian Foreign Service in 2013 to take over as the chief ministers culture adviser and got elected to the Rajya Sabha for a two-year period in 2014, had questioned the partys decision to take its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar by contesting the Delhi assembly polls in alliance.

He had cited the example of the Shiramoni Akali Dal, one of the BJPs oldest allies, which has declined to contest elections in the national capital despite a sizeable population of Sikhs following differences with the saffron party over non-inclusion of Muslims in the CAA

A number of clubs are reportedly keen on signing Cavani, who has scored a club-record 198 goals for PSG and whose contract expires in the summer. Atletico appear to be the 32-year-old’s preferred choice but the La Liga outfit and PSG are yet to agree a fee.

“I would like him to play there, (Atletico coach Diego) Simeone wants him now,” Cavani’s father Luis told Spanish progamme El Chiringuito.

“I think there is a strong chance he will go to Atletico. There is also the option to join the club in June. There are lots of other clubs interested but when you give your word to a team, you respect it.

“If he is allowed to leave tomorrow and Atletico still want him, I think he will sign. He is a player who needs time to play. PSG are treating him unfairly.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---strong-chance----cavani-will-join-atletico.html
226,23-1-20,Osaka sets Coco crunch,"Defending champion will take on American prodigy in mouth-watering third round fixture

Fifteen-year-old prodigy Coco Gauff set up an Australian Open blockbuster with defending champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday, as a pumped-up Serena Williams took another step towards a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title.

On a day when men’s seeds tumbled, Serbia’s Novak Djokovic strode into the third round to be joined by Roger Federer, who dismissed Filip Krajinovic 6-1, 6-4, 6-1.

American teenager Gauff, showing a tenacity which is becoming her trademark, clawed her way back from a set down to beat the experienced Sorana Cirstea 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.

Gauff, who screamed and pumped her fists as she completed her victory, said her “will to win” had got her through the tough second-round match at a windswept Melbourne Park.

“My parents always told me you can always come back — no matter what the score is,” said Gauff, who beat seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams in round one.

Gauff also beat Williams on her Grand Slam debut last year at Wimbledon, and in another quirk, she faced Osaka in the US Open third round, going down meekly in straight sets.

Japan’s 22-year old Osaka, beat China’s Zheng Saisai 6-2, 6-4 but briefly lost her cool mid-match, hurling and kicking her racquet when she gave up a break in the second set.

“I was thinking that I really don’t want to play a third set this time,” explained Osaka, who is defending a Grand Slam title for the second time.

Former world number one Wozniacki, playing her final tournament before retiring, came from behind in both sets for a 7-5, 7-5 win over Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine.

Serena Williams shouted at the top of her voice during a testing second set against 70th-ranked Tamara Zidansek, before seeing off break points to win 6-2, 6-3.

“She was a really good fighter — she did not just let me win,” said Williams, who can equal Margaret Court’s all-time mark of 24 Grand Slams if she lifts the trophy.

Wind ‘massive factor’

Earlier, Australia’s world number one Ashleigh Barty raced through 6-1, 6-4 against Polona Hercog, buoying hopes of a first home winner since 1978.

“It was very different end to end, I think the wind was a massive factor particularly with the new ball,” she said.

Djokovic also weathered the breeze — which followed heavy rain on Monday, and smog from bushfires last week — to beat Japanese wildcard Tatsuma Ito 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in 95 minutes.

“They were tough conditions, pretty windy and it was hard to know where the balls were going. My serve helped a lot to get me out of trouble,” said the Serb.

Federer was barely detained by Krajinovic, the world number 41, as he moved smoothly through in 92 minutes in the night match on Rod Laver Arena.

In other results, Petra Kvitova, last year’s runner-up, came through 7-5, 7-5 against Paula Badosa of Spain, and China’s Zhang Shuai ousted American Caty McNally 6-2, 6-4.

Former US Open champion Marin Cilic won a five-setter against French seed Benoit Paire, and one-time semi-finalist Milos Raonic beat Chile’s Christian Garin in straights.

Also, Tennys Sandgren took the biggest scalp when he ousted eighth seed Matteo Berrettini in five sets.

Sandgren’s fellow American Tommy Paul also pulled off a five-set upset when he beat Bulgarian 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4, 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (10/3).

And Australia’s John Millman further trimmed the number of high-ranked players when he ended the campaign of Polish 31st seed Hubert Hurkacz.

But Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was handed a slice of fortune when Philipp Kohlschreiber withdrew injured.

Among eight first-round matches held over from Tuesday, after rain wiped out half of Monday’s schedule, Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro, also retiring this year, upset Belarusian 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/osaka-sets-coco-crunch-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/osaka-sets-coco-crunch.html

228,23-1-20,Injured Sania exits Australian Open with calf injury,"Sania Mirza's first Grand Slam outing after maternity leave ended with an early exit as the Indian ace retired mid-way into her women's doubles first-round match due to a calf injury, here on Thursday.

Sania and her Ukrainian partner Nadiia Kichenok, who came into the major after winning the doubles title at the Hobart International, were trailing 2-6 0-1 against the Chinese team of Xinyun Han and Lin Zhu when the Indian called it quits.

Sania has injured her leg during practice. She is returning to the circuit after a two-year break.

Her right calf strapped heavily, Sania struggled to move freely on the court. It also affected her serve.

Kichenok was also struggling at the net, often missing easy put-away volleys.

Serving at 2-4, Sania was broken by the Chinese and they served out the set easily.

The Indian took a medial timeout after the first set. Soon after, the Indo-Ukrainian pair was broken in the first game of the second set and Sania found it difficult to continue.

Sania had also pulled out of the mixed doubles event, forcing compatriot Rohan Bopanna to pair with Kichenok.

Also representing India in the mixed doubles is veteran Leander Paes, who has teamed up with Jelena Ostapenko, who had won 2017 French Open.

230,23-1-20,"In next ten days, 5,000 more Shaheen Baghs across country: Azad","In the next 10 days, there will be 5,000 more protest sites like Shaheen Bagh across the country, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said on Wednesday evening as he reached the iconic demonstration spot in south Delhi to extend his support to the women protesting against CAA and NRC.

Addressing a massive gathering, the Dalit leader said the Citizenship Amendment Act is a ""black law"" that is dividing people on religious lines.

""I congratulate those who have participated in this protest. This is not just a political agitation. We have to save the Constitution and unity of the nation,"" he told the women who have been staging a sit-in against the CAA for more than a month now.

Azad said even the record-breaking cold has not been able to break the will power of the women protesters.

The crowd, singing Faiz Ahmed Faiz's Urdu poem 'Hum Dekhnege' before Azad's arrival, got charged as he reached the venue.

Holding the Constitution, he said, ""I promise you that in next 10 days there will be at least 5,000 Shaheen Baghs across the country"".

Azad said that earlier everyone had heard about Jallianwala Bagh, but now they were talking about Shaheen Bagh. ""If you have the courage of sacrifice, then you have to sacrifice with holding your demonstration peacefully,"" he said.

""Till the Bhim Army is here, this law would not be applicable and they have to go through my corpse (to implement it),"" Azad said.

""The court is saying that we should respect our Prime Minister. I do and and I will do because the constitution says this. But the Prime Minister also needs to respect the constitution of this country,"" he said.

The protesters hailed Azad and raised slogans in his support.

He said when he was in Tihar jail, he read the newspapers to know about the situation of women sitting on protest at Shaheen Bagh.

His visit to Shaheen Bagh comes a day after a Delhi court modified the conditions imposed on him while granting him bail. He was arrested last month for giving ""inflammatory speeches"" during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid here.

The court allowed him to visit Delhi for medical reasons and election purposes. It also directed Azad to register his presence to the Station House Officer (SHO) of Fatehpur police station in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, every Saturday for four weeks and on the last Saturday of every month.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-next-ten-days--5-000-more-shaheen-baghs-across-country--azad-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/in-next-ten-days--5-000-more-shaheen-baghs-across-country--azad.html
231,23-1-20,World's most important human rights law: Roopa Ganguly on CAA,"Accusing the opposition parties of trying to mislead people, BJP MP Roopa Ganguly said that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) should be regarded as the world's most important human rights law.

Winding up her two-day Odisha visit, the actor- turned-politician said that the CAA will not take away anyone's citizenship.

""In no way, the CAA will have any adverse impact on Indian citizens. Opposition parties are spreading lies and misleading people for narrow political purpose,"" she said.

Ganguly, who met refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan settled in Malkangiri and neighbouring Nabarangpur districts during her visit, was addressing a meeting organised by the BJP in support of the CAA on Wednesday.

""Despite all hue and cry over the issue, the fact remains that the CAA symbolises humanism. It can be described as the most important human rights law in the world. It aims at giving citizenship to people who come here after being tortured and harassed,"" the Rajya Sabha member from West Bengal said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/world-s-most-important-human-rights-law--roopa-ganguly-on-caa-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/world-s-most-important-human-rights-law--roopa-ganguly-on-caa.html
232,23-1-20,"AAP, Kejriwal 'humiliating' Purvanchalis by mocking 'Rinkiya Ke Papa': Manoj Tiwari","The AAP and its chief Arvind Kejriwal mocking 'Rinkiya Ke Papa' song are ""insulting"" Purvanchalis and their culture, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said.

The Purvanchalis, natives of Eastern UP and parts of Bihar living in Delhi, are not going to be swayed by Kejriwal government's water and power freebies and 98 per cent of them are supporting the BJP, Tiwari said in an interview to the PTI.

Kejriwal had in recent past took a dig at Tiwari, a well known Bhojpuri actor, referring to him as a ""good singer"" who rendered 'Rinkiya Ke Papa', when asked for his views about Delhi BJP president.

""The Purvanchalis will support the BJP in Delhi elections because Kejriwal and his party have been 'humiliating' them and their culture more than once,"" he said.

The name ""Rinkiya"" in the song refers to daughters. By, mocking the song, the AAP and Kejriwal also ""demean"" the role of daughters and women in the society, he asserted.

""I pity his (Kejriwal) intelligence. At a time when 'Beti Bachao' is being talked about in the country, he is mocking fathers having daughter. 'Rinkiya Ke Papa' is just a song... Rinkiya symbolises daughters, is it a curse to have a daughter ?,"" Tiwari asked.

Kejriwal also ""humiliated"" the Purvanchalis over the issue of national register of citizens (NRC), and also by saying that they come to the city for better treatment at Delhi government hospitals, he said.

""He (Kejriwal) and his party say if NRC is implemented in Delhi, Manoj Tiwari and Purvanchalis will have to leave the city. They say Purvanchalis buy Rs 500 ticket to come to Delhi for treatment at Delhi government hospitals and then go back to their home. Now, they are ridiculing me for my song Rinkiya Ke Papa,"" the BJP leader said.

Tiwari asserted the BJP will form next government in Delhi and party's Chief Minister will be decided by its MLAs.

""The BJP will win a minimum of 45 seats, as is reflected in our surveys and public feedback. AAP and Kejriwal often talk about BJP's chief ministerial candidate which means they acknowledge our victory. As regards our Chief Minister, the party MLAs will decide if we form government in Delhi,"" he said.

Delhi people will vote for ""peace and safety"" rather than for those backing protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said.

""Delhi people do not want violence, they do not want the AAP and Congress spreading anarchy on the roads of Shaheen bagh through distribution of money. They want a a safe Delhi, and the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will win the elections with a huge margin,"" Tiwari claimed.

Nobody is going to loose their citizenship due to the CAA, still protests, ""hooliganism and violence"" took place in Delhi, he said.

""Congress and AAP were equally behind this. We will go to people asking them if they want a safe Delhi, developed Delhi or this violence and anarchy, "" Tiwari said.

The elections will be on the plank of ""safety and development"" rather on the ""freebies"" of AAP government, Delhi BJP chief said.

""Free water and power supply is an illusion by the Kejriwal government. Considering the number of beneficiaries and quality, water supply is not free in Delhi.There is no scheme, no notification for free power supply and it was announced as a freebie before the polls in a hurry to lure voters,"" he charged.

The BJP that bagged just three of the 70 Assembly constituencies in last elections, has an uphill task ahead as it seeks to unseat the AAP that created history in Delhi winning 67 seats and forming government in 2015.

Voting for Assembly elections will be held on all the 70 seats on February 8.

233,23-1-20,More Shaheen Baghs coming up across country: Nandita Das,"Lauding the efforts of students and common people who have been protesting against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), actor Nandita Das said on Thursday that more places like Shaheen Bagh are coming up across the country.

Das also exhorted people to speak up against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""They (government) are asking those who have been living here for four generations to prove that they are Indians. This is very sad. I think everyone should speak up,"" she said on the sidelines of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF).

The actor said the protests against the CAA and the NRC are ""spontaneous"" and no political parties are involved in them.

""These are led by students and common people. The youth has created a hope in the country. Every other place is becoming a Shaheen Bagh now, and I think as human beings, we should speak up against these laws,"" Das said.

She emphasised that with the economic slowdown, growing unemployment rate, and now with the CAA and the NRC, the country has become a topic of discussion across the world as ""people are being divided on the basis of religion"".

""We haven't seen this kind of unemployment in possibly 50 years. The economy is going down. International newspapers are writing about what's happening. This is the first time that we are being divided on religious lines.

""Our Constitution has given us the right to equality. You may belong to any caste, gender or religion but you are equal under the Constitution. And if you believe in that equality, you wouldn't want to see any sort of segregation,"" Das said.

234,23-1-20,Death penalty is not open ended that can be challenged all the time by condemned prisoners: SC,"Observing that the ""finality"" of death sentence is extremely important, the Supreme Court on Thursday said condemned prisoners should not be under the impression that the death penalty remains ""open ended"" and can be challenged all the time by them.

In remarks that came against the backdrop of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape-murder case filing one petition after another leading to the delay in their hanging, the court stressed it has to act as per law and judges also have a duty towards the society and the victims to deliver justice.

The observations were made by a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices S A Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna while hearing the review pleas of a woman and her lover for killing seven members of her family including parents, two brothers and their wives and strangulating her 10-month-old nephew in Uttar Pradesh in 2008.

The bench reserved its verdict on their review pleas against its 2015 judgement upholding the death penalty to the two convicts.

""One cannot go on fighting endlessly for everything,"" it said.

""The finality of death sentence is extremely important and a condemned prisoner should not be under the impression, that the death sentence remains open ended and can be questioned by them all the time.""

The remarks came when senior advocates Anand Grover and Meenakshi Arora pleaded for leniency and commutation of the death penalty of Shabnam and her lover Saleem on the ground they be afforded an opportunity to reform themselves.

The plea was vehemently opposed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.

""A convict cannot seek mercy after killing his parents that oh ho, now I have become an orphan,"" said Mehta, who appeared for the UP Government.

The law officer said that after convictions, a ground is being allowed to be taken that the death row convict has reformed himself or herself in jail then everybody will take that plea and it would open a new legal avenues for such condemned criminals.

The bench asked the lawyers to provide it the judgement on the issue whether the court is obliged to consider the plea of reformation for commuting the death penalty of the convicts post their convictions in heinous cases like the present one.

""Every criminal is said to have an innocent heart. However, we have to look into the crime also,"" the bench said when the ground of possible reformation of convicts was argued as one of the mitigating circumstances for commuting death penalty.

The bench said the scope of review plea was limited and the condemned prisoners were required to only show the ""error apparent on records"" of the apex court's earlier verdict.

""We do not like to emphasise only on the life and death penalty of an accused, especially when lives of seven people have been snuffed out in the present case,"" the bench said, adding ""The most important thing that we consider is sentencing should be proportionate to the crime.""

The bench was told by the lawyers for the convicts that they belong to a poor and uneducated background and moreover, they were first time criminals and hence be given an opportunity to reform.

It then referred to the sequence of events in the case and said the father of the woman convict was against her relationship with the co-convict and her lover and fights used to take place in the family on the issue.

In a pre-meditated manner the woman served the sedative-laced tea to all the seven family members and then her lover comes in the picture and inflicts fatal wounds on all of them by using an axe, the bench said.

""It is not the judge but the law that deals with a criminal. A judge, being a human being, cannot forgive a murderer. The law and the judge act for the society. Imagine a situation when a judge tells a murderer 'oh yes, I forgive you!'. Imagine the impact.""

The solicitor general then mentioned the plea of Ministry of Home Affairs, which was filed on Wednesday, and said the Centre is seeking modification of the 2014 directions to ensure that a 7-day deadline is fixed for execution of condemned prisoners after issuance of the black warrant.

The apex court had upheld the death sentence of the two convicts who are natives of Amroha in UP, in 2015.

In 2010, the Allahabad High Court upheld the death sentence awarded to the duo by a sessions court.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/death-penalty-is-not-open-ended-that-can-be-challenged-all-the-time-by-condemned-prisoners--sc-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/death-penalty-is-not-open-ended-that-can-be-challenged-all-the-time-by-condemned-prisoners--sc.html

238,23-1-20,"Akhilesh, Maya take up Shah gauntlet","SP, BSP chiefs accept CAA debate challenge; Owaisi asks HM to invite ‘daadhi wale’ also

In a new twist to the ongoing fracas over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati have accepted Home Minister Amit Shah’s challenge for debate on the CAA.

While Akhilesh is prepared for such an engagement while keeping economic slowdown and development as part of the package, Mayawati said her party is ready for a debate on the CAA on any platform.

Meanwhile, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi chipped in, telling Shah, “Daadhi wale se karo na” (debate with a bearded man).

Addressing a rally in support of the CAA in Lucknow on Tuesday, Shah had dared Opposition leaders like Mayawati, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav to debate with him on the law on a “sarvjanik manch” (public platform).

Picking up the challenge, Akhilesh said, “I’m ready for the debate on CAA. Ask them to fix a place or a forum, with their favorite channels and anchors, also for a debate on development. We Samajwadis are ready for it. But the BJP should also debate on the issues like economic slowdown, unemployment, poverty and death of people due to Government harassment.”

Accusing the BJP of discriminating on the basis of religion, Akhilesh said those who understand the soul of the country are opposed to the amended citizenship law. He also alleged the BJP is playing with the Constitution as it has majority in the Lok Sabha.

“I am glad that women have taken the lead and youth are protesting in large numbers,” Akhilesh said after garlanding a statue of SP leader Janeshwar Mishra at a park here on his death anniversary.

BSP chief Mayawati, who along with Akhilesh, had skipped the Opposition meeting in Delhi to oppose the CAA, on Wednesday said her party is ready for a debate on the CAA on any platform.

“The BSP is ready to accept the challenge thrown by the Central Government, which is troubled by the organised struggle and agitation all over the country against the most controversial CAA/NRC/NPR, especially by the youth and women, for a debate on the issue on any platform and anywhere,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.

Mayawati had obviously come under pressure to take an aggressive stance against the CAA after another Dalit leader Chandrasekhar Azad occupied centre stage in Delhi in mobilising protest against the CAA.

Meanwhile, asserting that Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar were against discrimination, the SP chief accused the BJP of practising discrimination on the basis of religion. “Every Indian is against it. Will they (the BJP) kill the soul of the country and create fissures in society for votes,” he said.

Accusing Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of using words like “thok diya jayega” in his speeches, he said, “This cannot be the language of a politician. “BJP used ‘kabristan and shamshan’ and ‘Diwali and Ramzan’ during poll rallies for the sake of votes.”

Speaking at a rally in Karimnagar district in Telangana, Owaisi wanted Shah to discuss the new law with him instead of others. “I am here.. Debate with me.. Why (debate) with these people… ‘Daadhi wale se karo na’ (Debate with a bearded man). We will talk and debate on CAA, NPR and NRC,” the leader of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen(AIMIM) said.

Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal has already challenged Shah for a debate while party colleague P Chidambaram asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi as to why he or his Government did not accept his suggestion of the PM holding an open debate with five critics of the amended Citizenship Act and let people draw their own conclusion.

“I had suggested that the PM should select five of the most articulate critics and hold a Q&A session with them. Why doesn’t the PM/Government accept the suggestion?

“Let five critics of CAA-NPR debate the PM. Let the event be televised live. And let the people draw their own conclusions,” he said on Twitter. In another tweet, he said, “HM (Home Minister) has dared the Opposition to debate CAA. Is that not what the Opposition, jurists, academics, writers, artists, students and youth have been doing since Dec 12?”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/akhilesh--maya-take-up-shah-gauntlet-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/akhilesh--maya-take-up-shah-gauntlet.html
239,23-1-20,Won’t stay CAA without hearing Centre: SC,"Govt gets four weeks to reply; 5-judge Bench to hear matter

The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Centre on pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act saying it will not issue any order to stay the Act without hearing the Government’s argument. The court gave the Government four weeks to respond. A five-judge Constitution Bench will hear the matter.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde restrained all high courts from hearing pleas on the CAA till it decides in the matter. As many as 143 petitioners have approached the SC on CAA questioning its constitutional validity.

The Bench, also comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna, said it will hear the petitions related to Assam and Tripura separately as the problem with the CAA in these two States is different from rest of the country.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for some petitioners, said the issue be referred to a Constitution Bench and the NPR exercise be postponed by a couple of months. He also urged the Bench to put on hold the operationalisation of the CAA.

Asserting that it will not pass any ex-parte order without hearing the Centre on staying the operation of the CAA and exercise of the National Population Register (NPR), the court said it will pass order on granting any interim relief to petitioner opposing the CAA after four weeks.

The petitions concerning Tripura and Assam as well as the matters related to Uttar Pradesh, which is going ahead with the implementation of the CAA without framing any rules, can be dealt with separately, the Bench said. It said the earlier cutoff date for citizenship in Assam was March 24, 1971 and noted that it has been extended till December 31, 2014 under the CAA.

The SC said it will decide in-chamber the modalities of hearing the batch of petitions on the CAA and may fix them for day-to-day hearing after four weeks.

Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, told the Bench the Government has been given copies of around 60 pleas out of the 143 petitions. He said it wanted time to respond to all the pleas.

Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA. Among those who have filed pleas are the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi.

The IUML said in its plea that the CAA violates the fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion.

The petition had alleged that the Government’s CAA was against the basic structure of the Constitution and intended to explicitly discriminate against Muslims as the Act extended benefits only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians.

The plea filed by Ramesh said the Act is a “brazen attack” on core fundamental rights envisaged under the Constitution and treats “equals as unequal”.

The other petitioners include the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the All Assam Students Union (AASU), the Peace Party, the CPI, NGOs Rihai Manch and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/won---t-stay-caa-without-hearing-centre--sc-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/won---t-stay-caa-without-hearing-centre--sc.html
240,23-1-20,"BJP candidate Kapil Mishra terms Delhi polls contest between India, Pakistan","Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra on Thursday termed the anti-CAA protest sites in the national capital ""mini-Pakistan"" and said the upcoming assembly elections will be a contest ""on Delhi roads between India and Pakistan"".

In a series of provocative tweets, the BJP's candidate from Model Town also said Pakistani rioters have taken over the streets of Delhi.

He made no specific mention of the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but sharply attacked the protest at Shaheen Bagh and other places in the city.

Mishra, who left the Aam Aadmi Party to join the BJP, said, ""Pakistan has made its entry in Shaheen Bagh. Many mini Pakistans are being formed in Delhi. Indian law is not not being followed in Shaheen Bagh, Chandbagh, Indralok.""

""Pakistan rioters have encroached on the roads of Delhi (Pakistan ki entry Shaheen Bagh mein ho chuki hain. Delhi mein chhote chhote Pakistan Banaye ja rahe hain. Shaheen Bagh, Chand Bagh, Indralok mein desk ka kanoon nahi mana jaa raha hain. Pakistani dangayiyo ka Delhi ki sadko pe kabza),"" he tweeted.

For over a month, hundred of people, primarily Muslim women, have been staging a protest at the Shaheen Bagh in south Delhi.

""India vs Pakistan 8th February Delhi. There will a contest on Delhi Roads between India and Pakistan on February 8,"" Mishra said.

""Pakistan has already entered Shaheen Bagh and small pockets of Pakistan are being created in Delhi,"" he added.

In another post, Mishra asserted that the BJP will win the February 8 elections and Kejriwal will resign from his post when votes are counted on February 11.

The former AAP leader was removed as minister by Kejriwal in 2017. Last year, he was also disqualified as AAP MLA under the anti-defection law.

Mishra, who has often found himself in controversy, faces AAP MLA Akhileshpati Tripathi in the elections.

He was criticised for a tweet with communal overtones during Diwali last year. The post was later taken down by Twitter for violating its guidelines.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp-candidate-kapil-mishra-terms-delhi-polls-contest-between-india--pakistan-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bjp-candidate-kapil-mishra-terms-delhi-polls-contest-between-india--pakistan.html

Jaishankar to ask him to see that all steps are taken by the Saudi Arabian authorities after reports emerged that nurses from the south Indian state in a hospital there are affected by the coronavirus.

In his letter to Jaishankar, Vijayan mentioned that nurses working at Jazeera Abha Al Hayath Hospital in Saudi Arabia have been identified as being infected with the coronavirus, and India should get in touch with the Saudi authorities to ensure that action is taken to help them.

According to reports, one Kerala nurse has already tested positive for the deadly virus.

The nurse, along with 30 other nurses -- most from Kerala -- have been currently placed in isolation.

The Kerala nurse who has tested positive is believed to have got the virus from a Filipino nurse, who was being looked after by her.

Meanwhile, the Cochin International Airport (CIAL) on Wednesday began screening all incoming passengers from China and Hong Kong, following the outbreak of the coronavirus.

The new virus was first spotted in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei province.

Corona viruses can infect both animals and people, and cause illness of the respiratory tract.

The symptoms of infection include high fever, difficulty in breathing among others. Detection becomes difficult when this surfaces like flu or a bad cold.

246,23-1-20,MNS's new flag bearing King Shivaji's rajmudra draws Sena ire,"The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party's new flag unveiled on Thursday has drawn flak from the Shiv Sena and some organisations here for the use of Chhatrapati Shivaji's royal seal in it.

MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday unveiled his party's new saffron-coloured flag bearing the octagonal 'rajmudra' (royal seal) of Chhatrapati Shivaji at its centre.

The party's earlier flag had stripes of saffron, blue and green colours.

Talking to reporters, Shiv Sena's Aurangabad district chief and MLC Ambadas Danve said on Thursday that Chhatrapati Shivaji's royal seal should not be used for political reasons.

""The rajmudra should not be used for political purposes. We express our dislike towards it. We will approach the state government and Election Commission in this regard to seek action,"" he said.

The MNS was set up in 2006 after Raj Thackeray split from the Shiv Sena.

Vinod Patil, president of R R Patil Foundation, a social organisation in Aurangabad, told reporters that he was pained to see the use of rajmudra in the MNS flag and sought the state government's action against the party.

""There is a three-party government in the state. They should take action against the MNS...We never thought that the royal seal of Shivaji Maharaj will be a part of its new flag. Using the rajmudra for politics is painful,"" he said.

""It is the duty of the state government to look into the issue. We will also move the Election Commission over it.

247,23-1-20,Govt wants 7 days deadline for execution,"Centre moves SC to amend rules to do away with delaying tactics

In the wake of delaying tactics adopted by the death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, Union Home Ministry on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court for amending the 2014 guidelines regarding the timeline for the execution, filing of review and curative petitions and mercy petitions.

Asserting that the need of the hour is to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims rather than keeping the rights of the convicts in mind, the Centre wants the SC to fix a deadline of seven days for the execution of death penalty of condemned prisoners after issuance of the death warrant.

The affidavit filed by the Government also sought clarifications with regard to cases involving multiple convicts who time their petitions in such a way that the execution of the death warrant could be delayed indefinitely. The Nirbhaya case is perfect example of such delaying tactics.

The MHA’s plea sought a direction from the top court in fixing the deadline for filing of curative pleas after the rejection of review petitions.

It also sought a direction that “if the convict of death sentence wants to file mercy petition, it would be mandatory for a convict of death sentence to do so only within a period of seven days from the date of receipt of death warrant issued by the competent court”.

The MHA submitted that the top court should “mandate all the competent courts, State Governments, prison authorities in the country to issue death warrant of a convict within seven days of the rejection of his mercy petition and to execute death sentence within seven days thereafter irrespective of the stage of review petition/curative petition/mercy petition of his co-convicts”.

The top court, on January 20, had rejected the plea of a death row convict in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case challenging the Delhi High Court order which had dismissed his claim of being a juvenile at the time of offence saying he cannot re-agitate the issue by filing fresh application.

A Delhi court has recently issued fresh death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts -- Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan (26) -- in the case after their hanging got delayed from January 22 due to pending petitions.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road.

In an application, the MHA sought a direction “to mandate all competent courts, State Governments, prison authorities in country to issue death warrant of a convict within seven days of rejection of his mercy petition and to execute death sentence within 7 days thereafter irrespective of the stage of review petition/curative petition/mercy petition of his co-convicts.”

The MHA said the country is facing a menace of certain offences relating to terrorism, rape and murder which are punishable with death sentence.

“It is submitted that the offence of rape is not only a criminal offence defined in the penal code of the country but is the most horrific and unpardonable offence in any civilized society. The offence of rape is not only an offence against an individual and society but is an offence against humanity.

“There are various instances of such heinous and horrific offences of rape accompanied by an equally horrible and horrific offence of murder of the victim which shakes the collective conscience of the nation,” the MHA said.

The Government said in the larger interest of public and of the victims, their families, the earlier guidelines should be modified to ensure that the accused of such “horrible, dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offences” be not permitted to play with the “majesty of law and prolong the execution of the sentence awarded to them in accordance with the law”.

The MHA, in its plea filed through Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, urged the court to fix a time limit within which the convict of death sentence should file curative petition, if he so chooses to do so.

“In case of multiple convicts of such horrific crimes who are awaiting death sentence, mandating the issuance of warrant by competent court within seven days of rejection of mercy petition and execution of death sentence within seven days thereafter irrespective of the proceeding, if any, taken by his co-convicts,” it said.

The Ministry said under the scheme of criminal justice system, a full proof regime is being providing to accused at various stages of judicial scrutiny to ensure that an accused is punished strictly in accordance with law and convicts be not allowed to misuse the judicial processes.

“When a death sentence is awarded to an accused after the judicial scrutiny, the procedure established by law ensures that the said decision is mandatorily tested by the highest court of the State namely the High Court,” it said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/govt-wants-7-days-deadline-for-execution-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/govt-wants-7-days-deadline-for-execution.html
248,23-1-20,China virus city in transport shutdown as WHO extends talks,"China said it was halting flights and trains from Thursday out of Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the centre of a deadly SARS-like virus outbreak, as the UN extended emergency talks on the disease.

The central city's special command centre against the virus also said that residents should not leave without a special reason and that the measures would be effective from 0200 GMT, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

The move is meant to ""resolutely contain the momentum of the epidemic spreading,"" the centre was quoted as saying.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus meanwhile said he was postponing a decision on whether or not to declare a global health emergency -- a rare instrument used only for the worst outbreaks -- saying he needed ""more information"".

""I have decided to ask the emergency committee to meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion,"" he said, referring to a group of international experts who met for several hours at the WHO in Geneva on Wednesday.

Asked about the transport shutdown, he added: ""By having a strong action not only will they control the outbreak in their country but they will also minimise the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally."" Hundreds of people have been infected with the virus in China and 17 have died since the first case was detected in Wuhan on December 31 and authorities have already urged visitors to steer clear of the city.

The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, the National Health Commission also announced measures to contain the disease -- including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains.

The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there ""is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease"", health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing.

More than 500 cases have now been reported, with the majority in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.

Major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing have also reported cases, as well as provinces in northeastern, central, and southern China.

The virus has also been detected in Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures.

But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. Countries have intensified efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen -- known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia.

European airports from London to Moscow have also stepped up checks and Nigeria, which has many citizens working in China, said it would start checks at entry points.

The WHO has confirmed that the virus can be passed between people, at least those in close contact.

However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. A Wuhan market is believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak.

A price list circulating online in China for a business there lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS.

""We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,"" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention.

He said it was clear ""this virus is adapting and mutating"". Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected.

Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear a mask if they have a cough.

Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital.

In Wuhan, city authorities made it mandatory to wear a mask in public places on Wednesday, according to state-run People's Daily.

In response to skyrocketing demand for masks -- which were starting to sell out at pharmacies and on some popular websites -- China's industry and information technology ministry said it would ""spare no effort in increasing supply"", state media reported.

""These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,"" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school.

In Wuhan, police were also conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said.

Officials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fever.

The local government has cancelled major public activities, including Women's Olympics football qualifiers scheduled for February 3-9 which have been moved to the eastern city of Nanjing.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-virus-city-in-transport-shutdown-as-who-extends-talks-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-virus-city-in-transport-shutdown-as-who-extends-talks.html
249,23-1-20,Investigation points to Saudi prince role in Bezos phone hack,"Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's phone was likely infected by spyware hidden in a message from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to an analysis released Wednesday, prompting calls for an official investigation.

A forensic analysis by technical experts retained by Bezos after a leak of his personal information in early 2019 suggested that the Bezos iPhone was compromised by ""tools"" procured by a close associate of the Saudi de facto ruler.

The suggestion of the Saudi prince's role in the hacking prompted calls for further investigation by UN human rights officials looking into the October 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and contributor to The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos.

""The alleged hacking of Mr Bezos's phone, and those of others, demands immediate investigation by US and other relevant authorities,"" UN Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and David Kaye said in a statement in Geneva.

Any investigation should also look at the ""continuous, multi-year, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents,"" they added.

Callamard, the UN expert on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and Kaye, the expert on freedom of expression, said the latest revelation ""suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia.""

The technical experts hired by Bezos concluded ""with medium to high confidence that Bezos' iPhone was compromised via malware sent from a WhatsApp account used by Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman,"" said the report by FTI Consulting, first reported by the online news site Vice.

Saudi authorities rejected the latest allegations.

""Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd,"" the Saudi Arabian embassy said on its Twitter account.

But FTI, which was retained by the security consultant hired by Bezos, Gavin de Becker, said its forensic analysis pointed to former Saudi court media adviser Saud al-Qahtani, part of Prince Mohammed's inner circle.

Qahtani, who was sacked as a result of the internal Saudi investigation into the Khashoggi case, is widely believed to have played a role in the killing of the journalist and to have directed ""a massive online campaign"" against Bezos and his newspaper.

The FTI report said Bezos and the Saudi royal exchanged phone numbers and communicated via WhatsApp after meeting at a Los Angeles dinner in April 2018.

It said that a message to Bezos on May 1, 2018 contained a video attachment which the two men had not discussed, but which delivered the malware that allowed ""unauthorized exfiltration"" of data from the Amazon CEO's iPhone X.

The outflow of data increased by 29,000 percent after that incident, according to the report.

Bezos, the world's richest man, announced in early 2019 he was the target of a blackmail campaign by the National Enquirer tabloid which threatened to publish lurid pictures of him and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez as he was moving toward divorcing his wife.

In March last year, de Becker said he concluded that the hack and leak of the Bezos pictures were led by Saudi Arabia but did not specify which part of the Saudi government he was blaming for the hack.

According to a message to Bezos in February 2019 cited in the FTI report, the Crown Prince denied any involvement in the hack.

""Jeff all of what you hear or told.. It's not true,"" the message said. ""You know the truth, there is nothing against you or amazon from me or Saudi Arabia.""

The analysis also suggested that the hackers may have used a type of spyware used in other Saudi surveillance cases, such as Pegasus-3 malware developed by the Israeli security firm NSO Group.

The Israeli firm said in a statement it was ""shocked and appalled"" by the reports linking its software to the Bezos phone hacking.

""If this story is true, then it deserves a full investigation by all bodies providing such services to assure that their systems have not been used in this abuse,"" the company said.

""Just as we stated when these stories first surfaced months ago, we can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/investigation-points-to-saudi-prince-role-in-bezos-phone-hack-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/investigation-points-to-saudi-prince-role-in-bezos-phone-hack.html
250,23-1-20,"Firefighting plane crashes in Australia, killing 3 Americans","Three American crew members died Thursday when a C-130 Hercules aerial water tanker crashed while battling wildfires in southeastern Australia, officials said.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the crash deaths in the state's Snowy Monaro region as Australia attempts to deal with an unprecedented fire season that has left a large swath of destruction.

Coulson Aviation in the US state of Oregon said in a statement that one of its Lockheed large air tankers was lost after it left Richmond in New South Wales with retardant for a firebombing mission. It said the accident was “extensive"" but had few other details.

“The only thing I have from the field reports are that the plane came down, it's crashed and there was a large fireball associated with that crash,” said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.

He said all three aboard were U.S. Residents.

“Unfortunately, all we've been able to do is locate the wreckage and the crash site and we have not been able to locate any survivors,” he said.

The tragedy brings the death toll from the blazes to at least 31 since September.

The fires have also destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.4 million hectares (25.7 million acres), an area bigger than the U.S. State of Indiana.

Coulson grounded other firefighting aircraft as a precaution pending investigation, reducing planes available to firefighters in New South Wales and neighboring Victoria state.

The four-propeller Hercules drops more than 15,000 liters (4,000 gallons) of fire retardant in a single pass.

Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the national air crash investigator, and state police will investigate the crash site, which firefighters described as an active fire ground.

“There is no indication at this stage of what's caused the accident,” Fitzsimmons said.

Berejiklian said there were more than 1,700 volunteers and personnel in the field, and five fires were being described at an “emergency warning"" level — t he most dangerous on a three-tier scale — across the state and on the fringes of the national capital Canberra.

Also Thursday, Canberra Airport closed because of nearby wildfires, and residents south of the city were told to seek shelter.

The blaze started Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures caused conditions in Canberra to deteriorate. A second fire near the airport that started on Thursday morning is at a “watch and act” level — the middle of the three tiers.

“Arrivals and departures are affected due to aviation firefighting operations,” the airport authority said in a tweet.

Another tweet from traffic police said “the fire is moving fast and there are multiple road closures in the area. Please avoid the area. Local road blocks in place.” Residents in some Canberra suburbs were advised to seek shelter and others to leave immediately.

""The defense force is both assisting to a degree and looking to whether that needs to be reinforced,"" Chief of Defense Angus Campbell told reporters.

""I have people who are both involved as persons who need to be moved from areas and office buildings that are potentially in danger, and also those persons who are part of the (Operation) Bushfire Assist effort,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/firefighting-plane-crashes-in-australia--killing-3-americans-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/firefighting-plane-crashes-in-australia--killing-3-americans.html
251,23-1-20,We used to quash 7-times bigger India in cricket: Khan on Pak's growth potential,"Giving a cricket analogy from the past to bolster his case about his country's resource richness and growth potential, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday said they once used to thrash seven-times bigger India and were seen as a force to reckon with.

He said Pakistan was a big force in hockey and so many other sports too, while it has always been a rich country in terms of human and natural resources, but an entrenched corruption derailed the growth story over last few decades.

""In 60s, Pakistan was shining and it was like an Asian role model. I grew up with that hope but we let ourselves down because unfortunately democracy couldn't get grounded in Pakistan. When democracy faltered, army came in...,"" Khan said here at a breakfast session on the sidelines of the WEF 2020.

Khan said he realised that if Pakistan has good governance it will rise.

""The founding fathers of Pakistan were brilliant and men of complete integrity. They wanted Pakistan to be humane, just society for welfare. But we deviated from that vision. We have to restore the vision for which this country was founded.

""When I was playing cricket, India was seven times of our size but we regularly quashed them. In hockey and so many other games also. We were great,"" he said.

At the Pakistan breakfast session hosted by Pathfinder Group and Martin Dow Group. Khan also recalled his childhood days and his struggle during initial years in politics.

Khan said he learnt from his initial days in cricket that there is no prize for coming second in the professional world of sports. ""There is no sympathy for losers,"" he said.

""When my mother died of cancer I realised there was no cancer hospital and when I was building the hospital I was told you can't give the treatment free.

""But I ensured 70 per cent got it free. It cost seven billion rupees to build it and annual loss was 10 billion. People laughed at me but I was happy 70 per cent were getting free treatment,"" he said.

Khan said when he entered politics, again people laughed at him for years, but he never deviated from his goal.

Seeking to showcase Pakistan's economic growth potential, Khan said the country has huge natural resources such as copper and gold.

""I was told just the profit of only two blocks was two billion dollars. We have huge coal reserves. But we falter on productivity.

""When I went to China, I saw their productivity is huge. We have larger number of cows and buffaloes but China has much higher milk productivity,"" he said.

Terming overseas Pakistanis as one of the greatest resources, Khan said he wants them to come back to work for their country.

""They are best of the minds. We are trying to get them back and some have already come. I feel the highest amount of investment can come from overseas Pakistanis,"" he said.

On suggestions for the government taking the bill for international conferences, Khan said global expos are productive but he feels there is a need to save money as the government is going through an austerity programme.

"" My own visit here is at a fraction of money spent earlier by the governments. I'm cancelling junkets of my ministers and allow them to go only after being totally convinced about productivity,"" he said.

On gender inequality, Khan said no country can prosper with a skewed development so we need to work towards raising the level of income for women, especially the women at the bottom of the social ladder.

He said a majority of children in Pakistan were not going to English medium schools and that needed to change.

""We want to promote investment, that will create wealth and that would be used for all sections of society. If we can concentrate on the bottom of our society it will help a lot,"" he said.

Outlining his vision, Khan said his focus is on improving ease of doing business and to provide better governance.

""We are up against corrupt entrenched status quo that ruled Pakistan for 30 years. They are spreading gloom and doom because they don't want us to succeed.

""We also face deteriorating institutions. It takes time to restore them but we are doing that slowly and steadily. In the first year, two-third of our tax collection went for debt servicing... We are also looking at export-oriented growth,"" he said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-used-to-quash-7-times-bigger-india-in-cricket--khan-on-pak-s-growth-potential-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/we-used-to-quash-7-times-bigger-india-in-cricket--khan-on-pak-s-growth-potential.html
252,23-1-20,China seals five cities to halt spread of virulent coronavirus as cases climb to over 630,"China on Thursday locked down five cities, including Wuhan, suspending all public transport in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus that has infected over 630 people and left 17 others dead, dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year.

On Thursday evening, Chinese officials announced suspension of public transport in five cities - Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang and Wuhan in Hubei province, official media reported.

Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out.

Nationwide, a total of 17 people have died, all of them in and around Wuhan. The victims' average age was 73, with the oldest 89 and the youngest 48. So far 631 cases have been confirmed in 25 provincial-level regions in the country.

The government has sealed Wuhan and Huanggang, a prefecture level city with over 7.4 million people, in an unprecedented effort to curb the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. The other three cities too have substantial population.

From 10 a.M. Thursday, all public transportation, including city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance coaches in Wuhan were suspended, and outbound channels at airports and railway stations closed until further notice.

The city officials have asked people in both the cities not to leave. Wuhan is a major transportation hub and home to many universities.

The Wuhan lockdown is a cause of concern for Indian students who still remained there. The city has about 700 Indian students, majority of them studying medicine. However, most of the students have apparently left for home for the holidays.

As concerns grew over their safety, the Indian Embassy on Thursday opened helplines and established contacts with the concerned Chinese officials to ensure food and other supplies for those who remained in the city.

In new disclosure, Chinese officials on Thursday confirmed fresh cases of coronavirus in people who did not even travel to Wuhan recently.

The National Health Commission also reported increasing number of cases with no exposure to Wuhan's Hunan seafood wholesale market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. The cases without confirmed exposure to the market have been found overseas.

The virus, which a doctor in Wuhan told BBC is spreading at an alarming rate, has dampened the Chinese New Year celebrations beginning Friday.

Chinese all over the world formally bid goodbye to the year of the pig and welcome the year of rat on Friday. The Chinese government has given week long holiday.

In view of virus scare, several cities including Beijing have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival.

Large cultural activities during spring festival in Beijing such as temple fairs were cancelled to prevent the spread of the virus, state-run Global Times reported.

An official statement said that Beijing's sprawling imperial palace 'Forbidden City' will close on Saturday until further notice to ""avoid cross-infection caused by the gathering of people"".

A Chinese government announcement said citizens in Wuhan and Huanggang should not leave without specific reasons.

As medical consumable such as surgical masks, protective clothing and disinfectant are running short, the Red Cross Society of China's Wuhan branch opened a 24-hour hotline to receive donated emergency stocks.

All residents in the province have been ordered to wear masks.

""Staff of state organs, enterprises and institutions shall wear masks at work, and operators of public venues should set up eye-catching signs to request residents to put on masks before entering,"" said a notice issued by the Wuhan municipal government.

""Those who disregard the warning will be punished according to relevant laws and regulations,"" it added.

Many local residents are busy purchasing food and daily necessities for the festival, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

According to the provincial commerce department, the Hubei province will strengthen the monitoring of grain, oil, meat, eggs and vegetables, increase stocks during the spring festival holiday to ensure stable supply, and intensify environmental sanitation control.

Hubei Province has alone reported 444 cases of coronavirus infections. All 17 deaths were reported from the province.

Among the confirmed cases, 399 patients are receiving treatment in hospitals, with 71 in severe condition and 24 in critical condition, said Yang Yunyan, vice governor of the province.

Confirmed cases have also been reported from several regions including Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as in the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday extended to Thursday its emergency talks on whether the coronavirus outbreak in China constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.

Lauding China's immediate detecting and sharing of the sequencing of the virus, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus believed that those actions will ""minimize the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/second-chinese-city-placed-on-lockdown-over-virus--official-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-seals-five-cities-to-halt-spread-of-virulent-coronavirus-as-cases-climb-to-over-630.html
253,23-1-20,US Treasury Secretary advises Greta Thunberg to 'go study',"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday advised climate activist Greta Thunberg, who has been bitterly critical of US policy at the World Economic Forum, to study economics before giving out lessons.

Asked about the Swedish 17-year-old's demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels, he told reporters: ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us.""

The Trump administration and Greta Thunberg have sparred indirectly since Tuesday on panels in Davos but organisers have carefully averted any direct confrontation.

In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump castigated the ""prophets of doom"" and those that predicted a climate ""apocalypse"", while Thunberg sat in the audience.

Shortly before leaving the Swiss ski resort, Trump said he would have ""loved"" to have met the activist, Time magazine's Person of the Year.

Thunberg repeated her climate warnings, hammering home in her speech that it was time to ""panic"" because ""the house is burning"", as she did the previous year in Davos.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-treasury-secretary-advises-greta-thunberg-to--go-study--2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/us-treasury-secretary-advises-greta-thunberg-to--go-study-.html
254,23-1-20,ICJ orders Myanmar to protect Rohingyas from genocide,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday ordered Myanmar to take provisional measures to protect its Rohingya ethnic minority from acts of genocide.

The judges unanimously pronounced in favour of Gambia, which had accused Myanmar of committing genocidal acts against the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state and had requested the top United Nations court to enforce provisional measures to ensure that Myanmar complies with the 1948 Genocide Convention signed by the country in 1956, Efe news reported.

Presiding Judge Abdulwaqi Ahmed Yusuf ordered the Myanmar government to ""take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of article 2 of the Genocide Convention.""

The court said the mainly Muslim community living in Rakhine state ""remain extremely vulnerable.""

Yusuf reminded Myanmar that the provisional measures it must take are legally binding and said the Southeast Asian country must submit a report on the actions it intends to take in compliance with the ruling within four months.

Myanmar must submit again, another six months later, showing how it is in compliance with the measures.

A group of several civil society organisations, mostly from ethnic minorities that have suffered years of war in the country's peripheral areas against a military infamous for its human rights violations, issued a statement on Wednesday supporting the case at the ICJ.

""We understand very clearly that the ICJ case against Myanmar is directed toward those responsible for using political power and military might, and not the people of Myanmar,"" read the statement.

The charge of genocide refers to the military operations, carried out in the Rakhine state by the Myanmar army in 2016 and 2017 as a response to armed attacks by rebels belonging to the insurgent group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), that led to the exodus of some 800,000 Rohingyas to neighbouring Bangladesh.

The Myanmar government has denied entry into the country to a fact-finding mission set up by the UN in the aftermath of the military operations.

The Myanmar military is accused of carrying out a campaign of killings, tortures, burning of houses, and rapes in 2018 with ""genocidal intent"".

On its part, the Myanmar legal team, headed by the de facto leader of the country, Aung San Suu Kyi, denied the allegations of genocide, and asserted that the counter-insurgency operations were just part of an internal conflict triggered by ARSA.

The Myanmar military on Thursday issued a statement asserting that ""it will not only give full consideration to the recommendations relating to the armed forces in the report of the ICOE but the office of the Judge Advocate General will study the report in detail as well.""",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/icj-orders-myanmar-to-protect-rohingyas-from-genocide-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/icj-orders-myanmar-to-protect-rohingyas-from-genocide.html
255,23-1-20,Rajini’s house now fortress after threat,"A heavy posse of police have been deployed at the residence of Tamil film’s superstar Rajinikanth following threat of physical attacks on him by the Dravidar Kazhakam and associated parties.

Rajinikanth’s residence at Chennai’s Poes Garden has come under a security blanket with armed guards of Tamil Nadu Special Police and plainclothesmen from city police taking positions in vantage points along the approach road to Poes Garden.

The posting of policemen is a fallout of the statement made by the actor on the 50th anniversary of Tamil magazine Tuglaq on last Wednesday when he pointed out that the Dravidar Kazkaham, founded by EV Ramasamy Naicker, had taken out a procession in 1971 holding placards with nude pictures of Lord Rama and Maa Sita which were garlanded with footwears.

This was a rally against the superstition prevailing among the Hindus and Ramasamy Naicker was a known Hindu baiter. Leaders of the Dravida Kazhakam want a public apology from Rajinikanth for airing his views publicly.

But the film actor made it known on Tuesday that he stood by what he said during his speech and there was no question of him tendering any apology. All political leaders, barring those from the BJP, have come together in condemning the superstar.

“Rajinikanth should not air his views publicly without learning and understanding the basics,” said MK Stalin, president, DMK.

The AIADMK expressed displeasure over Rajinikanth’s words for hurting the sentiments of the Dravida cadre.

K Jayakumar, Tamil Nadu Minister for fisheries and the spokesman of the Government demanded public apology from Rajinikanth.

But Tamilaruvi Manian, close confidant of the superstar told The Pioneer on Wednesday that this furore about Rajinikanth’s speech was much ado about nothing. “Rajinikanth did not tell anything about Ramaswamy Naicker. What he told was that activists of DK took out the procession carrying nude pictures of Lord Ram and Sita. What is wrong in saying something which has happened and that too substantiated with documentary evidence,” asked Manian.

Manian also pointed out that the anger and resentment expressed by Dravida Kazhakam activists and leaders of other major political parties is an indication of the fear and apprehension they had over Rajinikanth’s political ambitions. “It is sure that Tamil Nadu will not be the same once Rajinikanth announces his political entry by launching the political outfit,” said Manian.

Narayanan Tirupati, BJP spokesman, said there was no need for Rajinikanth to tender any apology as he has not blamed anybody in his speech during the Tuglaq anniversary. “Rajinikanth exposed the hypocrisy being practiced by the Dravidian political parties under the guise of secularism,” said Narayanan.

Meanwhile political commentators are of the view that the statement by Rajinikanth could lead to realignment of political forces in the State. There were signals from the AIADMK that the party may dump the NDA and forge fresh alliance with parties that respect and recognise Ramasamy Naicker’s brand of politics.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rajini---s-house-now-fortress-after-threat-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rajini---s-house-now-fortress-after-threat.html
256,23-1-20,Global manhunt on for fugitive Nithyananda,"The Interpol has urged member nations to help locate Nithyananda, the self-declared godman who fled India last year amid allegations of rape and sexual abuse.

A blue-corner notice that makes it obligatory for countries to share information on any person involved in a crime has been issued by the Interpol against Nithyananda at the behest of the Gujarat Police.

Last month, Ecuador denied the presence of the fugitive “godman” and said it had rejected his request for asylum. The Embassy of Ecuador also suggested he had left the country for Haiti.

He was charged with kidnapping and wrongful confinement of children to make them collect donations from followers to run his ashram.

The Blue Corner Notice will help the law enforcement agencies here in collecting additional information from the member countries of the Interpol about the suspect’s identity, location or activities in relation to the crime.

The Gujarat Police had sent a request to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the nodal body for Interpol matters in India, seeking a Blue Corner Notice against Nithyananda, officials said.

Following this, the Interpol issued the Blue Corner Notice against Nithyananda. After securing the Blue Corner Notice, the Gujarat Police is working to get Interpol to issue a Red Corner Notice, a global arrest warrant, against Nithyananda, source said.

The Gujarat Police had registered an FIR against Nithyananda after two girls went missing from his ashram in Ahmedabad last year.

While police continue to look for him, reports emerged in December last year that he has created a “Hindu” nation, Kailaasa, with its own flag and political setup, on an island near Ecuador.

Besides Gujarat, Nithyananda is also wanted by the Karnataka police in a similar case.

He was also arrested in 2010 in Himachal Pradesh over rape allegations.

In December last year, the Centre cancelled his passport and also rejected his application for a fresh travel document.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/global-manhunt-on-for-fugitive-nithyananda.html
257,23-1-20,Vyommitra charms all with her hello before spacewalk,"Before orbiting astronauts on India’s first manned mission to space in December 2021, the Indian Space Research Organisation will send “Vyommitra”, a “lady robot” in the unmanned Gaganyaan spacecraft.

The robot was the centre of attraction at the inaugural session of the “Human Spaceflight and Exploration — Present Challenges and Future Trends” here on Wednesday.

Vyommitra, a combination of two Sanskrit words Vyoma (Space) and Mitra (Friend), took everyone by surprise when she introduced herself to the audience gathered there. “Hello everyone. I am Vyommitra, the prototype of the half-humanoid, been made for the first unmanned Gaganyaan mission,” the robot said.

Explaining about the role in the mission, she said, “I can monitor through module parameters, alert you and perform life support operations. I can perform activities like switch panel operations...”

The robot said she can also be a companion and converse with the astronauts, recognise them and can also respond to their queries.

ISRO chairman K Sivan told reporters the half humanoid will simulate human functions in space and also interact with the environment control life support system.

“It will be simulating exactly the human functions there (in space). It will check whether the system is right. This will be very useful to simulate, as if a human is flying,” he added.

The humanoid, which Sivan said was functioning well, has the human simulation system.

Earlier, addressing the inaugural function, Sivan said ahead of the launch of India’s maiden human spaceflight venture Gaganyaan in December 2021, ISRO will undertake two unmanned missions in December 2020 and June 2021 and “Vyommitra” will fly in them.

“We are on schedule (regarding Gaganyaan). We are going to do lots of demonstration tests this year. This year end we will send our unmanned mission and the half-humanoid you have seen today is going to fly in it,” he said.

The ISRO will monitor how the human system will behave in the environment control life support system. “The humanoid project has almost completed,” Sivan added.

Union Minister of State for Department of Space and Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh too shared a video of the humanoid on Wednesday on Twitter and wrote, “In the run up to the first Human Space Mission by India at ISRO...’Vyommitra’, the humanoid for #Gaganyaan unveiled. This prototype of humanoid will go as trial before Gaganyaan goes with astronauts.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vyommitra-charms-all-with-her-hello-before-spacewalk-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/vyommitra-charms-all-with-her-hello-before-spacewalk.html
258,23-1-20,"Pakistan 'spews venom', takes to hate speech like fish takes to water: India at UN","India has slammed Pakistan for ""spewing venom and false narratives"" of monumental proportions in the United Nations, saying it takes to hate speech like fish takes to water and ""obfuscates"" the international community from the truth as Islamabad yet again raked up the Kashmir issue at the world body.

Pakistan consistently rakes up the Kashmir issue at various UN platforms in a bid to internationalise it but has repeatedly failed to get any support.

Last week, Islamabad failed in its efforts to get any traction from the membership of the UN Security Council when its 'all-weather ally' China made another pitch to raise the issue in the 15-nation Council. There was consensus among the rest of the Council members that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu, speaking at a session of the General Assembly on 'Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organization' on Wednesday, said Pakistan ""indulges in confabulations and obfuscates the international community from the truth"" instead of putting an end to the ""bellicose and vitriolic diatribe"" and taking steps to restore normal ties.

""Just like a fish takes to water, one delegation has again taken to hate speech. Every time this delegation speaks, it spews venom and false narratives of monumental proportions.

""It's extremely surprising that a country that has completely decimated its minority population talks about protecting minorities. Pakistan's practice of using false pretenses to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. Pakistan needs to reflect that there are no takers for its false rhetoric and should get down to the normal business of diplomacy,"" Naidu said.

The Indian diplomat's strong response came after Saad Ahmed Warraich, Counsellor at Pakistan mission to the UN, raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in his remarks during the session, saying no other situation reflects the ""abdication"" of the UN's responsibility to discharge its responsibilities more than the decades-old Jammu and Kashmir issue.

China's latest attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Pakistan's behalf failed last week, with an overwhelming majority of the body expressing the view that it was not the right forum to discuss the bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.

It was China's third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC since August last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories.

""We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others. We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,"" India's Permenent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said last week.

""We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,"" Akbaruddin said after the January 15 Council meeting.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pakistan--spews-venom---takes-to-hate-speech-like-fish-takes-to-water--india-at-un-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/pakistan--spews-venom---takes-to-hate-speech-like-fish-takes-to-water--india-at-un.html

His comments on the two issues comes a day ahead of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's maiden visit to India after he assumed power in January last year following a sweeping electoral victory.

Lago told PTI in an interview that over 15 agreements will be signed during the Brazilian president's visit, including one on the investment protection and facilitation treaty.

""These (Citizenship (Amendment) Act and Kashmir situation) are two internal issues of India that obviously we are following with great interest.

He made the remarks when asked if the CAA and the Kashmir issue could be discussed during talks.

Brazilian President Bolsonaro will on Friday begin a four-day visit to India, primarily as the chief guest on Republic Day and also to explore ways to boost trade ties at a time both the large economies are hit by slowdowns.

He will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind separately on Saturday.

260,23-1-20,Democrats present case against President Trump in Senate impeachment trial,"Led by Congressman Adam Schiff, House Democrats on Wednesday began making a strong case before Senators to remove President Donald Trump in the third ever impeachment trial in the American history.

Knowing that they are unlikely to succeed in ousting Trump from the White House as Republicans enjoy a 53-47 majority in the 100-membered Senate, the managers of the House, wherein Democrats enjoy a majority, had their arguments on the Senate floor with an eye on the November elections.

Making a strong plea before Senators, Democratic Congressman Schiff, who is the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, accused Trump of using his power to cheat in the elections.

“Today we will begin our trial with the factual chronology. The facts are damning. We're going to lay them out in great detail in our chronology today,” Schiff told reporters before he went to the Senate to argue against the president.

In his opening argument, Schiff quoted founding father Alexander Hamilton who imagined a scenario in which future president would put personal interest ahead of that of the nation.

“We are here today in this hallowed chamber, undertaking this solemn action for only the third time in history, because Donald J Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has acted precisely as Hamilton and his contemporaries had feared,"" he asserted.

“President Trump solicited foreign interference in our democratic elections, abusing the power of his office by seeking help from abroad to improve his reelection prospects at home. And when he was caught, he used the powers of that office to obstruct the investigation into his own misconduct,"" Schiff said.

The 435-member House on December 18 charged Trump with ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential Democratic rival for the current president in the 2020 elections.

The days proceedings on Wednesday began with Senate Chaplain Barry Black prayer.

""Help them remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle, that words have consequences, and that how something is said can be as important as what is said. Give them a civility built upon integrity that brings consistency in their beliefs and actions,"" Black said.

The impeachment trial is being presided over by the Supreme Court's Chief Justice John Roberts. As per the ruled of the trial passed by the Senate Tuesday, House managers and lawyers on behalf of Trump will have 24 hours to present their cases over the three days.

As per the decorum guidelines, during the impeachment trial, Senators are supposed to stick to their seats and not talk to others, and not bring cell phones or tablets to the floor.

But a number of Senators on both sides were seen breaking this decorum.

“I am not somebody who is very good at sitting at one place,” said Senator Pat Thune.

On the Senate floor, Senators were allowed to drink only water and milk. A large number of Senators were seen drinking milk.

Trump's lawyers led by Pat Ciplollone and Jay Sekulow are planning to make a strong defense for the president. Based on their multiple television interviews and interaction with reporters they are likely to paint Trump as a victim of a partisan charade.

“We will challenge aggressively the case that they're putting forward based on what we're hearing, and we also have an affirmative case as well,” Sekulow told CNN on Wednesday.

“They're not here to steal one election. They're here to steal two elections. It's buried in the small print of their ridiculous articles of impeachment. They want to remove President Trump from the ballot,” Cipollone said.

Soon after Trump returned to the White House after attending the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, the White House alleged that Schiff's one-sided impeachment report -- the document that serves as the basis for Democrats' entire case -- is nothing but a partisan hatchet job.

“Rather than drawing more attention to their flimsy, fake 'investigation,' Schiff chose to deflect and make up more lies about President Trump,” it said.

Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein said the case made by the House impeachment managers is a fact-based case that lays out how Trump tried to trade nearly USD 400 million in appropriated funds for Ukraine in exchange for its interference in our upcoming presidential election.

The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York on Wednesday, has also claimed that Hawaii Democrat Gabbard suffered an economic loss to be proven at trial.

""Hillary calling me a 'Russian asset' is not only intended to smear my reputation and derail my campaign for president, it's also intended to silence any voice that dares to speak out against the establishment status quo,"" Gabbard, 38, said in an email to her supporters explaining the reason for her suing the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential elections.

Tulsi has been harmed by Clinton's lies and American democracy has suffered as well, according to the lawsuit.

""With this action, Tulsi seeks to hold Clinton and the political elites... Accountable for distorting the truth in the middle of a critical presidential election,"" said the lawsuit.

Clinton, 72, who unsuccessfully fought the 2016 presidential election against President Donald Trump, in an interview in October last year said that the Republican party was ""grooming"" a Democratic presidential candidate to run as a third-party candidate. Although she did not name Gabbard, her comments were seen directed to the Hawaii lawmaker.

According to the lawsuit, ""millions of Americans heard (or read about) Clinton's defamatory statements. Scientifically conducted opinion surveys have shown that Clinton's false, malicious statements about Tulsi, including that Tulsi is a 'Russian asset' and 'the favourite of the Russians' were accepted as true by millions of Americans, including large numbers of voters in battleground presidential primary states.

""The defamatory statements have caused Tulsi to lose potential donors and potential voters who heard the defamatory statements. Tulsi has suffered significant actual damages, personally and professionally, that are estimated to exceed USD 50 million - and continue to this day"".

The lawsuit alleges that as a direct and proximate result of Clinton's intentional and malicious misconduct, Gabbard has suffered anguish and damage to her reputation, with direct and substantial injury to her positions as United States Congresswoman; Presidential candidate; and officer in the Army National Guard.

""These substantial injuries are continuing in nature and will continued to be suffered in the future, unless and until they are remediated by this court,"" it said.

""One would expect someone of Mrs Clinton's political background to act with a greater level of maturity and dignity, but her personal hostility toward Representative Gabbard apparently clouded Mrs Clinton's reason and blinded her to the US,"" said Gabbard's legal counsel Brian Dunne.

""She resorted to a damaging whisper campaign founded on lies, and when presented with the opportunity to retract her damaging remarks, she refused. Rep. Gabbard must defend her good name and hold Mrs Clinton responsible. This lawsuit intends to do just that,"" he said.

But given the US laws, it would be very tough for Gabbard in the defamation case against Clinton.

""To prevail in her defamation claim, Representative Gabbard has to prove that Secretary Clinton made a false statement of fact. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that mere 'loose and figurative' expressions, even 'vigorous epithets', don't qualify. And, the courts are especially protective of the right to engage in sharp-elbowed political debate,"" Jeffrey J Pyle, a Boston-based attorney, told ABC News.

""Representative Gabbard will have a difficult time convincing the court that Secretary Clinton's statements were anything other than non-factual 'rhetorical hyperbole' which is thoroughly protected by the First Amendment,"" said Pyle, who has represented a number of cases involving defamation, libel and First Amendment.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tulsi-gabbard-sues-hillary-clinton-for-defamation--seeks-usd-50-mn-over--russian-asset--comment-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/tulsi-gabbard-sues-hillary-clinton-for-defamation--seeks-usd-50-mn-over--russian-asset--comment.html
262,23-1-20,Democrats face risks and limits in Trump's impeachment trial,"The challenge is becoming increasingly clear for House Democrats prosecuting President Donald Trump's impeachment case as the Senate convenes for a second day of arguments in the landmark trial.

No matter how overwhelming the evidence confronting Trump, it becomes less compelling when presented again and again, day after day, as Democrats try to convince not just fidgety senators but an American public deeply divided over the Republican president in an election year.

The team led by Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of House Intelligence Committee, constructed a gripping account of Trump's political pressure on Ukraine and attempt to cover up the ""corrupt scheme"" central to the charges.

But the limits are apparent.

Prosecutors must rely on the same loops of videotaped testimony — ambassadors, national security officials and even the president himself — after Trump's GOP Senate allies blocked new witnesses.

Democrats were once reluctant to take on impeachment during an election year but are marching toward a decision by the Senate that the American public also will judge.

""We're trying this case to two juries — the Senate and the American people,"" Schiff acknowledged Wednesday ahead of opening arguments.

""The American people are watching. The American people are listening. And they do have an open mind.""

Trump blasted the proceedings in a Thursday morning tweet, declaring them the ""Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!""

House Democrats impeached Trump last month, arguing he abused his office by asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden while withholding crucial military aid.

They also charged him with obstructing Congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to testify in the House probe.

Republicans have defended Trump's actions as appropriate and cast the process as a politically motivated effort to weaken the president in the midst of his reelection campaign.

Campaigning in Iowa, Biden stood by the effort to remove Trump from office.

""People ask the question, 'Isn't the president going to be stronger and harder to beat if he survives this?' Yes, probably. But Congress has no choice,"" he said.

Senators must cast their votes and ""live with that in history.""

Each side has 24 hours over three days to present their case. After the House prosecutors finish Friday, the president's lawyers will follow. They are expected to take only Sunday off and push into next week.

Then there will be 16 hours for senators, who must sit quietly at their desks, no speeches or cellphones, to ask written question, and another four hours for deliberations.

""There's a lot of things I'd like to rebut,"" said Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow at the Capitol, ""and we will rebut.""

On the first day of opening arguments, Schiff appealed to senators not to be ""cynical"" about politics, but to draw on the intent of the nation's Founding Fathers in providing the remedy of impeachment and removal.

He spoke directly to Republicans to join them in voting to oust Trump from office to ""protect our democracy.""

Holding the room proved difficult. Most senators sat at their desks throughout, as the rules stipulate, though some stretched their legs, standing behind the desks or against the back wall of the chamber, passing the time. Sometimes they outwardly yawned.

Republicans quietly smirked at the presentation from Schiff and the lesser-known House Democrats prosecuting the case.

Nearing nine long hours of arguments, the empty seats became glaringly apparent. Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif., was under the weather and left early.

Some lawmakers dashed down the hall to appear on television. Visitors thinned from the galleries, one briefly interrupting in protest and being removed by Capitol police.

The impeachment trial is set against the backdrop of the 2020 election. All four senators who are Democratic presidential candidates are off the campaign trail, seated as jurors.

Several GOP senators said Wednesday they'd seen no evidence to support the allegations against Trump even though, just 24 hours earlier, they had rejected subpoenas for additional witnesses as well as documents.

Democrats, meanwhile, described the evidence against the president as overwhelming but said senators had a duty to gather more.

A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed the public slightly more likely to say the Senate should convict and remove Trump from office than to say it should not, 45 per cent to 40 per cent. But a sizable percentage, 14 per cent, said they didn't know enough to have an opinion.

One issue with wide agreement: Trump should allow top aides to appear as witnesses at the trial.

About 7 in 10 said so, including majorities of Republicans and Democrats, according to the poll.

The strategy of more witnesses, though, seemed all but settled. Republicans rejected Democratic efforts to get Trump aides including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, to testify in back-to-back votes earlier this week.

Senators were likely to repeat that rejection next week, shutting out any chance of new testimony.

A long-shot idea to pair one of Trump's preferred witnesses — Biden's son Hunter Biden — with Bolton or another that Democrats want was swiftly rejected.

""That's off the table,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters.

Biden also rejected having his son testify or even appearing himself. “I want no part of that,” he told voters in Iowa.

Some Republicans expressed disdain for it all. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa spoke sarcastically about how excited she was to hear the “overwhelming evidence"" the House Democrats promised against Trump.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/democrats-face-risks-and-limits-in-trump-s-impeachment-trial-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/democrats-face-risks-and-limits-in-trump-s-impeachment-trial.html

""I hate you,"" is what Shehnaz tells Sidharth while fighting with him in a new promo released by the channel.

The week started with Sidharth calling off his ""special friendship"" with Shehnaz. Sidharth refused to keep any relation with the singer, questioning her loyalty with him and her family. Shehnaz started talking with Asim Riaz, she got support from him, Vishal Aaditya Singh and Rashami Desai.

265,23-1-20,Work begins on Chandrayaan-3 mission: ISRO,"In its second attempt to soft-land on the moon, India began working on its third lunar mission -- Chandrayaan-3 -- which is scheduled for launch in early 2021, a top space official said on Wednesday.

""We have started working on our third lunar mission to land an unmanned spacecraft near the moon's south pole. The project work has gained momentum to launch the lander and rover by early 2021,"" Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K. Sivan said at a space event here.

On January 1, Sivan told the media here that the government had approved the ambitious mission for soft-landing of a spacecraft and a rover near the moon's south pole in the later part of 2020 or early 2021.

India's maiden attempt to soft-land at the designated spot on the moon failed on September 7, 2019, when Chandrayaan-2's Vikram spacecraft crash-landed due to a velocity glitch.

""As Chandrayaan-3 will have only a lander and rover, the lunar spacecraft will cost Rs 610 crore, including Rs 360 crore for the launch rocket,"" said Sivan on the margins of a symposium on ""Human Spaceflight and Exploration - Present Challenges and Future Trends"".

The space agency spent Rs 960 crore on the Chandrayaan-2 mission, whose Orbiter is circling around the moon at about 100 km from the lunar surface in an elliptical motion since August 20 last.

On India's maiden manned mission 'Gaganyaan', Sivan said that four Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots selected with three of them as crew would soon visit Russia for training.

""Gaganyaan will be a historic mission for the country as three Indian astronauts will fly in a space module designed and developed indigenously,"" asserted Sivan, a rocket specialist.

Former IAF Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma was the first Indian to fly in space onboard the Russian Soyuz-11 mission on April 2, 1984.

On return from Russia, the IAF quartet will undergo module-specific training at the space agency's human space flight centre in this tech city where critical technologies for space missions are being developed.

""The four pilots will be trained in our crew and service module to operate it for simulations. Three of them will be finally selected for the 7-day space mission in the earth's lower orbit,"" Sivan said.

Asserting that the manned mission was not a one-off feat or exercise to send a human being into space, the ISRO Chairman said: ""Gaganyaan is not just about sending a man into space but creating opportunities for national and overseas collaborations with other space-faring nations.

""Scientific discoveries, economic development, education, technology development and inspiring youths are the common goals for all nations. Human space flight programme provides an ideal platform to meet such objectives.""",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/work-begins-on-chandrayaan-3-mission--isro-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/work-begins-on-chandrayaan-3-mission--isro.html
266,23-1-20,Google discovers security flaws in Apple Safari browser,"Google security researchers discovered several security flaws in a privacy software in Apple web browser Safari that could have helped third-party vendors track users' browsing habits.

According to a report in the Financial Times which cited a soon-to-be published paper from Google's 'Project Zero' team, the vulnerabilities were found in an anti-tracking feature known as 'Intelligent Tracking Prevention'.

Once disclosed by Google researchers to Apple in August last year, the Cupertino-based iPhone maker immediately patched the flaws.

Apple launched the 'Intelligent Tracking Prevention' tool in 2017 to, in fact, protect Safari users from being tracked around the web by advertisers and other third-party cookies.

According to Google researchers, the vulnerabilities left personal data of Safari users exposed. They also found a flaw that allowed hackers to ""create a persistent fingerprint that will follow the user around the web"".

Apple confirmed it patched the issues.

This is the third time Google researchers have found flaws in the Apple ecosystem.

In September, Apple slammed Google for creating a false impression about its iPhones being at hacking risk owing to security flaws that allegedly let several malicious websites break into its iOS operating system.

Researchers at 'Project Zero' team had discovered several hacked websites that allegedly used security flaws in iPhones to attack users who visited these websites -- compromising their personal files, messages, and real-time location data.

In a statement, Apple said the so-called sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones ""en masse"" as described.

According to Google, the websites delivered their malware indiscriminately and were operational for years.

According to the iPhone maker, ""all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not ""'two years"" as Google implies.

Google researchers also said they identified a vulnerability that accessed all the database files on the victim''s iPhone used by end-to-end encryption apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and iMessage.

Apple said that it fixed the vulnerabilities in question -- working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after it learnt about it.

In July last year, the 'Project Zero' team found six critical flaws in Apple iMessage that can compromise the user's phone without even interacting with them. These security vulnerabilities fell into the 'interactionless' category.

Two members of 'Project Zero', Google's elite bug-hunting team, published details and demo proof-of-concept code for five of six 'interactionless' security bugs that impact the iOS operating system and can be exploited via the iMessage client.

All the six security bugs were patched with the iPhone maker's iOS 12.4 release.

267,23-1-20,Leadership can't always be determined by results: Kohli backs Williamson,"Questions will certainly crop up when a team will struggle but the leadership can't always be judged by results says India skipper Virat Kohli, putting up a stout defense of his under fire New Zealand counterpart Kane Williamson.

Williamson' leadership skills came under the scanner following New Zealand's crushing defeat in the Boxing Day Test against Australia as former skipper Brendon McCullum questioned some of his tactics.

New Zealand were drubbed 0-3 in that series.

McCullum said Williamson has gradually lost his love of the role and he can quit captaincy in at least the T20 format.

Williamson himself said he was willing to make space for a new leader if the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) suggests the same.

""For me it's always been about what's best for the team. If those discussions are to eventuate and collectively there's a thought that it (finding new captain) would be best for the team, then my stance is whatever is right and fits the group. I'm always open to whatever is going to move the team in those directions,"" Williamson said.

However, Kohli who leads India in all three formats, said people are sometimes too quick to blame captains for a team's failure.

""These kinds of things do come up every now and then, whenever you have a setback. I think its a part of having that responsibility of captaining in all three formats. One thing that I have done is I just focus on what I can do for the team and the vision that needs to be there to take the team forward,"" said Kohli on the eve of the T20 series-opener.

""I don't think leadership can always be determined by the results. It's also about how you can get the team together and get the guys functioning under you as well, which I think Kane has done wonderfully well.

""He has the respect of his team-mates and he has the trust of his team-mates, is what I can see, and he's also a very, very smart cricketer. If a team outplays you, you have to accept it as a collective failure, and not a lack of leadership or captaincy, is what I think.""

Kohli said Willamson should not be forced into a decision and he should have the freedom to make a choice.

""People get onto that side of things too early and sometimes I think it is better to let the individual decide himself. If you have given him the responsibility, I am sure he will decide whether he is good enough for the job any more or not as well,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/leadership-can-t-always-be-determined-by-results--kohli-backs-williamson-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/leadership-can-t-always-be-determined-by-results--kohli-backs-williamson.html
268,23-1-20,Upbeat India take on injury-struck Kiwis as build-up to T20 World Cup continues,"Preparations for the World Cup on top of their agenda, India will take on an injury-hit New Zealand in a rare five-match T20 International series starting Friday during which seam-friendly wickets would be a major challenge for the visitors.

Unlike most overseas tours, this will be a quick start for the Indian team. In a tight season, the first T20 comes only five days after their last ODI against Australia at home.

The team arrived in Auckland on Tuesday and chose to rest on Wednesday. Thursday was when they hit the nets ahead of the tour-opening game.

On the plus side, this hectic schedule helps the team management maintain consistency in team selection as they continue experimenting across the available squad in a World Cup year. The T20 showpiece is scheduled to be held in Australia in October this year.

Despite injury issues to key white-ball personnel like Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Deepak Chahar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar this past home season, the bench strength has come across adequate and raring to go for challenges ahead.

It begins at the top where KL Rahul has stepped up as a key part of India's white-ball plans.

He did enough against the West Indies as Shikhar Dhawan's replacement to merit a starting spot, and then formed a solid pairing when Dhawan returned while Rohit Sharma was rested. And now, India will once again start this T20 series with Rohit and Rahul pairing up at the top.

Skipper Virat Kohli dropped hints that Rahul's newfound confidence in his dual role as batsman-keeper has given vital options to the team.

According to Kohli, Rahul will continue to keep wickets in both ODIs and T20Is, but will open in the shortest format while returning to the middle-order in the 50-over format.

It could mean that Prithvi Shaw is being primed for an ODI debut and a potential pairing with Rohit when the three-match series begins on February 5.

The skipper also indicated a change in middle order plans. With Rahul keeping wickets, the fit-again Rishabh Pant could lose his spot in the playing eleven.

Manish Pandey is expected to play as the fifth specialist batsman and Shreyas Iyer will regain his spot at number four.

Pandey, Iyer and Pant batted together in the nets on Thursday, while Sanju Samson hung around, only to pad up later on. The Kerala batsman didn't seem to be in contention for the first T20I.

Pant and Pandey could both fit into the playing eleven should India opt for five bowlers and leave out the sixth option in Shivam Dube. Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja are the other two all-round options.

The Yuzvendra Chahal-Kuldeep Yadav combination is yet to play a game together since the 2019 ODI World Cup, and it remains to be seen if things will change in this aspect.

In the pace department, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah are assured starters, while the toss-up will be between Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini.

New Zealand had beaten India 2-1 in the T20I series last year. The Black Caps also won 2-1 in the T20I series during their Sri Lankan tour, and then drew 2-2 at home against England in a five-match series.

Despite the recent good record in the shortest format, there is a downbeat mood in the hosts' dressing room thanks to the 3-0 shellacking received in Australia over the past month.

It hasn't helped matters that the disappointing loss to their trans-Tasman rivals has raised questions about Kane Williamson's future as captain.

For the moment, New Zealand's leading batsman is happy to lead the side across all formats, but his position is up for review after the shattering defeat to Australia.

As always, they have a dearth of all-rounders to choose from but need to balance with pickings in the pace department, which is missing the services of Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson owing to injuries.

It remains to be seen if the Black Caps opt for two spinners in Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner given the really short boundaries at Eden Park, venue for the first two T20Is.

Teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar.

New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Kuggeleijn, Colin Munro, Colin de Grandhomme, Tom Bruce, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Tim Seifert (wk), Hamish Bennett, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Blair Tickner.

269,23-1-20,Revenge can't be on mind when you take on Kiwis: Kohli,"The loss still rankles him but Virat Kohli on Thursday said he can't really bring himself to think of revenge when India take on New Zealand for the first time after the Kiwis sent his side packing from the ODI World Cup last year.

The Black Caps defeated pre-tournament favourites India by 18 runs in the semifinals of the showpiece in England and Friday's tour-opening T20 International is the first clash between the two sides since then. Kohli has spoken repeatedly about how devastating the loss was for him personally.

""Even if you want to think of revenge, these guys are so nice you cannot get into that zone,"" said Kohli at the pre-match press conference.

""We get along really well with these guys and it's all about being competitive on the field. As I said in England, they are probably one side that has set the example for teams to play international cricket,"" he reasoned.

Lauding the affable demeanour of the Kane Williamson-led side, Kohli said they are great ambassadors for the sport.

""...They obviously want to bring out the best they can in every ball and every game, they are intense in their body language, they are not nasty, they are not doing things which are not acceptable on the field,"" he pointed out.

Williamson and his men had drawn effusive praise for their grace in the aftermath of a heartbreaking World Cup final loss to England, a game that was decided on boundary count after scores were tied.

""It is not about any kind of revenge - it is two quality sides playing good cricket. It is a challenge to beat New Zealand here and we are totally up for it,"" Kohli said.

On to cikcteing matters and the India skipper said the Kiwis are favourites in home conditions and he would not make the mistake of taking them lightly despite the recent injury setbacks.

""They will have slight home advantage but we have played a lot here in the past seasons. Every series is a fresh start and New Zealand in New Zealand is obviously a bigger challenge than playing them back in India. So we definitely have to be at our best game,"" he said.

Speaking about his team, Kohli reiterated that KL Rahul's dual role as a batsman and wicket-keeper is providing better balance to the side. He said he won't read much into criticism which may come his way by letting Rahul bat in top-order.

""As I said him doing well with the gloves has really opened up a scenario for us where it gives us a lot more balance in playing an extra batsman. This is something that we are looking to continue for a while; nothing taken away from anyone else and it is just what he brings to the side.

""And I know there will be a lot said about, talks around what happens to other players and what not, but the most important thing is what the team requires and the best balance we can create for the side,"" he said in a veiled reference to the future of designated keeper-batsman Rishabh Pant.

Talking about Rahul's ascendancy in the white-ball formats since the 2019 World Cup, Kohli said, ""He's open to accepting any kind of role, whatever the team wants. He is a total team man and you can tell the way he keeps as well. He is always looking for an opportunity and looking to make a play. He's not nervous about it.""

Rahul replaced Shikhar Dhawan against the West Indies and partnered Rohit Sharma at the top.

Dhawan returned to pair up with Rahul against Sri Lanka, but was injured against Australia and is missing this tour as a result.

""If you talk about replacements, we have a lot of T20 players around and people who are very experienced when it comes to playing T20 cricket. Having played a lot of matches in the IPL, on A tours and series, I don't see an issue of replacement.

""Look, whenever he (Dhawan) is back in the team we would love to have him back and have the balance in the team where we can really go in with the best batting line-up that we have,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/revenge-can-t-be-on-mind-when-you-take-on-kiwis--kohli-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/revenge-can-t-be-on-mind-when-you-take-on-kiwis--kohli.html

The list includes star campaigners like Amit Shah, Smriti Irani, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh, Dr Harsh Vardhan, Vijay Goel and the national president Jagat Prakash Nadda.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and the party’s poster boy Yogi Adityanath will lead the fight with former Chief Ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Arjun Munda.

Most of the campaigners for the BJP are from outside Delhi — a gap the ruling party is expected to exploit. Earlier, Kejriwal had pointed out that the BJP is yet to name a Chief Ministerial candidate. While that is the BJP’s usual procedure except in rare cases, the Chief Minister has poked fun at the party.

Meanwhile, the Congress has submitted names of 40 star campaigners to the election commission for the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra former Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha are among the star campaigners.

The decision to include Sidhu and Sinha’s name in the list of star campaigner is taken considering large number of Punjabi and Purvanchali voters in the national Capital, a senior party leader said.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as well as Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States Capt Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Kamal Nath (Madhya Pradesh), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) and V Narayanasamy (Puducherry) also figured in the list.

Former Chief Ministers Harish Rawat and Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia, senior leaders Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad, are also among the star campaigners.

The other campaigners for the AAP in the list are Bhagwat Mann, Pankaj Kumar Gupta, Durgesh Pathak, ND Gupta, Sushil Kumar Gupta, Rajender Pal Gautam, Imran Hussain, Baljinder Kaur, Dilip Pandey, Preeti Sharma Menon, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Amantullah Khan, Satyender Jain, Dr Ajay Kumar, Kailash Gehlot, Rakhi Birla, Vishal Dadlani, Prithvi Reddy, Aman Arora, Shoaib Iqbal, Abdul Rehman, Sanjay Bhagat, Rekha Rani, and Somnath Bharti.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra, campaign committee chief Kirti Azad, AICC in-charge of Delhi P C Chacko and NSUI chief Neeraj Kundan, will also campaign for various candidates in the high-stakes poll battle.

Former Union minister Shashi Tharoor, who has been aggressively taking on the AAP and had launched the party’s campaign in Delhi, will also canvass for various candidates for the party.

Polling will be held on February 8 for the 70-member Delhi Assembly and the results will be declared on February 11.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/galaxy-of-stars-to-touch-base-in-fierce-delhi-battle-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/galaxy-of-stars-to-touch-base-in-fierce-delhi-battle.html

275,23-1-20,My politics will not change with popular mood of audience: Kabir Khan,"Calling himself an optimist who believes in the goodness of people, director Kabir Khan says everything these days is being looked at through the prism of religion but India is about more than that.

The director of blockbusters such as ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" and ""Ek Tha Tiger"" said he is happy he has a platform as a filmmaker to present a counterpoint to the prevailing narrative based on religious fault lines.

""I'm an optimist who believes in the goodness of the people. But yes, there is a certain level of bigotry that has crept in. Everything is being looked at through the prism of religion but India is not about that.

""It sounds like a cliché but when I was growing up, I was not aware of my religion. That was the greatness of this country,” Kabir told PTI.

He said he is a product of a mixed marriage and is pained to see the social fabric being tattered.

“I have celebrated the best that Indian secularism has to offer. But to see the greatness of this country being simplified and broken down into religious fault lines is a painful experience,” he added.

According to Kabir, it is dangerous to see history through the prism of religion, whether in cinema or society. But it is important to revisit history to know what happened and one can always find something that is relevant for the present, he said. The director, who started as a documentary filmmaker, returns to his roots for a five-episode series on Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army, ""The Forgotten Army: Azaadi Ke Liye"", on Amazon Prime, his most expensive project yet.

Asked whether this is a difficult time for filmmakers, Kabir said he believes art thrives in the time of strife and, as a storyteller, his politics will always reflect in his work.

“Every film has its politics and every filmmaker has to reflect his or her politics. Every film of mine will reflect my politics and it will never change according to the popular mood of the audience. But a film should not be just about that. Politics should be in the layers beneath,"" he said.

His terms his 2015 Salman Khan-starrer ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" an ""extremely political"" film. At face value, it can also be enjoyed as the story of a mute Pakistani girl who drifts into India and is taken back to her homeland by a Hanuman devotee. But there is so much more. The ""chicken song"", for instance, was a sly reference to the beef ban controversy at the time, he said.

""I won't say it is a difficult time for me as a filmmaker. It is good that I have a platform where I can talk and present a counterpoint and I refuse to believe that the entire country believes the narrative that is being sent out. There are millions and millions of people, and perhaps majority, that does not believe. And if I present the counterpoint, they will think about it.”

Discussing his new series, the director said it has always fascinated him that the sacrifice of the men and women who comprised the INA is just a forgotten footnote in history.

“I wanted to make something that stands the test of time. It goes down in posterity,” Khan, who first explored the subject in a Doordarshan documentary 20 years ago, said.

For the documentary, he travelled with former INA officers Captain Lakshmi Sahgal and Captain Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon from Singapore to India via erstwhile Burma, retracing the route that the INA followed.

“The documentary got me a lot of attention and acclaim but the story just never left me. It's actually the first script I ever wrote and I landed up with that script in Bombay from Delhi. I realised very soon that nobody's going to give me a budget of this size to make my first film.

""And then after every film, I would pick up the script and say, ‘Okay, this is the one I want to make', because this is the story that made me want to become a filmmaker. On the way, I ended up making eight other films but this is really the story that I wanted to make,” he said.

Kabir is happy that the story has come out as a series, not a film, as it would have required to compromise with the budget and other elements.

""Without giving any numbers, this is the most expensive project I have ever worked on… It required that kind of budget.""

Kabir believes the INA was responsible for bringing down the morale of the British establishment, which realised it would be impossible to keep the country colonised without the support of the local army.

""There are a lot of debates and discussions about what happened with the INA and the controversies around it. The whole point is that, if you want to judge what the Army did, sure that's your prerogative, but at least get to know what they did. Nobody knows what happened with the Army from 1942 to 1945.""

He added that 55,000 men and women of the INA fought for independence and 47,000 of them died.

""Not a single person from that Army was ever taken back into the independent Army, which is such an amazing fact... The fact that the British called them traitors became the narrative and we also started assuming that they were traitors.""

""They were the only women's regiment in the whole world 70 years ago. That's what they thought about women's importance in society. I don't know whether they will be happy with what the current situation is,"" he said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/my-politics-will-not-change-with-popular-mood-of-audience--kabir-khan-2020-01-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/my-politics-will-not-change-with-popular-mood-of-audience--kabir-khan.html
