0,13-2-20,Policing the media,"The electronic media is a major influencing factor in any election campaign. But it appears to function beyond MCC. Rules need to be strengthened

As the din and dust of the bitterly fought elections in Delhi settle down, it is time to take a closer look at one of the vitals of the campaign. Conduct of free and fair elections with “transparency” and a “level-playing” field for all are integral to any democracy. This has also been highlighted in our Constitution and has been recognised as a part of its basic structure. In any election campaign, the media plays an important role in dissemination of information and, thus, enables the people to make a well-informed choice. In this context, at present, the electronic media, both television and social, on account of its phenomenal reach has virtually occupied the centre-stage and has become a major influencing factor in any election campaign.

At present, in addition to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, there are certain provisions in the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, and the Indian Penal Code that lay down the general parameters within which the system must operate. Besides these, the Election Commission of India (ECI) prescribes a Model Code of Conduct (MCC), which is applicable to all stakeholders, political parties, candidates as well as officials and the Government machinery on their role in the conduct of elections. MCC is the essential rulebook that has to be adhered to in letter and spirit. Any violation can draw the ire of not only the ECI but also invite judicial intervention. While MCC had evolved over the years, its real impact was felt for the first time during the tenure of former Chief Election Commissioner TN Seshan. But it appears that the electronic media, in general terms, still remains beyond the MCC.

When the concept of MCC was evolving in the 1960s, it was only the print media and the radio that dominated the scene. As such, reportage was left to the Press Council of India (PCI), which issued detailed guidelines in 1996 on election-related reporting. During the last few decades, advancements in information technology have virtually revolutionised the channels for dissemination of information and the way they reach out to the people. In this context, apart from the television channels, guidelines with respect to the use of social media during election campaigns are also issued by the ECI. Separately, on the lines of the PCI, the National Association of Broadcasters, which is a voluntary organisation, too, issued guidelines for private television channels in 2011 for election-related broadcasts. During a campaign, monitoring is expected to be undertaken by the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA).

Some of the important guidelines are as follows: (i) News broadcasters must not broadcast any form of “hate speech” or other obnoxious content that may lead to incitement of violence or promote public unrest or disorder as election campaigning based on communal or caste factors is prohibited under election rules. (ii) News broadcasters should strictly avoid reports that tend to promote feelings of enmity or hatred among the people on grounds of religion, race, caste, community, region or language.” (iii) The ECI is required to monitor the broadcasts from the time elections are announced until the conclusion. Violations are to be reported to the NBSA for action under their regulations. Thus, the NBSA does not take cognisance of the violation, if any, unless reported by the ECI.

In the recently-concluded election campaign in Delhi, two cases pertaining to the Members of Parliament (MPs) stand out. In both cases, the ECI proceeded to act under the MCC, though in a limited manner. While no FIR was registered (not even by the police), it deprived the MPs of their status as star campaigners. At the same time, they were also debarred from campaigning for varying durations.

It may appear to be a case of shooting the messenger but in this case, the messenger did not happen to be an innocent carrier. Offensive words were spoken at a gathering but competition-driven channels ensured that the content reached not only every nook and corner of the country but also became subject of comment internationally. Almost all television channels continued to saturate the audience with the offensive part of the content for more than 24 hours but neither the ECI nor the NBSA reacted to the violation.

An equally serious problem that remains unresolved so far exists during multi-phase polling. In such cases, it often happens that the 48-hour embargo may have commenced in one constituency while full-scale campaign continues in other areas scheduled to go to polls later. With news channels enjoying unlimited reach, the 48-hour embargo appears to be observed more in breach. In this context, in 2019, the ECI in its manual of MCC had stated that “in an era of wide reach of electronic media in the country, it is impossible to block any matter being covered on electronic media in a specific area, State or constituency.”

Elaborating further, it was held by the NBSA that “the media would be entitled to broadcast electioneering with regard to a contesting candidate of a particular party in one State, irrespective of the fact that transmission would be seen in other States.” It was further held that “so long as the broadcast of the election-related programme in State ‘Y’ is not used for promoting or attacking any specific candidate in State ‘X’, there can be no objection. Covering a general event relating to a political party, which is relevant and of common interest across the country or a State; which does not extol the public to support any candidate or does not criticise any candidate in the constituency going to polls, is not a violation of any guidelines.”

In other words, both the ECI and the NBSA appear to have given up on the main point, which in many cases would mean an erosion of fair play and level-playing field. This existing practice needs a focussed attention by a group of experts so as to ensure that no unfair advantage is taken by any candidate.

According to the rules, the NBSA does not act till informed by the ECI, which may not inform at all. What can be the way out ? At present, the fundamental principles and rules of self-regulation of NBSA are quite open-ended. These need to be amended so as to strengthen the institution by giving it a statutory backing. In case of prima facie violations, NBSA should be able to act independently. The chairman of the NBSA is a respected former Judge of the Supreme Court with several senior retired IAS officers and diplomats as members besides other experts. Their hands need to be strengthened so as to bring in sobriety as well as rationality in the content, raising the credibility of the institution.

1,13-2-20,BJP formula to stay,"The party tested the swell factor of its polarisation agenda in Delhi and may still replicate it in Bengal, Bihar

Undoubtedly, the Delhi verdict has been a blowback to the hate rhetoric of the BJP, which had pitched it to a national referendum on its identity politics. Affirmatively, it has swerved the axis back on governance as the spine of a people’s mandate. But for the BJP, the religious polarisation and the vituperative campaign have worked the way it has wanted. Particularly in a literate, aware and urbane Delhi, the distillate of India as it were. First, uncomfortable as Delhiites might be, using the Shaheen Bagh protests over citizenship laws as a metaphor, it forced a binary conversation and picked up fence-sitters, those who gave it a vote surge and eight seats from a pre-poll estimate of two or a near wipeout. Delhi has, therefore, proved to the BJP that in the absence of a local governance or performance record and even without local faces, its agenda has a speed-breaker narrative that did make the AAP sweat in the last days of campaigning. And if this polarisation, with its most repugnant avatar, has even given it an apology of a gain in Delhi, the BJP will use it in varying degrees, depending on its spin cycles in States. Second, each Opposition party, which is now tactically avoiding a confrontation with the BJP and refusing to bite the bait that only makes the latter look like the victim, is being compelled to take a stand on the emotive issue of religion. Hence the rabid vigour of senior BJP leaders in pushing it. AAP has successfully turned religion into a jan dharma of serving the people with its actions. But in public chants and rants, it countered Jai Shri Ram with Jai Bajrangbali, using the image of Ram’s servitor Hanuman. This is what the Congress did with the temple run of the Gandhi scions and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee did with her Jai Maa Kali slogans during the Lok Sabha. India had so far reconciled itself to a secular public life where ritualism was lived as a daily habit rather than an exhibitionist practice. The BJP has managed to overturn this paradigm, equating the dressing down of religion to disowning it as a shame, opening up the Hindu pantheon to appropriation by various parties. Insidiously, the BJP has buttonholed majoritarian liberalism and forced it to display some sort of identity on its sleeves. The political parties have no choice now but to play by the rules of this game. Religion, tragically, is now the domain of tactical warfare. Why would the BJP give it up? Third, by establishing religion as a key marker of political play, it has exiled secularism and Constitutional values to the domain and responsibility of civil society. This separation is significant. For we may rave and rant about the BJP’s socio-cultural pollutants, stage protests and sit-ins but there’s no political space for civil movements. These work up a bigger pressure no doubt and may effect a change in the long-term but in five-year timelines of electoral politics, that discourse will be cautiously side-stepped by each political party in campaign duels with the BJP. In that sense, the latter has coopted all parties into developing campaign strategies on its terms, herding them into Centre-Right positions.

How then will the BJP relook its strategies or the Opposition reorient itself in such a scenario, in Bihar and Bengal, particularly the latter as it is still the most feisty vanguard against its divisive politics and a liberal bastion? Bihar has a 17 per cent Muslim population but the BJP ally and Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar is compromised by circumstance, unable to snap his symbiotic link so close to the State polls. He is supporting CAA and knows the Muslim vote consolidates around Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Even then he has 45 per cent of the State’s vote pie comprising extremely backward castes (EBCs), the Mahadalits and women. Besides, he has a legacy of governance that is difficult to overlook for the BJP, which doesn’t have a saleable face. Post the Delhi verdict, the BJP could attempt to find a Shaheen Bagh-like metaphor in protests at Gaya but wouldn’t want to overplay it given Nitish’s deep discomfort over profiling-based policies. It is in Bengal though that the BJP may play hard, considering Mamata has stuck her neck out stridently against the otherisation of the minorities. Besides, Bengal has a sizeable 27 per cent Muslim votepie against which the BJP will look to consolidate every Hindu vote. The anxieties of Partition are latent in Bengal and the BJP will be looking at playing up the subterranean memory by hook or by crook. Besides, as a border State that has suffered infiltration and where refugees have been regularised as votebanks, the fear of the Muslims has worked. In the developing two-party matrix at the State level, the minuscule CPI(M) and Congress vote has already migrated to the BJP, shoring up its percentage as a key Opposition player. Mamata, like Kejriwal, has learnt her lessons in realpolitik but the question is how fiery a tigress she chooses to become. The BJP for sure is luring her.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp-formula-to-stay-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/bjp-formula-to-stay.html
2,13-2-20,Deal? Or no deal?,"Trump came to power telling his voters how the world, India included, treated the US unfairly. Will he get his trade pact?

Donald Trump’s bestselling book is titled, Trump: The Art of the Deal. But after he surprised everyone, possibly even himself, and became the 45th President of the US, he has found it difficult to even locate a canvas on which he can paint his masterpiece. Much of the global peace dividend of the past 75 years following World War II has, thanks to the US, given access to its immense market to countries across the world. Trump and many of his core supporters believe that this access has been granted “unfairly.” Take the example of China, which is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the US’ benevolence. It has not been given reciprocal rights to American companies in its home turf and has indeed become a strategic threat to the US. India, too, has been a beneficiary of such benevolence. For years, we have gained from its Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme that allowed a certain amount of duty-free imports. But Trump’s trade negotiators nullified that and with some justification, too. Given that the US claims that India is hardly a “developing economy” and a part of the G20, we have been declared ineligible for such benefits. Trump also believes that India has some extremely protectionist trade rules, high rates of customs and excise on goods. His go-to refrain has been for the American motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, whose imported big two-wheelers have been subjected to some harsh duties. But with India’s economy in the doldrums, what access can it offer to companies in the US is the moot question.

So as Trump heads to India for a State visit, a deal may be on the cards. Logically, it would primarily focus on defence where India is seen as a bulwark against Chinese expansionism. But what about trade? India may possibly do a bit of a reversal against the increasingly protectionist and import-substitution route that the Government has been following. But Indian negotiators are as stubborn as American ones and even though Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi may sign some papers, the impact of what those papers say and how they will be operationalised eventually will possibly be similar to the papers Trump signed with Kim Jong-Un of North Korea.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/deal--or-no-deal--2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/deal--or-no-deal-.html
3,13-2-20,Rise of the new plebs,"The success of the AAP lays the ground for a new political discourse that can probably recast Indian politics within an eclectic frame but it needs to tread its course cautiously

Literally, the word “pleb” means an ordinary person, a commoner or someone from the lower rung of society. The word has often been widely used to indicate just that whenever there has been any sort of a mass upheaval. The thumping and resounding victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the just-concluded elections in Delhi echoes this word, though with a correction. Here, the term “pleb” has come to reflect new politics, raising reassurances as well as concerns. AAP’s victory brings forth a combination of “caste” and “class” elements, a mix of governance and belongingness that prevents its categorisation simply as another form of middle class politics, an urbane political phenomenon.

There were two theories around which the electoral narrative in Delhi was constructed. First was the question of governance and second of identity. Both were invoked variedly and were widely discussed by opposite sides. The first narrative was debated the most. It related to the model of governance around which AAP mobilised the voter’s sentiment. It sought to attract the attention of the voters by focussing on various popular welfare schemes such as mohalla clinics, clean water, free bus rides, safety of women and legalising colonies among other issues. Rather than engaging in an exclusively bi-partisan hate exchange, it concentrated and crafted a campaign that was aimed at projecting its governance model. In the course of such a campaign, AAP succeeded in dismissing predictions made by various political pundits.

Commentators argued that the electoral promises made by the AAP were utopian in nature. To cite an example, sociologist Anand Kumar (2013) pointed out that regional parties had predicted that AAP would have no electoral future as it was ignorant about the complexities of Indian society and politics. Other observers called AAP leaders a bunch of inexperienced power-hungry people, who gave up the Jan Lokpal movement to gain power. However, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal effectively responded to them by saying, “Our politics is not for power, we want power to change the politics.” Thus, the State was seen as an instrument to effect qualitative changes to ensure safety for the weaker sections, access to necessary services, particularly health and education. Successive election results have cemented these claims.

However, the success of the AAP and the failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) provide a cue to the second narrative that has been more subtle than the loud narrative of governance.

Beneath the visible electoral stunt between the AAP and the BJP and the decimation of the Congress as a non-player, the elections were also about a competition between governance and identity, the latter being vigorously articulated as a ferment of nationalism. For the BJP, it was a prestigious election as it believed it could dismantle the AAP and repeat the Modi wave. By trooping in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, party president JP Nadda, Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Prakash Javadekar and Chief Ministers Yogi Adityanath and Nitish Kumar as the election campaigners for the 2020 Delhi Assembly election, it believed that it could split the AAP’s vote bank.

BJP’s Delhi MP Parvesh Verma even called Chief Minister Kejriwal a “terrorist.” Shah branded him a liar and alleged that the Kejriwal Government in Delhi failed to fulfil the promises of installing 15 lakh CCTV cameras, procuring 5,000 DTC buses, opening 1,000 schools, regularising temporary workers and providing free wi-fi. He went to the extent of comparing him with Adolf Hitler. Despite the high decibel campaign, the BJP neither had a manifesto nor could it succeed in projecting a dominant face against Kejriwal. This was something that it attempted at during the national elections by making Prime Minister Modi its prime ministerial candidate and turning the elections into more or less a presidential form of battle.

However, the BJP’s nationalistic agenda of merging “culture” and “religion” with “nationalism” and seeking electoral success based on vote divisions was effectively countered by the AAP, which focussed exclusively on development issues like water, power, school, mohalla clinics, sewer and free ride scheme for women. Further, AAP also successfully ensured that it does not fall prey to the anti-Hindu/pro-minority image that was successfully used by the BJP in other State elections.

This, in a sense could be read in Kejriwal’s chanting of Hanuman Chalisa or his temple visits. However, more than appeasement, it points to the indispensability of a politics of belongingness, prevalence of a politics of national identity, one that can articulate either violently or in a subtle manner but cannot simply be erased.

This understanding needs to consider a common sense that flows underneath the vox populi of Delhi. Even though it resembles political conservatism, it is couched within a wide variety of day-to-day vocabulary of politics that simultaneously harbours fear for the other and at the same time rejects any kind of politics that rests solely on violent and communal nationalist rant. The success of AAP leaves residue for a new political imaginary that could probably recast Indian politics within an eclectic frame, fusing the narrative of governance and nationalism. It may redefine conservatism via technologies of governance, representing more sections through negotiation between imagined majorities and those making the idea of nation itself more inclusive.

However, it is difficult to talk about the future. Though AAP has made an impressive entry into electoral politics, it is not certain whether this sort of inroads can be repeated in other States with the same agenda and programmes. Besides, it will be difficult for it to move on with these ambiguous and simplistic perspectives, particularly on core structural questions of caste and land among others.

As was argued by SP Shukla, AAP refuses to see the current situation as part of a historical process that started long ago. Its concern is short-term. Its focus is myopic. And it stops short of any radical analysis or measure. But responses amid the Delhi elections are noteworthy. They need to be thought of as signposts of the changing nature of the political discourse in the Indian context.

4,13-2-20,Reinvigorate the medical sector,"The Government has paved the way to institute a separate regulatory body for medical devices. It must walk an extra mile to device regulatory provisions, too

According to a recent survey conducted by Anna University, only one in five ventilators used in hospitals across Tamil Nadu has been certified safe for use by biomedical engineers. Further, findings showed that at least 35 per cent of the medical equipment used in hospitals did not pass calibration tests. While we do not have concrete data on complications and deaths caused by malfunctioning equipment, it is not hard to imagine a scenario where treatments are prescribed based on faulty readings, leading to catastrophic consequences. This scenario is all too common in States across the country. The lack of a regulatory framework for medical devices is the main reason behind this laxity. At present, only 23 categories of medical devices are regulated by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. India will not be able to deliver efficient healthcare unless it regulates the rest of the devices.

According to industry associations, the Niti Aayog’s proposal to institute a separate regulatory body for medical devices was long overdue. While the industry awaits a full draft of the 41-page document to be uploaded in the public domain, people in the medical device manufacturing industry have expressed their desire for central regulatory provisions. Any regulatory provision, if implemented correctly, will give the industry a clear idea of the legal requirements that need to be followed in a centrally-regulated market.

Impact of Ayushman Bharat: Even as this healthcare scheme has successfully completed a year, the medical device industry remains at a nascent stage. However, the National Health Protection scheme has led to an increase in patient pool as well as bed capacity. Thus, the medical device industry is all set to become one of the biggest beneficiaries, especially in categories like instruments and equipment and disposables and consumables. A shift in disease burden also means that certain categories like diagnostic equipment will witness greater growth than others. If the scheme is implemented effectively, India can expect a compound annual growth rate of at least 30 per cent over the next three years.

At present, the country imports over 80 per cent of its medical devices and the Government has made its intention clear to make India one of the global hubs for medical devices, both in manufacturing and distribution. This move will attract investors, both Indian and overseas. The lack of predictability has been one of the biggest factors that has been holding back investment in local manufacturing.

Implementation: According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, medical devices are regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Medical Device Rules 2017. The industry is awaiting an official announcement to migrate to an independent medical device Act. If the Government is intent on regulating medical devices under a separate regulatory body, it has to fast track its implementation. It must clear the air on this matter. This will give the healthcare sector a clarity on future regulation. Manufacturers will also be able to obtain licences under a streamlined framework. Local manufacturing can be encouraged and, thus, lead to a reduction in the costs incurred due to imports. Further, more hospitals will be able to procure devices and improve infrastructure. Patients, too, will be able to benefit due to better diagnoses and treatments. Overall, it will help India move closer to achieving universal health coverage in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

It is equally important to ensure that the regulatory body has competent bio-medical engineers, technocrats, scientists, lab technicians, clinicians and surgeons on its panel. The range of medical devices is quite vast and they must not be seen through the lens of drugs and cosmetics as medical devices do not have any systemic effect/pharmacological actions.

Improper implementation can have adverse consequences. Lack of regulation will lead to unscrupulous manufacturers taking advantage of the loopholes. They may end up manufacturing low-grade equipment, which will worsen the state of healthcare. To play it safe, the Government can start experimenting with just a handful of new devices in the market and see if the transition is smooth. Meanwhile, it can seek expertise of the players in this industry to draft the Bill. Once it is drafted and approved by various stakeholders, it can be passed in Parliament. This will ensure that the regulatory environment is fair and strong, encouraging positive growth in the industry and bolster the Government’s “Make in India” campaign.

5,13-2-20,An invisible air pollution crisis,"COPD is often overlooked but is a serious health threat. Given that pollution is one of the leading causes of this ailment, the Government must roll out specific and targetted programmes that can mitigate its prevalence

A spike in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coupled with an increase in asthma attacks, is a cause for concern. Both diseases are soon to become new indicators for spiraling pollution levels, especially in the National Capital Region (NCR). One reason for the worsening health of the citizens is the deteriorating Air Quality Index (AQI) levels. This can be gauged from the fact that the World Health Organisation (WHO) specifies 60 as the advisable limit in urban areas for AQI. But Delhi consistently shows an AQI of 400 or even more on most days.

Interestingly, air pollution was not on the agenda for any political party in the just-concluded elections in Delhi. None of the contesting parties touched upon this issue in a detailed manner.

The spectacular win of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), too, hinged on a host of other issues and had little to do with air pollution. The ruling party, too, does not have any clue as to how it can rein in runaway pollution levels. All of this points towards a grim healthcare scenario for the citizens of Delhi in the days to come. As the Central and the State Governments flounder with their policies that are ineffective in maintaining a healthy air quality, the young and the elderly continue to spend more time in hospitals.

Diseases such as bronchitis, COPD and lung cancer have a direct relationship with the air people breathe. Apart from this, every year during winters, there is a noticeable jump of at least 30 per cent in patients with respiratory complaints arising due to air pollution. With people becoming a victim of the specter of worsening air quality, it is puzzling as to why the Government has failed to take immediate remedial measures. To understand the extent of the issue, the Government must commission a fact-finding panel to quantify the loss to health and commerce due to pollution levels. Surely, the panel will come up with some shocking numbers. This is evident from the fact that a recent study by an NGO showed that nearly 100,000 children under five years of age succumb to severe air pollution every year.

As the national capital heads into ICU, thanks to worsening ambient air quality, the authorities have remained a mute spectator as the victims themselves. There is an urgent need to galvanise the concerned departments into action before the price for inaction becomes too much to bear and takes the form of a public health emergency.

So, what is ailing India, especially Delhi? Respiratory diseases, especially COPD, come hard on financial resources. According to a report by the National Commission for Macroeconomics and Health (NCMH), India already spends Rs 32,000 crore annually for treating COPD patients. This shows the disease burden, both health wise and on the economy as well.

Given these difficult conditions, the Government must roll out a comprehensive programme that is directed specifically towards respiratory diseases that are triggered due to any kind of pollution. The programme must factor in threat factors, diagnosis challenges and identify risk factors, too. Tests and diagnosis are an important aspect for treatment. Many patients suffering from COPD escape detection until it’s too late.

Diagnosis that establishes the presence of COPD includes spirometry tests which are not usually available in many hospitals and primary healthcare centres. To get a grip on respiratory disorders, the State Government in Delhi can start a door-to-door healthcare initiative that is specially aimed at children and the elderly. Under this initiative, volunteers of the health department can visit households, conduct spirometry tests, take notings and, thus, identify the disease before it takes a heavy toll.

The “Health at your Doorstep” initiative of the Government will go a long way in restoring faith of the people and help them understand the importance of health parameters. Based upon the success of this pilot programme, it can be rolled out in other States, too. Efforts of the authorities and the Government will be useful only when they translate to saving the lives of the people. This should be the main focus of any Government initiative. The Government must constantly assess the efficacy of its programmes and quantify how many lives have been saved. These figures will help prove the success of the initiative as well. Pollution is here to stay but we can reduce the toll it takes. Specific and targetted initiatives that are quantifiable can do just that.

7,13-2-20,Min expresses concern over quality of work,"Panchayat and Rural Development Minister Kamleshwar Patel, while reviewing the State-level works of Rural Engineering Services, has directed that all incomplete works should be completed by March 31, 2020. He said that strict action should also be taken against the consultant and the contractor responsible for the delay in the works. Additional Chief Secretary Manoj Shrivastava and RES Field officers were present in the meeting.

Minister Patel said that all officers from the Superintending Engineer to the Sub-Engineer should regularly monitor the works. The days of field visits of engineers must be fixed.

Expressing concern over the quality of construction works, he said that for the works which have been delayed due to the wrong design of the consultant, the accountability of the consultant should be fixed, recoveries should be made from them and they should be blacklisted. Patel said that criminal cases should be registered against contractors who run away from work midway.

Kamleshwar Patel said that the accountability of engineers will also be determined in case of delay in construction works. He said that cases which are incomplete due to forest land dispute, should be resolved in the district with the intervention of the Collector. He said that he will himself hold a discussion with the departmental ministers to resolve cases at the Government level.

Additional Chief Secretary Manoj Shrivastava directed to prepare the work manual of RES immediately. He said that the work should be monitored through geo-tagging. Photographs of four stages of each construction work should be made online through geo-tagging.

The Chief Engineer informed that 584 works of RES are in progress. These include 197 works of Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana Gravel, 52 of Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana BT, 115 of Aajeevika Mission, 2 of Stadium, 2 of Haat-Bazaar and 175 of Chief Minister Gram Sarovar.

14,13-2-20,UP Budget session beginning today expected to be stormy,"The Budget session of Uttar Pradesh Legislature commencing from Thursday is expected to be stormy with the opposition gearing up to corner the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party over various issues, including anti-CAA protests, deteriorating law and order and police atrocities on women and the poor.

Samajwadi Party has repeatedly disturbed the Assembly’s inaugural session of the year and prevented the Governor from reading out the address for the last three years.

This issue was again discussed in the all-party meeting convened by Assembly Speaker Hriday Naryan Dikshit on Wednesday.

The Speaker sought the cooperation of opposition parties in smooth opening of the Budget session and urged them that the Governor be allowed to read the address.

The Speaker also presided over a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee to approve the agenda of the House.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also appealed to the opposition parties to maintain the dignity of the House during the Governor’s address to the joint sitting.

A Samajwadi Party MLA however said, “We will welcome the new Governor as per old tradition.”

The opposition parties are upbeat to mat the ruling BJP on different issues, following its defeat and the landslide victory of Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi Assembly polls.

The session will begin with the address of Governor Anandiben Patel to members of both Houses, while the Yogi government will table its over Rs 5-trillion budgetary for 2020-21 in the Assembly on February 18.

The session will continue till March 7, when the budget would be approved.

This will be the fourth budget of the Yogi government with the budget size crossing Rs 5 lakh crore-mark. In 2019-20, the total budget size was around Rs 4.85 lakh crore.

UP government has also fixed a target to achieve one trillion dollar economy by 2024 to contribute to the country’s target of 5 trillion dollar economy.

Apparently, the opposition has geared up to take on the ruling BJP inside the Assembly over different issues related to people, including atrocities on women protesting over CAA/NRC, unemployment, stray cattle, law and order and others. Legislators of different parties met separately to chalk out their strategies on Wednesday .

During the session, two CAG reports will also be tabled in the Assembly, while more than two dozen bills are slated to come up for discussion in both Houses.

Meanwhile, leader of the opposition and Samajwadi Party member Ram Govind Chaudhary said the opposition would remain united to floor the government over its failures.

“Rise in corruption, deterioration of law and order besides failure in providing relief to people through different welfare schemes would be the main issues before the opposition,” Chaudhary said, adding that atrocities on women and children protesting against CAA and NRC would be a prominent issue.

“We are in touch with other opposition parties for better floor coordination in the House,” he said.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna, who is also the state Finance Minister, said that the government was ready to discuss and debate all issues to be raised by the opposition.

“But the onus is on the opposition as it has to raise the issue properly as per rules. But if they create a ruckus and block functioning of the House, then the session will not be fruitful,” he stated.

BSP leader Lalji Verma and Congress Legislative Party leader Aradhana Mishra said that their members were fully prepared to take on the government on all issues.

According to the plan, four days have been kept for debate on the motions of thanks on Governor’s address in the Assembly and thereafter a debate on the budget will start.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/up-budget-session-beginning-today-expected-to-be-stormy.html
15,13-2-20,Cong to protect rightsof citizens: Priyanka,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra stressed that her party would fight to save the country’s communal harmony and ensure that democratic rights of every citizen were restored.

Priyanka interacted with protesters holding a demonstration against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in Azamgarh on Wednesday.

“This is a fight to save the country, our democracy, our Constitution and our traditions. We will not back out from our fight. I am honoured to be a part of this,” Priyanka said on the sidelines while meeting the family members of anti-CAA protesters who were killed or injured in police action in Azamgarh.

The Congress leader said that she had gone to Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Lucknow and Varanasi to meet anti-CAA protesters and their families. “No one can stop me from going anywhere to meet anti-CAA demonstrators and to join them in their struggle,” she said.

“You have seen the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttarakhand which has stressed that reservation is not a constitutional right,” Priyanka said, alleging that the state government was trying to destroy the Constitution.

“You all have to stand up because all the laws which they are planning to bring in are not against one community but against the entire Constitution,” she said amid slogan shouting by the crowd.

Talking about police atrocities on anti-CAA women protesters in Biliriyaganj (Azamgarh), the Congress leader said, “The police beat up women and even ransacked their houses. Several youths were arrested along with Maulana Madni Three minors were also arrested. I will complain to the National Human Rights Commission about police atrocities in Azamgarh.”

On the directive of Priyanka, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ and Congress Legislative Party leader Aradhana Mishra went to the hospital to meet Sarvari Bano, who fell ill during the anti-CAA protest in Azamgarh and has been in the ICU for the past one week.

During the meeting, women narrated their ordeal to Priyanka and alleged that police officials were threatening them regularly. They also said that the police sprayed water at them so that they suspend their protest.

Interestingly, during her visit, Priyanka not only targeted the Union and UP governments but also Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, who represents Azamgarh in the Lok Sabha.

The Congress leader’s visit to Azamgarh came against the backdrop of posters claiming Akhilesh Yadav to be ‘missing’ being pasted on walls at important places of the city. The posters questioned the MP’s absence in the wake of police action against women protesting against the CAA last week.

Accusing the BJP government at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh of trying to destroy the Constitution, Priyanka dubbed both as ‘anti-poor and anti-people’.

This is the Congress general secretary’s second visit to eastern UP in less than a week as earlier on Sunday she visited Varanasi on the occasion of Ravidas Jayanti.

Later this month, Priyanka is scheduled to address six rallies in the state starting from Basti on February 23 and take on the BJP government over farmers’ issues.

The Congress will take on the BJP regime in UP over issues like stray cattle, payment of dues to cane growers, irregularities in procurement of paddy and suicide by farmers in Bundelkhand. The party would also demand loan waiver for farmers, 50 per cent subsidy on power bills, cow sheds and watchdog allowance in every village.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-to-protect-rightsof-citizens--priyanka.html
16,13-2-20,"Deoband ‘Gangotri of terrorism’, says Giriraj","Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Giriraj Singh stirred a controversy by terming leading Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband at Saharanpur as a ‘’Gangotri of terrorism”.

Darul Uloom Deoband and Samajwadi Party condemned the statement and demanded an apology from the minister while UP Minister of State Mohsin Raza and UP Shia Central Waqf Board Chairman Waseem Rizvi endorsed Singh’s statement.

“I do not know what it is about this place, it produces people similar to ISIS chief Baghdadi and Jamat Ul Dawa chief and Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed. I got to know that both were students of Deoband. I believe that this place is not a centre of learning. In fact, it is a den of terrorism,” Singh said in Saharanpur where he had gone to meet Seer Swami Brahmananand Saraswati at the latter’s ashram on Wednesday.

The Union minister reiterated his remark that those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Shaheen Bagh and elsewhere were leading a “Khilafat movement”.

Earlier in December, BJP MP Sanjeev Balyan had also hinted at the role of Darul Uloom Deoband in the violence that occurred during anti-CAA protests in the state.

“They are not anti-CAA, they are anti-India. It’s a Khilafat movement. Had it not been anti-India, then Sharjeel Imam would not have asked to break India and Assam and urge India to become an Islamic nation. Slogans glorifying Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon would not be raised. Hatred is being injected into women, children. Wherever in India, their population exists, they are engaging in Khilafat movement,” the Union Minister said.

Commenting on the population of Muslims, Singh remarked, “Their population has reached 20 crore. Resources available are only 2 per cent. That’s why strictest population control law should be implemented. Those who refuse to accept it, be it from any religion, their voting rights should be taken away.”

Responding to the Union minister statement’s, Deobandi Ulema Qari Sayyid Ishaq Gora condemned the statement and demanded an immediate apology.

“The statement by Giriraj Singh is baseless and unfortunate. He should withdraw his comment and apologise not only to a community but to the whole nation. If he believes that madarsas are the hub of terrorism, then I would like to suggest him to take admission in a madarsa to see what kind of teaching is imparted in this institution. We teach students love and respect for our nation,” he said.

Another cleric, Mufti Asad Kasami, challenged Singh to prove that Baghdadi and Hafiz Saeed were students of Darul Uloom Deoband. The cleric also said that the institution always stood by the country in its fight against terrorism.

Meanwhile, UP Minister of State Mohsin Raza endorsed the Union minister’s statement, saying, “Western UP is notorious for anti-national activities and the presence of ISI modules. Several persons have been arrested by security agencies and that is why Giriraj Singh said this.”

UP Shia Central Waqf Board Chairman Waseem Rizvi said, “Darul Uloom Deoband is a centre promoting extremism and radicalisation of Muslims and the government must take effective action to curb such activities.”

Condemning the statement, Samajwadi Party said, “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is the fountainhead of terrorism and Singh’s statement is nothing but frustration of the BJP following the debacle in Delhi Assembly polls.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/deoband----gangotri-of-terrorism-----says-giriraj.html

As per news agency, a bill of Rs 67,000 had not been paid and a Power department spokesman said that the disconnection was done in a “routine exercise”.

However, Mayawati’s family members promptly deposited a sum of Rs 50,000 after which power supply was restored to the house.

A senior Power department official in Lucknow said that there was no politics in the incident. “We are disconnecting power supply wherever bills are pending and this was just one of the cases. Power supply was restored after the arrears were paid.”

Meanwhile in Lucknow, Mayawati attacked the Centre over steep hike in the price of LPG (cooking gas) cylinder and termed it as a “cruel decision” against the poor.

Reacting to the hike of Rs 144.5 per LPG cylinder due to spurt in benchmark global rates of the fuel, the BSP chief said that the move would hit crores of poor and hard working people who were battered by “severe inflation”.

“It would have been better had the Centre worked as a welfare state as embodied in the Constitution,” she tweeted after the price notification of state-owned oil firms.

LPG price was increased to Rs 858.50 per 14.2 kg cylinder from Rs 714 previously, making it the steepest hike in rates since January, 2014 when the prices had gone up by Rs 220 per cylinder to Rs 1,241.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/power-supply-to-maya---s-badalpur-mansion-disconnected--restored.html
18,13-2-20,‘Kaagaz’ relives the agony of living dead,"‘Kaagaz’, a biopic on Lal Bihari Mritak testifying his struggle for the living dead, would be released across India on April 24. The film aims to expose the glaring truth about the agony of people declared dead by unscrupulous relatives in a bid to steal their assets.

‘Kaagaz’, starring Pankaj Tripathi and Monal Gajjar in lead roles and directed by famous actor, producer and director Satish Kaushik, has been shot in Uttar Pradesh and is the second movie after ‘Chhapaak’ which is set to stir the social conscience of masses.

When Lal Bihari ‘Mritak’ started his struggle for the living dead by forming Mritak Sangh, an association of ‘dead’, he never thought that one day he would become the subject of a movie.

“The living dead is a big issue. Year after year people are declared dead by close kin to grab their property. This phenomenon is not limited to Uttar Pradesh. It is spread across the country,” Mritak told this reporter.

Lal Bihari of Mubarakpur in Azamgarh, who later added the suffix ‘Mritak’ to his name, was declared ‘dead’ in revenue records following the death of his parents and his home and land were seized by his relatives.

A victim of corruption and betrayal of his own family members, Lal Bihari fought for 18 years to prove that he was alive.

To prove that he was alive, he fought elections against former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh from Allahabad Lok Sabha constituency and against Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram in 1988. He also contested election against former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi from Amethi, threw pamphlets in UP Vidhan Sabha and even got himself arrested and demanded widow pension for his wife.

Following a struggle of 18 years, the government at last conceded that he was indeed alive.

Kaagaz directed by Satish Kaushik, famous for his works like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Tere Naam and numerous others, revolves around the persistence and steely resolve of a man seeking justice. The film was mostly shot in Lucknow, Sitapur and Azamgarh in UP.

Satish Kaushik said that he came across Lal Bihari’s story through an article in a newspaper after which he contacted him and later got the rights for the film in 2003.

“The idea of making a movie stayed with me for a long time as movies on such subjects were not so popular at that time, I postponed the project. Now, when biopic are accepted I made the film which will be released soon,” he said.

Well-known actor Pankaj Tripathi, famous for proving his mettle by way of movies like Gangs of Wasseypur, Stree, Masaan and web-series like Sacred Games and Mirzapur, is playing the lead role as Lal Bihari Mritak in the movie.

Responding to a question as to why he chose actor Pankaj Tripathi for the lead role, Kaushik said that he was a great actor with the ability to bring alive any character through his acting prowess.

“I was extremely impressed by him as an actor. He has a spontaneity in his acting,” he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---kaagaz----relives-the--agony-of-living-dead.html

After the revelation that Alka (19) and her love interest Ankit opened fire at her parents, killing the father and critically injuring the mother, the police arrested the duo on Wednesday.

SSP Mathura, Shalabh Mathur, said that a complaint was filed by slain Army personnel Chetram’s brother Om Prakash, suspecting that the firing was orchestrated and was not incidental as claimed by Alka.

Prakash told the police that Alka was in love with Ankit and as Chetram was against the affair, on Monday night, Alka took out her father’s pistol and called her lover. Later they opened fire at Chetram and when his wife Rajkumari rushed to his rescue, they fired at her with the intention of eliminating her, but she survived.

Later Alka inflicted an injury on her hand and cooked up a story that her father opened fire at her and her mother and as he tried to shoot her minor brother Adarsh, she snatched the pistol and in the process he got fatally shot.

On the basis of complaint, the police recorded the statements of Rajkumari and Adarsh, both of whom confirmed that it was Alka and her lover who opened fire.

Doctors who examined Alka confirmed that the injury was self-inflicted.

After the evidences cropped up, Alka was taken into custody and a case of murder was registered against her.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mathura-murder--takes-new-twist---girl-killed-father.html
20,13-2-20,BJP regime anti-Dalit and anti-Backward: Rajbhar,"Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath government, former minister and Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar said that the Bharatiya Janata Party regime was anti-Dalit and anti-Backward as it was promoting the rich, depriving the poor of their basic rights.

Addressing an ‘Adhikar Chetna Rally’ along with former minister Babu Singh Kushwaha in Jahurabad area of Ghazipur district on Wednesday, Rajbhar said that people belonging to deprived sections of society were neither getting government benefits nor basic rights as enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

“They are facing hardship because of the lop-sided policies of the BJP government which is loaded in favour of the rich,” he said.

He said the fact was that around 65 per cent of the poor were languishing in jail for petty crimes as they could not afford lawyers while the rich were being released after committing heinous crimes due to their resources to fight cases in court.

“This government is only promoting the upper castes while the backwards and MBCs are languishing,” he said.

In his address, Kushwaha said that the Yogi Adityanath government was even partial in reimbursing fees of students. “General category students are around seven lakh while backward caste students are 21 lakh in UP. But this government has released a budget of Rs 609 crore for upper caste students and Rs 600 crore for backward caste students. The latter amount should have been Rs 2070 crore,” he said.

“This government is privatising government jobs in a clandestine way so that the poor are deprived of jobs as reservation is not there in private sector,” Kushwaha said.

Local leaders like Ramdhani Bind, Prem Chandra Prajapati, Babu Ram Pal, Anil Singh Chauhan and Dr Arvind Rajbhar too addressed the rally.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/bjp-regime-anti-dalit-and--anti-backward--rajbhar.html

25,13-2-20,Maoist with bounty on head surrenders,"A dreaded Maoist surrendered before the Malkangiri SP on Wednesday. He was carrying a cash reward of 4 lakh on his head.

The 30-year-old Jipro Habika, a resident of Khajaguda under the Narayanpatna police limits in Koraput district, was working as an area committee member of Gumma Area Committee under MKVB Division of AOBSZC.

Jipro had joined the third company of Central Regional Committee (CRC) of the banned CPI( Maoist) group in the year 2012. He was involved in nine criminal incidents including murder, exchange of fire and blasting of vehicles.

He was the suspect in killing of Naib Sarpanch G Sundar Rao at Puteru village in Koraput district in 2016, MLA KS Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma near Dunguriguda Mandal of Araku Valley in Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh in 2018, an official release said.

Jipro decided to join the mainstream of society when he saw various developmental activities undertaken by the State Government and realised the futility of Maoists’ path of violence.

He also realised that the Maoist leaders are using innocent tribals of their region for their own individual interests and making them fight amongst themselves; and once their benefits is over, they are branded as police informers and killed mercilessly. He was also disappointed with the behaviour of senior Maoist leaders on regional feeling between Telugu and other cadres. Increasing police operations and successes in interior areas and subsequent continuous fear of police action also contributed to his decision to surrender.

32,13-2-20,Formulate plan for city drainage issue: Aparajita to CM,"Bhubaneswar BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi has written to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik urging him to formulate a comprehensive master plan for addressing the longstanding waterlogging and drainage problem in the city during the rainy season.

She mentioned in the letter that the issue had been discussed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development during its recent visit here on January 17 and 18. During the discussions, it came to the fore that a plan prepared by Meinhardt, Singapore in 2008 partly addresses the requirement, but it lacks in terms of detailing and is inadequate as it does not factor in a lot of essential requirements, including land acquisition costs.

While this plan proposed construction of natural drains in two phases, the need for construction of all internal drains and making them part of an overall plan for effective discharge of storm water has not been fully considered. It has also come to the notice of the Parliamentary Standing Committee that construction of 13 (3 additional) natural drains would require land acquisition and freeing of Government land from encroachments. This has not been considered while preparing the Detailed Project Report in 2008, Sarangi wrote and enclosed a list of existing natural storm water drains in Bhubaneswar and 37 vulnerable locations as identified by the BMC for the CM’s perusal.

In view of the impending rainy season, she urged Patnaik to issue appropriate instructions to the relevant authorities for (a) gainful utilisation of Rs 110 crore and ensuring that drainage work is undertaken keeping in view the requirements of 37 vulnerable points and not spending by just distributing it ward wise, and (b) a systematic and sustainable approach towards de-silting of drains and preparation of a comprehensive master plan by taking into consideration all natural and internal drains and an overall cost implication thereof.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/formulate-plan-for-city-drainage-issue--aparajita-to-cm.html

34,13-2-20,State crosses nat’l average in MGNREGS,"The State has crossed the national average in many indicators of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

This was reveled at the governing body meeting of the MGNREGS Society held under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy at the Lok Seva Bhawan here on Wednesday. Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water Principal Secretary Deo Ranjan Kumar Singh outlined the issues for discussion.

Tripathy directed the departments to take up more need based projects in convergence with MGNREGS.

Odisha is ahead of national average in the indicators like project completion, geo-tagging, timely payment of wages, individual beneficiary based projects, e-payment, and employment generation. Around 91 per cent of the projects up to 2018-19 have been completed against the national average of 89.5 per cent. Similarly, 95 per cent of the assets created under MGNREGS during Phase-I and 84 per cent of assets created under Phase-II have been geo-tagged against the national average of 91 per cent and 79 per cent, respectively. With regard to timely payment of wages, 99.4 per cent of payments have been made within the scheduled timeline against the national average of 96.5 per cent. The percentage of the completion of individual beneficiary based projects has gone up to 86 per cent against national average of 68 per cent.

35,13-2-20,AAP won more easily as saffron brigade used hate tricks,"It’s just a rare coincidence that Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP captured Delhi yet again on his wife Sunita’s birthday on Tuesday. His third-time sweeping victory was forecast quite in good time, though the BJP master strategists and Delhi boss Manoj Tiwari had kept boasting of a conclusive victory.

Appropriately, Kejriwal should have decided to take oath as the first ‘hatrick' Chief Minister of Delhi on February 13 on which day in 1931, Delhi was officially declared as the capital of British India. The British administration had shifted capital from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911 and King George the Fifth had come to India to lay the foundation-stone. The modern location of Delhi has been described as ‘Indraprastha’ in the scriptures and ancient history books. Experts have discovered that a monarch of the Gupta dynasty had founded Delhi as a seat of power in the third century AD. Later, somewhere near Surajkund of today, Raja Anangpal Tomar, who had founded the Tomar dynasty in AD 736, made Delhi his principal place of administration. He had probably chosen the Aravalli hills in Mehrauli as his headquarters for strategic military advantages. Between 3000 BC and 17th century AD, Delhi was a site for seven different cities and referred to as Hasthinapur meaning 'elephant-city'.

Much later, the Delhi Sultanate kept the city a vibrant place of power and commerce. But subsequently, the city lost glory and slipped into oblivion until Shah Jahan, the fifth great Mughal, shifted capital from Agra to the great city in 1638. The Mughal emperor too considered the Yamuna river to be more resplendent alongside Delhi than in Agra. Over time, 14 walled gates came up protecting the city. Five of them, Ajmeri Gate, Lahori Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Delhi Gate and Turkman Gate, are still in place as mute witnesses to the grand history.

The British Raj which formally commenced only after the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 after the crown took over charge from the East India Company. The capital of British India shifted from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911. The reason was that Delhi was the financial and political centre of many empires that had earlier ruled India successfully. Immediately after Delhi became the capital of India, a temporary secretariat building was constructed in North Delhi in 1912 to seat officials. Four million British pounds were spent on shifting the administration facility from Kolkata to Delhi.

Construction of the administrative buildings and facilities began in earnest and Delhi became ready in 1931. British architect and planner Herbert Baker and Edwin Lutyens had designed the modern city. And one Sobha Singh was given the contract job of finishing all civil works. He started work as soon as the First World War over in 1918. Lord Irwin formally inaugurated Delhi in 1931 on February 13.

Post-Independence India witnessed only Congress people in power until the mid-1970s when the Congress was dethroned for half a term only. Badly defamed Indira Gandhi, vanquished for dictatorial style of ruling India, returned to power and ruled until her assassination in 1984. The Congress slowly became weaker after that. The BJP rose from nowhere, won elections and enjoyed one full term under the stewardship of most charismatic Atal Behari Vajpayee between 1990 and 1995. All pollsters forecast a thumping comeback for Vajpayee which never happened. What caused the unexplained fall was the arrogant display of power and wealth by some of the frontline saffron leaders. They held all party meetings in five-star hotels and splurged enormous amounts of money on a horribly stupid 'India Shining' publicity. The ordinary citizen eventually lost trust, and the Congress managed to scrape through and enjoy two consecutive terms.

The BJP again dislodged the Congress from power in 2014. Highly paid market strategists came by and victory was achieved. Modi proved to be a popular leader only because of his humble background, personal honesty, and a number of eye-catching theatrical acts in public. All the same, Amit Shah and Modi kept committing errors of being too loud and boastful. Their tall poll promises of employment and black money recovery were nearly impossible to keep. Further, they resorted to hate narratives to belittle or slur the stature of potent, highly-adorable opponents.

Meanwhile, the greenhorn Aam Aaadmi Party (AAP) headed by a former IITian bureaucrat had materialised to drive both BJP and Congress crazy with fear and confusion. The AAP promised sea improvement in the critically-essential services and goods including incredibly cheap or nearly free electricity, water, healthcare and education. Kejriwal became messiah for keeping all his promises within months of coming to power. For all this, the BJP with all its might was forced to bite dust in Delhi. The AAP has proved beyond doubt that life-supporting essential commodities like power, water and basic healthcare do matter so much to the ordinary citizens.

In the latest fight against the AAP, the BJP suffered massively more because of hate speeches and baseless blames dumped on the AAP leaders who have made things happen even without any control over land and police. The more Shah and Modi hurled hurting words at the AAP, the stronger the voters' decision turned to bring back the truly-performing AAP. The BJP is only licking wounds now in utter cluelessness, remorse and shame.

The Delhi voters know Kejriwal can do hardly any good in the national arena. But at home, he has no match in vision and implementation of the promises made. While making door-to-door campaign, Kejriwal had the guts to tell voters that they should dismiss him if his work has not yielded any benefits for them.

The AAP has brought down prices of water and electricity by only plugging leaking holes. Corrupt officials have been nabbed and pilferage fully controlled. Advanced healthcare is absolutely free; and Government schools now have better facilities than many so-called elitist public schools run by profit-crazy private entrepreneurs. The blood sucking, expensive private schools have been ruthlessly axed for their indiscriminate fee-increasing sprees. Presently, Government schools look more plush and sophisticated than private schools known hitherto for glamour and glitter.

It seems Kejriwal is out to compete with Naveen Patnaik in winning election after election by only proving to voters that he is simple, honest and striving incessantly for truly measurable ‘good governance'.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aap-won-more-easily-as-saffron-brigade-used-hate-tricks.html

40,13-2-20,Girl serious after receiving wrong treatment at VIMSAR,"A poor girl from Burla township undergoing treatment in VIMSAR is now struggling for life due to the wrong treatment of the doctors there.

Following a boil on her face, she came for treatment. Doctors diagnosed it to be Haemangioma. And in the OPD ward of the ENT department, the doctors gave her an injection that ultimately didn’t suit her and reacted to severe extent.

“The reaction was so acute that it even led to tissue death immediately,” admitted Superintendent of VIMSAR Dr Jayashree Dora.

“But the mistake, if any, is purely accidental and a committee has been formed to inquire into the entire incident,” Dr Dora added. She further said that for further improved treatment she has been referred to SCB Medical College, Cuttack, but her family members have opted for Kalinga Hospital at Bhubaneswar and medical authorities here are considering their request.

“In Kalinga Hospital, plastic surgery will be done to her and she is sure to improve,” she said.

However, the doctors and the Superintendent further admitted the incident to be totally unfortunate but never intentional as no patient was an enemy before a doctor.

But there is growing resentment against the doctors from the family members and the public at large who blame that the casual approach of the doctors and particularly of Dr Ipsita Panda and Dr Sujata Panda caused such pitiable situation for a poor girl.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/girl-serious-after-receiving-wrong-treatment-at-vimsar.html

Bagchi said “As I look at the Educational Institution like yours, it requires time and is a process of infrastructure creation. The base is physical infrastructure and physical infrastructure can be created by anyone. But beyond physical infrastructure comes the digital infrastructure in this world. But differentiation comes when they build Intellectual infrastructure is what makes one Institution different from the other institution.

49,13-2-20,Conservationists want iconic Ganesh shrine spared,"Conservationists have demanded that the Government must not demolish the iconic Ganesh Temple near the Lingaraj Temple here.

The small temple dates back to the 11th Century, contemporary to the Lingaraj Temple. It was originally one of the subsidiary temples and was inside the complex before the wall was built in later years. It has been listed as a protected monument years ago and is one of the smallest Ganesh temples of the Old City.

Presently inside the premises of the BM High School, the small temple is seven feet in height and a five-tiered Pidha Deula of the Kalingan order.

The administration has dug up the area near the temple and has made a small pedestal inside the verandah of the school for installing the idol. A few rooms of the school too have been demolished. After the idol is removed, the entire temple along with the Navagraha panel will be razed to the ground. This will happen in the next few days.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Co-operation Disaster Management exercise, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had said,“ Heritage sites not only represent our cultural identity, but are also a driving force for our economy. They must be preserved for future generation at any cost.”

It is surprising that the temple, which was preserved years ago will now be demolished. It can be left alone, standing in the middle of the corridor without causing any hindrance, said activist Anil Dhir of INTACH, adding, ""The Archeological Survey of India should put a stop to such activity.”

State Convener of INTACH AB Tripathy is of the opinion that if the removal of the temple is imminent, then it should be handed over to a proper agency and relocated to another place.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/conservationists-want-iconic-ganesh-shrine-spared.html

""This Government has continued to be in the speech mode, refusing to come in the work mode, months after the election process ended,"" he said, alleging that the Government is citing its speeches as its achievements.

""Many schools don't have enough teachers, but they (Government) are taking no steps to fill up the vacancies for 40,000 teachers. There are other burning issues facing other sections of the society, including farmers, but this Government is doing nothing. Their only motto seems to be ''look busy, do nothing'', Hooda said at a press conference here.

He said the Government may claim they have done 101 works during their first 100 days in office, the truth is that all they have done is make speeches with nothing on the governance front. ""We had highlighted mining and paddy scams, but no probe has been ordered so far,"" he said.

The former Haryana Chief Minister also claimed that at over 28 per cent, Haryana has the highest unemployment rate in the country and rural consumption is down.

Hooda questioned the logic behind the State Government's pre-budget consultation exercise in the absence of the economic survey report and said it will be difficult to give concrete suggestions. ""In the absence of the economic survey report, how will we know what the State's economic situation is,"" he said.

After holding discussions with various stakeholders, including industrialists, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar will hold a pre-budget meeting with legislators from February 17 to 19 to deliberate on sectoral allocations. Hooda said he will attend the meeting.

The Congress leader claimed that Haryana's debt has increased three-fold from Rs 61,000 crore to Rs 1.81 lakh crore under the BJP regime and demanded a white paper on state's economic situation.

Asked to comment on the Congress' rout in the Delhi Assembly polls, Hooda said, ""In a democracy, you have to respect the people's mandate.""

""As far as the performance of the Congress in the Delhi polls is concerned, there should be introspection in the party at the national level,"" he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/only-speeches--no-work-in-state--hooda.html
57,13-2-20,NABARD to meet needs of State,"Punjab Rural Development and Panchayats Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa on Wednesday urged the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to make its credit norms suitable to the State, which needs to develop the existing basic infrastructure.

At the same time, he urged the country’s apex development financial institution to make policies, programs and guidelines according to the specific needs of the States.

Bajwa was speaking during the State Credit Seminar for 2020-21 organized by the NABARD with the credit potential of Rs 2,30,664.81 crore for the State of Punjab. Bajwa also released the State focus paper for the year 2021-22 prepared by NABARD in the seminar.

NABARD has projected a credit flow of Rs 2,30,664.81 crore during 2020-21 in Punjab under priority sector lending, as per the revised norms outlined by the Reserve Bank of India.

Of the aggregate credit plan, the share of crop loan is pegged at Rs 98,211.12 crore (43 percent of the total), agriculture term loan at Rs 23,899.46 crore (10 percent), MSME at Rs 42,091.60 crore (18 percent), agricultural ancillary activities at Rs 15,002.60 crore (seven percent), and agriculture infrastructure at Rs 6,580.58 crore (three percent).

Bajwa lauded the efforts of NABARD in preparation of such a structured and comprehensive document, which reflects the potential available under each sub-sector of the state rural economy.

He assured all possible support from the State Government for the realization of projected credit potential and targeted development.

He advised banks to provide credit for capital intensive units like dairy, poultry, fisheries, etc and also for agro-processing units to enhance farm income with the objective to double the same by the year-2022.

He emphasized the need for setting up of mini as well as commercial dairy units, piggery, poultry as well as small orchards in farmer’s fields to supplement their income.

Additional Chief Secretary (Development) Viswajeet Khanna also praised the efforts of NABARD for promoting farmer and farming supportive projects like FPOs as well as the focus NABARD gave to Hi-tech Agriculture in its State Focus Paper.

Chief General Manager, Punjab Regional Office NABARD, JPS Bindra said that the theme of the current State Focus Paper is “Hi-tech Agriculture”.

Considering stagnation in agriculture productivity, depleting water tables, environmental concerns and paucity of labour, he said that adoption of hi-tech agriculture by farmers would give them better returns and resolve these issues to a large extent.

To achieve objectives of farm and rural development, crop diversification, increasing crop productivity, reducing the cost of cultivation, ensuring remunerative prices to farmers and supplementing their income through allied and off-farm sector activities would be the future strategies, he added.

Highlighting the new initiatives of NABARD in Punjab, he said that NABARD has launched its flagship initiative “e-Shakti” for the digitization of the self-help groups in 10 districts of the State.

Advocating the need for collectivization in the farming sector, he detailed about the concept of farmer producer organizations. A total of 103 FPOs have been promoted by NABARD in Punjab. He called upon all stakeholders to make use of the State Focus Paper in preparing their action plan for 2020-21, so that there is all-round development in the agriculture and rural sectors of Punjab through bank credit and related services.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/nabard-to-meet-needs-of-state.html

On the same tithi Prabhupad declared him Gour Govinda Swami instead of Gour Govinda Das by giving him sannyas initiation.

His preaching programme in Krishna consciousness was highly appreciable. He travelled to the United States of America, England, USSR, Canada, western countries, South Africa, Australia, Indonesia and so many other countries four times while travelling various important cities of India and created thousands and thousands of followers and devotees.

66,13-2-20,MLA Kundu alleges ‘scam’ in co-operative sugar mill,"Independent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, who is supporting the BJP-JJP Government in Haryana, on Wednesday, claimed that the state’s cooperative sugar mills have shown a loss of Rs 3,300 crore and alleged it was due to corruption and malpractices.

Talking to reporters here, Kundu said that he met Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and submitted a letter in this regard on Tuesday evening. He said the CM assured him of taking action on the complaint. The legislator claimed that he had submitted proof to the Chief Minister on how the loss had taken place in the last four years.

Describing Khattar as an honest person, Kundu said he has high hopes from the Chief Minister that he would initiate strict action as per the law in the case.

In a letter to Khattar, copies of which he released to the media, Kundu said, ""It is informed that a loss of Rs 3,300 crore has been shown by the Haryana State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills Ltd."" The losses have taken place in the last three years and ""it is because of inefficiencies at every step, misutilisation of funds/fraud/corruption due to malpractices adopted for the selfish interest of officers concerned,"" Kundu said.

The MLA alleged that the officers had acted on behalf of a former minister in the previous Khattar Government in the State and said he would raise the matter in the next assembly session.

""I would not call it a Rs 3,300 crore loss, but it is a big scam. There are a total of 10 cooperative sugar mills in the State. ""Likewise, every mill which until five years ago on an average was reporting a loss of Rs 10-12 crore, started reporting losses of nearly Rs 100 crore,"" Kundu claimed.

He also alleged that 80,000 quintal of molasses during 2016-18 was siphoned off from the Panipat sugar mills and alcohol was illegally prepared from this non-accounted quantity of molasses and sold in the black market.

""Then chairman of Sugarfed got an inquiry initiated in this case, but he was forced to resign as punishment for initiating the inquiry,"" the MLA claimed.

He alleged that the inquiry is still pending due to ""pressure"" from the former minister.

He also touched upon state Urban Local Bodies Minister Anil Vij constituting a special investigation team (SIT) to look into allegations of irregularities and loss to the exchequer in execution of certain projects implemented under the previous term of the BJP government.

The SIT has been formed under the chairmanship of the urban local bodies department's director

The lawmaker had alleged irregularities and fraud to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore in the urban local bodies department due to ""corrupt practices"".

Kundu, a BJP rebel who contested against the official party candidate and won from Meham, had trained his guns on a former minister and gone public with his allegations.

“Vij is an upright person and he will take the matter to a logical conclusion,” he said.

The Haryana Police had a month ago booked Balraj Kundu and his brother Shivraj Kundu for allegedly cheating a Rohtak resident.

A case was registered against Balraj and his brother Shivraj by the Rohtak police under various IPC sections pertaining to cheating, conspiracy and criminal breach of trust on a complaint by Narender Dhankhar, a police spokesperson had said earlier.

Kundu reiterated, ""I have been raising my voice against corruption. Such false cases will not suppress my voice”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mla-kundu-alleges----scam----in-co-operative-sugar-mill.html

While talking to The Pioneer, the MCD tax superintendent Dharmesh Painuly said, “In recent days, the collection of property tax remains around Rs 35 lakh per day in which about Rs 15 lakh is from residential property tax and the remaining is from non-residential property tax.

Till now, MCD has collected Rs 35 crore from property tax payers and certainly the goal of collecting Rs 50 crore will be achieved by the end of the month of March. Last year only about Rs 25 crore were collected by MCD, but hopefully this time the collection will exceed Rs 50 crore.”

The penalty of Rs 100, Rs 1000, and Rs 5000 will be imposed on the area of the property up to 50 square metres, 200 square metres and 400 square metres respectively. The penalty of Rs 15,000 will be imposed on the property of more than 400 square metres.

However, if the tax submission of the property is late by 30 days, five per cent of tax will be charged as penalty in the form of delay fee by MCD. It is pertinent to mention here that the last date of submission of property tax with a rebate of 20 per cent was extended by Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal 'Gama' by one month which is slated to end on February 15.

68,13-2-20,Sheeshambada locals start protest outside UEPPCB,"The locals of Sheeshambada have started an indefinite period protest outside the Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) on Wednesday regarding the functioning of the solid waste management and recycling plant which has been operating for more than five months without No Objection Certificate (NOC).

The locals alleged that UEPPCB is deliberately ignoring the nuisance created by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) and Ramky Company in the waste management plant in Sheeshambada.

According to the residents, Ramky Company and few officials of MCD are in connivance with UEPPCB and that is why the board has not taken any action against them in spite of improper operation of the plant and that too without No Objection Certificate (NOC).“Everyone knows that the plant in Sheeshambada is operating without NOC for more than six months now.

Why has the NOC not been approved or rejected so far? If everything is fine in the plant according to pollution control board then sanction the NOC to MCD, if not then cancel it.

But they are not doing any of it as there are so many defects in plant operation that they cannot approve NOC and cannot reject it too because of their involvement with MCD,” alleged a local Pushpa Bhandari.

According to one of the locals Satpal Dhaniya, “The residents of Sheeshambada and nearby areas are really suffering a lot due to the mismanagement of the garbage in the plant. The Chief Minister had said while inaugurating the solid waste management and recycling plant that if the plant would cause any kind of trouble to the residents then it would be shifted somewhere else but it has been more than four years and we are still protesting against it.”

He further added that if no action is taken by the state government soon then they will start an indefinite period protest outside the CM’s residence and Vidhan Sabha.It is pertinent to mention here that last month,

the chairperson of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) Usha Negi has also asked UEPPCB to respond to the notice issued regarding the foul smell and disease causing conditions near the waste management plant due to which the lives of local children are being affected on a daily basis.

Given the stand of the state government on promotion in reservation it was believed that the Uttarakhand government would remove the ban imposed on promotions.

However the heat generated by the order has made the government hesitant. The order has given a chance to the opposition parties to attack Narendra Modi government with Lok Sabha witnessing uproar over it. The union government was forced to give statement in Lok Sabha on the issue.

Giving an indication of Uttarakhand government’s mood, the Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said recently that the decision of SC would be examined.

The SC on February 7 had ruled that reservation in promotion in not a fundamental right and states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions. It opined that seniority and merit should be the criteria of promotion.

With this decision, the SC quashed the decision of Uttarakhand HC in Gyanchand case which allowed benefit of reservation in promotions. The Uttarakhand government had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the SC against the HC order. The state government also issued a moratorium on promotions of its employees in September last year.

The formidable association of general and OBC employees is now pressurizing the government to remove the ban so that justice is delivered.

99,13-2-20,Couples upbeat with unique plans for Valentine’s Day,"With Valentine’s Day just round the corner, couples in Ranchi have already made plans to celebrate the day of love with their better halves. From picking the perfect gift to planning an evening by themselves, everything has been arranged to celebrate the special day.

For Geetanjali and Rimanshu Hirani who got married 10 years back, everyday is special. “We had an arranged marriage and it was not love at first sight for us. In an arranged marriage, it takes time to like and love each other and also discover each other’s qualities. We never were the romantic couple like they show in Bollywood movies. On February 14, to make the day special, I have ordered a gift for her online along with some flowers,” said Rimanshu.

Priyansha and Abhyuday Dizit, who were in a long distance relationship for a few years before tying the knot, believe that they don’t need a specific day to celebrate love. “Since we are both professionals and February 14 happens to be a working day, we plan to go out for dinner post work. We are not able to spend too much or put in too much effort so we would just love to spend some quality time with each other. We don’t believe in celebrating one day to express our love but since it’s a trend, we just go for a fancy dinner,” said Priyansha.

“For us Valentine’s Day is no different than any other day. We have a habit of picking flowers for each other on random days and that’s what is more special for us.

But to do something on February 14, we might go out for dinner to a place not very crowded.

It’s been three since we got married and it’s been a beautiful journey so far,” said Paridhi and Atul Drolia who too had an arranged marriage.

Shrinkal Shree and Rahul Anand had been in a relationship for the past six years and recently got married in November 2019. “Before we got married, on our first Valentine’s Day we were in a long distance relation. I had sent him personalized gifts while he had sent me flowers with my favorite chocolates. Post our marriage, this is our first Valentine together. Since we both are very fond of Chinese, we will go to BNR for a nice dinner,” said Shrinkal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/couples-upbeat-with-unique-plans-for-valentine---s-day.html
100,13-2-20,Demands for pension flood ‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’,"Expectations at ‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’ are growing with every programme which is held on every Wednesday by DC and Saturday by DDC but it is getting too tough for administration to come up to it.

The popular demand from the officialdom is that it be a fortnight affair and not a two push offs in one week Wednesday and Saturday.

At Babhandee panchayat under Pipra block this programme saw a huge gathering and equally huge filing of petitions for myriad demands majority of them for pension and it appears the whole of this district’s rural scape wants to live on pension.

Villagers there told this correspondent, “Everyone wants pension here. This is too sad. The government must see that many who come demanding pension has one or two Jio cell phones with their family members.”

There came a 60 plus man, who posed as if he cannot stand on his legs. His demand was that he should be given pension.

DC’s security personnel gave this man a helping hand. He was made to stand but he feigned his legs were not supporting him.

DC Shantanu Kumar Agrahai went to him and said, “This is all for pension. The man has indulged in this fake posturing of weaknesses. No matter after all it is a welfare State and pension was sanctioned to him on the spot.” This man was seen then walking comfortably back home!

Nazareth Deputy Collector Shailesh Kumar had to appeal to officers, “To move in their respective stalls instead of sitting in a row behind the DC’s chair.” The BDO Pipra Anita Kerketta had arranged simple vegetarian food for officials too, which many relished.

It was district social welfare officer Aftab Alam who had to do more running between the DC’s table down to stalls with beneficiaries holding his hand for sanctioning of pension or for updating of Aadhar cards.

Alam had to do more than 12 such ‘trips with beneficiaries’ to the stalls.

It was noticed there that stalls like of pension, food and civil supplies, Aadhar registration, banks, Awas etc were in a series as a result confusion was raging as for pension visitors were found arguing with men at stall of labour employment or at aadhar card stall.

A villager there at Babhandee said, “These stalls should be set up with at least 5 feet gap/ distance from the nearest one as then only crowd will not suffocate these stalls .”

PM Awas Yojna Gramin beneficiaries at least 26 of them are serious defaulters. They have not completed their house which are of the scheme spanning over from 2016 -19 said DRDA director Smita Toppo.

Smita Toppo said these beneficiaries must act fast or their funding will stop after March 31st.

BDO Pipra Anita Kerketta said some of these beneficiaries have moved out from here to earna living outside Jharkhand, some have land dispute where this Awas is coming up, some beneficiaries have misspent the government money given for their Awas.

Kerketta feared government money given to these 26 looksto be ‘sunk.’

Elderly women came in great numbers before DC Agrahari who were heardwith patience. A white tailored man in all washed kurta pajayma was snubbed by DC who was poking his nose in every petition of the people here.

Agrahari conceded Pipra block has no paddy procurement centre and paddy farmers will have to take back their quintal of paddy for sale at the nearest paddy procurement centre set up at Harihurganj a distance of 20 kilometers between Pipra and Harihurganj.

Additional collector revenue P K Prasad said 7 cases of mutation have been cleared in this programme while equal number of them will be disposed of in 30 days time.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/demands-for-pension-flood----sarkar-aap-ke-dwar---.html

103,13-2-20,"3 kids, parents’ decomposed bodies found","Tension was palpable in Northeast Delhi’s Bhajanpura area on Wednesday morning after five members of a family were found dead under mysterious circumstances inside their house. Police said no suicide note was recovered from the house.

The deceased have been identified as Shambhu Chaudhary (43), his wife Sunita (37), their daughter Komal (12), their sons Sachin (14) and Shivam (17). Police said that Shambu used to drive e-rickshaw in the locality of Bhajanpura.

According to Ved Prakash Surya, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Northeast district, a police control room (PCR) call was received at around 11:16 pm on Wednesday from neighbour who told police about a nauseous smell emanating from a house in street number-10 of Bhajanpura.

“Acting on the call, Emergency Response Vehicle (ERV) was dispatched for the spot. The police broke the door of the house and found five decomposed dead bodies in the house. The highly-decomposed bodies have been sent for the post mortem examination,” said the DCP.

“The exact reason for the death will be ascertained after the visit and examination by Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team or after the post mortem report comes as the bodies are highly decomposed,” said the DCP.

“Police teams are trying to recover the mobile phone used by Shambhu, who was the only one in the family using it. Police have not recovered any weapon from the house. The house was also not ransacked. Police teams are also investigating the matter and are going to file a case under section 302 (murder) as the matter is very sensitive,” said the DCP.

“The family had been residing at the house as tenant for the last five months. Shambhu was permanent resident of district Supaul in Bihar,” the DCP added.

However, the relatives of Shambu suspected that it is a murder not suicide. Roshan Chaudhary (20), the brother of Shambhu, said he was in Bihar and came to Delhi this morning only.

“I had gone to Bihar and returned Delhi today. I spoke to Shambhu around 10 to 12 days ago. He used to run e-rickshaw and the relation between him and his wife was good. He had three children who used to study in a government school in Yamuna Vihar,” said Roshan.

Dinanath Chaudhary, the cousin of Shambhu, said that he heard about the incident from neighbours.

“I got the information from the nearby people regarding the bodies. I went inside the flat along with forensic science team. There was no issue in the family. It cannot be a suicide. It is a murder case,” he said.

“I went to the school where his kids used to study and found that they last went to the school on February 3,” said Dinanath.

Srikant Sharma, a neighbour, said that he noticed foul play and wanted to go inside but the main gate was locked from outside.

“The foul smell was coming from the house. Some people were thinking that the smell was coming from the sewer but I was sure that something was wrong. I wanted to go inside but the gate was locked. When police reached here, they broke open the door and later found the five decomposed bodies,” Sharma said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/3-kids--parents----decomposed-bodies-found.html

Interacting with various stakeholders of the State’s health machinery at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) Auditorium on Wednesday, Gupta said that hospitals and medicine retailers should not be scared of officials.

“If any official demands bribe, you directly inform me over WhatsApp. Necessary actions will be taken against the concerned official,” said Gupta, adding that officials will have to be honest if the Minister is honest. Gupta also shared his contact number with the people present at the event and assured that he will follow up all the complaints made to him over WhatsApp.

Most of the Ministers in the current Cabinet have been active on social media and are using various social media platforms to address problems of commoners. Chief Minister Hemant Soren has been actively addressing issues on microblogging website Twitter and involving officials too in the process. Now, Gupta’s WhatsApp assurance comes as an addition to the Government’s social media friendly approach.

The newly appointed Health Minister has had a strict approach towards officials since he took charge. On Wednesday, he attended the interactive session with hospital authorities, doctors and medicine retailers at RIMS Auditorium, and asked the officials to leave in order to have transparent conversations with other stakeholders.

The doctors present at the session highlighted the need of Medical Protection Act (MPA) in Jharkhand, while hospital authorities complained about high cost of medical waste disposal. Implementation of MPA has been a long pending demand of the Jharkhand chapter of the IMA. The Act has already been implemented in 18 states in India and IMA wants Jharkhand to be the 19th state to implement the MPA. The Cabinet had approved the MPA in Jharkhand in 2017.

The association of doctors sought single window system for all issues of hospitals and nursing homes. The members of the association also demanded smoother functioning of the Ayushman Bharat scheme and easy exit from the scheme.

Talking about the initiative of organising such interactive sessions for health department, Gupta said that collaboration between the Minister and other stakeholders was crucial for better functioning of the department. “It is very important to spread awareness among people of the State and the various stakeholders. This platform is to bridge the gap between the Ministry, doctors and other parties involved in running the health machinery,” Gupta said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/inform-me-on-whatsapp-if-officials-demand-bribe--says-health-minister.html

Harivansh on the occasion also advocated the need for establishing centers for training of MLAs. He said, “A lawmakers should maintain parliamentary conduct and dignity both in and outside the house as his or her act affects the entire society.”

The two day workshop was very much helpful for new legislators who were elected for first time. Purnima Neeraj Singh one of the lawmaker elected for first time from Jharia said, “The two day workshop was very helpful for such legislators who are elected for first time. During the workshop the participants discussed ways on how law is formed and what legislative processes that lawmakers have to follow in the House.”

She said, “Rajya Sabha deputy speaker Harivansh Jee was the chief guest at the concluding day. He spoke for more than seventy five minutes and during his speech he tried to touch various aspects of legislative procedure.”

Singh said, “The deputy speaker on the occasion asked new lawmakers to behave properly in House. Proper knowledge of budgets, presence of mind and knowledge of rules and regulations of House are some of the qualities that a lawmaker should have.”

The workshop was also attended by senior MLAs. Two times MLA from Dhanbad Raj Sinha said, “The workshop was learning experience as discussion were made on how law is made, how a bill is passed and legislative process in House.”

Sinha further said, “Despite elaborate legislative process conferred to Assembly by Constitution, it is very sad that much of the legislative procedure is not followed in House.”

Sinha said, “A Bill is passed in the House and after getting consent of majority of MLAs the bill becomes the Act without having any discussions on positive and negative aspects of Bill.” Wednesday was the second and last day of training workshop.

Earlier, Speaker Rabindranath Mahato, while stressing the positive debate between the side and the opposition, expressed concern that many important bills pass without discussion.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/harivansh-moots-for-effective-legislature---.html

112,13-2-20,"Muslims voted for Cong in LS, AAP in Assembly polls","The Muslim voters who had drifted to Congress in the last Lok Sabha elections veered this time to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). This is evident through the six Muslim-dominated Assembly seats in Delhi where Congress got only 45,000 votes polled together. In five of the six seats — Ballimaran, Okhla, Matia Mahal, Babarpur, Mustafabad — the Congress got a little more than 5,000 votes in each of the constituencies.

The Congress drew a blank for second time in a row and its vote share also reached an all-time low of 4 per cent in the Assembly polls.

The Congress' decline in the national Capital indicated that the Muslim community has shifted to the AAP. Take for instance, Congress' Haroon Yusuf, a Minister in the former Sheila Dikshit Government, who bagged only 5,107 votes in Ballimaran against his AAP rival who garnered 65,612 votes.

In the neighbouring Matia Mahal seat, Congress' Mirza Javed Ali got merely 3,403 votes as against 67,250 votes bagged by AAP's Shoaib Iqbal.

The only saving grace for the party was Seelampur where it garnered more than 20,000 votes. These were also the seats which were once the bastions of the Congress represented by party stalwarts.

In the Lok Sabha polls, the party had bagged 52,669 votes from Matia Mahal and 49,036 from the Ballimaran assembly segments. The seats fall under the Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency.

In Seelampur, Mateen Ahmed of Congress bagged 20,207 votes. However, it was much lesser than his AAP rival Abdul Rehman who secured 72,611 votes.

In Babarpur and Mustafabad, the Congress candidates got 5,131 and 5,363 votes, respectively. In the Lok Sabha polls, the then Delhi Congress president and party candidate Sheila Dikshit had secured the highest number of votes in Seelampur (64,382) assembly segment. She was polled 57,227 votes in Babarpur and 69,803 votes in Mustafabad.

AAP's Lok Sabha candidate from Northeast Delhi Dilip Pandey had bagged 17,803 votes (Mustafabad), 12,564 votes (Babarpur) and 10,091 votes (Seelampur).

On the Okhla seat, AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan bettered his 2015 performance and won by over 71,000 votes.

His Congress rival Parvez Hashmi, a former Rajya Sabha MP and a four-time MLA, managed to get only 5,107 votes.

In the Lok Sabha polls, Congress' Arvinder Singh Lovely got over 60,000 votes from the Okhla segment as against 43,000 by AAP's Atishi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/muslims-voted-for-cong-in-ls--aap-in-assembly-polls.html

114,13-2-20,"Cong, BJP’s bids on dynasts backfire","The Congress and the BJP which placed their bets on the kin of political veterans ended up tasting defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections, even as those with a political legacy who joined the AAP just ahead of the polls, went on to trounce their rivals by considerable margins.

Congress' candidate from Kalkaji, Shivani Chopra, daughter of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Subhash Chopra, polled a little over four per cent votes from the constituency and ended up behind AAP's winning candidate Atishi and BJP's Dharambir Singh. Shivani also ended up losing her security deposit.

Interestingly, Shivani's father has been elected thrice as MLA from the constituency. Former Delhi Speaker Yoganand Shastri's daughter Priyanka Singh was fielded by the grand old party from the R K Puram seat, but she only polled 3,237 votes. The winning candidate from AAP Pramila Tokas polled 47,208 votes from the constituency.

Singh, 41, is the vice-president of the Delhi Mahila Congress and has been politically active since 2008.

Her father served as Delhi minister for food and civil supplies from 1998 to 2003, minister for health and social welfare from 2003 to 2008 and Delhi Assembly speaker from 2008 to 2013.

Shastri represented the Mehrauli seat for the first two terms and the Malviya Nagar constituency in his third term. Poonam Azad, wife of Kirti Azad, who headed the campaign committee of Delhi Congress, was the candidate for the Sangam Vihar seat, but her fate in the polls was worse than her Congress counterparts.

She finished the poll race in the fourth position from the Sangam Vihar constituency, even behind the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate. She bagged a meagre 2.23 per cent of the total votes polled.

AAP's Dinesh Mohaniya retained the seat by securing over 75 per cent of the votes polled. Poonam, 53, had contested against then Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit in the 2003 assembly polls on a BJP ticket. She snapped her ties with the BJP in November 2016 after serving the party for more than 20 years, alleging that she had been sidelined. Poonam then joined the AAP, but just five months later, in April 2017, she switched to the Congress.

Her father-in-law Bhagwat Jha Azad, who served as Bihar chief minister in 1988-89, also belonged to the Congress.

Her husband and former MP from Bihar's Darbhanga, Kirti Azad, was suspended by the BJP in December 2015 after he alleged irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) when it was headed by former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley.

Former Model Town MLA Kunwar Karan Singh's daughter Akanksha Ola was in the fray from Model Town, but faced defeat.

Nangloi Jat MLA Birender Singh's son Mandeep Singh, former Ambedkar Nagar MLA Chaudhary Prem Singh's son Yaduraj Chaudhary and former Mustafabad MLA Hasan Ahmed's son Ali Mehendi also met a similar fate.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had also fielded candidates related to politicians this assembly election.

Rajiv Babbar, son of former three-time MLA O P Babbar, was fielded by the saffron party from Tilak Nagar, but ended up losing to AAP's Jarnail Singh for the third time by a margin of over 28,000 votes.

The senior Babbar had held the Tilak Nagar seat in 1993, 2003 and 2008. Rajiv Babbar had twice unsuccessfully contested from the seat in 2013 and 2015. He had lost to AAP's Jarnail Singh on both occasions.

Brother of former Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma, Azad Singh was the BJP's candidate from Mundka, but he lost to AAP's Dharampal Lakra, a first-timer, by over 19,000 votes. He is also the uncle of BJP MP from West Delhi Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma.

In 2013, Azad Singh was elected as the mayor of North Delhi. He has been active in politics since 1998 and has also contested for the post of President of Government School Teachers Association, Delhi (GSTA).

Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which came back to power with a thumping majority struck gold with its candidates related to political leaders.

The AAP had fielded Preeti Tomar, wife of former Delhi minister Jitender Singh Tomar, from Tri Nagar. She ended up winning the seat for the party by a margin of over 10,700 votes.

Her candidature was announced at the last minute after Jitender Singh Tomar was dropped following the Delhi High Court setting aside his election for giving false declaration regarding his educational qualification in his nomination papers for the 2015 Delhi assembly polls.

A Dhanwati Chandela, wife of former Congress MLA Dayanand Chandela, joined the AAP just ahead of the polls and ended up winning the Rajouri Garden seat by a margin of over 22,000 votes. She had unsuccessfully contested the Rajouri Garden bypolls in 2017 and lost to Manjinder Singh Sirsa.

Vinay Mishra, son of former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra, who had switched allegiance to AAP from Congress, won from Dwarka after defeating his BJP rival by over 14,000 votes.

The AAP won in 62 of the 70 seats with a total vote share of 53.57 per cent. The BJP emerged victorious in eight seats, getting 38.51 per cent of the total votes. The Congress could not manage to win a single seat and ended with 4.26 per cent vote share.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong--bjp---s-bids-on-dynasts-backfire.html

While only three candidates Arvinder Singh Lovely from Gandhi Nagar, Devender Yadav from Badli and Abhishek Dutt from Kasturba Nagar could save their deposits.

The Congress performance in the just-concluded Delhi Assembly elections touched a record low with the party bagging less than five per cent votes and 63 of its candidates losing their deposits. The party had ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot under former chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which had fielded candidates from 68 of the 70 seats, lost deposits in all the constituencies, according to data shared on the website.

The security deposit of a candidate is forfeited if he or she fails to secure one-sixth of the total valid votes cast in a constituency. Former Union minister for women and child development Krishan Tirath lost from the reserved seat of Patel Nagar, getting just 3,382 votes, accounting for a mere 2.8 per cent of the votes polled in the constituency.

Pradeep Kumar Rawal, the BSP candidate in Patel Nagar, finished last among the four candidates for the seat, and got 674 votes, even less than NOTA votes (767).

Yusuf got 4,802 votes in Ballimaran seat, finishing third behind his AAP and BJP rivals. Other former Delhi ministers Walia and Hashmi also finished poor third in Krishna Nagar and Okhla constituencies, respectively.

Delhi Congress chief Shubhash Chopra's daughter Shivani Chopra, who was the party candidate from Kalkaji seat, also could not save her deposit. AAP's Atishi won the seat with 55,897 votes and Chopra got just 4,965 votes.

Former Delhi Assembly speaker Yoganand Shastri's daughter Priyanka Singh, also forfeited her deposit. The vice-president of Delhi Mahila Congress got only 3.6 per cent votes.

The Congress' Kasturba Nagar candidate Abhishek Dutt, an SDMC councillor, got 21.42 per cent votes and stood a distant third.

Alka Lamba, the outgoing MLA who switched to the Congress last year, could garner only 5.03 per cent votes, while the youngest candidate this election and former DUSU president, Rocky Tuseed, polled 3.8 per cent votes.

The BJP and its allies JD(U) and LJP finished second in 62 seats, not losing their deposits from any of the seats. JD(U) candidates fought from Burari and Sangam Vihar, while the LJP from Seemapuri reserved seat.

A total of 672 candidates, 593 men and 79 women, were in the fray for the hotly contested elections.

119,13-2-20,Poll rout sparks blame game in Cong,"After the humiliating rout of the Congress in the Delhi Assembly elections, a war of words laced with blame game has erupted among Congress leaders. The overall vote share of Congress had plummeted to an all time low, from 9.7 per cent in 2015 to a meagre 4.26 per cent this time.

All India Congress Committee (AICC) Delhi in-charge PC Chacko sought to put the blame of the party's decline on late Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, saying the party started losing ground when she was at the helm in 2013. ""The party's downfall started since 2013 when Sheila Dikshit was chief minister and the new outfit AAP took away the Congress vote bank,"" he said.

Congress leader Sharmishtha Mukherjee took on senior party leader P Chidambaram, who had welcomed the AAP win as ""defeat of bluff and bluster"" and asked the former minister if the state Congress units should shut shop in case the party had decided that others will take on the BJP across states.

""With due respect sir, just want to know- has Congress outsourced the task of defeating BJP to state parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if 'yes', then we (PCCs) might as well close shop!"" asked Mukherjee.

Sharmishtha is daughter of former President Pranab Mukherjee, who has been a Congress leader all his life. The Congress drew a blank for the second time in Delhi elections and its vote share plummeted to 4.26 per cent from 9.7 per cent in 2015.

Congress leader Milind Deora slammed Chacko for his remarks saying, ""Sheila Dikshit ji was a remarkable politician and administrator. During her tenure as chief minister, Delhi was transformed and Congress was stronger than ever. Unfortunate to see her being blamed after her death. She dedicated her life to Congress and the people of Delhi.""

Dikshit's former aide Pawan Khera said, ""Just a data point. In 2013, when we lost, Congress vote share in Delhi was 24.55 pc. Sheila ji was not involved in 2015, when the vote share slipped to 9.7 pc. In 2019, when she was back in charge, the vote share came up to 22.46 pc.""

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor posted an Urdu couplet on Twitter saying, one is taking pride in someone else's victory, even in the party's defeat.

""The Delhi results are disappointing for Congress but there are consolations: the BJP's divisive politics has been repudiated with their rout; AAP's development message is what has prevailed over identity politics; and 8 months after sweeping the LS polls the winners have been rebuked,"" Tharoor said in another tweet.

Chidambaram, the former finance minister, had welcomed the AAP victory in Delhi polls, saying, ""AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP. I salute the people of Delhi who have set an example to other states that will hold their elections in 2021 and 2022.""",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/poll-rout-sparks-blame-game-in-cong.html

This number was distributed to people across the country through various media. The party leaders asserted that that it is historical that 'politics of work' is getting such a large support for nation building from people across the country.

Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has won the Delhi Assembly elections with an overwhelming majority. AAP has won a historic 62 seats in the results of the election on Tuesday. Whereas the BJP has got just 8 seats.

During the election, BJP leaders constantly tried to polarize votes by making false statements against the AAP and it’s leaders. At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party sought votes from the people of Delhi in the name of work, the party said in a statement.

141,13-2-20,"CEC: EVMs tamper-proof, won't regress to ballots","Amid renewed apprehension of tampering of EVMs by incumbent Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora on Wednesday asserted that the machines cannot be tampered with and that there was no question of going back to the ballot paper.

Arora also said that the Commission would engage with political parties in the coming days on various electoral reforms and the model code of conduct.

Addressing a ‘Summit’ of a television news channel, he lamented that day-to-day dialogue is becoming “more coarse “ and it should be “avoided”.

The CEC said EVMs can malfunction like a car or a pen but they cannot be tampered with. The EVMs are in use for 20 years now and there was no question of returning to the ballot paper, he emphasised.

Various courts, including the Supreme Court, have upheld the use of the machines to cast votes, he elaborated.

Responding to a question on holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls simultaneously, Arora said the call on the subject has to be taken at the political level. Once a decision is taken by the Government, the Election Commission can only facilitate its implementation.

The CEC also informed the audience that his colleagues in the EC are collaborating with Indian Institute of Technology, Madras to set up a “block chain” system where, say a person from Rajasthan working in Chennai can vote for elections in Rajasthan while remaining in the Tamil Nadu capital.

He clarified that this does not mean people can vote from home but will have to visit designated places to exercise their franchise.

For the block chain system to be implemented, changes in law may be required, according to another EC official.

After political parties questioned the reliability of the EVMs, the EC had organized an EVM challenge in 2017 for them to prove that the machines can be tampered with. But none of the parties turned up for the challenge, leading the EC to exhort that the political parties should stop crying foul at they ran away from the EVM challenge.

Later in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, the EC had said it had invited all parties to prove that the voting machines can be tampered with, but no one turned up.

142,13-2-20,PM urges to pay tax dues for development,"While the previous Governments had hesitated to touch the country’s taxation system, the current dispensation has been making it more citizen-centric, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, urging people to pay their dues for the development of India.

Speaking at an event of a news channel, he said the concern was that as some people always found ways to evade taxes, the honest got penalised.

“All Governments hesitated to touch the tax system. Now, we are making it citizen centric. When a number of people do not pay tax, find ways to evade it, the burden falls on those who honestly pay their dues,” he said. The Prime Minister added that it was unbelievable but true that only 2,200 people in the country had declared earnings of Rs one crore per annum.

He also said that this was the first time any Government had focussed on smaller cities to push for economic development. “India will not waste time now, it will surge ahead with confidence. The Union budget will help achieve the target of a USD 5 trillion economy,” said Modi.

“Along with strengthening the economy we are striving to strengthen our tier 2 and 3 cities.

We are the first Government to focus on fulfilling the dreams of small cities” said Modi narrating various measures taken in the infrastructure sector.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-urges-to-pay-tax-dues-for-development.html
143,13-2-20,‘Armed forces at cusp of transformation’,"Maintaining that proxy war and cross-border terrorism remained the key security challenges facing India, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat said on Wednesday said the armed forces are at the cusp of transformation.

Gen Rawat also rejected criticism that the armed forces are suppressing the rights of the people in Jammu & Kashmir and said required steps are being taken keeping in view ground realities and the threats of terrorism in the Union Territory.

Asked about his controversial comments that India has deradicalisation camps, he said what he meant was classification of people based on their views and the impact of relentless efforts to deradicalise young people. “When I said camps -- I meant groups of people. The classification of people based on their views and the impact of relentless efforts to deradicalise young people. The word camp got misunderstood,” he said during an interactive session at a conclave organised by a news channel. In an address at the Raisina Dialogue last month, Gen Rawat said deradicalisation camps are operating in the country as it is necessary to isolate people who are completely radicalised. Girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 years are being radicalised in the Valley, he said, describing it as a matter of concern. “We have got deradicalisation camps going on in our country.”

At the conclave on Wednesday, Gen Rawat also talked about the need for preventive deradicalisation strategies and how the Indian Army is running a number of schools in Kashmir as part of its outreach programme.

Talking about evolving a regional security matrix, Gen Rawat said developments beyond India’s immediate neighbourhood, such as in West Asia, may impinge on the country’s security interests.

“India needs to fulfill a larger responsibility in context of global peace. We have to expand our influence,” said Gen Rawat.

Asked whether creation of the chief of defence staff has added another layer of bureaucracy, the former Army chief said it was a long-pending proposal aimed at ensuring greater integration in functioning of the three services.

He said both the CDS and the defence secretary have clear responsibilities and both will work in coordination to bring in transformational changes in the military.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---armed-forces-at-cusp-of-transformation---.html

145,13-2-20,‘Anti-TB measures delivering results’,"Racing against time to meet its ambitious goal of eradicating tuberculosis (TB) by 2025 - five years ahead of the target fixed by the WHO - the Government is hopeful that various transformative strategies introduced in the last few years such as engaging private sector and the community, social support besides better healthcare facilities will help make the country free of the deadly disease.

“The measures are delivering results”, Vikas Sheel, Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry told reporters here while sharing details of various steps taken by the Government since the launch of the new National Strategic Plan (2017-25). Under the plan, the Government has committed to ending TB by 2025 - 80% reduction in incidence and 90% reduction in mortality by 2025 from a baseline of 2015.

The official said that there has been a 38 per cent increase in TB case notifications to the Government - from 17.36 lakhs in 2017 to 23.98 lakhs in 2019. “It means that we have been successful in closing the notification gap (between estimated incidence and notified cases), referred earlier as the ‘missing million’, to less than 3 lakhs, through greater engagement with private sector health care providers,” said Vikas Sheel.

In line with the National Strategic Plan, the Government has rolled out private sector engagement programs across the country to engage private providers such as formal and informal doctors, chemists and diagnostic labs, aimed at facilitating appropriate delivery of TB diagnosis and treatment. In 2018, the Government partnered with the Global Fund to launch JEET or the Joint Effort for Elimination of TB, a private sector engagement program operating in 45 large cities across the country.

The official added, “The increased number of notifications is an important step in the elimination of the disease from the country. We are already providing patients in the private sector with diagnostics, financial incentives of Rs 500 and free drugs, since last year. TB notifications have increased 14% in 2019 as compared to the previous year with overall TB cases reported at 23.9 lakhs in both private and public sector.”

Dr KS Sachdeva, Deputy Director General, Central TB Division said rapid molecular testing devices have been ramped up from 1180 to 1530 in the year 2019. Also, he said, 19.26 lakh TB patients are now on daily regimen through Fixed Dosage Combination initiated since October 2017. “Also, there are better and effective treatment regimen under which newer drugs (bedaquiline and delamanid) were introduced in 2018,” he added. The Ministry has also announced financial incentives of upto Rs 1 Crore to the best performing State in eradication of the deadly disease.

However, major challenges remain. For instance, migrant population, lack of enough funds, unawareness coupled with the wide prevalent stigma associated with the contagious disease.

According to the Government data, although there is a provision of Rs 500 to all TB patients as form of nutrition support, there is a need to provide additional support to patients to ensure treatment completion.

Also, “ according to financial management report (2016-17) the average utilization of the allocated funds under the NTEP was just 52.7 per cent.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---anti-tb-measures-delivering-results---.html

The age relaxation for other categories will continue. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has announced 796 vacancies in the country’s bureaucracy to be filled through the civil services examination 2020, which will be held on May 31, the notification said.

According to last year’s civil services exam notification, the upper-age limit of 32 years to take the test was further relaxable for up to a maximum of five years if a candidate had ordinarily been domiciled in the state of Jammu & Kashmir during the period from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1989.

There is no mention of such age relaxation in this year’s exam notification.

The erstwhile J&K State has been bifurcated into two union territories- Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh - with effect from October 31, 2019.”A candidate must have attained the age of 21 years and must not have attained the age of 32 years on the 1st of August, 2020 i.E., he must have been born not earlier than 2nd August, 1988 and not later than 1st August, 1999,” this year’s notification said.

This is probably the last time that the officers of IRTS, IRAS and IRPS are being recruited through the civil services examination after the amalgamation of the existing eight railway services into the one - Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS), officials said.

The commission may recruit IRMS officers from the next years onward. They said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-upper-age-relaxation-for-j-k-applicants-in-upsc-civil-services-exam-this-year.html
147,13-2-20,Pondy Assembly adopts resolution against it,"The Congress-ruled Puducherry on Wednesday adopted an Assembly resolution against the controversial amended Citizenship Act, becoming the first Union Territory in the country to say no to the law.

Earlier, States including Kerala and West Bengal, whose Chief Ministers Pinarayi Vijayan and Mamata Banerjee, respectively, are at the forefront of anti-CAA movements, had adopted Assembly resolutions against the Act. Amidst an opposition boycott, the one-day special session of the territorial Assembly adopted the resolution tabled by Chief Minister V Narayanasamy.

It also registered strong protest against the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register.

Members of the opposition AINRC and AIADMK boycotted the session while the three nominated BJP legislators staged a walk out after registering their objection to the tabling of the resolution.

As soon as Narayansamy started reading out the contents of the resolution, BJP members V Saminathan, KG Shankar and S Selvaganapthy were up on their feet and objected to the moving of the resolution.

They were heard saying the resolution was a ‘murder of democracy’ and ‘violation of constitutional provisions.’

They later trooped out of the House and did not return for the rest of the session.

The resolution urged the Centre to withdraw the CAA as it was “totally opposed to the principles of secularism.”

It was passed after the Chief Minister, his cabinet colleagues and legislators belonging to the Congress and its ally the DMK spoke on the resolution.

Speaker V P Sivakolundhu said the resolution was “adopted unanimously.” The resolution stated that the CAA had caused ‘pain and chaos’ among the people at large in the country. The enactment of the legislation in the Parliament had created ‘peaceful agitations across the country,’ it added.

The CAA was shattering to pieces the principles of secularism which is the basis of the constitution, it said.

Claiming that there was a hidden agenda in the CAA as the Muslims were ignored, it said the law was “totally injurious” to the great sacrifices made by Mahatma Gandhi for protection of secularism.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pondy-assembly-adopts-resolution-against-it.html
148,13-2-20,Didi: Don’t share your details to NRC agents in disguise,"Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday asked people not to disclose their personal information to anyone who may come in disguise to collect details for Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA).

The Chief Minister told people at Bankura that “people unauthorized by Bengal Government are creeping around to collect your personal details for CAA and future reference for National Register for Citizens (NRC). Please don’t share your personal information with such people.”

She said that some ‘fake agencies’ as also postal and bank employees have been employed to collect details. But I warn you against sharing such details because if you do so you will be in problem.

“Even if such fictitious people tell you that they are coming from the State Government don’t believe them because the State Government is not initiating such process. Even the central agencies cannot carry on such exercises without the State Government. Any such work is illegal without the participation of the State.”

The Chief Minister who staged a rally at industrial town of Durgapur with thousands of people trailing her earlier had said that the BJP was trying to create communal disturbance in Bengal in order to reap political harvest.

She said after suffering massive defeats in the Hindi belt including the national Capital Delhi the saffron party is trying to win Bengal “but people of this State will spell BJP’s end. Money cannot save BJP,” she said, asking women to blow their conch-shell like bugles ahead of war.

“The ululation and the sound of the conch-shells of my mothers and sisters are more potent weapons than BJP’s money,” she said.

With the municipal elections scheduled to take place in a few months from now and with the State polls getting due next year the Trinamool Congress has once again started staging rallies in districts in an apparent bid to thwart the BJP’s advances in the State.

Apart from the Chief Minister who staged a long walk at Durgapur senior party leaders including Ministers Rajib Banerjee on Wednesday staged processions at Alipurduar in North Bengal.

The BJP staged similar processions called Abhinandan Yatra at neighbouring Jalpaiguri also in North Bengal.

The move comes in the backdrop of the Supreme Court verdict delivered early this week where it said that there is “no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions”, and also no court can order a State Govt to provide for reservation to SC/STs.

“In response to the stand taken by the BJP government, it has been decided by our party to vehemently expose the BJP and agitate for the constitutional rights of the SC, ST and the OBC on February 16,” he said in the letter.

156,13-2-20,Complaint against Hajela for tampering with final NRC list,"The Assam Public Works (APW), an NGO, has accused former NRC State coordinator Prateek Hajela of tampering with the final version of the National Register of Citizens by excluding two persons from the list.

In a complaint with the state CID, the APW which is the original petitioner in the Supreme Court leading to the updation of the NRC has also alleged that Hajela altered public records after making those exclusions.

Hajela disobeyed the Supreme Court’s orders, made a false document, forged a public register and committed cyber offences by misusing his powers and position, APW president Abhijeet Sarma alleged in a press conference.

The NRC which validates bonafide Indian citizens of Assam was updated under the monitoring of the Supreme Court. The final list excluding 19 lakh people was published on August 31 last year.

Several political parties and organisations have alleged that many illegal immigrants were able to get their names included in the document while a large number of genuine Indians were excluded.

“We being a local responsible organisation of Assam enquired into certain data and came to know about fraudulent inclusion of two persons, who were earlier declared foreigners, in the final list of the NRC,” Sarma said.

“After the media reported this issue, Hajela tampered with the final list of the NRC, gaining access to the website by misusing his powers.

He disrespected the Supreme Court by changing the status of those two persons from accepted to rejected,” he alleged. The Supreme Court on August 13 last year had directed Hajela to formulate a strong security regime before publishing the final list to prevent it from illegal activities after its publication.

Hajela’s conduct indicates that he used “certain software which was very much within his domain even after publication of the final NRC to alter the status fo the two”, the APW alleged.

The APW said it fears that “Hajela may still have access to the NRC data and can use them for fulfilling his vested interests at any point of time”.

The apex court had ordered Hajela’s transfer from Assam to his home state Madhya Pradesh. He was released from the charge of NRC state coordinator on November 11 last year.

“We, therefore, requested th CID to register a case against Hajela for tampering with valuable public records and conduct an inquiry into his involvement in cybercrime during the updation process,” Sarma said.

APW had lodged a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Branch of the CBI against Hajela on November 28 last year, allegeing embezzlement of Rs 1,600 crores of Government fund by Hazela and his close aides during the NRC updating process.

Names of more than 19 lakh people were not included in the final NRC list.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/complaint-against-hajela-for-tampering-with-final-nrc-list.html

Acting on a tip-off, the personnel from the Anti Terrorist Cell and Anti Human Trafficking Unit of the Palghar police arrested 22 Bangladeshi nationals who were living illegally in hutments in Rajodi village at 1.30 am on Wednesday and took them to local police station for further investigations.

The arrested illegal Bangaldeshi immigrants— comprising 12 women and 10 men—have been booked by the police under sections 3(A), 6(A) of the Indian Passport Act of 1920 and also section 14 of the Foreign Nationals Act of 1946.

The police said that the arrested persons were in the age-group of 19 to 52 years. They hailed mostly from the border districts Jessore and Shantakhira districts in Bangladesah. They were living in India for varied periods. “Most of them were doing some petty jobs,” the police said.

“They do not have any valid documents for their stay in the country,” the police said.

The district headquarter–town of Palghar is located 104 km from Mumbai. The Palghar and their counterparts from the neighbouring district of Thane are trying to ascertain if they more number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are holed up in both the districts.

The arrest of the 22 illegal Bangladeshi nationals comes on the heels of the Raj Thackeray-led MNS organising a massive rally at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai to demand the immediate deportation of illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh residing in Maharashtra.

On its part, the Shiv Sena has also reiterated its commitment to detect and deport illegal Bangladesh immigrants from Maharashtra.

This is not for the first time that the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh have been arrested in Maharashtra. There have been such arrests in different parts of Maharashtra from time to time.

158,13-2-20,Five-day working week for Maharashtra Govt employees from Feb 29,"In some good news for its 17 lakh employees, the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Government on Wednesday announced a five-day week for its offices across the State from February 29.

Following the suit of the Union Government and the State Governments of Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the Maharashtra Government increased the daily work-time of its employees by 45 minutes, as part of its decision to go in for a five-day week for its employees in the State.

After considering a long-pending demand for reducing the number of working days in a week made by the unions representing the Government employees for several years now, the State Cabinet—at a weekly meeting presided over by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray – approved the five-day week proposal.

Under the proposal, the employees working in government offices in Greater Mumbai would henceforth work between 9.45 am and 6.15 pm instead of the earlier duty hours from 9.45 am to 5.30 pm. In Government offices outside Mumbai, the Government employees will henceforth work from 9.45 am to 6.15 pm instead of the earlier work timing of 10 am to 5.45 pm.

Till now, the State Government offices used to remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays.

“The five-day week system is not applicable to employees working essential services like Fire Brigade, Government colleges, engineering colleges, polytechnics, schools, police stations and departments engaged in sanitary services,” an official statement said.

According to the official statement, the total number of working days — which on an average work out to 288 days in a year — will come down 264 days in a year, because of the five-day week announced by the State Government. However, the working hours in a year would increase from the current 2088 hours to 2112 hours.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/five-day-working-week-for-maharashtra-govt-employees-from-feb-29.html

160,13-2-20,"Govt pro-Kannada, says BSY, asks outfits to call off bandh","Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday declared that his Government is ‘pro-Kannada’, even as several organisations have called for a Statewide bandh on Thursday demanding implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi report aimed at providing more jobs for Kannadigas in the State.

Requesting the organisations to call off the protest, he appealed to the agitators not to cause inconvenience to the general public.

“Those agitating, if they are willing to talk to me, I’m always ready to talk to them. We have already done several that are possible (to implement the report), what other things can be done, I’m ready to talk to them,” Yediyurappa said.

Speaking to reporters here, he said there was no need to call for bandh and cause inconvenience to public.

“Let them come and meet me today itself if required, I will wait for them at my residence, let them come and discuss in the interest of the people.

We are also pro-Kannada, want things to be favourable for Kannadigas, want children of Kannada get jobs.

I’m ready to everything that is possible for it,” he said, adding that he was with them and will extend full cooperation.

Minister for Kannada and Culture CT Ravi said the government has shown commitment towards implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi report and already implemented it in the government sector.

“In the private sector, we are trying to implement it step by step,” he added.

Several pro-Kannada organisations have given a call for a statewide ‘bandh’ demanding implementation of the report.

The Sarojini Mahishi Committee, headed by former Union Minister Sarojini Mahishi, was constituted in 1984 to recommend job opportunities for Kannadigas in Karnataka and it submitted the report two years later.

Responding to a question on the Congress extending support to the bandh, Yediyurappa wanted to know what that party did while in power.

“I don’t want to speak about others. I want to ask- Congress was in power right.

What did they do? They aregiving support to (agitation or bandh) while in opposition, what did they do while in power for five years? Rather than doing politics in the name of- Congress, BJP and JDS, honestly I’m ready work to solve issues in a non partisan way,” he said.

Congress leader and leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah had recently met Kannada organisations agitating for the implementation of the report and extended full support to them.

The protest organised by the “Karnataka Sanghatanegala Okkoota”, comprising a few factions of “Karnataka Rakshana Vedike”, has been backed by Ola-Uber cab drivers’ association, a few auto unions, farmers’ associations, street vendors association, trade unions and transporters’ associations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-pro-kannada--says-bsy--asks-outfits-to-call-off-bandh.html
161,13-2-20,Fresh batch of 25 envoys in J&K on two-day Govt-facilitated trip,"A second batch of 25 foreign envoys arrived here on Wednesday as part of a Union Government-facilitated trip to help them have a first-hand assessment of the situation in Jammu & Kashmir, a region which faced months of harsh restrictions after its special status was stripped of in August.

The envoys arrived at the Srinagar airport around 11 am but could not go ahead with their scheduled visit to Baramulla in north Kashmir due to inclement weather, officials said.

The foreign dignitaries instead went for a Shikara (boat) ride in the famous Dal Lake.

The Government had taken a group of 15 envoys to Jammu & Kashmir last month with an aim to make them see the efforts to bring back normalcy in Kashmir Valley. A number of Opposition parties called it a ‘guided tour’.

In New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that the group would meet representatives of the civil society, including youths, political leaders, local businessmen during their visit to the union territory.

After announcing reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir and withdrawal of its special powers, India imposed severe curbs including on movement of people as well as on mobile telephone and internet connectivity. The crackdown drew international criticism with several countries expressing concerns over the situation in Kashmir.

“As a part of the outreach efforts, visit of a second group of foreign heads of mission is being organised to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir on February 12-13,” the MEA said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/fresh-batch-of-25-envoys-in-j-k-on-two-day-govt-facilitated-trip.html

163,13-2-20,Ten-fold jump in grievances registered since 2014 as depts earned people’s trust: Minister,"The number of public grievances registered with the grievances cell has increased from just less than two lakh in 2014 to nearly 19 lakh now as the departments concerned have earned people’s trust, Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said on Wednesday. “When we came in 2014, the number of grievances registered in the grievances cell was not more than two lakh. Today, it is nearly 19 lakh. It is virtually a 10-time increase,” he said, adding that it reflects the trust citizens have posed in the Government.

The Government of India in 2019 received 18.7 lakh public grievances and disposed 18.1 lakh of them.

Singh said the increase in the number of grievances being registered is because the departments handling them are prompt and responsive, which has instilled confidence and trust among citizens.

He said the rate of disposal of grievances is now more than 95 per cent which is an achievement in itself. Launching the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) reforms at an event here, the Minister said a citizen-centric model of governance demands that there is a need to create awareness among the citizens for grievance redressal.

He said the main Mantra of the Modi government is to reach out to the last man in the queue with all the benefits of the welfare schemes.

The CPGRAMS 7.0 version has mapped last mile grievance officers, saving time and improving quality of disposal.

Accusing the BJP Governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh of trying to destroy the Constitution, she dubbed both Governments as ‘anti-poor and anti-people’.

Addressing people at Bilhariaganj locality here from the rooftop of her SUV, Priyanka Gandhi said, “Whatever happened with you was wrong, was an injustice. All of us will stand against the injustice.”

The Government which is at the Centre, and the one which is in UP, is anti-people and anti-poor, and is working to destroy the Constitution.

“If you and we do not save it, the Constitution will be destroyed,” she cautioned the people.

“You have seen the BJP Government in Uttarakhand say that reservation is not a constitutional right,” she said, alleging that the state government was talking of destroying the Constitution.

“You all have to stand up because all the laws which they are planning to bring in are not against one community, but against the entire Constitution,” she said amid slogan shouting by the crowd.

Asserting that the Congress party will stand with peaceful protesters, the party general secretary said, “I heard the women folk. I had gone to Bijnor, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Lucknow and Varanasi and other places where the police and the administration committed atrocities.

A report was drafted by our party and given to the NHRC.” She said she would also send names of policemen who committed atrocities in Azamgarh.

“The Congress party stands by you today, it will stand by you tomorrow, and will continue to stand by you until you get justice,” she added.

Though NRC authority denied any wrong doing in all data going offline and put the blame of non-timely renewal to the earlier NRC State Coordinator Prateek Hajela, opposition Congress has alleged it as ‘malafide’ and ‘deliberate’ action.

While the Centre assured all that the data is safe and termed the data going offline as ‘technical issues’, IT service provider Wipro said authorities concerned did not renew the services contract for the project after it expired.

Social media went berserk after the news broke with netizens strongly criticising the NRC Authority’s ‘negligence’ in handling the sensitive data, which contained the list of exclusion and inclusion of bonafide Indian citizens and were uploaded on its official website ‘www.nrcassam.nic.in’ after the final list was published on August 31, 2019.

Senior journalist-cum-RTI activist Saket Gokhale filed an RTI application to the NIC, the IT wing of the government, and made it public through his twitter account.

He sought a copy of the contract with Wipro regarding online hosting and storage of the official NRC list of Assam.

“Please provide name and details of the company used for cloud storage of the Assam NRC list along with the contract signed with it thereof,” the RTI requested.

Gokhale also sought all the relevant files pertaining to the contract renewal along with all official correspondence with Wipro and the cloud storage company.

In a separate tweet, the RTI activist questioned the NRC Authority’s decision to host the mammoth data on a private cloud service when the Government has its own such platform.

“What’s even more murkier is that govt-owned NIC has its own cloud service called Meghraj. Why the hell was the Assam NRC data stored on the Amazon AWS cloud when a domestic govt- owned option was freely available?” Gokhale tweeted.

He shared a screenshot from Wipro’s official website that talks about putting in place a “state-of-the-art fluid data center at Guwahati”.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/nrc-data-offline--centre-assures-safety--rti-filed-on-contract.html

170,13-2-20,AIADMK plans to regain voters’ trust,"Despite suffering setbacks in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the recently held local body election, the AIADMK Government led byChief Minister Edappadi Palnaniswami is planning for some major initiatives to regain the confidence of the voters.

While last Sunday saw the Chief Minister declaring the entire Cauvery Delta region (the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu) comprising of the districts lying along the banks of River Cauvery as a Protected Special Agricultural Zone, making it a no-go area for major industries which are not in sync with ecology and environment, it is reported that the Global Investors Meets (GIM) held in Chennai in 2015 and 2019 have started yielding results.

The two GIMs saw the signing of Memorndums of Understanding to the tune of Rs 5,43,000 crore. According to sources in Fort St George (Tamil Nadu Secretariat) most of the MoUs are under various stages of implementation. The Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are waiting for the right moment to declare the details like the number of people employed by the units which were already commissioned and the job potentials offered by the upcoming units.

“We may even come out with names and addresses of the persons who have been hired by those industries so that there would not be any doubts in the minds of political leaders and opponents of this Government about the authenticity of our achievement,” said a senior official in the secretariat.

Meanwhile , the announcement by the Chief Minister that Cauvery delta would be made a PSAZ has refurbished the image of the Government . Prof C Murukados, professor of economics, Madras University, said that the Government would not lose anything if the hydrocarbon and methane plants are not allowed clearance. “It is better not to have any industries in the Cauvery Delta region because the ecological and environmental degradation would be severe and drastic than the profits to be earned by corporate houses which were given license for setting up such projects. Other than these corporate giants, nobody in Tamil Nadu is going to make any gains because of the industries,” said Prof Murukados who himself has advised the Government from going ahead with industrialisation in the agricultural region.

S Semmalai, AIADMK MLA who is the senior most law maker in the party said that even companies who have been given clearance for setting up hydrocarbon and methane plants would be asked to stay away from the region. “The Government is well aware of the opposition to such projects. Though MoU has been signed for setting up a major refinery at a cost of Rs 50,000 crore, the location is outside the Cauvery Delta region and hence would become operational,” said Semmalai.

Political commentators like Govindarajan Satymurty are of the view that politics in Tamil Nadu is resembling a one-day cricket match with the AIADMK Government trying to score maximum runs in the slog overs. The question being asked is whether they would win the cup for third time in a row.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/aiadmk-plans-to-regain-voters----trust.html

The domestic unit finally settled at 71.34, down 6 paise over its previous close. The rupee had settled at 71.28 against the American currency on Tuesday.

Roy has also assured all Sahara investors that they would get their invested amount with full interest and an additional interest would be paid even for a day’s delay.

In a letter to investors on the occasion of the group’s 42nd Foundation Day, celebrated on February 1, Roy said the group always kept intact its tradition of timely payments and excellence in services but there has been delay in payments during the last seven years at certain places due to “some undesirable circumstances”.

Referring to a long-running dispute with capital market regulator Sebi over funds garnered by two group firms through issuance of certain bonds, Roy said the entire amount generated through sale or mortgage of assets or from joint ventures had to be deposited in a Sebi-Sahara account due to an embargo imposed by the Supreme Court. “Out of this, we cannot use even a single rupee for organisational work or even towards repayment to the esteemed investors,” Roy wrote.

Roy said Sahara has huge land parcels but developing townships or colonies on them has been difficult due to lack of funds for internal infrastructural development and for the requirement of depositing in Sebi-Sahara account any advance payment taken from residential unit buyers.

He, however, said these problems would be resolved soon as “two esteemed foreign investors with huge funds are coming with us in our real estate and city development businesses”. “Keeping in mind the directions of the Supreme Court, certain agreements have been signed, which will resolve Sahara’s problems within this year, that is 2020,” Roy said.

Sebi had ordered Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd (SHICL) in 2011 to refund the money raised from around three crore investors through Optionally Fully Convertible Bonds (OFCDs).

After a long process of appeals and cross-appeals, the Supreme Court on August 31, 2012 upheld Sebi’s directions asking the two firms to refund the money collected from investors with 15 per cent interest. Sahara was eventually asked to deposit an estimated Rs 24,000 crore with Sebi for further refund to investors, though the group has always maintained it amounted to “double payment” as it had already refunded more than 95 per cent investors directly.

Giving an update on the Sahara-Sebi matter, the government informed Parliament this Monday that Sahara group has deposited Rs 15,448.67 crore to ‘Sebi-Sahara Refund” account as on February 1, 2020, while a cheque of Rs 41.59 crore has also been given by the group in late January, which the court has directed to be accepted without prejudice.

Talking about the refund process, Roy said in his letter to investors that nearly Rs 22,000 crore was deposited in the Sebi-Sahara account (including the principal amount and the interest accrued on the same) till date, but Sebi could repay little over Rs 100 crore to investors despite giving four rounds of advertisements in 154 newspapers across the country.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/all-problems-to-be-resolved-in-2020--sahara-chief.html

According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) data, the manufacturing sector output contracted by 1.2 per cent in December 2019 as against a growth 2.9 per cent in the same month last year.

Electricity generation also fell by 0.1 per cent as against a growth of 4.5 per cent in December 2018.

Commenting on the IIP data, Rumki Majumdar, Economist, Deloitte India, said, “The contraction in the IIP in December raises concerns about the sustainability of the green shoots in industrial activities that were visible till last month. This does not bode well for the overall economy as global headwinds already pose significant challenges to overall industries.”

“The large outbreak of the coronavirus in China can adversely impact India as China is one of the largest trading partners. With several factories being closed down in China temporarily, the electronics and auto industry in India will likely be hit because of their dependence on Chinese imports of components and raw materials,” Majumdar added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/iip-contracts-0-3--in-dec-on-manufacturing-slump.html

However, the official said that as of now there is no clarity if the trade pact will be signed during President Trump’s visit on February 24-25.

Multiple rounds of talks have taken place between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in the past few weeks over telephone.

The two countries are negotiating a trade package to iron out certain issues and promote two-way commerce.

India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and greater market access for its products from sectors like agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, data localisation, and cut on import duties on some information and communication technology (ICT) products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.

In 2018-19, India’s exports to the US stood at $52.4 billion, while imports were $35.5 billion. Trade deficit dipped from $21.3 billion in 2017-18 to $16.9 billion in 2018-19.

POCSO Court's Special Judge Aneesh Dadhich held the man guilty of repeatedly raping his daughter on the basis of deposition by his mother that her son had committed a “disgusting and shameful crime” and she no longer wanted to hear his name.

After convicting the accused under various sections of the Indisan Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 70,000 on the convict, Public Prosecutor Lalchand Meena said.

The case against the man, whose wife had died years ago leaving her two-month-old daughter in his custody, was lodged in December 2017, when the hapless child first revealed her ordeal to an Anganwadi worker.

She used to go to an Anganwadi centre for her pre primary classes, said Meena.

People in public life must aim at eradication of poverty and make efforts to bring in unity among people,” he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Vice President's Secretariat.

Addressing a gathering at the launch of a book, “The vision of Antyodaya”, Naidu called for plugging loopholes in the anti-defection law to prevent elected representatives from defecting to another party without resigning.

He urged all political parties to discipline their members and ensure that such tendencies were curbed.

The vice president said people have a choice to change parties if they have a difference of opinion on ideology, but not for individual benefits.

“People in public life must treat their profession as a mission to serve and not for commission and they should not give remission to their responsibilities,” he added.

“The importance was noted of the full implementation of existing Russian-Turkish agreements including the Sochi memorandum,” the Kremlin said in a statement after the Putin-Erdogan phone call.

Army Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, who until last week was detailed by the Pentagon to the White House, testified before the House impeachment panel that Trump inappropriately pushed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Vindman was ousted from his job on the White House National Security Council on Friday, just two days after the Senate acquitted Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of justice charges.

He is to be reassigned by the Pentagon. His twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, who worked as an ethics lawyer at the NSC, also was ousted from his job and was re-assigned to the Army General Counsel’s Office.

Trump has already been sharply criticized for pushing out Alexander Vindman and others who crossed him in the impeachment hearings.

Asked whether he wanted to see Vindman face discipline, Trump said military officials “can handle him any way they want” but also suggested that he expected commanders to review the decorated, 20-year officer’s conduct.

“That’s going to be up the military,” Trump said. “We’ll have to see. They are certainly, I imagine, going to take a look at that.” Robert O’Brien, Trump’s national security adviser, said later Tuesday that Alexander Vindman was not asked to leave his White House job in retaliation for his testimony in the Democrats’ impeachment case.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-wants-pentagon-to-review-impeachment-witness----conduct.html

So far, the virus outbreak has claimed 1,115 lives with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province on Tuesday while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to 44,763, the state-run CGTN TV reported.

The number of confirmed cases abroad rose to 440 with one death so far in the Philippines. Japan reported the highest number of 203 cases with a majority of them from a cruise ship.

The virus, now named COVID-19, has spread to over 20 countries, including India.

The outbreak which led to the lockdown of nearly 20 cities in China with over 50 million people in Hubei province has led to increasing calls for freedom of speech, especially after the death of 34-year-old doctor, Li Wenliang, who faced a stern warning from police when he along with eight others tried to inform authorities about the virus epidemic in December.

Tragically, Li, an ophthalmologist died of the coronavirus on February 6, sparking a nation-wide outpouring rarely seen in China in recent years.

Following his death, hundreds of Chinese, led by academics have signed an online petition calling on the national legislature to protect citizens’ right to freedom of speech, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.

The petition is addressed to the National People’s Congress (NPC) often termed as the rubber-stamp parliament for its routine approval of the proposals of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC). The NPC is scheduled to meet early next month but the spread of the virulent virus cast doubts about the meeting as the Government discouraged large gatherings.

President Donald Trump, 73, who is seeking his reelection, won the New Hampshire Republican primary with a massive vote.

Sanders, 78, who lost to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primaries in New Hampshire, was ahead of his closest rival Pete Buttigieg.

With more than 85 per cent of the votes counted, the Senator from Vermont took 26 per cent support, followed by Buttigieg closely with 24.4 per cent and Amy Klobuchar coming third with 19.8 per cent of the votes.

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden were headed for distant fourth and fifth spots respectively.

“Now that we’ve gained another victory in New Hampshire, the establishment and financial elite are going to throw everything at us except the kitchen sink. And I have a feeling that the kitchen sink is coming pretty soon as well,” Sanders said after his victory in New Hampshire.

The Republican party and the Trump campaign said that Sanders winning the Democratic primary reflects that socialism has gained momentum in the Democratic party.

“One thing that is clear: Bernie Sanders winning his second state in a row shows how Socialism is now the mainstream in today’s Democrat Party,” Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.

195,13-2-20,Pesticides Management Bill gets Cabinet nod,"A bill to regulate pesticides business and compensate farmers in case of losses from usage of spurious agro-chemicals will be introduced in the Budget session of Parliament, the government said on Wednesday.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved Pesticides Management Bill, 2020, which seeks to replace the Insecticides Act, 1968, for regulating the pesticide sector by fixing prices and setting up an authority.

It would also regulate advertisements of pesticides and provides for heavy penalty as well as jail term for any violation of the law.

“As far as farmers are concerned because that is our primary concern, Pesticides Management Bill, 2020 will be introduced in this session of Parliament. Today, pesticide business is regulated by 1968 rules which have become age old and needs immediate rewriting,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/pesticides-management-bill-gets-cabinet-nod.html
196,13-2-20,Cabinet nod to Major Ports Authority Bill to replace existing law,"To provide autonomy to India’s top 12 major ports and improve their efficiency and competitiveness, the government on Wednesday gave nod to much-awaited Major Ports Authority Bill to replace a 1963 law governing the sector and said it will be introduced in the ongoing session of Parliament.

Earlier, the Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2016 and thereafter referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee but got lapsed after the dissolution of previous Lok Sabha.

“The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved Major Port Authority Bill, 2020 to replace existing Major Port Trust Act. It will provide more operational autonomy to ports and fast decisions will be possible at port level only. The Bill will be introduced in ensuing session of Parliament,” Shipping Minister Mansukh Lal Mandaviya said.

This will empower the major ports to perform with greater efficiency on account of full autonomy in decision making and by modernising the institutional framework of major ports, Mandaviya said.

This will not only boost India’s EXIM trade but generate employment, he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/cabinet-nod-to-major-ports-authority-bill-to-replace-existing-law.html

198,13-2-20,S&P affirms India’s rating at ‘BBB-’ with stable outlook,"Global ratings agency Standard and Poor’s on Thursday affirmed India’s sovereign rating at ‘BBB-’ with stable outlook, saying the country’s GDP growth is likely to gradually recover towards longer-term trend rates over the next two to three years.

‘BBB’ rating refers to adequate capacity of the rated entity to meet its financial commitments.

“Despite a notable deceleration in India’s economy in recent quarters, we believe its structural growth outperformance remains intact. Real GDP growth is therefore likely to gradually recover toward longer-term trend rates over the next two to three years,” S&P said in a statement.

It expects the economic growth rate to improve to 6 per cent during 2020-21, 7 per cent in the next fiscal and 7.4 per cent thereafter. “We expect India’s economy to continue to outperform peers at a similar level of income, despite a recent slowdown in real GDP growth. Supportive monetary, fiscal, and cyclical factors should support economic recovery, with real GDP growth averaging 7.1 per cent in fiscals 2020-2024,” it said.

The agency, however pointed out that India’s fiscal position remains precarious, with elevated fiscal deficits and net government indebtedness. Fiscal deficits have exceeded the government’s plan, S&P said, adding it expects limited consolidation over the next few years.

“S&P Global Ratings affirmed its ‘BBB-’ long-term and ‘A-3’ short-term unsolicited foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on India. The outlook on the long-term rating is stable,” it said in a statement. As per the National Statistical Office (NSO), India’s GDP growth is estimated to slow down to 5 per cent during 2019-20. The government expects growth to rebound to over 6 per cent in the next financial year.

Providing rationale for its rating action, S&P said the ratings on India reflect the country’s above-average real GDP growth, sound external profile, and evolving monetary settings.

As per the statement, the stable outlook reflects S&P’s expectation that India’s growth will be strong, the country will maintain its sound net external position, and its fiscal deficits will remain elevated but broadly in line with its forecasts over the next two years.

Further, “upward pressure” on the ratings could build if the government significantly curtails its fiscal deficits, resulting in lower net indebtedness at the general government level. Upside potential on the ratings could also increase if India’s external accounts strengthen substantially.

Also, the downward pressure on the ratings could emerge if India’s GDP growth falls well below the agency’s forecasts, causing it to reassess view of trend growth; net general government deficits rise further from their currently elevated levels; and political developments materially undermine economic reform momentum.

S&P further said the Indian economy had slowed measurably. Real GDP growth fell to a more than six-year low of 4.5 per cent in the second quarter of this fiscal. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of decline in year-on-year growth rate.

It also noted that tighter lending conditions continue across the financial system, particularly in the public sector. This, it said, is reflected in a gradual decline in credit growth.

In combination with ongoing liquidity concerns in the non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector following the September 2018 default by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and subsequent relatively less impactful defaults, domestic credit conditions have been somewhat mixed, it said.

“Weaker sentiment in the NBFI space may limit private consumption growth over the coming quarters,” it said.

The government’s August 2019 announcement that it will consolidate major public sector banks may also constrain credit growth over the next 12-24 months, it said.

“Nevertheless, we believe India is experiencing a cyclical, rather than a structural, economic slowdown. The economy’s long-term outperformance highlights its resilience.

“India’s wide range of structural trends, including healthy demographics and competitive unit labour costs, work in its favor. A more favourable corporate tax regime, which is particularly supportive of manufacturing firms, should reinforce growth, alongside additional fiscal and monetary easing,” it said.

The agency further said India’s economic growth faces headwinds over the near term, including subdued private sector investment and sentiment, labour market difficulties, and soft demand conditions. However, it believes the country’s long-term outperformance will remain intact.

India’s fiscal deficits will be higher in this fiscal year and the next, largely due to the economic slowdown and substantial cuts in corporate taxes, it added.

The Indian government’s fiscal 2020-21 budget acknowledges a rise in the Central government’s deficit to 3.8 per cent in 2019-20, and expects the deficit to fall marginally to 3.5 per cent next year.

S&P said the general elections held in April-May 2019 returned a robust mandate for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP-led government.

“The results suggest that major policy undertakings by the government in its first term, including GST and demonetisation, have not materially undermined support for the BJP-led coalition,” it said.

Over the next one to two years, this electoral support could encourage the government to pursue further reform initiatives, especially those aimed at liberalising foreign investment.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/s-p-affirms-india---s-rating-at----bbb-----with-stable-outlook.html
199,13-2-20,WHO to decide on emergency status of Ebola in DR Congo,"UN health agency experts meet on Wednesday to decide whether the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo should still be considered a global health emergency, following a sharp decline in reported cases.

The World Health Organisation last July declared it a “public health emergency of international concern” — a designation that gives the WHO greater powers to restrict travel and boost funding.

The outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DR Congo — an area where several militia groups are operating.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday said he was “encouraged” by an improvement in the situation, with only three cases reported in the past week.

But he added: “It’s not over.

201,13-2-20,An ode to the guru of minimalism,"Designer Wendell Rodricks’ death is a huge loss for the Indian fashion industry

Heaven is surely going to be a better dressed place now,” insists textile conservationist Madhu Jain about the death of her friend fashion designer, Wendell Rodricks. The gay rights activist and Padma Shri awardee died on Wednesday evening following a prolonged illness.

Nilakanth Halarnkar, BJP MLA from the Thivim Assembly constituency and a longtime associate of the 60-year-old designer confirmed his death. “Yes, it is true. He died at 5.45 pm. He was ailing for a long time,” Halarnkar said.

Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) is deeply disheartened with the sudden and untimely demise of him. “The fashion fraternity lost a legend today. Wendell, we will miss you,” FDCI wrote on social media.

Rodricks studied fashion designing in the USA and France from 1986 to 1988. His first collection from Goa earned him the title ‘guru of minimalism’ and his next collection in 1995 pioneered the concept of ‘resort wear’ and ‘eco-friendly’ garments at a time the words were not yet coined in India.

Rodricks’ silhouettes were what made him stand out and make a mark in the industry. In 2010 Wendell revived the weaving of the traditional Goan Kunbi saree, a two year project involving identifying and training weavers in the use of saree looms. This unique Kunbi saree and other garments using the same weave were showcased at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. Saree lovers like Sonia Gandhi, Sheila Dixit and Pratibha Patil have bestowed praise on the designer for reviving a dying craft.

Jain added, “This is a huge loss for the Indian fashion industry because Wendell was not only a designer but he also mentored talent. “If I talk about my generation of designers, when you saw talent, you didn’t try to suppress it, rather enhanced it. His sense of style and generosity was legendary. Wendell was the master of silhouettes. He did a lot to revive the Kunbi sarees. I pray for his soul. I remember this last session we had where we discussed about some of the unpleasant things happening in the fashion industry. He was very concerned, which is a rare thing in the fashion industry. But he spoke his mind, always.”

In January 2012 Rodricks turned author with Moda Goa — History and Style published by Harper Collins. This book got rave reviews for its portrayal of long forgotten aspects of Goa’s cultural history and costume history. In August 2012, Wendell’s memoir, The Green Room, was published by Rupa Raintree and launched at Lakme Fashion Week.

A designer with an international presence, Wendell has presented his unique garments, inspired by Goa and India, at major fashion events. Rodricks has the honour of being the first Indian designer to be invited to show at the World’s largest garment fair IGEDO in Germany (1995), Dubai Fashion Week (2001), Malaysia Fashion Week (2002), the prestigious Paris Pret-a-Porter salon (2007) and the world’s biggest organic fair BioFach in Nuremberg, Germany (2012). In 2007, the Confederation of Indian Industries invited the designer to showcase two fashion shows in Bryant Park, New York to celebrate the 60th year of India’s Independence. Rodricks has also, shown at Festival of India (1993) in Beijing and Shanghai in China and has shown in Sri Lanka.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/an-ode-to-the-guru-of-minimalism-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/an-ode-to-the-guru-of-minimalism.html

204,13-2-20,Science empowers women,"Science and education empower people, especially women who needs more empowerment and representation even now. That is why our government is supporting women empowerment,” said Dr Riad Kamel Abbas, Ambassador of Syria to India. He was the chief guest for the International Day of Women and Girls in Science at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur.

“Syria is a small country but we are diverse in terms of culture and religion. Our aim is to move towards equality. Women are the basis of our society. So we are providing free education and medicine in Syria,” said the diplomat. He added: “SRMIST is one of the best universities in India and Syrian students studying here must make use of this opportunity well.” He also urged students to complete their education and go back to their motherland so that they can contribute towards its development.

Dean (sciences) Dr D John Thiruvadigal welcomed the gathering. He said that the college is giving several benefits for women researches, including seed grants.

In his presidential address, vice-chancellor of SRMIST, Dr Sandeep Sancheti said, “People have started realising the capacity of women in science. They are multitasking and capable of delivering what is required, although they face several challenges in domestic and professional front. We have to make sure that women in sciences are given due respect because they have a lot to deal with. Unlike other subjects, science involves fieldwork, test, laboratory based investigations and observations. It cannot be done in the domain of the home. Families and institutions should give them the power to grow.”

Director (International Relations), Kartar Singh said SRMIST hosts a large number of Syrian students. He urged students to work on different projects and researches so that it has an impact on women. He also pointed out that many funding agencies ask the primary question as to how their project would benefit women.

Registrar of SRMIST, Dr N Sethuraman highlighted how the college motivates women students and professors.

Syrian students received their course completion certificate for Diploma in English from the Syrian Ambassador on the occasion. SRMIST students performed cultural events. Research assistant professor, Dr P Shoba gave a presentation on “Women raising the hidden barriers through science.” She motivated the audience on how science should be perceived as a powerful weapon by woman to reach the place where they deserve to be.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/science-empowers-women-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/science-empowers-women.html

206,13-2-20,Dembele out of Euro 2020,"Ousmane Dembele will miss Euro 2020 after Barcelona announced the France international will be out for around six months following surgery on his right hamstring on Tuesday.

Dembele’s absence also means he will be sidelined for the rest of this season for Barca, who will be without another attacker after losing Luis Suarez to a long-term knee injury last month.

“The first team player Ousmane Dembele has successfully undergone surgery ... for a ruptured tendon in his proximal hamstring in his right thigh. The Frenchman will be out for around six months,” the La Liga champions said in a statement.

The 22-year-old has suffered a number of hamstring problems since joining from Borussia Dortmund in August 2017 in a deal worth up to 147 million euros.

Dembele has made only nine appearances this season and was close to recovering from a hamstring injury before suffering a relapse in training last week.

The former Rennes attacker also missed the majority of his opening year at Barcelona with a similar problem which kept the forward out for four months.

207,13-2-20,Southern Stars win tri-series final,"Mandhana’s blazing 66 goes in vain as India choke again and fall short by 11 runs to gift T20 trophy

India opener Smriti Mandhana’s 37-ball 66 went in vain as Australia claimed the tri-nation women’s T20 series with a gritty 11-run win following a sensational five-wicket haul by spinner Jess Jonassen here on Wednesday.

Set a target of 156, India were all out for 144 after being 115 for three in the 15th over.

Seasoned left-arm spinner Jonassen was the star of the show with brilliant figures of 5 for 12 in four overs, making her only the third Australian bowler to return a five-for in the women’s T20 format.

“It was a really good all-round performance. Getting Mandhana was the game-changer, she was whacking us all over the park,” said Australian captain Meg Lanning.

Opting to bat, Australia managed to post 155 for six in their stipulated 20 overs. Chasing a challenging target, Mandhana was up to the task at hand and smashed 12 boundaries in her knock at the Junction Oval.

However, Mandhana’s dismissal in the 15th over, caught brilliantly by Nicola Carey in the deep mid-wicket, turned the match in Australia’s favour as they put the brakes on India’s scoring while at the same time taking wickets.

It was the departure of skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, in the 16th over, which dashed India's hopes of a victory.

“In the last three overs we couldn’t take the pressure and ended up losing wickets,” said Harmanpreet, reflecting on the loss.

Earlier in the day, India’s Rajeshwari Gayakwad leaked 19 runs in the last over to let Australia off the hook and post a challenging total.

Opener Beth Mooney, who was adjudged player of the series for her 208 runs in the event, top-scored for the hosts with an aggressive 71 off 54 balls, hitting nine boundaries at the Junction Oval.

At the end of the 19th over, Australia were finding it difficult to free their arms at 136 for five.

However, Mooney and Rachael Haynes (18 off 7 balls) hit out in the last six balls to prop up Australia, ruining left-arm spinner Gayakwad’s day.

Opting to bat, Australia were dealt an early blow when Alyssa Healy (4) was dismissed in the very first over of the summit clash by Deepti Sharma, extending the wicketkeeper’s woeful run with the bat.

Mooney found an ally in Ashleigh Gardner (26), with whom the opener added 52 runs for the second wicket, and then Lanning, who also made 26 during a 51-run third-wicket stand.

Deepti, who opened the bowling, finished with impressive figures of 2/30 in her four-over spell, while Gayakwad had 2/32.

India’s 16-year-old Richa Ghosh made her first appearance for India, scoring 17 off 23 balls.

209,13-2-20,‘Dialogue can resolve issues’,"Producer-director Vidhu Vinod Chopra says that Shikara was his most challenging film as he had to remain dispassionate to depict the truth and yet make a compelling argument that the only solution to hatred is love. By Team Viva

Shikara, a film about the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in early 1990, in the wake of violent Islamist insurgency was highly anticipated because the veteran filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra hails from the state.

After the film’s release, however, certain sections of people called out the film and its director. A video of a Kashmiri Pandit woman lashing out at the director at a screening in the city also went viral.

The hashtag #BoycottShikara started trending on Twitter and people were accusing Chopra of going soft on the subject rather than giving an unflinching account of the horrific atrocities that Kashmiri Pandits suffered.

Chopra said renowned Hollywood filmmaker James Cameron has praised his film: “This film opened with great reviews everywhere. I presume you would have heard about a man called James Cameron who has directed Titanic and Avatar. He called this film a masterpiece in a four-page letter. In India, the film released to full houses and great reviews. Then, suddenly all this hate wave comes up.”

He added, “I am not on Twitter or on any social media. What came as a big surprise for us is that our rating on IMDb, which was around eight or nine, dropped to one. We found that on all these social media platforms, people have started putting up videos and saying ‘this how you press the button to give the film a one-star rating’.”

Chopra said Shikara is close to his heart. “This is a very special film and it talks about events that happened even before all of you (students) were born. Around 30 years back, four lakh Kashmiris were thrown out of their homeland and my mother was one of them. I am technically a refugee in my own country because I am from Kashmir.”

He added that he never compromised on anything while making films in his career. “All my life I have never compromised on films I have made, whether it is 3 Idiots or the Munna Bhai series or Shikara. In every film, I tried and give you guys a message. In Munna Bhai, I talked about jaadu ki jhappi and in 3 Idiots I gave critical advice to students, to chase excellence and success will follow. I am happy to say that many lives changed with that film,” he pointed out.

Chopra felt that even this film would have the same impact. “In the same way, in Shikara we have a message that says, todo nahin, jodo (don’t break, unite) because we are at a stage in life where it is becoming a norm to say, “don’t unite, break.” Everything is breaking, be it systems or cities. I would urge you to watch this film and spread the message of this film because you (students) are the future. If you like the films, then go to social media and fix that criticism about it. Even if you don’t like it, remember its message,” he said.

Chopra had penned an open letter on Facebook to counter all criticism against this film. In the letter, the filmmaker elaborated on the sufferings that he, along with his family members, had to suffer when they were driven out of their homeland as a result of being targeted by Islamist insurgents three decades ago. He described the accusations as “nonsensical” and also urged people to not repeat past mistakes.

In an e-mail interview, the director spoke about the film and more.

You are directing after a long hiatus. Why this gap?

I was involved in the filmmaking process but for me to direct, the story had to be compelling. I had made up my mind that I am going to bring the Kashmiri Pandits’ story to celluloid and that process itself took me all these years. I was writing, researching, visiting, talking to people, identifying actors and trying to create an authentic story which would help me to tell the truth behind the Kashmiri Pandit issue. For me, this is not just a film. It is a movement of sorts to make the nation realise the trauma this community experienced and the sheer helplessness with which they have been packed off in various refugee camps across the country. It was difficult to write. I worked with Abhijat Joshi and Rahul Pandita for several years before I could bring it to life.

You left Kashmir 30 years back. What took you so long to approach the topic of migration of Pandits?

I started work on this topic post my mother’s demise in 2007. This film required significant research so that we could tell an absorbing story, which is fact-based and helps in bringing this conversation to the fore. I have done more work in those years but this was perhaps my most challenging film as I had to remain dispassionate as a filmmaker to depict the truth and yet make a compelling argument that the only solution to such hatred is love and that is at the centre of my film. The love between Shiv Kumar Dhar and Shanti Dhar (the chief protagonists — Shanti is also my mother’s name) is a binding factor which forces us to think beyond hatred. The shoot was mostly in Kashmir which was under heavy security cover so we had limited time to get the work done. Authenticity was the key. The writing also took significant time as I had to go through tons of documentation and video footage to bring reality to the fore.

These are politically sensitive times. Do you think that the film could be misinterpreted/misused?

Only after watching the film will you realise how relevant it is to solving the Kashmiri Pandit issue. I believe that dialogue in a conducive environment can help resolve issues. Yes injustice has been done and in the film it has been portrayed in the way it occurred, ghastly, inhumane and without any mercy. This was what we all went through, but I believe this hate has to end and dialogue will help us do that.

Can artistes afford to be political?

There is a clear divide in Bollywood. Artistes are human beings and the Constitution gives them the right as all other Indians to express their views.

What are your memories of Kashmir?

One of my fondest memories of growing up in Kashmir in the 70s is travelling with the family in a houseboat. It used to take us almost a week to reach the Kheer Bhawani temple. We used to cook on our way to the temple, stopping en-route at the Hazratbal Shrine. We would do this each time, without fail. There was absolutely no distinction in our heads between those two places of worship. This memory was in my head even when I was making Mission Kashmir, where I tried to portray how negative elements use religion to divide and destabilise us. I hope and pray that days like that return to the valley, perhaps for another young Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who might be growing up in Kashmir. That is my dream.

When do we see the next in the series of Munna Bhai?

You will see it very soon.

Digital is an exciting space. Do you plan to venture in it?

Yes, I have lots of ideas for this exciting space.

There are different kinds of stories being told. What has triggered that change?

Good writing is the key. Everyone is experimenting with new ideas and subjects and it is a great sign. This should keep on happening. In our studio, we continue to explore new topics and areas which can be used to send positive, inspirational and introspective message in society.

210,13-2-20,Parasite depicts class warfare brilliantly,"Bong Joon-ho’s film Parasite starts in a dingy, half-basement apartment with a family of four barely able to scratch out a life. There must be no place to go but up, right? Yes and no. There’s nothing predictable when the South Korean director is on his game.

This dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There’s always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.

It tells the story of the impoverished four-person Kim family who, one by one, and with careful and devious planning, all get employed by the four-person affluent Park family — as a tutor, an art teacher, a driver and a housekeeper. They are imposters stunned by the way wealth can make things easier: “Money is an iron. It smooths out all the creases,” says the Park patriarch with wonder.

Bong, who directed and wrote the story for Parasite, has picked his title carefully, of course. Naturally, he’s alluding to the sycophantic relationship by a clan of scammers to the clueless rich who have unwittingly opened the doors of their home on a hill. But it’s not that simple. The rich family seem incapable of doing anything — from dishes to sex — without help. Who’s scamming who?

Bong’s previous films play with film genres and never hide their social commentary — think of the environmentalist pig-caper “Okja” and the dystopian sci-fi global warming scream “Snowpiercer.” But this time, Bong’s canvas is a thousand times smaller and his focus light-years more intense. There are no CGI train chases on mountains or car chases through cities. (There is also, thankfully, 100 per cent less Tilda Swinton, a frequent, over-the-top Bong collaborator.)

The two Korean families first make contact when a friend of the Kim’s son asks him to take over English lessons for the Park daughter. Soon the son (a dreamy Choi Woo-sik) convinces them to hire his sister (the excellent Park So-dam) as an art teacher, but doesn’t reveal it’s his sis. She forges her diploma and spews arty nonsense she learned on the internet, impressing the polite but firm Park matriarch (a superb Jo Yeo-jeong.)

The Park’s regular chauffeur is soon let go and replaced by the Kim patriarch (a steely Lee Sun-kyun). Ditto the housemaid, who is dumped in favor of the Kims’ mother (a feisty Jang Hye-jin.) All eight people seem happy with the new arrangement until Bong reveals a twist: There are more parasites than you imagined. The clean, impeccably furnished Park home will have some blood splashing about.

Bong’s trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward. “Keep it focused,” the Kim’s son counsels his father at one point. Bong has followed that advice.

There are typically dazzling Bong touches throughout. Just look for all the insect references — stink bugs at the beginning to flies at the end, and a preoccupation with odor across the frames. And there’s a scene in which the rich matriarch skillfully winds noodles in a bowl while, in another room, duct tape is being wrapped around a victim and classical music plays.

Bong could have been more strident in his social critique but hasn’t. There are no villains in Parasite — and also no heroes. Both families are forever broken after chafing against each other, a bleak message about the classes ever really co-existing (Take that, “Downton Abbey”).

The South Korean director and his masterful social thriller had won best original screenplay, best international film, best director, and best picture, the latter a history-shattering win as the first non-English language film to win the top prize in the Oscars’ 92-year history.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/parasite-depicts-class-warfare-brilliantly-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/parasite-depicts-class-warfare-brilliantly.html
211,13-2-20,Trend Blazer,"‘Not averse to playing cameos’

Actor Bhumi Pedenkar, who will be seen making special appearances in films like Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan and Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship, says she is not averse to playing cameos in films.

“I am driven to content at all times. As an artist, I have been fortunate that such films have found me. I want to be part of the best cinema that is being made by our industry. It is a personal ambition and a goal and so, when a good film requires me to play a cameo, I'm not averse to it,” Bhumi said.

This year will also see Bhumi headlining three films Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitaare, Durgavati and a yet-untitled film.

‘It's important to constantly keep reinventing yourself as an artiste and that has always been my endeavour. The industry folks have been sending me such out-of-the-world stories that I am frankly having a hard time choosing my next project. The sheer volume of stories that have come my way is mindboggling. I have shortlisted a few interesting ideas and I am still reading a lot of screenplays.’

—Ali Fazal

Actor Sayani Gupta is set to co-produce Where the Wind Blows, a film which will feature her as the only protagonist. It's been directed by Karma Takapa, whose films Ralang Road and Mor Mann Ke Bharam have travelled to various festivals.

Sayani said, “This film is very close to my heart. Shooting for it was not lesser than a roller coaster ride. Though the shoot was difficult, the experience was one of the most memorable ones. I had the best time shooting with Karma and team.”

Margot to work with Christian Bale

Actor Margot Robbie will be seen alongside actor Christian Bale in David O Russells next film.

Russell will direct the film from his own script. Plot details are being kept under wraps. Matthew Budman will produce the project. He had been considering options in the last few months while waiting for the right cast to come together for the project.

With Bale and Robbie's schedules opening, the opportunity to direct his first film since 2015's Joy is set in the right direction.

In 2019, Robbie was seen in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, where she played Sharon Tate, as well as Bombshell.

216,13-2-20,Bhajji backs Gill over Prithvi for 1st Test,"Shubman Gill’s stellar show in the recently-concluded India A series is an indicator that he is ready for Test debut, feels senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.

Shubman had scores of 83 and 204 not out batting in middle-order in the first A Test and then scored a hundred opening in the second game, showing his versatility at different slots.

Prithvi Shaw, back in the Test squad after 16 months, is also a contender in the playing XI with his equally dazzling repertoire of strokes.

“Shubman should get his chance since he has been part of the team (as reserve opener) for quite a while without playing any Test match,” Harbhajan, who has been Gill’s state team skipper in white ball cricket said.

Their journeys have been intertwined since the U-19 days but in next 10 days, Prithvi and Shubman will provide skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri with a lot to ponder while fighting to be Mayank Agarwal’s opening partner in first Test against New Zealand, starting February 21.

With Rohit Sharma being ruled out due to a hamstring injury and the in-form KL Rahul surprisingly ignored by the outgoing selection committee, India could go into the series with Agarwal, who has so far played nine Tests, as the senior opener.

India’s woes could be compounded as Agarwal, despite his superb initiation in Test cricket, has been in wretched form, bagging a pair (0 in both innings) of the A Test in Christchurch and failing in all three ODIs.

He also had a quiet couple of Ranji Trophy games.

However, Harbhajan feels that Agarwal should continue as the main opener.

“Mayank is a proven player in Test cricket and a top batsman. He understands his game very well. Just because of three ODI innings and a practice game, you don’t drop him. It doesn’t work like that,” Harbhajan explained.

“He has been scoring lots of runs wherever he is playing, so I feel Mayank and Shubman should start in first Test,” he added.

But, former India stumper Deep Dasgupta has a contrarian view and wants Prithvi to start in the playing XI.

“I fully understand that Shubman is in great form but remember one thing. It was Prithvi who made his Test debut before even Mayank. He did well and was first choice in Australia before getting injured,” Dasgupta’s take was different from Harbhajan.

Dasgupta, who was in New Zealand as an analyst, feels Prithvi looked in great touch throughout even though he didn’t get a big knock.

“If Prithvi has been out injured, then he should rightfully get his place back in the side. Shubman has to wait.”

Asked if Shubman, whose range of strokes is way more than Hanuma Vihari, could be accommodated in the middle-order, both replied in the negative.

“No, in the middle order, Vihari is a better bet. He has done nothing wrong in his limited opportunities. Shubman’s real impact is when he is opening,” said Harbhajan.

Dasgupta couldn’t agree more.

“The last series that he played in the West Indies, he was adjudged Man of the Series so you can’t pick Shubman in middle-order ahead of Vihari based on one double hundred.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bhajji-backs-gill-over-prithvi-for-1st-test.html
217,13-2-20,"SC refuses PIL seeking CBI probe into 'molestation' of Gargi students, asks petitioner to move HC","The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea seeking a CBI probe monitored by it into the alleged molestation of students during a cultural festival at the all-woman Gargi College here last week.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde asked lawyer M L Sharma, who mentioned the matter seeking urgent hearing, to move the Delhi High Court with his plea.

""Why don't you go to the Delhi HC. If they dismiss the petition then you come here,"" the bench, also comprising justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, said.

The apex court said it would like to have advantage of Delhi HC's view on this matter.

Sharma expressed apprehension that electronic evidence related to the case might be destroyed.

On this, the top court said, ""Delhi High Court can also pass order like the Telangana High Court in the police encounter case to preserve electronic evidence"".

Sharma had sought a direction to the probe agency to seize all video recordings and CCTV camera footage of the college campus.

He had also sought arrest of the people behind the ""planned criminal conspiracy"".

On February 6, a group of men broke into Gargi College during the 'Riverie' fest and allegedly groped, harassed and molested the attendees, who claimed that security officials just kept watching when the incident took place.

The incident came to light after some students took to Instagram to narrate their unpleasant experiences during the fest and alleged that security personnel did nothing to control the unruly groups.

The petitioner alleged that it was a planned political and criminal conspiracy hatched in the backdrop of the Delhi elections and since February 6, no action has been taken against the accused.

Polls is Delhi were held on February 8 and the result was declared on February 11.

""The state government took no action. It is a clear criminal conspiracy hatched by the political party to deploy accused persons to provoke the Delhi public for effecting voting in their favour. Despite presence of Delhi Police ... On February 6, neither principal nor other state authorities tried to stop and arrest the accused persons,"" the PIL had stated.

The petition claimed that ""deliberate chants of Jai Shri Ram discloses that it is a political, planned conspiracy"" and blamed the chief minister of Delhi for not taking any action against the accused.

""Entire incident is being supported/protected by the state government and no action of arrest has been done till now for justice and to prosecute all accused persons therefore unless this court takes action, real political persons and accused persons will not be arrested at all,"" the plea had said.

Besides the security arranged by the college, the area had Delhi Police and paramilitary force personnel who were stationed there for the assembly polls.

According to police, a case was registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-on-gargi-college-incident--asks-petitioner-to-approach-hc-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-refuses-pil-seeking-cbi-probe-into--molestation--of-gargi-students--asks-petitioner-to-move-hc.html

224,13-2-20,Dalal Delhivers,"Opener Hiten Dalal smashed his maiden first-class hundred before Himmat Singh and Jonty Sidhu shared a 147-run stand to propel Delhi to 389 for six on day one of their final Ranji Trophy league match against Rajasthan here on Wednesday.

Dalal (102 off 93) and Anuj Rawat (45 off 70) took control of the proceedings with an opening stand of 142. After their dismissal, Jonty Sidhu (92 off 137) and Himmat Singh (90 off 128) anchored the innings to put Delhi in a strong position.

It was an ordinary bowling effort from Rajasthan who allowed Delhi to score at 4.37 runs per over after electing to bowl at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground.

It was a memorable knock from Dalal, who is playing his 12th first-class match, comprising 18 fours and a six.

Tanveer Ul-Haq was the pick of the bowlers for Rajasthan, taking two wickets for 78 runs in 17 overs.

All but out of the quarterfinal race, Delhi need other results to go their way and a big win over Rajasthan to remain in the hunt for a knockout berth.

With just 18 points from seven games, Delhi are currently languishing at the 10th spot in the 18-team Group A and B cross pool and are virtually out of the reckoning, but a bonus point win over Rajasthan and some favourable results can still keep them in the fray.

In Patiala, Punjab bowled out Bengal for 138 on day one with left-arm spinner Vinay Choudhary taking six wickets.

In response, Punjab were 93 for three at stumps with skipper Mandeep Singh unbeaten on 29.

third 100 for Sarfaraz

Rajkot: Saurashtra bowlers led by skipper Jaydev Unadkat dished out a clinical show to restrict Tamil Nadu to 250/7 in their last Elite Group B match.

While the result of the game would not affect Saurashtra, as they have qualified for the knockouts already, it would have a bearing on Tamil Nadu’s prospects as nothing short of a win would help the side.

For Tamil Nadu, the experienced Abhinav Mukund (86) and N Jagadeesan (61 not out) scored fifties.

Jagadeesan’s knock ensured that the visitors reached the 250-run mark.

Meanwhile, at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Sarfaraz Khan and Aakarshit Gomel hammered hundreds to take Mumbai to a commanding 352/4 in an inconsequential game against Madhya Pradesh.

Gomel made his first-class debut.

Both the teams are already out of the tournament.

For Mumbai, Sarfaraz (169 not out) and Gomel (122) steadied the ship with their 275-run stand after the top order failed once again.

This season belonged to Sarfaraz, who has hit a triple hundred, double hundred and now a hundred.

225,13-2-20,Injured Maxwell could miss beginning of IPL,"Australia’s dashing all-rounder Glenn Maxwell is set to miss the beginning of the IPL after an elbow injury on Tuesday ruled him out of the upcoming ODIs and T20 Internationals in South Africa.

Maxwell will undergo surgery on his left elbow and will be replaced by D’Arcy Short in both squads.

Cricket Australia said he might require at least six to eight weeks to attain full match fitness, which means he is likely to miss the beginning of the IPL too, which is starting on March 29. The 31-year-old is representing Kings XI Punjab in the franchise-based league.

A “shattered” Maxwell said the decision to withdraw from the South African tour was difficult.

“I was not confident that I could perform at international level with my elbow in its current state and have decided to undergo surgery straight away to fix the issue,” Maxwell said in a statement.

“I would like to thank Justin Langer, Ben Oliver, Trevor Hohns and the whole Australian squad for their understanding.”

The South Africa tour was the first time Maxwell had been picked for national duties since taking a break from cricket in October due to mental health issues.

Australia’s national selector Trevor Hohns said Maxwell’s increased pain could not have been overlooked.

“We are disappointed to lose Glenn this close to the tour as we were looking forward to welcoming him back to the national side in both the 20 and 50-over formats after his break during the summer,” Hohns was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia.

“Unfortunately, the pain he has experienced in the elbow in the latter stages of the BBL increased over the weekend and he will have surgery immediately to rectify the situation.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/injured-maxwell-could-miss-beginning-of-ipl.html
226,13-2-20,USA equal record lowest ODI total,"Young leg-spin sensation Sandeep Lamichhane on Tuesday claimed six wickets to help Nepal rip out USA for the equal-lowest score in ODI history.

Only Xavier Marshall (16) could reach the double figures as USA were bowled out for 35 in the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 match played at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground.

Lamichhane finished with career-best figures of 6/16. Sushan Bhari, a slow left-arm orthodox by trade, picked up the other four wickets of the innings. Nepal also broke the world record for the least balls taken by a team to bowl out the opposition in an ODI as they bundled out USA inside 12 overs.

The USA’s score is level with Zimbabwe’s effort against Sri Lanka in Harare in 2004. The next lowest scores are by Canada (36), Zimbabwe (38) and Sri Lanka (43).

Nepal chased down the target in 32 balls with eight wickets in hand.The match also entered history books as it was the shortest-ever ODI.

227,13-2-20,Ritu focussed on becoming MMA champion,"Wrestler-turned-Mixed Martial Arts fighter Ritu Phogat on Wednesday said she might return to wrestling in future but currently she’s focussed on putting in the hard yards to achieve her dream of becoming India’s first MMA world champion.

Ritu, who had bagged the 2016 Commonwealth Wrestling Championships Gold and Silver at the 2017 World Under-23 Championships, won her debut MMA fight at the One: Age of Dragons event, beating South Korea’s Nam Hee Kim in under three minute.

The 25-year-old from Haryana, daughter of the legendary wrestling coach Mahavir Singh Phogat, will next feature in her second MMA bout on February 28 in Singapore.

“I know I still have a long way to go, but I’m willing to continue to put the work in until I reach my ultimate goal. My dream is to give India its first ever mixed martial arts world champion,” she said ahead of her face-off with China’s Pro MMA fighter Wu Chiao Chen at One: King Of The Jungle on February 28.

“As an athlete, I am open to meet any challenge head on. Working with elite world champions at Evolve in Singapore has really cultivated my combat skills and transformed me into a complete fighter.”

Asked if she plans to return to wrestling, Ritu said: “Yes, definitely. My wrestling career has been a fantastic one but I wanted to do something new. When I decided to make the transition to mixed martial arts, I knew the risk and the rewards. “I knew the Olympic was scheduled in 2020 but I wanted to be a MMA champion, so when I got the opportunity I didn’t let it go. Right now, I am focussed on this. So let’s see what lies in future.

“My father also wanted me to make the country proud, so whether it is wrestling or mixed martial art, I would give my everything to make my country proud,” added Ritu, who featured in an exciting workout session here.

Asked about her cousin and World Championships Bronze medallist Vinesh Phogat’s chances at the Tokyo Olympics, Ritu said: “Vinesh is doing really well and not only me but the whole country has this expectation that she becomes the country’s first female gold medallist in wrestling.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ritu-focussed-on-becoming-mma-champion.html
228,13-2-20,Indian women need to learn from mistakes to win elusive ICC trophy: Edulji,"Former captain Diana Edulji feels the Indian women’s team will have to learn from the repeated mistakes it is making at the moment to end its ICC title drought in the upcoming T20 World Cup.

The tournament is to be held in Australia from February 21.

Edulji, who did a lot for women’s cricket during her 33-month tenure as a member of the Committee of Administrators running the BCCI, said the current team is losing games which it should win far too many times.

“There is something wrong with this team. This is a team which can win every game and it does win from an unlikely situation but the next game it is losing from a comfortable position like it did today. They are simply not consistent enough.

“They have all the facilities at their disposal now, at par with men, and yet they have not been able to play consistent cricket and win ICC trophies. If they play like the way they are playing, they will make the semifinals again (at T20 World Cup) but I don’t see them winning the trophy,” Edulji said shortly after India’s loss at the Junction Oval.

In the tri-series, India won and lost a game each against Australia and England in the league stage before faltering against the hosts in the final. The team is prone to crumbling under pressure in big games.

India, who went unbeaten into the semifinals of the 2018 World T20, came a cropper against England. In 2017, India were cruising towards their maiden ODI World Cup title before the middle-order collapsed inexplicably. Back then, the team was given a rousing reception despite finishing runners-up.

Edulji reckons the batters’ running between the wickets and shot selection can be a lot better.

“They are so lazy that they never try for a second. These are the things that make all the difference. It is a single or a boundary, there is nothing in between,” said the 64-year who played 20 Tests and 36 ODIs.

While Smriti Mandhana has been solid at the top, the likes of Jemimah Rodrigues and skipper Harmanpreet have not been as consistent. The middle-order anyway has not fired regularly.

“Both Harmanpreet and Jemimah need to pull up their socks. Maybe Harman should give up captaincy and play her natural game. Something seems to be troubling her. But who else takes over then. If Smriti is handed captaincy, it might affect her batting too,” said Edulji.

In the bowling department, the team has been relying on spinners for a long time as there are hardly any quality pacers around.

“It just shows there are no quality pacers in domestic cricket. You only have Shikha Pandey of some calibre. What is being done to produce pacers? We are bound to play with a spin heavy attack if there are no pacers around.

“We are not concentrating on junior cricket enough. How come Australia have pacers who can bowl at 120 kmph and we don’t?” asked Edulji.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/indian-women-need-to-learn-from-mistakes-to-win-elusive-icc-trophy--edulji-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women-need-to-learn-from-mistakes-to-win-elusive-icc-trophy--edulji.html
229,13-2-20,Amit Panghal is world No.1 in IOC's Boxing Task Force rankings for Olympic Qualifiers,"World silver-medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) has been ranked number one by the IOC's Boxing Task Force ahead of next month's Olympic Qualifiers, making him the first Indian pugilist in over a decade to achieve the global top position in his category.

In 2009, Olympic bronze-medallist Vijender Singh did it for the first time after he opened India's account at the world championships with a bronze in the 75kg division.

The 24-year-old Panghal holds the numero uno position with 420 points, according to the list released by the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Boxing Task Force, which is in charge of administering the sport right now.

The IOC task force will be conducting the Olympic qualifiers and the main event later this year in Tokyo as the International Boxing Association (AIBA) is currently suspended for alleged financial and administrative mismanagement.

The rankings took into account the last two world championships for both men and women and the continental championships and Games in 2019. The Asian Olympic Qualifiers will be held in Amman, Jordan next month.

Panghal has enjoyed a phenomenal run since 2017, clinching gold medals at the 2018 Commonwealth and Asian Games.

Last year, he became the first Indian to claim a silver medal at the world championships after notching up a gold at the Asian meet.

In the women's rankings, celebrated six-time world champion M C Mary Kom occupies the fifth spot in the 51kg category. Mary Kom, who won an unprecedented eighth world medal -- a bronze -- last year, has 225 points. Her rival Nikhat Zareen is ranked 22nd with 75 points.

However, the best-placed Indian among women boxers is Lovlina Borgohain, who holds the third position in the 69kg division. The 22-year-old Borgohain is a two-time world bronze-medallist.

Among other Indians, Asian silver-medallist Kavinder Singh Bisht (57kg) is placed seventh with 190 points, followed by former world bronze-winner Gaurav Bidhuri at 32nd spot.

In the men's 63kg division, world bronze-winner Manish Kaushik is the best-placed Indian at 12th, followed by four-time Asian-medallist Shiva Thapa at the 36th position.

Veteran Manoj Kumar, a three-time Commonwealth Games podium-finisher, is 71st in the 69kg category, in which Ashish is the highest-positioned Indian at 22nd.

Two-time world and Asian silver-winner Sonia Chahal holds the 10th spot in the women's 57kg category.

The continental Olympic Qualifiers in Dakar (Africa), Amman (Asia), London, (Europe), Buenos Aires (Americana) and the final world qualifiers in Paris will grant more points to ensure that the winners of these events are guaranteed a seeding the Olympic Games.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/amit-panghal-is-world-no-1-in-ioc-s-boxing-task-force-rankings-for-olympic-qualifiers-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/amit-panghal-is-world-no-1-in-ioc-s-boxing-task-force-rankings-for-olympic-qualifiers.html
230,13-2-20,Dhoni is best captain India ever had: Raina,"Veteran India batsman Suresh Raina feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best captain India ever had.

Raina and Dhoni play for the same IPL franchise -- the Chennai Super Kings --, which is also led by the latter.

""I think we have the best captain who has changed the Indian team like anything. Now we have that same aura in our dressing room,"" Raina said on 'The Super Kings show' on Star Sports Tamil.

The 38-year-old Dhoni has retired from Test cricket but his future in the limited overs formats is a subject of intense speculation.

The two-time World Cup-winning former captain took a break from cricket after India's exit from the 2019 World Cup in England. He is set to be back in action at the IPL, where he will captain the CSK, starting March 23.

With three restricted stands at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai finally being reopened, Raina urged the fans to fill the venue in every CSK home game.

""We have all the seats available. Hopefully, we'll have more fans now so that there is it will be more energy on the field,"" the 33-year-old Raina, a former India batsman, said.

Raina, who last played for India in 2018, also expressed his excitement about the prospect of playing with CSK's latest acquisitions.

""This year we have a lot of new talent in our team. Piyush (Chawla) is there, then we have Hazelwood, Sam Curran, Sai Kishore from Tamil Nadu, he has been bowling really well for them. So, I think we have a lot of mixture of youngsters and seniors.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-is-best-captain-india-ever-had--raina-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-is-best-captain-india-ever-had--raina.html
231,13-2-20,Efficacy of Pak's decision to send Hafiz to jail remains to be seen: Govt sources,"The efficacy of Pakistan's decision to send Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed to jail remains to be seen as it came just days ahead of a global watchdog's review on Islamabad's action against terror networks operating from the country, official sources said on Thursday.

A Pakistani court on Wednesday sentenced Saeed, the mastermind of 2008 Mumbai terror attack, to 11 years' prison in two cases relating to terror financing.

The sentencing of Saeed came just four days ahead of a meeting of global anti-terror watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris to review Pakistan's compliance of an action plan prescribed by it to contain terror groups in the country.

Last year, the FATF asked Pakistan to fully implement its anti-terror action plan by February 2020 or face severe action. Pakistan was already kept under the ""grey list"" of countries by the FATF for failing to contain terror financing.

Indian government sources said it is part of a long-pending international obligation of Pakistan to put an end to support for terrorism and that efficacy of Saeed's sentencing remained to be seen.

""The decision has been made on the eve of FATF Plenary meeting, which has to be noted. Hence, the efficacy of this decision remains to be seen,"" an official source said elaborating on the government's assessment of the action.

The sources said it's also to be seen whether Pakistan would take action against all other terrorist entities and individuals operating from territories under its control.

India has been pressing Pakistan to take action against all those involved in cross-border terror attacks including the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks.

It has to be seen whether Pakistan brings perpetrators of cross border terrorist attacks, including in Mumbai and Pathankot to justice expeditiously, the sources said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/efficacy-of-pak-s-decision-to-send-hafiz-to-jail-remains-to-be-seen--govt-sources-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/efficacy-of-pak-s-decision-to-send-hafiz-to-jail-remains-to-be-seen--govt-sources.html
232,13-2-20,LPG price hike: Rahul reminds BJP of its own protest,"Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a swipe at the BJP over the LPG cylinders' price hike by attaching an old picture of Union Minister Smriti Irani.

""I agree with these members of the BJP as they protest the astronomical Rs 150 price hike in LPG cylinders,"" Rahul Gandhi tweeted with the hashtag Roll Back Hike.

He also attached a picture of Irani protesting along with the BJP workers with an LPG cylinder.

Rahul's tweet brings into focus the sharp political rivalry between him and Irani and is taken as a reminder that he has not forgotten the loss of his family bastion Amethi to the BJP leader. Irani had defeated the former Congress chief from Uttar Pradesh's Amethi by a margin of 55,000 votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

His remarks came a day after the prices of the LPG cylinders were hiked by a steep Rs 144.50 per cylinder on Wednesday taking the price to Rs 858.50 per cylinder.

This was one of the steepest increases in the LPG prices in over five years.

A non-subsidised 14.2 kg cylinder will now cost Rs 858.50 in New Delhi, Rs 896 in Kolkata, Rs 829.50 in Mumbai and Rs 881 in Chennai.

233,13-2-20,Govt renames two prominent institutes after Sushma Swaraj on eve of birth anniversary,"The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, a cultural centre reflecting India's connect with its diaspora, was Thursday renamed Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in honour of the late external affairs minister known for her empathy in reaching out to distressed Indians globally.

The Foreign Service Institute, a renowned institution where diplomats are trained, has also been renamed the Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

The government's decision to name the two institutions after Swaraj came a day before her 68th birth anniversary.

The illustrious leader who brought rare empathy and a human approach to India's diplomacy as external affairs minister in the previous Narendra Modi government died on August 6 last year following a massive cardiac arrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said the two institutions have been renamed in solemn tribute to the ""invaluable contribution"" of Swaraj to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service.

""The announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on February 14 in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former external affairs minister,"" it said.

As External Affairs minister, Swaraj brought a sense of assertiveness in India's diplomacy besides engaging the diaspora, a central focus of the country's foreign policy priorities.

Swaraj was one of the most followed foreign ministers on Twitter globally.

She was known for helping Indians stuck abroad as she was quick to respond to their calls for help on Twitter. Swaraj even became popular in Pakistan for her response to people wanting to get visas for medical treatment in India.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra located in the heart of the Capital was set up to recognise the contributions of the overseas Indian community to India's growth and development.

A museum in the Kendra depicts the history of migration of the overseas Indian community as well as their experiences and contributions.

Swaraj had many firsts to her credit -- the youngest cabinet minister in the Haryana government, the first woman chief minister of Delhi and the first woman spokesperson for a national political party in the country.

She was Information and Broadcasting minister in the 13-day Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1996 and got the Cabinet portfolio again after he led the BJP to power in 1998.

Long seen as a protege of veteran BJP leader L K Advani, she also was the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha between 2009-14.

234,13-2-20,"BJP leaders shouldn't have uttered 'goli maro', 'Indo-Pak match': Shah","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said statements like 'goli maro' and 'Indo-Pak match' should not have been made by BJP leaders while campaigning for the Delhi Assembly elections and that such remarks may have cost the party dearly.

He, however, said the BJP does not fight elections just for victory or defeat but believes in expanding its ideology through polls.

""Such statements should not have been made. Our party has distanced itself from such remarks,"" he told at a Times Now programme.

Shah was asked a question about a few BJP leaders raising slogans like 'goli maro' and talking about the 'Indo-Pak match' during the Delhi elections campaigning.

He admitted that the BJP may have suffered in the polls because of the statements made by some of its leaders.

""It is possible that our performance may have suffered because of this,"" he said.

Shah said his assessment on Delhi elections went wrong but asserted that the result of the polls was not a mandate on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

He said anyone who wants to discuss issues related to CAA with him can seek time from his office. ""(We) will give time within three days,"" he added.

Strongly defending the CAA, which provides for Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, the home minister said there is no such provision in the new law that will take away the citizenship of Muslims.

""We have never discriminated against anyone on the ground of religion. There is no provision in the CAA which says that citizenship of Muslims will be revoked. Don't just criticise CAA, but discuss it on the basis of merits. CAA is neither anti-Muslim nor anti-minority. I am ready to meet anyone, but discussions need to happen on merit. Unfortunately, nobody wants to come forward and discuss CAA,"" he said.

Shah also said that so far the government has not taken any decision on rolling out the NRC for the whole country and made it clear that those unwilling to show documents during the the National Population Register exercise were free to do so.

He, however, said the NRC was a promise of the BJP in its election manifesto.

Asked about the ongoing agitations against the CAA, Shah said everyone has a right to peaceful protest but violence is not justified.

""We tolerate non-violent protests, but vandalism can't be tolerated. Silent protest is a democratic right,"" he said.

On Jammu and Kashmir, Shah said everyone, including politicians, are free to visit the newly-created Union Territory whenever they want to and there is no restriction on anyone's movement.

Asked about the detention of three former chief ministers -- Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- he said it was a decision of the local administration to slap them with the Public Safety Act.

Omar Abdullah has approached the Supreme Court and let the judiciary take a decision on it, he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bjp-leaders-shouldn-t-have-uttered--goli-maro----indo-pak-match---shah-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/bjp-leaders-shouldn-t-have-uttered--goli-maro----indo-pak-match---shah.html

236,13-2-20,BJP plans welfare feats publicity,"Party introspects Delhi poll loss; ‘Har Kaam Desh Ke Naam’ drive mulled

After BJP’s debacle in Delhi elections, party president JP Nadda held a review meeting here with party general secretaries even as senior Minister Prakash Javadekar sent out a letter to all Union Ministers asking them to design a campaign to highlight the welfare work done by their respective Ministries.

Facing criticism of running a polarising and shrill campaign, the party has begun to review the gaps in its poll strategy that includes low priority given to local developmental issues.

Nadda has been elaborately briefed by the State leaders and other party representatives about the possible reasons for the debacle. The BJP Delhi unit may be restructured in a “large measure”, sources said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah who had spearheaded the electioneering in the Capital also held consultations with the party president.

Barring Kailash Vijayvargiya and Anil Jain, all other general secretaries attended the meet. The meet decided that the party should initiate an Assembly segment-wise scrutiny of its performance and analyse and review councilor/corporator and MP’s popularity with the voters. Two of the seven Lok Sabha constituencies could not win a single MLA for the BJP that included Pravesh Verma’s West Delhi.

Against the backdrop of a near wipeout in the Delhi poll, the Modi-Government renewed its attempt to create more visibility for its public works and schemes by circulating a letter to all the Central Ministers asking them to design a campaign to highlight the welfare work done by their respective Ministries.

The Information and Broadcasting Minister has shot off the letter asking all his ministerial colleagues to inform people about their Ministry’s “public welfare work” through television, newspapers, outdoor and digital mediums between February 15 and March 31.

The one-and-a-half-month-long campaign should be themed “Har Kaam Desh Ke Naam”, the letter stated. Javadekar urged the Ministers to issue immediate directives to officials in this connection.

Meanwhile, a day after its rout in the Delhi polls, BJP general secretary Ram Madhav cryptically said one of the things which people look in State elections is a “leader who can deliver”. He, however, said that in terms of popularity in national politics, no one is close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“We have moved into a new kind of politics, we should be careful as a party. We should not lose sight of the fact that you build leaders who are strong and have support,” Madhav said at the “Times Now Summit”.

“When it comes to national politics, there is nobody who can come anyway near to Modiji in terms of popularity and popular confidence... The same situation we are facing in State after State. In States, it also comes to who is the leader who can deliver. Probably people are thinking on these lines. Perhaps one of the messages from this (Delhi) election is that,” he said while responding to a question on the Delhi Assembly polls.

However, Madhav underlined that the BJP has strong State-level leaders who were Chief Ministers as well, like in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and said, “Each State is different. A leader is one ingredient that we need but that’s not everything that a party needs for success.”

US president Donald Trump will receive a “memorable” welcome during his two-day stay in India during which he will hold trade and diplomatic engagement in Delhi and take part in a roadshow in Ahmedabad and also inaugurate a newly-built cricket stadium there. A mega spectacle in Ahmedabad — Kem chho Trump — on the lines of “Howdy Modi” event held in the US last year, has been planned to greet Trump.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday expressed his “extreme delight” that the US President and his wife Melania Trump will be in India later this month and said they will be accorded a “memorable welcome”.

In a series of tweets, Modi said India and the US share a common commitment to democracy and pluralism. “Our nations are cooperating extensively on a wide range of issues. Robust friendship between our nations augurs well not only for our citizens but also for the entire world,” he said.

Trump and his wife will be visiting India on February 24 and 25, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in Washington on Tuesday.

Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama had travelled to India twice, in 2010 and 2015.

Modi said the visit is a very special one and will go a long way in further cementing the India-US friendship. “India will accord a memorable welcome to our esteemed guests,” the Prime Minister said.

During a phone call over the weekend, Trump and Modi agreed the trip would further strengthen the India-US strategic partnership and highlight the strong and enduring bonds between the American and Indian people, Grisham said.

Trump said that he is looking forward to his visit to India later this month where millions of people would welcome him. “He (Modi) is a great gentleman and I look forward to going to India. So, we’ll be going at the end of the month,” Trump told reporters in his Oval Office, a day after the White House announced dates of his anticipated India trip.

Trump, during his India visit, would participate in a grand roadshow in Ahmedabad and also tour the Sabarmati Ashram and inaugurate a newly-built cricket stadium here with Modi.

During his visit to Modi’s home State Gujarat on February 24, Trump, along with Modi, would participate in a grand roadshow, planned along a 10-km decked-up stretch from the Ahmedabad airport to the Sabarmati Ashram, said officials from Ahmedabad.

The US President would then visit the Sabarmati Ashram, which served as epicentre of the country’s freedom struggle during Mahatma Gandhi stay there. Trump and Modi would later inaugurate the newly- constructed Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in the city’s Motera area and address a gathering, likely to be attended by over one lakh people, the sources said. The mega event at the stadium will be similar to the “Howdy, Modi!” event held in the US last year, they said.

Modi and Trump shared the stage at the “Howdy Modi!” gala event in Houston in September last year and addressed a record crowd of 50,000 Indian-Americans. Citizens here have dubbed the upcoming visit of the US president at the Sardar Patel Stadium as “Kem Chho, Trump!” (Howdy Trump) event, said officials connected with the event. The stadium at Motera has a seating capacity of 1.10 lakh higher than the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia, an official earlier said.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has issued an order assigning duties to its officers for the roadshow preparations. The civic officials have been asked to arrange transportation and parking for those invited for the Motera stadium inauguration.

Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu were accorded a grand welcome in Ahmedabad during their visits between 2014 and 2018.

The three leaders had also visited the Sabarmati Ashram with Modi and paid respects to Mahatma Gandhi.

In view of the US President’s upcoming visit to Ahmedabad, the Gujarat Government on Tuesday rescheduled tabling of the State Budget in the Assembly to February 26.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/memorable-welcome-awaits-trump--modi-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/memorable-welcome-awaits-trump--modi.html

Kejriwal has taken oath as the Chief Minister twice before from Ramlila Maidan. The venue assumes significance as it was from this ground that Kejriwal, under the aegis of Anna Hazare, started anti-corruption agitation which got a nationwide response and also paved the way for him to form a political party.

Expressing gratitude to the people of the national Capital for keeping faith in the party intact, Sisodia said, “People has given us a historic mandate and rejected the politics of hatred. For the first time in India people voted for the work. People have shown that the citizens of Delhi are pro-development and pro-work,” he said, adding that people of Delhi has made the politics of love win and rejected the politics of hatred.

People of Delhi have given a befitting reply to those “tried to spread hatred” and proved that Kejriwal is their son and brother and they want to make him Chief Minister.

Providing good education, health infrastructure, making the city better living and ensuring safety of women is the true meaning of the patriotism today, he said, adding that the development model of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will pave the way for the nation to economic prosperity

“Kejriwal’s work is model of development and it has proved that true patriotism is all about ensuring quality education, providing basic amenities and work done for the welfare of people,” he said.

245,13-2-20,"Mamata not invited, TMC to boycott E-W Metro inauguration","The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal on Thursday decided to boycott the inauguration of the East-West Metro corridor, after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's name was found missing from the invitation card for the programme, party sources said.

The first phase of the East-West Metro corridor, connecting Sector V with Salt Lake Stadium in the city, is scheduled to be inaugurated later in the day by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal.

Senior TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, state fire services minister Sujit Bose and Bidhanagar Municipal Corporation Chairperson Krishna Chakraborty, who have been invited to the inauguration, have decided to give the event a miss, in protest against ""the insult meted out to Banerjee and the people of Bengal"".

""The East-West Metro corridor project was the brainchild of Mamata Banerjee during her tenure as the railway minister from 2009-2011. It was Banerjee who had sanctioned money (for the project) in Railway budget. Now, when the project is being inaugurated, she has not been invited. This is an insult to Banerjee and the people of Bengal,"" Dastidar told PTI.

Echoing similar sentiments, Bose said, ""Why should we attend the event when our chief minister has not been invited? The BJP should refrain from such petty politics.""

Railway officials, however, have declined to comment on the matter.

Defending the decision to not invite the CM, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said, the TMC is ""paying for its past sins"".

""During the Left rule, Mamata Banerjee, as the railway minister, had not invited the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, on several occasions. So they (TMC) should be the last to talk about courtesy,"" Ghosh said.

""In several administrative meetings in Bengal, BJP lawmakers have not been invited. Was that a sign of courtesy? The railways have invited local public representatives. Now it is up to them to decide whether they would attend the inauguration,"" he added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mamata-not-invited--tmc-to-boycott-e-w-metro-inauguration-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/mamata-not-invited--tmc-to-boycott-e-w-metro-inauguration.html
246,13-2-20,LPG cylinder dearer by Rs 144; Opp for rollback,"Cooking gas price has been hiked by a steep Rs 144.5 per non-subsidised LPG cylinder. This is the sixth such hike in the last six months and the biggest such increase in the last six years. The Opposition has slammed the hike and demanded immediate rollback.

The state-run oil companies have said that LPG price has been hiked due to spurt in benchmark global rates of the fuel. But to insulate domestic users, the Government almost doubled the subsidy it provides on the fuel to keep per cylinder outgo almost unchanged.

The Congress said the subsidised cylinder on May 16, 2014 was only Rs 414 and under Modi regime it is Rs 567, an increase of Rs 151 per cylinder, and if you use 12 cylinders, then this price also goes up by almost Rs 2,000 per annum.

The Congress hit out at the BJP over the LPG cylinder price hike, saying it has struck the pockets of the people with “current”. The party has demanded an immediate rollback of the hike, reasoning that the price of the international crude oil has fallen.

Hitting out at the Government over the hike, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Modi ji increased the price of LPG cylinder by Rs 144. Cooking gas price has been increased by Rs 200 in one year.”

The party in statement said the Modi Government has electrocuted the budget of the common man. “While talking about current, they have struck the pockets of the public with current,” he tweeted in an apparent reference to Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks during the Delhi polls campaign that “press the button so hard that protesters in Shaheen Bagh feel the current.”

“The Modi Government with one stroke of pen has increased the price of gas cylinder by Rs 144 taking the price of non-subsidised gas cylinder to Rs 858.50. I want to remind Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who came to power promising almost zero inflation that when the Congress demitted power on 16th May 2014 a non-subsidised gas cylinder price was only Rs 414. It is Rs 858.50 today,” Surjewala said.

While the TMC said the BJP is an anti-people party and its decisions and policies are a reflection of that, the CPI(M) said the BJP is trying to take revenge for the defeat in the Delhi Assembly polls. “Just because people did not vote in BJP’s favour, they are punishing them by increasing the LPG price,” said CPI(M) legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty.

Despite its series of defeats in several Assembly polls, they are yet to learn their lessons, TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lpg-cylinder-dearer-by-rs-144--opp-for-rollback-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/lpg-cylinder-dearer-by-rs-144--opp-for-rollback.html

248,13-2-20,China demotes top official in charge of Hong Kong,"China has demoted the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the State Council said Thursday, following months of pro-democracy protests in the semi-autonomous city.

The shuffling of officials at China's top policy body on the financial hub's affairs comes after months of political unrest -- the starkest challenge to Beijing since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong, currently secretary-general at the national committee of China's top political advisory body, was promoted to director while Zhang Xiaoming was re-appointed as a deputy in charge of daily operations at the office.

In Hong Kong, millions have taken to the streets since June last year, originally in opposition to a now-abandoned proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China.

The movement then morphed into demands for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.

In recent days, Hong Kong's leaders have faced criticism as well over shortages of masks and resources that emerged in their handling of a virus epidemic starting from the mainland.

Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, said 67-year-old Xia served as deputy to President Xi Jinping when was party secretary of Zhejiang province.

""I think Xi Jinping wanted to find someone he could trust,"" said Cabestan.

Cabestan said Xia, a former Zhejiang Communist Party chief, has since been known for a hardline approach in fighting the re-emergence of Christianity there.

The personnel changes are aimed at boosting coordination between Beijing and Hong Kong, he said, as well as giving more support to the pro-establishment camp in Hong Kong's Legislative Council.

""(Xi) wants fresh blood, people he can trust, who are going to bring Hong Kong closer to China,"" he said.

Indian-born Murad Alam was arrested for carrying Rs 45 lakh forex in food packets and was handed over to the Customs authorities. A video provided by the force showed the security personnel cracking peanuts, opening sealed biscuit packets and digging into oily meatballs to extract an assortment foreign currencies rolled and wrapped neatly inside.

252,13-2-20,'Haathi Mere Saathi' not an easy film to make: Rana Daggubati,"Actor Rana Daggubati says mounting his upcoming action spectacle ""Haathi Mere Saathi"" involved lots of challenges as they were focused on doing justice to the story.

Directed by Prabhu Solomon, the movie is about 'a man who fought for the jungle, the animals and against the society'. It will release across the country in three languages -- Hindi, Tamil and Telugu -- on April 2.

""It's not an easy film to get done. There were challenges. We were dealing with nature, dealing with three languages and the elephants. You have so many factors that are not going to be with you everyday but that's what it is about, completing a story.

""I went back two years while watching the making. I'm a different man today because I was able to do all these things,"" Rana told reporters.

The actor said for his character in ""Haathi Mere Saathi"", he had to shed to his weight by 30 kgs.

""After 'Baahubali', when Prabhu sir met me, I was looking like a bull. He said we have to try and figure something else out. We started understanding how will a person be if he's lived in the jungle for so long, what the nature of his food be and that's the physicality we brought along.""

Rana says the film is a reflection to the environmental crisis across the world.

""It's a mirror to the society. This happening in many parts of the country, the world. Everywhere there's an elephant corridor and urbanisation around. There are cities which grow and break the natural habitat.

""As filmamkers, artises, we have films to voice out certain things. To influence people in the most entertaining way possible...""

254,13-2-20,Pak sends Hafiz to 11-yr jail to ward off FATF terror tag,"Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attack and Jamat-ud-Dawa chief, was sentenced to 11 years in two terror financing cases on Wednesday, four days ahead of a crucial meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris where Pakistan will present its case to escape from being blacklisted. The crackdown on Saeed’s outfit last year followed a warning by the FATF to Pakistan to deliver on its commitments to curb terror financing and money laundering.

Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a $10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17 in the terror financing cases. The 70-year-old hardline cleric is lodged at the Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail. Anti-terrorism court Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta sentenced Saeed and his close aide Zafar Iqbal to five and a half years each and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 in each case. A total of 11 years sentence will run concurrently.

Saeed and Iqbal were sentenced in two cases registered against them in Lahore and Gujranwala cities on the application of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police. “Saeed and Iqbal will have to spend five and a half years in imprisonment,” a deputy prosecutor general said after the verdict.

Interestingly, the court on Tuesday accepted Saeed’s plea to club all six terror financing cases pending against him in the anti-terrorism court Lahore and announce the verdict on completion of the trial held amid tight security.

The FATF in October last decided to keep Pakistan on its ‘Grey List’ for its failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyeba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

Since Pakistan continues to be in the FATF “Grey List”, it would be very difficult for the cash-strapped country to get financial aid from the IMF, the World Bank, ADB and the European Union. The FATF is backed by the UN Security Council passed resolutions which made its recommendations binding and in case of deficiencies, sanctions could be imposed.

Earlier, the anti-terrorism court in Lahore had reserved the verdict in the two cases against Saeed for February 8 after the completion of the trial. “However as the court resumed hearing in four other terror financing cases against Saeed and others on Wednesday, Judge Bhutta announced the verdict in the two already completed cases handing down a total 11 years imprisonment to Saeed and Iqbal,” deputy prosecutor general Abdul Rauf Wattoo said.

Saeed will undergo imprisonment at the Kot Lakhpat jail where he has been detained since July last. The four other terror financing cases are against Saeed, Iqbal, Yahya Aziz, Abdul Rehman Makki. The anti-terrorism court or ATC had indicted Saeed and his close aides on December 11 in the terror financing cases.

On last Saturday, judge Bhutta deferred the verdict against Saeed in two terror financing cases till February 11. In the two cases, the prosecution produced some 20 witnesses in the court who testified against Saeed and his close aides for their involvement in terror financing. Saeed pleaded “not guilty” in both the cases.

The Counter Terrorism Department of Punjab province had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities in the province. The cases were registered against Saeed and others in Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan for collection of funds for terrorism financing through assets/properties made and held in the names of trusts/non profit organisations, including Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust, Muaz Bin Jabal Trust, etc.

According to the CTD, investigation launched into financing matters of proscribed organisations --- JuD and LeT --- in connection with implementation of UN Sanctions against these Designated Entities and Persons as directed by NSC (National Security Committee) in its meeting of January 1, 2019 chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan for implementing the National Action Plan.

“These suspects made assets from funds of terrorism financing. They held and used these assets to raise more funds for further terrorism financing. Hence, they committed multiple offences of terrorism financing and money laundering under Anti Terrorism Act 1997. They will be prosecuted in ATCs (Anti Terrorism Courts) for commission of these offences,” the CTD said.

Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pak-sends-hafiz-to-11-yr-jail-to-ward-off-fatf-terror-tag-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/pak-sends-hafiz-to-11-yr-jail-to-ward-off-fatf-terror-tag.html

256,13-2-20,"Ahead of Trump's India visit, US Senators seek assessment of human rights, religious freedom situations in India","Ahead of President Donald Trump's maiden visit to India, four influential US Senators, who described themselves as ""longtime friends of India"", have sought an assessment of the human rights situation in Kashmir and religious freedom in the country, saying hundreds of Kashmiris remain in ""preventive detention"".

The bipartisan group of Senators, in their letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dated February 12, said that India has now imposed the longest-ever internet shutdown by a democracy, disrupting access to medical care, business and education for seven million people.

The Indian government abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and imposed severe curbs including on movement of people as well as on mobile telephone and internet connectivity. The crackdown drew international criticism with several countries expressing concerns over the situation in Kashmir.

India has categorically told the international community that its move to scrap Article 370 was an internal matter. According to officials, internet is being restored in the Valley in a phased manner after reviewing the security situation.

The US lawmakers, describing themselves as ""longtime friends of India"", wrote in the letter that ""more than six months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government unilaterally revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, the government continues to block most internet in the region"".

""Hundreds of Kashmiris remain in 'preventive detention', including key political figures,"" they said.

Signatories to the letter are Chris Van Hollen, Todd Young, Richard J Durbin and Lindsey O Graham.

""In addition, the Indian government has taken other troubling steps that threaten the rights of certain religious minorities and the secular character of the state. This includes the passage of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act which is being challenged in India's Supreme Court,"" the Senators wrote.

In the letter, the Senators requested Pompeo for a State Department assessment of a number of issues in India including the number of individuals detained by the government for political purposes and their treatment; current restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir; current accessibility of Jammu and Kashmir; and restrictions on religious freedoms in Jammu and Kashmir.

The actions taken by the Indian government in Jammu and Kashmir, they said, have severe consequences. That is why, in the Fiscal Year 2020 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programmes appropriations report, the Congress urged India to fully restore telecommunications and internet services, lift its lockdown and curfew and release the individuals detained pursuant to the Indian government's revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution.

Trump will pay a state visit to India on February 24 and 25 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Wednesday said the US President's visit will be a ""very special one"" and it will go a long way in further cementing India-USA friendship.

India maintains that the Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities.

It is widely acknowledged that India is a vibrant democracy where the Constitution provides protection of religious freedom, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect fundamental rights, a senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs has said.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny any citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

Defending the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said that the law is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship.

""We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There's no problem in that,"" he said.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ahead-of-trump-s-india-visit--us-senators-seek-assessment-of-human-rights--religious-freedom-situations-in-india-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/ahead-of-trump-s-india-visit--us-senators-seek-assessment-of-human-rights--religious-freedom-situations-in-india.html
257,13-2-20,Women tend to drink more alcohol as they age,"Women aged 50-70 are more likely to consume alcohol than younger women, at levels that exceed low risk drinking guidelines, according to a new study.

The researchers found that despite the potential health risks of exceeding national drinking guidelines, many middle-aged and young-old women who consume alcohol at high risk levels tend to perceive their drinking as normal and acceptable, so long as they appear respectable and in control.

For the findings, published in the journal Sociology of Health & Illness, researchers at New Edith Cowan University (ECU) in Australia and Aalborg University in Denmark, investigated the social construction of alcohol use among 49 women aged 50 to 69 in Australia and Denmark.

""The research highlighted that respondents from both countries indicated that alcohol use among women their age was normal and acceptable,"" said study lead author Julie Dare from ECU.

According to Australian health authorities, drinking more than two standard drinks on any day increases the risk considerably of premature death over a woman's lifetime.

The researchers found that women place more importance on appearing to be in control, behaving respectably, social pleasure and feeling liberated than the quantity of alcohol consumed or potential health risks.

While some women reported reducing their drinking due to health concerns, others suggested that positive health behaviours such as exercise served to 'neutralise' alcohol-related health risks.

According to the study, health advice and interventions relating to middle-aged and young-old women's drinking practices need to acknowledge that women may socially construct their drinking practices to prioritise matters other than biomedical impacts of alcohol.

While the study highlighted many similarities between Australian and Danish women, one interesting cultural difference was the way Australian women thought about alcohol in relation to stress.

""If the Australian women had some sort of distress in their lives they believed it was acceptable to drink. They were quite open about this saying 'I just had a bad day, I needed to have a drink',"" Dare said.

The 29-year-old actor, who stars opposite Sara Ali Khan in the new take on the 2009 original, said playing the dual roles of Raghu and Veer was like undergoing a ""litmus test"".

""Getting an opportunity to work with Imtiaz Ali sir in itself is a big thing. When he chose me, it felt more like a validation for me. For the first time, I was living the character on and off screen. From little nuances to those big details, I enjoyed it all. It's like a litmus test for me, something I've never done before,"" Kartik said in an interview with PTI.

The director previously told PTI that Kartik fit well as he represents a perfect mix of a small town boy meets metro. The actor said when Imtiaz called him, he was just curious about his life and not his past work as an actor.

""I'm from Gwalior and I've seen that bit of life and lived it. I've seen a metro like Delhi or Mumbai where things are really different. He really held my hand through this journey. The best thing was he used to give you details, make you understand the characters but during the shoot he would let you be free and never dictate. This changed my sensibilities.""

The actor, who has a number of projects lined up after ""Love Aaj Kal"" releases this Friday, believes he is finally getting the opportunity to collaborate with directors that he always wanted to.

264,13-2-20,Both filmmaking and love are about self-discovery: Sara Ali Khan,"She is taking forward the story of a film that her father did 11 years ago, but for actor Sara Ali Khan the only thing ""circular"" about being a part of ""Love Aaj Kal"" is that both the films are looking for similar answers on love in different eras.

The 24-year-old actor features in director Imtiaz Ali's modern take on his 2009 original, which starred Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone.

Sara, who is cast opposite Kartik Aaryan's Veer in ""Love Aaj Kal"", said she has never been someone who carefully plans anything, including her career.

""I have never really planned journeys. I feel privileged that so early in my career I got to the chance to work with the people I really wanted to, whether it is Imtiaz sir or Kartik. I hope each experience I have with different filmmakers enriches me further and adds to my personal bounty of experiences.

""The only thing extremely circular about this is that filmmaking is a journey, love is a journey. In 'Love Aaj Kal', we had a journey about love and filmmaking, and I don't really know which was what. Both filmmaking and love are somewhere down the line a means to discover ourselves. I hope I never stop doing that,"" the actor told PTI in an interview.

Sara, who plays a modern working woman in Zoe, said her character carries ""burdens of the past"" but comes to an understanding about love through the story that is set in the past, which features Kartik as Raghu and Arushi Sharma as Leena.

""Love is not linear, it's affected by a lot of things. It's affected by what's inside you and outside. Zoe's constantly getting influenced by her mother, her career and also by Raghu's story because of Raghu's relationship with Leena, which I think is the soul of the film. It's about how love 'kal' affects love 'aaj' because all of us carry burdens of the past and memories,"" the actor said.

Sara said the film conveys that while the expression of love has changed over the years, its timelessness is something that will never lose its appeal.

""For Zoe, specifically, times have changed and the expression of love has changed. There's also an inherent message of the timelessness of love,"" she added.

The actor, who started her movie career with 2019 film ""Kedarnath"", said she wants to explore every aspect of being a performer.

""As an actor, I'm young and want to discover myself. I want to do diverse films, whether it is a larger-than-life commercial film with David (Dhawan) sir, or a true hard-hitting narrative with Imtiaz sir or a self-seeking project with Aanand (L Rai) sir. I just want to continue with all of that,"" she said.

Sara's comments about having a crush on Kartik, who is now her co-star, have acquired a life of their own with fans shipping them as ""Sartik"" but the actor said their collaboration was in no influenced by the buzz surrounding their personal life.

""Today, only real things are able to connect with people. Audiences have become too smart. Promoting an Imtiaz Ali romantic film based on what I said on a show would be doing a very bad job. I think there (about the pairing) is something that people are liking, enjoying and that's what it's about,"" she said.

267,13-2-20,"Warm-Up Game: Opening gambit, lone spinner on focus as India meet steady NZ XI","Clarity on opening combination, a call on whether Ravichandran Ashwin's variations can trump Ravindra Jadeja's all-round skill-sets will be the focus for India in their three-day warm-up game against New Zealand XI starting here on Friday.

After the harsh reality check of 0-3 drubbing in the just-concluded ODI series, a red-ball warm-up game will be the most welcome distraction for Virat Kohli and his men as a precursor to the two-match Test series starting next week.

India could not have asked for a better practice game as the opposition team is full of New Zealand senior and A team players, including leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, all-rounder Jimmy Neesham and wicketkeeper Tim Seifert, in its ranks.

The inclusion of first team white ball pacers Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner will be the kind of test which both Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill will relish as they make a case for their inclusion in the playing XI for the first Test starting in Wellington on February 21.

Shubman will be itching to show his skipper that he is ready for the big debut which is eagerly anticipated among his growing legion of fans, despite his international career being two-match old.

A flat track like the one at Seddon Park will also be a test for the two frontline spinners with Ashwin and Jadeja getting a chance to test the likes of Daryl Mitchell, Tom Bruce and Seifert in action.

A good show on a flat deck can improve Ashwin's chances of toppling Jadeja even though the proposition looks dim at the moment.

For the New Zealand XI, there is Dane Cleaver, who has had scores of 196 and 53 in the two A 'Tests' against India. He would like to impress the selectors and get into the first team for the Test series.

India's red-ball overseas warm-up games in the past few years have mostly been two-day affairs with the home team batting on one day and visitors on the other day.

Devoid of first-class status, the matches have been about giving everyone in the squad a chance to have a decent hit between 50 to 100 balls and bowlers getting into the groove with a spell or two.

The hosting Boards also often put up a rag-tag outfit which is a strategic move to deny visiting teams a chance to check out against quality batting or bowling line-up.

However, this warm-up game promises to be different as India are looking to get their combination right for the Test series which is also a part of World Test Championship.

The Teams (From):

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (vc), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Hanuma Vihari, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin, Rishabh Pant, Navdeep Saini, Shubman Gill.

NZ XI: Daryl Mitchell (captain), Finn Allen, Tom Bruce, Dane Cleaver, Henry Cooper, Scott Kuggeleijn, James Neesham, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi, Blair Tickner, Will Young. 13th men: Jake Gibson (Friday) and Scott Johnston (Saturday and Sunday).

268,13-2-20,There is no fight for spot with Prithvi: Shubman,"Promising India batsman Shubman Gill insists he is not competing with fellow young gun Prithvi Shaw for the opener's slot in the first Test against New Zealand but if he does get the opportunity, he will not ""let it go waste"".

With a double hundred and a century against New Zealand 'A' here, Gill has made everyone take notice despite Shaw being firmly back in the mix for the upcoming two-match series starting in Wellington from February 21.

""Obviously, our careers started at the same time but there is no fight as such,"" Gill said on Thursday when asked about his take on his competition with the former India U-19 captain.

Both Gill and Shaw are 20 and considered the stars of the future after a splendid runs in age-group cricket.

""Both of us have done well in our positions. It's up to the team management, who they will play. It's not as if there is a fight. Whoever gets the chance will try to make the most of the opportunity and not let it go waste,"" the 20-year-old said ahead of the warm-up game against New Zealand XI.

Having played in New Zealand for the last six weeks as part of the A team, Gill feels that if New Zealand's short-ball factor can be nullified, it would go a long way in helping the team.

""I think their bowling attack has been taking a lot of wickets with the short ball, especially Neil Wagner. If you see the last series they played against Australia, when nothing was happening in the wicket, they were really relying on the short ball.

""As batsmen, if we could take that out of the picture and not give wickets to the short ball, it will be really helpful for us,"" he observed.

Just like vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane had said in an interview with PTI, Gill also spoke about wind being a key factor in Wellington during the opening Test which starts February 21.

""Wind (Breeze) factor is very important, especially when you are batting. The bowlers do a lot of planning depending on the breeze. It was not that easy to consistently pull and hook the ball (in windy conditions during the A series).""

An opening batsman in a Test match is like a pace-setter whose performance sets the tone for the rest of the line-up, feels Gill, who follows this philosophy for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy.

""It was nothing new to me when I was asked to open the innings. When you go at No. 4, already, you are two wickets down. That's a different scenario, a different pressure game.

""When you are opening the innings, you have to set the game for the whole team. That's a different thing. And when you are opening the innings, you have to set the base for the other batsmen coming in so that it will be easy for them.""

In the middle order, Gill said it's about being cautious when the second new ball is taken.

""...Because you are playing at a certain flow and the ball isn't swinging that much. When they take the new ball, you have to be a little more cautious than you were before.""

While he has done well in New Zealand, Gill has found facing the red Dukes in England more challenging due to the excessive swing on offer.

""There is more swing in England, and there is also more movement off the wicket as compared to New Zealand. In New Zealand, the ball is also slightly different but I feel England is more challenging when you are batting to seamers.""

India will be playing the second Test in Christchurch at the Hagley Oval, a ground where he scored 83 and 204 not out in an A game.

""I think the wickets here are really good to bat on, especially when we played in Christchurch. The only challenge that we were facing was the bounce which was really good and consistent,"" he said.

The past one year has been a journey of realising his potential with good performances at the domestic and A levels and Gill listed what has worked for him.

""If you are improving on your fitness, you won't know but there will be improvement. Your reflexes improve and that helps. If you are fitter, you are confident that I can play a longer innings, I won't be that tired.""",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/there-is-no-fight-for-spot-with-prithvi--shubman-2020-02-13.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/there-is-no-fight-for-spot-with-prithvi--shubman.html
