0,15-3-20,When virus went viral,"Covid-19 is the new obsession in many parts of the world today, as the fear of getting infected by the coronavirus threatens humanity for one more time. This is how humanity responds to crises in times of globalisation. The spread of the news is much faster than the spread of the virus that spreads the disease. Taking the case of China and India together, that account for 40 percent of the humanity, the enormity of the pandemic or the number that may have died due to the virus may not be ascertained. At worst, it may be a few thousand out of 7.5 billion, if the estimation is valid. Chances are, they are not. And for India, it is still around 35 as per the reports. Further, we cannot be sure whether these deaths are due to the virus or other respiratory diseases for other reasons. But look at the way the world is shouting ‘Corona, Corona’. Newspaper headlines say much is not known about the virus. Yet, they also say that India is just not prepared for the pandemic. And we are closing schools, offices and other establishments. Official seminars and business meetings are being postponed, airlines are suspending flights, social get-togethers are being cancelled, and the whole country seems to be running helter-skelter. The irony is that the problems that actually bother are getting glossed over as the country seems to be obsessed with a threat that actually may not be there. But amidst all this, commerce seems to thrive. Masks that would normally cost `5 are being sold for `500. This tribe that makes hay all the time, whether the sun shines or not, almost always scores and finds corona or something like it to thrive. Maybe, corona like viruses can be engineered to suit certain situations. Spread of corona is not as big a problem as spread of the news of the corona virus spreading. The treasure of knowledge, the range of advisories, the pseudo-medical expert tips and the videos of do’s and don’ts on the social media seem to be a bigger threat as they may create more cases of paranoia than respiratory infections. There actually are people turning paranoid, washing their hands obsessively, and wearing the masks religiously. Interestingly, it is still not clear whether those masks can stop the spread of virus, or that safe distance of three feet can keep the micro-organism at bay. Something like showing the red rag to the bull although science says bulls are color blind. But that is how it is. People know the truth, yet are not willing to believe it. Our gullibility is more dangerous than corona virus that seems to be a threat in the present times. The gullibility may keep threatening us for all times in the name of something or the other. It was bird flu few years ago. Great country with great people who press the panic button at the slightest pretext. There was a time when the whole country made a beeline to offer milk to Lord Ganesh and watch him actually consume it. We need more investments in developing scientific temper than science per se because science cannot flourish where there is no scientific temper. The corona scare is temporary, but the mass hysteria threat is permanent. More so, in a country where people are wont to jump to conclusions without verifying the hypothesis. The hysterical temper is the first outcome of paranoid societies.

1,15-3-20,Af in Taliban’s hands! India must come to terms,"India would be in a difficult position when the Taliban come to power after the US forces leave Afghanistan. Hence, Delhi must work out a counter strategy to deal with a post-Ghani Afghanistan. It should chalk out a new plan to develop a working relationship with the Taliban leadership in order to prevent Pakistan’s proxies occupying the levers of power in Kabul

The US-Taliban peace deal hammered out in the last week of February in Doha had raised the hope of ending the internecine war in the war-torn Afghanistan. The Taliban leadership promised not to allow any Islamist terror organisations, particularly foreign terror groups such as the al-Qaeda and the ISIS, to operate from the country’s soil in return for the US forces withdrawal from the country.

However, considering the disagreement between the Taliban and the Afghanistan Government ever since the deal was inked, the historic peace agreement seems to be another false start for this war ravaged nation. What was witnessed in the beginning of the week is the swearing-in of two heads of States — Ashraf Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah in Kabul. Both of them have claimed themselves to be the rightful leader. Interestingly, Ghani’s oath-taking ceremony was attacked by rockets allegedly launched by the very ISIS. The turn of events have plunged the country into more confusion.

First, the two presidential inaugurations have left the commoners at their wits’ end.

Second, it has highlighted the fact that a bitter power struggle between the two Afghan leaders is coming up.

Third, the last week’s clashes between the US forces and the Taliban, accompanied by the ISIS attack on the condolence of a Hazara leader, portend that reclaiming peace in Afghanistan is not a cakewalk.

The differences between the Ghani Government and the Taliban have widened. As the Government was not included in the peace deal signed between the US and the Taliban, it clearly shows the upper hand of the rebels in any future arrangement of power in the country. At the same time, cornering the popularly elected Government implies that the Taliban have been accepted as the legitimate political agent of Afghanistan.

Though the Government has agreed to release 1,500 prisoners as a gesture of good faith, the Taliban want all its 5,000 man to be freed in one go. Moreover, the Taliban made this a condition for initiating the Afghan dialogue. In fact, the release of prisoners, including 1,000 Government employees (now in the captivity of the Taliban) is meant to be a confidence-building measure to initiate the intra-Afghan dialogue. Today the conflicting positions on the issue between the Ghani Government and the Taliban appear to come from different wordings in the documents exchanged between the US and the Taliban and between the US and the Kabul establishment on the other.

Around the same time, American special negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad has urged both sides to sit for talks at the earliest so as to iron out the differences and set the priorities for ensuring peace in Afghanistan.

The Taliban coming back to the mainstream is simply the reassertion of religious fundamentalism in Afghanistan. Let’s recollect what Taliban did during its tenure in office from 1996 to 2001 when it was toppled by the US-led war on terror following the 9/11. The Government of Mullah Omar was barely recognised by three nations i.e. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Islamist forces’ godfather Pakistan. Apart from banning women in public places, including the UN staffers, and demolishing the Bamiyan Buddha, the Taliban soon made Afghanistan a breeding ground of Islamic jehad. By providing safe haven for al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, Afghanistan invited the ire of the US after 9/11.

Thus the global war on terror under the leadership of the US started right at the heart of Afghanistan, aiming to eliminate its roots and branches. This ultimately led to the fall of the Islamic regime of Omar. However, during its five-year term, the Taliban Government demonstrated ability in providing basic security within their reach and control, enforcement of religious law. Further, their Government achieved an effective opium poppy ban between 2000-2001. By virtue of its structure and functioning style, the mullahs did not operate any modern centralised structure of administration. Thus their communication with the general populace was too limited beyond a certain point. The Taliban being Islamic radicals had not accorded top priority to such modern architecture of governance at all. In fact, some key areas like foreign relations were never a concern for them as they were in favour of managing an exclusive zone far away from the international community.

After being in full control of Kabul, they executed former Afghanistan President Najibullah, who had been staying at a UN compound in Kabul for four and a half years. Hundreds were killed in the fighting of the last few days and they established a radical Islamic rule over the country.

It seemed they did not have a clear vision about governance and to sustain a radical rule when the entire world was averse to recognising them. What guided them was pure religious fervour and an immediate strength to impose their might over the hapless people over a sizeable territory of Afghanistan. But then, lack of a central authority, state organisations, a methodology for command and control mechanisms which can reflect some level of popular participation made it impossible for many Afghans to accept the Taliban (Rashid, A, 2001). The Taliban didn’t carry out even the minimum of developmental work because they believe that Islam will take care of everyone. So it was quite natural that the Taliban failed to reach out to the common Afghans.

Much beyond what had largely shaped the Taliban world view in those days was a conglomeration of limiting elements such as limited access to mechanisms of governance and conflict management, education, media, foreign relations and finally zero tolerance to different religious faiths. These finally circumscribed all efforts of the Omar regime to continue in power and survive a mighty American invasion in 2001.

Since its ouster from power, the Taliban leadership has learnt enough tactics to stay relevant. From being anti-modern in its initial days, the Taliban have started not only recognising the ubiquitous role of information & communication technology but are also using the IT tools to the best of their benefits.

Many analysts say if the Taliban insurgency has evolved into a force to be reckoned with, it has gathered much of its inspiration from the sharp rise of the al-Qaeda and probably the sudden growth of the ISIS in the ruins of Iraq. And all these factors have decisively translated these localised insurgents into an inseparable part of the so-called global jehad against the Western powers and their perceived enemies across the globe.

If at all a Taliban regime resurrects in Kabul, what could really unfold in Afghanistan? Those days of the misogynistic rule of the Taliban would never come up again for now. Certainly Pakistan will play a significant role in reshaping the future of Afghanistan. But orchestrating a forceful transition from Ghani Government to Taliban by the Pakistani deep State would irretrievably damage the image of Pakistan. For now, Pakistan and the rest of the international actors, including the US, need to facilitate an intra-Afghan talk as soon as possible.

Why can’t main stakeholders and the Afghan leadership articulate a clear plan for the next iteration of peace talks? Only such attempts will release new life into the peace process. More than resolving the current crisis, China, Iran and Russia would be happier to see America leaving Afghanistan. Mediators in the past frequently mythologise the participation of women and civil society organisations in peace deals as truly problematic.

Many of the experts even say that negotiations are a precarious process and they are conducted in private places. Also it has been said that additional actors will complicate the entire process of peace making. Such actors may destabilise the truce with the Taliban.

Another school of thought argues that women and civil society could be well engaged only after a negotiation with the Taliban is reached. It implies that now the time has just come to involve them as Afghanistan is heading for the implementation of the truce with the Taliban.

However, significant developments are likely. The Taliban will be on the rise as they have developed both military skills and diplomatic manoeuvrability to deal with friends and adversaries.

India would be in a difficult position when the Taliban come to power in Kabul and the US forces leave that country. Hence, Delhi must work out a counter strategy to deal with a post-Ghani Afghanistan. Since no Northern Alliance exists as of today for which India offered its support in the past, now it should chalk out a new plan to develop a working relationship with the Taliban leadership. Else, its long-term plan for development assistance and continuous support towards the democratically elected regimes would all be lost once Pakistan’s proxies occupy the levers of power in Kabul.

Undoubtedly, Pakistan’s treating of Afghanistan as a buffer state and exploiting the jehadi elements for its own advantage would only accentuate acrimony and antagonism against it in the days to come. Thus Islamabad must reappraise its policies towards Afghanistan. It should invest more on the Afghan people than on selective groups, leaders and more particularly on the radical elements. Instead of making Afghanistan an alienated frontier and making more faultlines ready for the jehadis, its neighbours and other international actors should push for permanent peace, involving all ethnic constituencies, tribal leaders and most importantly, the popularly elected regime in Kabul.

Otherwise, without an iota of doubt, Afghanistan would be turn into a perfect storm of renewed insurgency. The Taliban are not simply to be viewed as a radical Islamist movement; it has been able to build around a charismatic mullah phenomenon for marshalling support from tribal kinship and rural masses. And for years, this extraordinary support, buttressed by Talib reinforcements from the border areas of Pakistan was more than enough to pound and counter the US-led coalition across Afghanistan.

Keeping all these critical elements in mind, Ghani and Abdullah should come together first and work out a quick rapprochement so as to thwart a resurgent Taliban and to facilitate a new road to peace. Else Afghanistan will permanently remain as a labyrinth of violence.

2,15-3-20,Corona a warning for new world order,"The coronavirus scare has hit India but patchily. The Central Government and many State Governments have acted with a sense of urgency, taking drastic precautionary measures that some consider excessive and others insufficient. The mixed reactions are inevitable since the WHO-declared pandemic is still to assume a virulent presence in the country. There are still a very large number of people who believe that the coronavirus is a phenomenon that will somehow bypass India. In Parliament, an Opposition MP stated on the floor of the House that rural India will not be affected because of its lifestyle and, in case, Ayurveda is there to take care of our illnesses. The other popular theory is that coronavirus thrives in a cold climate and that the approaching summer will protect India.

The MP who spoke about about India’s wholesome rural lifestyle may well have been prescient and prophetic. The fact is we don’t know. The Centre and many States don’t want to take chances and have operationalised a number of steps from immigration controls and crowd control to awareness programmes. They quite rightly believe that over-reaction is better than complacency. I believe they are right, despite the short-term adverse economic consequences of confronting a strange disease about which we know so very little.

Of course, in some States life goes on as usual. I am in Kolkata over the weekend and find that very little has changed, except the disappearance of hand sanitisers from retail outlets. Political life, for example, seems to be totally unaffected and no one has dared as yet to suggest that the forthcoming civic body elections, due in mid-April and late-April be postponed till things have returned to relative normalcy. Maybe the rescheduling of IPL cricket — always a big draw in Kolkata — will be the proverbial game changer.

There are many sociologists, political analysts and social scientists who are spending their waking hours agonising over a lost ‘idea of India’ and praising the bravery of the women of Shaheen Bagh. I would urge them to divert their minds to studying the impact of coronavirus or at least the coronavirus scare on popular psychology. Is the panic exclusively middle class and confined to those who spend time monitoring global news? Or, has it started triggering real fear in the minds of those who are otherwise too busy earning a livelihood? It would be instructive to know.

India, it is generally admitted, has reacted with a sense of urgency. This is despite the negativism of some Opposition parties who seem to lack discerning skills. The Congress, for example, seems to be determined to pin the responsibility for the pandemic on the Modi Government — an approach that is reminiscent of the negativism during the Kargil war. But this is unlikely to wash. I think in such situations people do look to Governments to set the tone and even if the message takes time to percolate downwards, it slowly does get there.

The anxious bewilderment in India is in sharp contrast to the panic that has overwhelmed Europe with reports that the number of those infected could touch a million and more. We have read of the grim situation in Italy and there are reports of panic buying and hoarding of essential supplies of food and medicine. In London, friends who are in the vulnerable demographic bracket are quite voluntarily refraining from social contact and over-stocking their larders with daily necessities that, naturally, includes toilet paper. If the scare recedes in a fortnight or so, people will look back at the precautionary steps with some amusement. However, if it persists, the impact on society could well be quite dire. I read in a British paper that the social fabric of Ancient Greece was demolished by an epidemic. We also have the examples of the Black Death and the influenza epidemic after World War 1. Will Europe lose its status as a global power if this epidemic is not contained soon? I mean European countries have ageing populations and aren’t demographically equipped to fight the coronavirus unless a medical cure can be quickly found.

As of now, the world is preoccupied with containing the spread of the virus to think of anything else. No one has seriously applied their minds to the enormous consequences of the pandemic. There are whispers of what is going to be the effect on China. Will it end Beijing’s hegemonic dreams? We have not heard a whisper from Russia. How will it impact that country which has never given up hopes of staging a dramatic return to the global high table. And what will be the effects on globalisation, as countries and communities retreat into their shells as a form of self-preservation?

The next few weeks will witness a radical departure from our set routines. Everyone will have more time for home and their families as outdoor diversions come to be restricted. Maybe this is as good a time as any to reflect on the state of modern civilisation and contemplate alternative approaches. The coronavirus may be a virus but it is also a warning.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/corona-a-warning-for-new-world-order-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/corona-a-warning-for-new-world-order.html

6,15-3-20,Akhilesh asks SP cadre to gear up for UP polls,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has asked party cadre to brace themselves for the 2022 UP assembly elections, cautioning them that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could stoop to any level and employ all possible tricks to win the polls.

Addressing members of the SP national executive in Lucknow on Saturday, Akhilesh said the historic victory of Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi elections in February this rear was a whiff of fresh air that strengthened the belief that elections could be won on development work and people-friendly measures.

“However, development will not be a central issue in UP assembly elections and the BJP will play the politics of bigotry to divide people on the lines of caste and religion. So we have to prepare ourselves accordingly,” he said.

“We have to be ready for a long haul. We can sustain ourselves in politics and become a strong claimant for power in 2022 only with struggle and agitation. Samajwadis have sustained themselves in politics only on the fight against injustice and tyranny of state power,”’ the SP chief said.

Akhilesh also sought to play the caste card, saying, “If the SP is voted to power in 2022, the state government will conduct caste-based census in UP. There is a huge imbalance in reservation for different castes and communities. The caste-based census will ensure fixed quota for each caste as per their demographic share.”

The political resolution adopted by the Samajwadi Party executive criticised the present caste-based system and said that 85 per cent population comprising Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes was getting only 50 per cent reservation while 15 per cent upper castes were getting 50 per cent which was far more than their due share.

Reiterating his opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (ACC), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), Akhilesh said that none from the party would fill the NPR form.

He said that NPR and NRC were highly discriminatory against poor and marginalised sections and the government must roll back the CAA.

The SP chief also criticised the ordinance promulgated by Governor on Friday providing for recovery of damages to public and private property from the protesters.

“The UP government has brought the ordinance to defend itself as it had no reply to questions raised by Supreme Court as to under which law it had put up hoardings carrying photos and addresses of anti-CAA protesters,” the SP chief said.

Akhilesh also attacked the Yogi Adityanath government for the detention of party MP Mohammad Azam Khan and Dr Kafeel Khan, saying that both were being victimised by the BJP government for political reasons.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-asks-sp-cadre-to-gear-up-for-up-polls.html
7,15-3-20,SP to stage state-wide protests every month,"Aiming to limber up for the 2022 UP assembly polls, the Samajwadi Party has decided to stage state-wide protests and demonstrations on the 22nd of each month till the elections.

This was decided in the day-long meeting of SP national executive held in Lucknow on Saturday. SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav was conspicuous by his absence in the meeting as he was said to be busy in Delhi.

The 2022 UP assembly elections occupied the top slot of the SP national executive’s agenda and the party decided to go it alone when the state went to the hustings.

The SP will, however, take along small political outfits like Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal and a few others.

In the 2017 UP assembly polls, the SP had aligned with Congress and it had joined hands with arch rival Bahujan Samaj Party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But both these experiments ended in disaster for the party.

In the post-meeting media briefing, SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said that the party would launch a mass contact programme with a Cycle Yatra across the state on the birth anniversary of party ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia on March 23.

“From April 22, the party will stage demonstrations at all district headquarters with focus on 22 issues concerning welfare and grievances of the people on the 22nd of every month. Party cadre will focus on these issues to oppose the Yogi government in UP,” he said.

Chaudhary said that all members of SP national executive were present in the meeting that was chaired by party presided Akhilesh Yadav.

He further said that all senior SP leaders, including Ram Gopal Yadav, former MP Kiranmoy Nanda, leader of opposition in UP Assembly and Legislative Council were also present in the meeting.

Chaudhary said that besides detailed deliberations on the 2022 assembly elections, the national executive also adopted a resolution on the prevailing economic and political situation in the country.

The SP spokesman said the political and economic resolution focused on the present economic mess and atmosphere of communal hatred and bigotry across the country.

“The Samajwadi Party will offer to replace the politics of hatred and bitterness with love and harmony and restore an atmosphere and environment of communal harmony and brotherhood,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-to-stage-state-wide-protests-every-month.html
8,15-3-20,"Groom abducted, killed","Close on the heels of the sensational killing of a groom during a marriage procession in Kushninagar a fortnight back, another groom was abducted and later murdered in Muzaffarnagar.

The victim’s brother was also abducted but was later released by the miscreants.

The police registered a case and were making efforts to nab the killers. They suspect that an affair of the bride with someone else could be behind the killing.

As per reports, Abdul Wahab (22) of Hussainabad Bhanwada hamlet of Ratanpuri in Muzaffarnagar was to get married with a girl in Kalchhina village in Bhojpur area of Ghaziabad on March 15.

However, two days before the wedding, four unidentified masked men barged into Wahab’s house in Muzaffarnagar and took him and his brother with them at gunpoint on Thursday afternoon.

Threatening the family members with dire consequences if they tried to stop them, the abductors bundled the groom and his brother in a four-wheeler and sped off.

The family later informed the police about the abduction after which the cops launched a search.

On Friday morning, Wahab’s brother was found lying in a nearby jungle. He told the police that the abductors wanted to kill Wahab but since they were unsure about his identity, they also took him with them. He said after identifying Wahab, the abductors dumped him in the jungle and sped off with Wahab.

On Saturday morning, the bullet-riddled body of Wahab was found in the same jungle.

After preliminary probe, the police suspect that the bride probably had an affair with another boy and when her marriage was fixed, the girl with the help of her lover orchestrated Wahab’s elimination.

A police team was sent to Ghaziabad to collect further details and arrest the suspects.

Meanwhile in Fatehpur, the uncle of a groom was electrocuted by a high tension wire that fell on him after a gunshot was fired during a marriage function on Friday evening.

Additional Superintendent of Police Rajesh Kumar said, “Groom’s friends were firing in the air to celebrate at the house of his father Udaibhan Singh Chauhan in Bhadba village of Malava police station when a high tension wire snapped and fell on Udaibhan’s younger brother Vinod Singh Chauhan (60) causing instant death.”

Five persons, who rushed to rescue Vinod, also sustained burn injuries.

A case was registered against Udaibhan and other unidentified persons and his licensed gun was seized.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/groom-abducted--killed.html
9,15-3-20,Congress joins poster war,"The hoarding/poster war between the Bharatiya Janata Party and its rivals escalated on Saturday as after Samajwadi Party, now the Congress put up posters of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and other ruling party leaders with respective “criminal histories”.

A day earlier, a SP leader had put up hoardings cautioning parents against rape accused BJP leaders Swami Chinmayanand and Kuldeep Singh Sengar who has been expelled from the party.

The Congress posters were pasted at the gates of BJP state office in Lucknow and next to hoardings with pictures of anti-CAA protesters put up by Lucknow district administration and police in Hazratganj for their role in violence in Lucknow on December 19, 2019.

The posters maintained that recovery for damage to public property should start with the chief minister as he was also an accused in Gorakhpur riots.

The Congress posters also highlighted five cases against Yogi Adityanath which include sections 147, 148, 295, 153 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code.

The posters were reportedly put up by Sudhanshu Bajpai and Laalu Kannaujia, who claimed to be Congress workers.

Subsequently, an FIR was lodged against Sudhanshu Bajpai, Laalu Kannaujia, unidentified printing press owner and others under Section 505 (1) (b) of IPC and Public Property Act at the Hazratganj police station.

Speaking to reporters in Lucknow on Saturday, UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said, “The posters were put up by party workers and there is absolutely nothing wrong in them. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is a member of the Legislative Council but it seems that he thinks himself to be a judge. Yogi himself is an accused in riots, so he should put up his posters first and compensate losses to government and public property.”

“Charity begins at home. Hence, recovery should start with Yogi and BJP leader Radha Mohan Das Agarwal, who were accused in Gorakhpur riots. I have said it before that those accused in riots should be treated in similar manner. BJP leaders like Sangeet Som, Suresh Rana, Sadhvi Prachi, Umesh Malik and Sanjeev Balyan were also accused in Muzaffarnagar riots. What is more, as per his affidavit submitted before Lok Sabha polls, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya is also an accused in 11 cases, including those of riots,” Lallu said.

Reacting to the Congress posters, BJP leader and UP minister Suresh Rana, whose picture also figures in the posters, said, “It seems that Congress is rattled by the action taken by the state government against rioters. They ask for proof of Balakot airstrike and visit the house of rioters. The Congress cannot digest the fact that law and order is improving in Uttar Pradesh and hence it has resorted to such politics.”

On Thursday, the Supreme Court told the Yogi government that its decision to put up hoardings identifying anti-CAA protesters had no backing of law but stopped short of passing any interim order and slated the mater for hearing next week by a three-judge bench.

The apex court is hearing an appeal filed by the UP government challenging the March 9 order of Allahabad High Court directing the state to remove posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests.

On Monday, the High Court had ordered Lucknow’s district magistrate and police commissioner to remove the ‘name-and-shame’ hoardings immediately and submit a report by March 16, the next date of hearing.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-joins-poster-war.html
10,15-3-20,"Teenager raped, killed in Amroha","A 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered in Amroha, while a woman was gang-raped and done to death in Maharajganj during the past 24 hours.

The bodies of the victims were recovered on Saturday morning and the police were trying to identify the killers. Separate cases were registered and the bodies were sent for autopsy.

In Amroha, Class XI student Sunita (name changed) of Hassanpur had gone with her younger sister to collect fodder for cattle on Friday afternoon.

Later, Sunita’s sister returned home, asking her to bring the fodder home. But when she did not return after considerable time, the family members launched a search but failed to trace the girl.

On Saturday morning, the girl’s naked body was found lying in a nearby cane field with blood stains on her private parts.

Circumstantial evidence suggested that she had been raped and then eliminated by the rapists.

The police suspect that the perpetrators of the crime were acquainted with the victim and hence they killed her, fearing being identified and arrested.

In Maharajganj, the body of an unknown woman was found lying between Deoria canal road and Siswa road in Jaishree hamlet of Nichlaul on Saturday morning.

The victim, in her late 20’s, was gang-raped, killed and later her body was dumped at the above spot.

The police were trying to ascertain the identity of the victim so that the perpetrators of the crime could be tracked down.

Meanwhile, in yet another case of crime against members of the fairer sex, a 17-year-old girl was raped by two men in Mahoba on Thursday.

The case was however reported at Mataundh police station of Banda by the girl’s family only on Friday night.

During preliminary probe, it surfaced that two youths raped the 17-year-old girl on the pretext of taking her to a nearby jungle around 5 pm on Thursday in Khanna police station area of Mahoba.

The accused later absconded.

The case was later handed over to Mahoba police for investigation as the scene of crime is in that district.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/teenager-raped--killed-in-amroha.html
11,15-3-20,"Rains, hailstorms to hit Rabi production","Unseasonal rains accompanied by hailstorm have put a big question mark on the government’s target of record production in the current Rabi season.

In most districts of Uttar Pradesh, unseasonal rains have damaged wheat, pea and chickpea (chana) crops but the government has claimed that crop damage has been restricted to only 14 districts.

As per preliminary estimates of the Agriculture department, the minimum damage could be 15 per cent and it could go up to 50 per cent and even higher in some districts.

For the current Rabi season, the production target was set at 640 lakh metric tons, which seems to be a far cry now.

Besides food grains, the rains have also damaged standing oilseeds, pulses and vegetable crops.

A senior official of the Agriculture department said, “A survey is on and the loss of to Rabi crop will be a minimum of 20 per cent as per preliminary estimates.”

As per the Revenue department, 14 districts suffered the maximum damage till March 13. The districts include Fatehpur, Azamgarh, Shahjahanpur, Budaun, Bahraich, Gonda, Barabanki, Sultanpur, Amethi, Jhansi, Etawah, Lakhimpur Kheri, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra.

The damage to Rabi crop in these 14 districts is as high as 33 per cent while no damage to crops has been reported from the rest 61 districts.

Meanwhile, the state government has set an ambitious wheat procurement target of 55 lakh MT for the coming 2020-21 Rabi marketing season.

The UP cabinet on Friday approved Rabi Procurement Policy under minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,925 per quintal set by the Union government.

Last year, the state had failed to achieve its target and could log only about 38 lakh MT of wheat as compared to the target of 55 lakh MT. The sluggish procurement in 2019-20 Rabi season was attributed to Lok Sabha elections apart from competitive prices in open market, which provided a viable option to farmers to sell their produce.

Following the poor response last year, the state government has extended wheat procurement window by an additional 10 days to June 25, 2019, to partly achieve its target and keep wheat prices firm in the market for the benefit of farmers.

Of the target of 55 lakh MT for wheat, Food Corporation of India would directly procure 1.5 lakh MT while the remaining would be purchased by various state government agencies, which would set up 5,000 procurement centres across UP.

The bulk of 25 lakh MT and 5 lakh MT would be procured by UP Cooperative Federation Limited and UP Cooperative Union respectively.

Procurement for Rabi crops would kick off from April 1 and continue for the next 75 days till June 15, 2020.

The process would not stop even if the seasonal target is achieved before the deadline.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rains--hailstorms-to-hit-rabi-production.html
12,15-3-20,"Sidhu launches YouTube channel, Jittega Punjab","He is a master communicator but remained incommunicado for nearly nine months. But finally, Congress MLA and former Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday announced the launch of his YouTube channel, describing it as a platform to take Punjab towards revival and renaissance.

Sidhu, who fell out with Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and had to resign from the Cabinet, launched the channel — Jittega Punjab (Punjab will win) — after he met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Delhi and apprised them of a roadmap for the revival of the Congress-ruled State to its pristine glory.

The announcement assumes significance as the Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government is completing its three-year tenure and is going to highlight its achievements on March 16.

“Sidhu is today launching his own channel on Youtube to air and share his views with the people of Punjab in a simple/understandable form,” a statement from his office said along with a link to the channel.

“The channel invites all like-minded people for discussions, interviews and an exchange of views. It is a platform to propel Punjab towards revival and renaissance,” said the statement.

“After nine months of contemplation and self-renewal the former minister, four-term Member of Parliament and MLA Amritsar East will be vocal on the burning issues of Punjab and strive to carve out a concrete road-map for the resurrection of Punjab as a welfare State,” the statement added.

The channel is inspired by the path of universal brotherhood, tolerance, love and peace shown by Baba Nanak (Guru Nanak Dev, founder of Sikhism), it said.

Asking people to share their views and “be a part of the resurrection,” Sidhu said, “the whole world is my country, all mankind my brethren, to do good my religion — inspired Sidhuism.”

“The icons of the channel (are) Maharaja Ranjit Singh & Shaheed-E-Azam Bhagat Singh (who) are the epitomes of our glorious past, good governance, courage, sacrifice and role-models for our future generations,” the statement said adding, the channel’’s logo is inspired by Punjab’’s state bird ‘’Goshawk’’.

In a four-minute long video-clip shared with the media, Sidhu said in the last nine months he has realised that power bestowed upon leaders by the voters of Punjab should not remain confined to just four or five people. “The power of people must return to the people,” he asserted.

Seeking to strike an emotional chord with the masses, Sidhu said facts won’’t be twisted and only truth will prevail on his channel.

The launch of the channel comes amid reports that several Congress MLAs are “unhappy” with the State bureaucracy for allegedly neglecting them while a few legislators are demanding concrete action against transport and sand mafia in the State.

There was also speculation that the Aam Aadmi Party was trying to woo Sidhu ahead of 2022 Punjab Assembly elections. AAP MP and State unit chief Bhagwant Mann had even said that he would be the first one to welcome Sidhu into the party fold.

The Congress legislator had been away from the limelight ever since his resignation from the State Cabinet after Chief Minister Amarinder Singh changed his portfolio in June last year. The 56-year-old Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with the CM, was blamed for his “inept handling” of the local government department for the “poor performance” of the Congress in the urban areas during the Lok Sabha polls last year.

Sidhu had also faced flak for hugging the Pakistan Army chief during his visit to the neighbouring country in 2018 and Capt Amarinder had disapproved of the act.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sidhu-launches-youtube-channel--jittega-punjab.html
13,15-3-20,Officials’ hostage by farmers exposes botched paddy procurement: BJP,"Bharatiya Janata Party Kisan Morcha reacted strongly to incident of taking a Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) and procurement centre committee manager hostage by farmers for non-procurement of paddy from them even after issuing tokens.

The Morcha said the incident exposed the real face of the Congress-led government in the state.

The farmers of Sambalpur paddy procurement centre in Bemetara district kept the officials as hostage.

BJP’s Kisan Morcha state president Poonam Chandrakar said the incident revealed the real situation prevailing on the ground. The state government had promised to procure the paddy from all the farmers who had been issued tokens, but still the paddy is not being procured from them.

He alleged that in the current kharif procurement season the state government has failed to fulfil the smooth paddy procurement. The state government itself had announced for procurement of paddy from farmers holding token, but situation prevailing across the state is totally different.

The BJP leader further said that it is most unfortunate that farmers are being forced to resort to agitation to meet their demands or even take the officials as hostages for quick action. BJP will back all such agitations which will be in favour of farmers, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/officials----hostage-by-farmers-exposes-botched-paddy-procurement--bjp.html

PCC state general secretary and chairman communication wing Shailesh Nitin Trivedi in a statement said instead of slashing down the price of petroleum products due to decrease in price of crude oil in international market the Union government had increased the excise duty. This was like ‘sprinkling salt’ to the wound and was worth condemnable, he said.

Rather than extending the benefits of reduction of crude oil price to 30 dollars per barrel, the Union government surprisingly increased the excise duty, the Congress leader said.

He said it is most ‘shameful’ act of the Congress MLA where all the legal system which has been laid down for protection of women in such cases have been bypassed and made ineffective.

Usendi seeking reply from the state government as to why no hearing was given to the victim girl in police station when they had approached to file the complaint, as the accused was relative of the MLA. He urged the state government to take matter seriously and take stern legal action. He added that this will bring shame to the state.

He asked Chief Minister as how an MLA has been allowed to take law into his hands and how his wife has been given any such rights. It is quite surprising that even after victim had approached the police station, police did not hear the case nor was the FIR registered.

BJP state president said the state government should take action against the MLA’s relative and wife by registering a case. The accused should be arrested immediately.

The project, which was approved under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) in 1997 at a cost of Rs 217 crore, still remains uncompleted and its cost has escalated to Rs 2,400 crore thanks to the Government’s apathy, opposition by local people and irregularities and corruption in its implementation.

48,15-3-20,‘Rasik Sampadak’ performed at 35th National Theatre Fest,"Munshi Premchand's story Rasik Sampadak, marked the third day of 35th National Theatre Festival. The play was staged at Ravindra Bhavan, here on Saturday.

Directed by Veena Sharma, the play Rasik Sampadak is a satirical comedy, which depicts the mentality of the people who focus on the outer beauty of a person rather than their inner beauty or qualities.

Even in the 21st century, after being independent and self-sufficient, women are judged on the basis of their appearance. Therefore, this play in addition to being a satirical comedy also gives the message of not judging women on the basis of their looks.

The play was beautifully performed by the artists of Rang Visharad Theatre Club.

The play is beautifully designed through comic situations about the male mindset towards women, as they are seen as objects of beauty rather than intellect.

In the play, a poet gets attracted to women and he tries to get involved with every woman, who comes to learn his masterly aptitude towards poem writings.

The writer gets obsessed with every woman. He thinks that getting close to any woman would take him and his career to heights, only to discover that he was doing nothing, but damaging his own image and talent.

The play concludes on the note that it is not the bodily beauty of the woman that makes her beautiful but, her attitude toward any creative art, but her inner self that brings the artist out of her.

The play was beautifully performed giving away a message that women should never be objectified. The performance of the artists enthralled the audience.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---rasik-sampadak----performed--at-35th-national-theatre-fest.html

Anant Mandi has organized 17 farmers' markets in the past one year. With this, the milestone is being celebrated as a 2-day event, named Anant Mahotsav on 14 and 15 March.

On the first day of Anant Mahotsav, there were many engaging activities that happened throughout the day. In the farmers' market, organic farmers from various districts came with a wide variety of products like vegetables, grains, pulses, dairy products, oils, soaps, and personal care products.

Huge number of people from across the city came to buy healthy and organic products and also interacted with the farmers.

The food corner - “Sabki Rasoi” got an amazing response from the crowd where a creative assortment of homemade foods using organic ingredients was brought to them.

Apart from this, following workshops were conducted on diverse themes, like - “Food Affects Mood” facilitated by Rajna Pardasani, an “Upcycling” workshop facilitated by Alpna Jha, book discussion session for children facilitated by Eklavya and “Natural Soap Making” session with Somya Jain and Vaibhav Dewal. These workshops were enthusiastically attended by a huge number of people; inquisitive and excited to know more about sustainability and healthy lifestyle.

In addition to this, a panel discussion was organised on the significance of organic farming and how one can to switch and practice organic farming. The youth team at Anant Mandi has also organised an art space in which a painting exhibition was organised on the theme ""Ecological Diversity"". Adla-Badli - a swap sale - to encourage the habit of exchanging items rather than buying new things in the community was another eye-catcher of the event.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/anant-mahotsav-witnesses-huge-footfall-at-gandhi-bhavan.html

51,15-3-20,‘Assembly adjourned undemocratically’,"Leader of Opposition Pradipta Kumar Naik (BJP) on Saturday alleged that the State Assembly was adjourned undemocratically on Friday on a plea of coronavirus at the behest of the BJD Government in order to divert people’s attention from the issue of deposit of Rs 545 crore belonging to the Jagannath Temple, Puri in the crisis-ridden private Yes Bank.

“The Government had promised to withdraw Lord Jagannath’s money from the Yes Bank on March 19, 2020. Unsure of withdrawing the money, the Government closed the Assembly undemocratically to escape from facing troubles in the House,” said Naik at a Press meet here.

He said the BJP would not sit silent until action is taken against those responsible for depositing the Lord’s money in a private bank in violation of laws.

Opposition Chief Whip Mohan Majhi said adjournment of House in the name of Novel Coronavirus has proved that State Government has turned an escapist. “What is the link between spreading of Covid-19 and functioning of the Assembly,” wanted to know Majhi.

Deputy Leader of Opposition Bishnu Charan Sethi said the corona fear has not gripped people rather it has grasped the BJD. “The Finance Minister should come out with a whitepaper detailing about fund deposits of various Government departments in private banks. The OMC and the Idco have deposited Rs 650 crore and Rs 2,000 crore in private banks, respectively.

The health department has a total of 112 ventilators in different government hospitals which are much less than required even in normal situations.

The shortage of doctors and the equipment becomes more acute when one looks at the district wise availability of doctors. Mountainous districts like Pauri, Tehri, Bageshwar, Uttarkashi and Chamoli are more affected by the shortage of Doctors.

Pauri which is the home district of chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat who also holds the health portfolio is one of the worst sufferers due to the shortage of doctors. Incidentally this district which is also home of chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath, former Chief Minister Major General (Retd) Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri and union cabinet minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” has 343 sanctioned posts of doctors out of which only 167 are filled. Similarly more than 70 percent of posts of specialist doctors are vacant here. Uttarkashi district which is the biggest district of the state in terms of area has only one physician and has not even a single ventilator.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shortage-of-doctors-to-hit-anti-covid-19-preparations-.html

The girls shower flowers and rice on the doorsteps and sing:

Phool Dei, Chamma Dei

Deno Dwar, Bhur Bhakar

Vo Dei Sei Namashkar, Puje Dwar

During this festival, people of villages sing, dance and make merry to celebrate the harvest and to pray for the well being of their relatives. It is one of those times when everyone exchanges wishes of prosperity. Folk singers sing Chaiti and are given rice and other gifts as appreciation.

The innocence and goodness of the children and the newly blossomed flowers give a hue of tremendous positivity to all rituals associated with Phool Dei.

It celebrates the rich biodiversity of Uttarakhand and brings in awareness regarding the environment among children .

Phool Dei showcases the inner bonding between the communities who all are residing in the hills. During the festivity, the young girls pluck the first flowers of the season.

86,15-3-20,Fabric Of Flowers,"Over the centuries, rich tradition of using floral designs in textiles has evolved in various forms all over the country, writes Alka Pande, as she explores perceptions and interpretation of flowers in her book, Flower Shower: The Culture of Flowers in India. An edited excerpt:

In bright attire of flowers forged new, Heavenly of colour, white, red, brown and blue.

—William Dunbar

Flowers have been an inspiration for textile patterns since ancient times in India. The floral motifs on the costume of the red male torso from the Indus Valley civilisation show a visible refined version of the jasmine. Numerous Ajanta murals depict people wearing delicate garments with lotus patterns. Over the centuries, a rich tradition of using floral designs in textiles has evolved in various forms all over the country. Among different styles are the kalamkari and ikat traditions of Andhra Pradesh, the Paithani weaves of the Deccan, the embroidered shawls of Kashmir, the patolas of Gujarat, phulkari of Punjab, the Kantha and Jamdani of Bengal and Chamba rumals (handkerchiefs) of present-day Himachal Pradesh, as well as pictorial shawls that have worked images of birds, animals, flowers, plants, landscapes and other natural wonders that can be found across the length and breadth of the subcontinent. Every piece varies in terms of the hues employed, the patterns, the embroidery and its intricacy. The wealth of designs that form the motifs can vary from the symmetrical to the abstract to depictions of the rich flora and fauna of the subcontinent.

Each of the 29 states has its own tradition of weaving, embroidery or block printing and each state has distinctive floral motifs which defines its unique sensibility.

THE ESSENTIAL MOTIF

Images of flowers and flowering plants form a leitmotif that have run through the textiles of India, whether made by a village woman for her family, by a court artisan, or by a professional weaver for the export trade. Although some of the most common flower motifs (buta) and the paisley on Kashmir shawls can also be so stylised that they may appear to be simply abstract forms, their roots are firmly embedded in a love of gardens and flowering plants that dates back at least to the court cultures of the early years of the Safavid Dynasty in Iran (1501-1732) and the Mughal Dynasty in India (1526-1857). They take on many avatars such as embroidered shawls made by artisans for themselves to the buta in twill tapestry that were carefully crafted and then sent abroad to enter the realm of the European elite.

Nora Fisher notes that in Gujarat, village women, as well as professional embroiderers from the Mochi community would take the aid of drawings when they were creating their designs at the turn of the nineteenth century.

It is therefore interesting to note that the buta that border many shawls came about after various concepts and ideas about floral designs were synthesised from medieval Iranian images, pre-Islamic nature imagery and botanical drawings from France and the Netherlands. The final outcome was so beautiful that it dotted the cultural landscape of the Mughal world and was favoured by peasants and nobles alike.

Asawali and Amarvell, western India: The Satavahana Dynasty in 200 BCE made the city of Paithan its capital, alongside the holy Godavari river. The Paithani style is named for this city, renowned as it was for an over two-millennia-old textile tradition that hinged on carefully weaving multi-coloured threads together with gold and silver into a single, magnificent piece. It was but natural that the Satvahana rulers would then go on to give the Paithani style great impetus, being responsible for its spread across the Deccan. So favoured did it become that the style endured under the rule of other kings, the Mughals stamping their mark on it with the addition of floral patterns and the amarvell (flowering vine) motif. It even charmed the cold-hearted Mughal monarch, Aurangzeb, under whom it evolved.

Elegant additions such as asawali (flower pot with a plant) motif, the peacock, geometrical figures and flowering vines were made to the Paithani style as it continued to mature. For example, under the watchful eye of the nature-loving Emperor Jahangir, Paithani grew to acquire many additions in the form of designs that mimicked flowers and other natural wonders. With the rise of the Peshwas and the waning influence of the Mughals, the former became great patrons of the Paithani, the asawali or flowering vine being one of their prime contributions in terms of design.

From the land of the Chinar, northern India: Shawls woven in the Kashmir Valley are replete with floral motifs and naturalistic designs incorporating animals, birds and trees. Kashmiri embroidery is known as ‘kashida’ a vibrant and lovely reflection of the natural beauty of its homeland featuring creepers, leaves of the chinar, mangoes and floral motifs. The Kashmiri shawls popularised the ‘paisley’ design, which — over the years — became the defining motif of the Kashmiri pashminas. The four particularly popular shawls from Kashmir, the pashmina, the kanikar, the dorukha and the jamavar have floral motifs intrinsic to their design.

WEAVES — SILKS AND BROCADES

The Banarasi is one of the important brocades of India. The Banarasi ‘naksha,’ a Persian device which was similar to the jacquard loom enabled the weavers to weave the undulating floral patterns in intricate brocades and kinkhwabs (heavy silk fabric). From realistic roses, to stylised lilies and paisleys, the repertoire of the flowers was expansive, inclusive of the local flowers grown in the region.

FLORAL MAGNIFICENCE ON THE FLOORS

Carpets, rugs and namdahs, panja daris: There are numerous references to woven floor coverings in ancient and medieval Indian literature. Some Buddhist texts mention the presence of woollen carpets from as far back as 500 BCE. Pre-modern India saw the presence of woven bamboo mats and dhurries. For example they are mentioned in the Mrcchakatika of Sudraka. Mats are an age-old cottage industry, references to which are found in the Atharva Veda which mentions mats made of grass or kapisu and madur kathi mats made from madur kathi reeds. These were made for priests and Brahmans to sit on, as well as to cover the floors in wealthy households. Woven mats were also found in the Indus Valley Civilisation. All hand-woven, some of them had abstract floral patterns on them.

However, the most luxurious examples are found in the hand-knotted carpets which were introduced to India when the Mughal Emperor Babur made it his home. Babur sorely longed for the luxurious trappings of Persia and it was his grandson Akbar who laid the foundations for the carpet weaving industry at his palace in Agra in 1580. The Mughals not only followed the Persian technique of carpet weaving but were also deeply inspired by the traditional designs and motifs from Persia. The Persian carpets generally had a battle scene in the foreground with exquisite, fine worked borders of vines and flowers. In the Mughal courts, the Persian carpets were recreated with Indian forms and the patterns of these newly birthed Indian carpets varied from patterns featuring creepers and flowers originally with multiple shades of blues and greens on a red and peach base.

Another traditional floor covering of India is the dhurrie. Dhurries can be made of cotton wool, silk or jute and the material depends in the state on which they are made. In Punjab and Rajasthan the dhurries are known as Panja dhurries. Khairabad and Sitapur in Central India are some other centres for dhurrie making. These intricately woven floor coverings often feature geometric patterns which are inspired by the natural vegetation of flowers and vines.

From the states of Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Gujarat (Kutch) and parts of Rajasthan come some felted wool carpets known as namdahs. This is an Urdu word, brought to India by the Mongols and Mughals. Chain stitch embroidery is used to create beautiful floral motifs, particularly trees and flowers, translated by the artistic imagination of the artisan.

One quality that is important to develop spiritually is to be loving and kind to all. This is often symbolised by one physical gesture that each of us can learn to make. We can bring joy into our environment just by smiling. A smile on our face can brighten the lives of all we meet.

When we face life’s challenges, it is hard to smile. When we have problems at work and the boss is making difficult demands on us it may be hard to smile. When we think we have done our best work, yet we are criticised for our mistakes, we tend to frown. When we find others getting a promotion or raise, but we are at the same job with the same pay, our face shows our unhappiness.

It is sometimes difficult for parents to smile when their baby is waking them up in the middle of the night. It is hard for parents to smile when they are taking care of the child’s every need at the expense of their own. Whether it is changing a diaper, feeding the child at all hours of the day or night, or dealing with a child’s temper tantrums when they want something you know is not good for them, it is hard to keep smiling. But if we can learn to smile in the face of the challenges of parenting, we will be providing a model for that child to also grow up and smile in the face of life’s difficulties. This will bring one more smiling person into the world.

Laughter and smile has a role in improving our health too. Studies on the value of smiling show that they release hormones such as endorphins that have the power to make us feel happy. When the body is flooded with these chemicals produced by our own body, they not only raise our spirits but fortify our immune system. Thus, when we smile, our immune system is stronger, and we are better able to resist diseases when in good health.

Some may have experienced that when they are in a good mood, feeling happy, they may be around people who have a cold or flu but do not seem to succumb to those illnesses. But when we are sad, run down, or depressed, we may find that our immune system is not strong enough. Thus, in the same circumstances, when around others who are ill, we seem to also get sick. Similarly, if we are already ill but remain positive and happy with a smile on our face, researchers report that we can cut down the time of our illness and heal faster.

Another thing the doctors encourage to speed up healing is meditation. Studies have been conducted to show that relaxation and meditation can speed up the healing process. How? They can put us in a state of calm, in which the body is producing hormones that make us feel good. This aids the healing process.

Smiling is a wonderful way to dispel a tense situation. It helps relieve the pressures of life and puts us in a relaxed state of mind. Going jolly and laughing has a component to our mental health. Those same happy hormones can keep us feeling mentally good. This can help turn around the feeling of being in the doldrums.

Life hands each of us problems. No one is immune from difficulties. We may think we alone are filled with worries but listen to the tale of every person and each suffers as much as we do in his or her own way. It is said that if everyone puts their problems into a pile in the middle of the earth and were asked to pick a set of problems from that pile, after examining the problems of others, each would pick his or her own set of problems again. We would realise that others’ circumstances are not really better than our own, and sometimes they may even be worse.

Problems are a part of life. It is up to us whether we choose to be depressed about them and go about being sad, or we choose to smile. Our problem may not go away immediately, but we can face them boldly. When we have a problem, being sad creates a secondary problem, because our mental state is agitated and our immune system weakens.

One of the quickest ways to put a smile on our lips is through meditation. When we meditate, we are tapping into a source of all happiness and bliss. Those who experience God refer to God as all consciousness, all truth, and all bliss. Our soul is a drop of that ocean. When we meditate, we are connecting with our soul, our true essence, which is bliss. In meditation, when we focus at the seat of the soul, a doorway opens that leads us into the realms beyond. Carried on a stream of Light and Sound, the same essence as God, we swim along this river of bliss which leads to the eternal infinite ocean of bliss. Immersed in this ecstasy, we are far removed from the pains and sorrows of life. Our soul is filled with happiness so much so that we become one big eternal smile. When we emerge from our meditation, we carry that happiness with us the rest of the day. Thus, no matter who we meet or what situation we are in, we are shored up by the bliss from within. This helps us deal with life’s problems in a state of internal happiness. We may still have to deal with outer problems, but we are not affected within.

Picture an astronaut leaving the safety of a space capsule to fix it or do an experiment in space. His spacesuit is equipped to keep the temperature at the right level and to protect him from any particles floating in space. He can maneuver difficult work outside because he is in a safety bubble. Similarly, when we meditate, we are immersed in a safety bubble of happiness and peace. This protects us from the dangers and problems we encounter in life. When we experience the inner joy, we naturally can go about our day experiencing happiness. Thus, it is easy to keep a broad smile on our lips.

So let us ‘go jolly’ and turn our long face into a smiling face as we go about our life. We will find we are not only happier ourselves but that it has a ripple effect. We add happiness to our environment. The people around us in turn radiate happiness, which returns to us. Over time, this smiling atmosphere spreads. Little by little, smiles will emanate from us to our households. From our households, it spreads to our neighborhoods and communities. Then each community, spreading happiness, can radiate to the whole world. Let us bring forward the happiness we experience in meditation to our outer lives and make sure we wear a smile wherever we go and gift a smile to whoever we meet.

92,15-3-20,"Stocking, black marketing sanitizers, masks may land you in jail","Stocking protective masks and hand sanitizers in a bid to sell them later for a higher price might land shopkeepers and suppliers in jail, Ranchi Sub-Divisional Officer Lokesh Mishra said on Saturday, adding that the clampdown on shopkeepers and whole sellers was initiated in the wake of the COVID 19 hysteria.

“There is provision of imprisonment of up to seven years if any person is found stocking up hand sanitizers and protective masks with the intent to sell the products at a higher price in black market,” Mishra said, adding that no such cases were found in Ranchi as of now, but the administration will not spare any person found guilty of such practices.

The District Administration’s decision came close on the heels of the Centre’s inclusion of hand sanitizers and masks under Essential Commodities Act 1955, thereby, giving State governments control over production, quality management and distribution of the two products.

The State Governments can carry out operations against order speculators and those involved in black marketing and overpricing, an official of the Consumer Affairs Ministry told a leading English news website on Saturday afternoon. Offenders may be punished with an imprisonment of seven years or fine or both, he added.

The demand for hand sanitizers and surgical masks skyrocketed since Coronavirus entered India through Kerala earlier this year. In Ranchi, N95 masks disappeared from medicine stores and even hospitals. Shopkeepers said that there was no supply of masks in Jharkhand. Since the demand for N95 masks was high in Delhi, the manufacturers could not supply masks to Ranchi, they added.

Meanwhile, the Government asked all State-run hospitals to stock sufficient masks and other products used for protection against Coronavirus. Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) has arranged for 450 pieces of N95 masks and all State-run hospitals have set up special isolation wards for patients infected by the virus. Doctors say that three-layered surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in protection against the virus. N95 masks, they say, are only meant for use by medical practitioners and caregivers.

While the virus has claimed over 5000 lives across the globe, primarily in Italy and China, it has affected more than 80 people in India and caused two deaths. No cases of Coronavirus have been reported in Jharkhand so far. However, nearly 100 people here are under observation after returning from countries affected by the virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Coronavirus a global pandemic.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stocking--black-marketing-sanitizers--masks-may-land-you-in-jail.html
93,15-3-20,Lalu ‘avoids’ meeting people due to coronavirus,"Amidst the fear of Coronavirus, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) President and former Bihar Chief Minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav is said to be refraining himself from meeting people as the Medical Board of Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), suggested him to meet people consciously due to his bad health and old age.

Lalu Prasad is convicted in the fodder scam cases. He is undergoing treatment at RIMS in the State Capital. Saturday is the day according to the Jail Manual to meet with Prasad but on this Saturday there were very few people came to meet him. On this day a maximum of three people can meet him. However, he can be met on other days also under certain circumstances.

Talking to media, Dr Umesh Prasad, who is supervising treatment of Lalu Prasad said that as Prasad is facing some severe diseases and his immunity system has decreased so after outbreak of Coronavirus he should meet with people consciously. “People came here to meet Prasad from various places. Some came from foreign countries also. So that the board has suggested Prasad to meet people by maintain some distance,” he added.

The board consisted of departments of medicine, surgery, bone, eye, radiology, cardiology, urology, neurology and psychiatry. After seeing the medical report of Prasad, who was suffering from 12 serious diseases, the board said that help will be sought from the expert nephrologists in respect of serious kidney disease of RJD Supremo. After checking the treatment and protocol, the board said that they are providing proper treatment.

Prasad is currently serving a sentence in the RC-68A / 96 case and admitted to RIMS. In the four cases in which he has been convicted, the CBI case numbers are RC-20, 38, 64 and 68 A / 96. In these cases, he has been sentenced from three and a half years to a maximum of 14 years.

The biggest case related to animal husbandry scam is scandal number RC-47A / 96.

94,15-3-20,Cong sinking ship; workers lost faith in Rahul: Hussain,"Terming the Congress party as sinking ship, BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain today said that the Congress party itself is responsible for its plight. Addressing media persons here on Saturday Hussain said that people sailing on the sinking ship are now jumping off to save their lives as they have understood that neither the country nor they will be benefitted in the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

He said that the youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia has returned home in Madhya Pradesh. “He used to live in the hearts of party leaders and now he has joined the party. The BJP is a party formed by his grandmother, who alongwith Scindia’s father Madhavrao Scindia had entered the parliament for the first time on Jan Sangh’s ticket. Now Jyotiraditya Scindia will also go to the Rajya Sabha for the first time as a BJP member,” he said.

Speaking on the political scenario of Madhya Pradesh, he said that the Congress is going to lose MP. Soon the BJP government will be form there. There is a stampede in the Congress in other states as well. Jharkhand is also not untouched by this.

Speaking on the CAA, Hussain said that it is a law for granting citizenship, not for taking citizenship. Indian Muslims need not fear. They belong here and will remain so, but there is no place for Bangladeshi infiltrators. Muslims also have to leave Mecca Medina at the end of the visa period. If religion is one, then why are Muslim countries fighting among themselves? He said that religion is a private matter, one should not associate it with nationality.

He said that for the Muslims of India, there is no better country than India, no better friend than Hindu and better leader than Narendra Modi. He said that by enacting the Citizenship Act, the Modi government has realized the dreams of the fathers of Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhimrao Ambedkar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, National President JP Nadda through their statements have clarified the policies of the government and the party inside and outside the House. Now even the propaganda opponents have agreed with the government’s decisions.

He also urged the sisters sitting in Ranchi on protest not to be misled by anyone, and end the sit in.

Hussain said the BJP government is working on the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas. Not anti-CAA, NPR is the normal procedure before the census, whereas there is no discussion of NRC at any stage.

Wishing BJP’s Rajya Sabha candidate and Deepak Prakash victory, he said that Prakash is a dedicated worker of the party and his old friend. He will represent Jharkhand in the Upper House by getting more votes than required. Media in-charge Shivpujan Pathak and Minority Cell president Sona Khan were also present in Saturday’s Press conference.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cong-sinking-ship--workers-lost-faith-in-rahul--hussain.html
95,15-3-20,Maintain a realistic perception,"Someone in his mid-sixties, came seeking answers to his pointed questions: “Sir, as on date, professionally, I am doing well but yet, I don’t feel settled. Right from my college days, I had a trying time, as it has been subject to unseemly twists and turns every now and then. Why? Would I ever have a smooth go in life? A lot of astrologers predicted a hassle-free life from a particular age or the other. Those never came true. When questioned about their failed predictions, they found escape in inaccuracy of my time of birth. In the process, they tried to correct my birth time afresh, again and again. How long will such trial and error method go on? Of late, I have begun losing faith in astrology. Having heard about you, I have come with lot of hope to show me the way forward to future.”

Responding to his queries, I made it clear that it is unfair on the part of the astrologers to justify their failure in inaccuracy of the birth time. In astrology, there are proven methods for correction of birth time. The said astrologers should have done it before reading your chart. Second, they seem to have ignored the fundamentals of astrology. Remember, it is a well stated guideline of Indian astrology to factor in three dimensions of life — Kala, Patra, and Samaya — while analysing a chart. Kala refers to the overall environmental condition, which is ever changing and remains beyond anybody’s control. Patra relates to personality frame up of a being. That defines how intelligently one would take on challenges posed by environmental factors, and how efficiently one may pursue the tasks in hand. Samaya speaks of the probable timeline pertaining to fruition of destiny indications, which is dependent on the other two factors. The said astrologers did not pay attention to your personality traits, is how they could not guide you properly.

That makes it incumbent upon you to first know your own self — indwelling potential with all inherent virtues and attributes; as well as vulnerabilities, which covers all the habit tendencies and attitudes, prejudices and passions, likes and dislikes. From the nature of your questions itself, it becomes evident that you carry a strong sense of insecurity, which in turn, has brought in identity crisis. Why? For the answer, let us look at the astrological pointers to your personality-traits. You were born when Cancer was rising, which is a movable and water sign, known for its fluidity. This by itself speaks of being too much emotionally sensitive and vulnerable to mood swings as would lord of the sign Moon change its colour every day. Now, with its crab like character as the sign symbol stands, you also remain vulnerable to get too much attached to your perceptions, feelings, ideas and all that you like, which may often put you in peril. It is just like a crab, which may prefer to lose its claw than to forego its hold. Moon occupies Virgo sign, which apart from bringing in a vacillating tendency, makes you judgmental and a perfectionist by nature, of course by your self-defined measure. If things do not happen your way, you may become overcritical of others, where after may not hesitate in denigrating them with your acerbic remarks. Evidently, therefore, people often get put off with you, and with obvious consequences.

The Sun marked with one’s identity, is placed adverse to Jupiter and Neptune, which in the first place, speaks of your swaggering ego, distanced from ground reality. That binds you to self-defined dos and don’ts, and not open to look beyond for a reality check. That makes it difficult for you to digest contrarian views. Second, you are vulnerable to remain stuck to your delusionary dream perceptions. Third, habitually you are an escapist, who may seek a change if things don’t work your way. This tendency gets further amplified because of Saturn’s aspect on Ketu. Intelligence signifying Mercury placed adverse to both Jupiter and Neptune, account for your insensible reasoning and judgment. Jupiter placed adverse to Neptune makes you susceptible to carry peculiar beliefs, which often puts you in a wrong spot before others.

To sum up, you wish to live on your own exclusive terms, and that too in such a complex world, where every individual is born unique, all manifesting varying traits. So, life won’t move to anybody’s asking. Better address your inherent tendencies, sharpen your intelligence and come to terms with the realities, to smartly negotiate the callings of life.

96,15-3-20,Taking curry on to a bigger platform,"Shalini Saksena speaks with global curry queen Sarah Ali Choudhary, a multi-award winner and Indian food expert from UK, about what brought her to India and how the food from the country is a journey for her which has a story to tell

A UK resident of Indian origin, she is a TV chef and her recipes and articles have been featured globally in the Forbes, The Sun, The Telegraph and Independent. Forbes even titled her — The Curry Queen— and listed her in the top 100 women entrepreneurs in UK. She has received multiple awards, the most recent being for Entrepreneur of the Year by Dorset Food and Drink Awards. Meet Sarah Ali Choudhary who was in India recently on behalf of WonderChef to promote the brand in the UK.

There is a reason why and how she got the title — Curry Queen. “I was given this by Forbes. In England, it is a male-dominated food industry. To be given this title is amazing and is overwhelming at times. It is good because it helped me laugh by podcast where I use this title to build my brand,” Choudhary says.

She tells you that Indian food in England is very popular, the best selling food, so much so that it has become a part of British menu. “One can even go to a pub now, and order chicken tikka masala. Indian food has gone all out. It has increased the economy by millions. In terms of how it changed, the cuisine has been designed for the western palate in England. The food flavour has been designed in a way so that they can eat the otherwise very spicy food like we have in India. With so many new ideas, there are people who are trying to bring back the authentic recipes,” Choudhary explains.

What they are doing, she says, is giving a twist to the rather rustic looking plating of the Indian food by serving smaller portions, much like the French. “It is part of the whole change that they are bringing in, but I think that we should stick to be traditional way rather than copy the French Michelin style of serving,” Choudhary says.

She tells you each one of us have a perception of what normal is like when she comes to India, her favourite food is Chinese, something that she doesn’t eat even when she is in China. “In England, the food that one finds in the menu has been adjusted to suit them. It is only recently that people have started to eat spicy food,” she says.

She agreed to be associated with WonderChef because she is also has a Swiss company who send her their products as she does a lot of cookery demonstration, it is always good to have this kind of association with the cookware brand as it is mutually beneficial for the parties involved.

What she found strange when she landed in India was how people here no longer wear the sari, something that she does all the time. “I find that people only wear it for formal occasions or for weddings. I wear a sari all the time, even when I am in England. India has gone far ahead in the way they work, their strength and how the industries work. I think in that sense England is backward. I just feel that Indians don’t lose their tradition in their quest to move forward. It would be sad to not see women wearing a sari when one lands here. The good part is that food has not changed. It is so vibrant and colourful,” Choudhary says.

Interestingly, Choudhary never wanted to be in this industry. She was happy to be the face of her parents catering business. “Dealing with people was my strength. But being in the industry has pitfalls. When you go to a restaurant, you know what to expect and would be stressed out and I didn’t want to be part of all that. So I don’t have a restaurant but I am still associated with Indian food. I just want to take the journey of Indian food to another level. I don’t want people to come, eat quickly and leave. I would like to make Indian food a bigger story,” Choudhary says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/taking-curry-on-to-a-bigger-platform-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/taking-curry-on-to-a-bigger-platform.html
97,15-3-20,"Govt hikes excise duty on petrol, diesel by Rs 3","The Modi Government on Saturday hiked the excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre each to generate an additional revenue of about Rs 39,000 crore.

Though retail prices of petrol and diesel will not be impacted as state-owned oil firms adjusted them against the recent fall in oil prices, the Government has once again, just as in 2014-15, not passed on the gains arising from a slump in international oil prices. The Congress hit out at the Government saying the Modi-Shah Government has looted the people by raising the excise duties and tax and demanded that the hike be withdrawn and the benefits be passed to the common man. It also said it will strongly raise the issue both inside and outside

Parliament. Last Sunday, Saudi Arabia announced it would boost production and cut crude oil prices which caused oil prices to fall some 32% to about $28 a barrel, levels not seen since the bottom of the last crash in February 2016. According to sources in the Government, the Centre has taken this step of increasing duty to raise revenue in view of a tight fiscal-deficit situation. This may help the Centre in generating the resources for development of infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, they

said. According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre in case of petrol and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel. Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10. With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi Government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.Officials said the increase in excise duty will result in annual increase of Government revenues by about Rs 39,000 crore. The gains during the remaining three weeks of the current fiscal would be less than Rs 2,000 crore.

Petrol and diesel prices, which are changed on a daily basis, were cut by 13 paise and 16 paise respectively as oil companies adjusted the excise duty hike against the drop in prices that warrants from international rates slumping the most since the Gulf war.

The Govt had between November 2014 and Jan 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

Critics of the Govt have estimated that after the drastic cut in prices oil prices in India should have drastically declined which they have not with Petrol still costing Rs 69.87 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel at Rs 62.58.

Congress' senior spokesperson Ajay Maken said the government should reduce the rates of petrol, diesel, and LPG by at least 35-40 per cent. ""In Dollar terms, the international crude oil prices are down to the level of June-July 2004, when the petrol, diesel and LPG were available at Rs 35.71, Rs 22.74 and Rs 281.60 per cylinder respectively, which were quite cheap in comparison to the present rates,"" Maken said.

Maken said the total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83. The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre, he said.

""The Modi-Shah Govt has looted the people by increasing excise duties and huge taxes on petroleum products and did not bring this under GST despite the consistent demand of Congress,"" he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-hikes-excise-duty-on-petrol--diesel-by-rs-3-l.html
98,15-3-20,"Hike instead of drop in global crude oil prices, says AAP","Demanding reduction in petrol and diesel prices, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha said that by increasing the prices despite record drop in global crude oil prices, the BJP Government is working against the interest of people of India.

""We demand the BJP Government to reduce petrol price to Rs 39 per liter and diesel to Rs 31 per liter, as there is a 55 percent decrease in crude oil price in global market,"" said Chadha

Taking a jibe on the BJP run Union Government, Chadha said that in India , driving a bike is expensive than flying an aeroplane.

Notably, excise duty on diesel has increased from Rs 3.56 per liter to Rs 18.80 per liter and on petrol from Rs 9.40 per liter to Rs 22.90 per liter.

Citing the escalations in oil pricing, the AAP leaders said ""In the past few years the BJP-led Central Government has increased the excise rate nearly 12 times, therefore, the price of petrol and diesel has increased exponentially,""

""Today we are at a time when in our economy, the price of aviation fuel is cheaper than that of the per litre price of petrol and diesel.

Today, in Delhi, the price of petrol is Rs 69.87/lit, price of diesel is Rs 62.50/lit and the price of aviation fuel is Rs 56/lit. So today it is cheaper to fly an aeroplane than driving a car,"" he said, Today, in India the unemployment rate has touched a record low, the economy of India is witnessing an unprecedented slowdown and at this point of time, the Modi Government has also increased the fuel prices and inflation rate.""

Adding furthermore, he said that In India, the crude oil price is dependent on the price of crude oil in the global market.

""Today, in the global market the price of crude oil has become the lowest in the last 15 years but under the Modi Government in India, the crude oil price has only increased,"" he added.

""This Modi Government has not given us the benefit of decreased oil price of the global market. Today we are buying the crude oil in India in the rate of global crude oil price as of November 2004.

Under the BJP regime, the Central Government has increased the excise rate nearly 12 times in the last 6 years and this way they have earned an amount of Rs 16 lakh crore,"" said Raghav.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/hike-instead-of-drop-in-global-crude-oil-prices--says-aap.html

102,15-3-20,Farooq Abdullah meets son Omar after 7 months,"National Conference Chief and sitting Parliamentarian from Srinagar, Dr Farooq Abdullah on Saturday spent some quality time with his son and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah at Hari Niwas sub-jail in Srinagar after a gap of more than seven months.

Dr Abdullah had sought formal permission from the local authorities to meet his son lodged in Hari Niwas sub-jail.

After receiving the nod, Dr Abdullah, accompanied by his wife and daughter,drove straight to Hari Niwas to meet Omar.

According to official sources, the meeting between the two lasted around one hour. Images of Omar, stepping out of the guest house in the company of his parents, went viral on various social media platforms. Omar,sporting a long beard, was seen escorting his parents on the steps of the Hari Niwas.

Later in the day,Dr Abdullah met Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and several other party workers at his Gupkar road residence. Leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha arrived in Srinagar early morning and drove straight to the Gupkar road residence of Farooq Abdullah.

After the two-hour-long meeting, Azad called for the restoration of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir and release of all political leaders.

“First and foremost, democracy should be restored in J&K for any political process to start,” Azad told reporters.

He also called for the release of all leaders and individuals, including former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti who have been detained under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).

Democracy can be restored once all the leaders behind bars – either in jails or in guest houses or under particular act – are released. Let every individual of J&K be released from jail. Let the political process start… Let democracy prevail and then we can pick up other fights,” he said.

Azad also sought restoration of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir.

While Dr Abdullah acknowledged the sweet gesture and remained tight lipped Azad lambasted the Centre over its decision to scrap Article 370 and declare J&K a union territory.

In an indirect reference to a newly established political party, Azad said an agency-backed party won't survive there. “Only parties which are backed by people can flourish here,” Azad said.

Sharing his thoughts with media persons, Azad claimed, “It is the happiest moment to meet Dr. Abdullah after seven months. He is a friend. Besides, I met him on behalf of those who raised voice against the detention of these leaders since August last year either in parliament or at different platforms,""

“I have come on behalf of all those who have been raising voice in the parliament and other places against the detention of politicians,” Azad said accusing the government of committing excesses against Dr Abdullah by putting him in house arrest for over last seven months.

103,15-3-20,Of spiritual mindfulness,"It’s vital for our well-being to live in the present. Sometimes thinking doesn’t work; we need to relax and go beyond thinking, says Venugopal Acharya

It is undoubtedly difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by suitable practice and detachment. — Bhagavad Gita (6.35)

Rahul Dravid was down and out, almost. He came in to bat at number six, in the second innings follow on of a match that India was quickly losing. As he prepared to face the ball, the Australian captain hurled a scathing remark, “Oh Rahul is number six now, next match, he’ll be number twelve”. He meant Rahul is playing so bad, he’ll be out of the team soon.

Rahul had had a bout of low scores in the past and he felt shaken within as he prepared to bat. Memories of his poor performance flashed before his eyes. His mind had weakened. He was now being intimidated by aggressive opponents who were amongst the best in the art of sledging-a ploy to distract a batsman and disturb his concentration by sarcastic insults which would cause him to make mistakes and get dismissed.

What did Rahul do? He decided to take one ball at a time. He told himself there’s nothing he could do about the past and he has no control over his fate after this match. But this innings was his. And to be more precise, the ball that is coming at him now is the only reality of his life. ‘This ball is mine and I play it to perfection’ affirmed Rahul. Meanwhile, the Aussies tried their best to see the back of him but Rahul Dravid just lived one ball at a time.

What happened then is an incredible story of grit. Along with his partner Laksman, Rahul batted the entire fourth day, and most astonishingly, the Indian team came back to life, became the aggressor and won the match that is widely considered to be one of the greatest matches in test history. Rahul did what the American philosopher Henry David Thoreau said, “The meeting of two eternities — past and future — is precisely the present moment.”

It’s absolutely vital for our well-being to live in the present. That doesn’t mean we don’t plan our future or analyse our past mistakes. It simply means that you act mindfully. Don’t mix up many activities or multi-task and land up mentally exhausted. Play one ball at a time!

Ignore the mind’s scripts

The mind can offer many scripts and each appears convincing. If you ignore the mind’s proposal, it assures it has an alternative and then another one, until you succumb. Like this, we remain dutiful slaves of the mind. In the process, we miss out on a simple, yet most effective tool to puncture the mind’s tirade. And that is ‘just be present, here and now’.

In the spiritual tradition I come from, we softly chant the Holy Names of God on our prayer beads, and the entire focus is on hearing the sound. Srila Prabhupada, a revered Bhakti yoga teacher gave a simple tool: “Listen to the mantra you are chanting now. There’s no question of mind.” He’d say, ‘simply listen’. When you listen to sacred sound, you enter a spiritual space. In other traditions, the details may vary but wherever the practice is to ‘listen’ or ‘observe’ or ‘present’, we enter a space beyond the mind; it is here we touch divinity.

Examples of living beyond the mind

Once I was searching for my umbrella that I had misplaced. I thought hard and long but was clueless. I gave up and went about doing other things. Later as I relaxed, suddenly, as if out of nowhere, I knew where I had kept it earlier. Sometimes thinking doesn’t work; we need to relax and go beyond thinking.

Often when we try to solve a problem, our mind conjures up many alternatives. But if we slow down and learn to relax, accepting the present in a detached fashion, we’ll be surprised by the clarity we get, even in the midst of the confusion all around. Likewise, compulsive thinking could inhibit us. But if we learn through these small steps, we will blossom into our true self.

104,15-3-20,Seek guidance from God,"A soul must be in a position to gain what one lacks. And God fulfills this need either directly, or through His system, says AJIT KUMAR BISHNOI

This is not my conjecture. Lord Krishna tells us to always decide, what should be done and what shouldn’t after knowing what is stated in our scriptures. They should be our guidelines. (Bhagavad Gita 16.24) And what has been stated in the Gita? It is the wonderful dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna (18.76) From time immemorial the mankind has taken guidance from Lord Krishna’s instruction as detailed in the Gita.

I will quote God’s guidance in matters, which are among the most important to us. Let me take up intelligence first because the right intelligence is what we need to do anything well. There are four parts to it. (18.30) The first is to know what is worth doing and what is not. For example, should you pay attention to rumours or spread them yourself? The answer is no. The second is to know what is to be feared and what not. For example, should we fear our future? No, if we are connected with God; He will ensure a safe future for us (18.58)

The third guideline is to know what is attachment and what is relinquishment. If one doesn’t one will endure pain like when one is attached to the result. Similarly, relinquishing what shouldn’t like family duties brings punishment. And the last is to know what causes bondage and what is liberating. This is important in our quest for liberation at some point in the future.

The next important guidance is about our duties. The Lord has made it quite clear that duties, that is as per time, place and circumstance must be done. Otherwise even maintenance of the body will become difficult. (3.8) What is our experience? We qualify for God’s help only when we are dutiful. Isn’t there a famous saying that God helps those who help themselves. One may question this premise that if we can help ourselves, then, why do we need God’s help? Because we are limited and can go only so far, God the unlimited has to step in and take us further.

Next, I must address both peace and happiness, the most sought after goals. The Lord has left us in no doubt about what is required to be done. He states, “One must have God consciousness, otherwise there is no peace, and from where could there be any happiness.” (2.66) Happiness obtained by the contact between senses and sense objects is like poison in result. (18.38) And happiness obtained through laziness or carelessness is even worse. (18.39)

How does one achieve God consciousness? Both the factors earlier mentioned come into play. We need proper intelligence, that is spiritual intelligence and being dutiful, especially towards ourselves, that is the soul. As a soul, it is our duty to link with God, because we are His parts. (15.7) We are quite helpless without God, being extremely small. To live a good life, we need all kinds of help from God. We need God’s guidance because He is omniscient and our awareness is limited. We also need all kinds of strength such as atmabala — the inner strength, physical strength, mental strength, strength to tolerate, etc. God must protect us including from ourselves, because invariably we are our worst enemies.

I pray to God when I am faced with a problem. I immediately seek His guidance and help, and He provides. This facility is open to one and all, because this is the cosmic design. A small soul must be in a position to gain what one lacks. God does fulfill this need of ours either directly (9.22) or through His system. (9.10) All those who aspire to live a quality life shouldn’t miss out, otherwise life can be quite tough — a normal experience.

105,15-3-20,Weinstein’s jail a milestone in ‘Me Too’ drive,"Some of the women victims have demonstrated to the world that we should not stop fighting for what’s right. However, many wonder why the victims did not complain against Harvey Weinstein for decades while they were shaping up their career under his tutelage

The judgment delivered by the Manhattan Criminal Court this week is absolutely historic. It is about sentencing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein to 23 years of imprisonment for sexual assault and rape. The sentence was handed down by Justice James Burke who found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting a former production assistant and raping a former aspiring actress. His trial marked a major landmark for “Me Too” campaign as it highlighted the fact that finally a white, powerful and rich man can be prosecuted for sex crimes. Also it was critical because at last the accusers were heard by the judiciary. Though the charges first came to light in 2017, Weinstein was arrested in May 2018 and then the long legal battle began.

The Weinstein case saw twists and turns from the very beginning. Around two dozen women accusers who first raised their voices against him were known as “Silence Breakers”. They all joined hands to demand that Weinstein be held accountable for the egregious crimes he committed. It must be noted that less than one year after The New York Times and New Yorker published investigations detailing allegations of sexual abuse and assault against him that spanned decades, he was arrested in May 25, 2018. When he was remanded in police custody, he initially faced five counts for alleged nonconsensual encounters, including with former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and an undisclosed accuser. These counts include rape in the first degree, one count of rape in the third degree, one count of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and two counts of predatory sexual assault.

However, Weinstein had pleaded not guilty of any of these charges at the start. He had denied engaging in any nonconsensual encounters detailed in criminal and civil court proceedings so far. Weinstein and his attorney’s denial have brought to light the fact that characterised him as a victim. In an interview, he grumbled and said: “I feel like the forgotten man. I made more movies directed by women and about women than any other filmmaker, and I am talking about thirty years ago. I’m not talking about now, when it is vogue. I did it first! I pioneered it! It all got eviscerated because of what happened. My work has been forgotten.”

This clearly shows how much he has contributed to the growth and developed of cinema, professional careers of many and achieving new heights in that particular era. But then at what cost? He should have been checked earlier. Before he turned it into a complete mess and gory episode, many of those women and probably some man as well should have gathered courage to expose him. He has gone too far. In an advanced country like the US, supported by an extremely liberal environment and highly charged with sophisticated information technology, these women should have come forward much earlier. Nevertheless, he was exposed only for the betterment of the society and for the safety and security of women in high profile industries such as movie making.

When the case was making progress, many of his victims were not confident that they will see their perpetrators sent to jail for his crimes. Chiding the judicial system may not help the victims. It’s all about collating evidences and making it heard to the judges before it is too late. And that has happened and taken a new turn in this century only. Women of the world, you have won another battle against an animal like man, for sure.

Why such crimes go unreported? Why victims hesitate to come upfront? Are they scared of losing their career? Whether we love or hate those who stood up, plainly speaking, we have to admire their chutzpah. Such crimes go unreported because of fear or losing favour at times. The victims not really hesitate to come forward, but they simply can’t fight such elements as they are too tied to the system. Yes, it is true that once you point a finger at such biggies, you may lose big career opportunities or at times may be sidelined forever. This is all about a close-knit system where you can’t fight alone unless you are too powerful or ready to sacrifice your career.

The emergence of technological revolution, especially with the ultra-modern social media platforms, has changed the scenario. Women today can easily take up their grievances to Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snap chat, Instagram, etc. These fora first help highlight the cases and then put extreme pressure on the culprits, leading to their public confessions at times. But dragging them to the courtroom and passing through agonising trials up to the conviction stage certainly demands both moral and material strength.

Weinstein’s conviction is a milestone in the Me Too campaign. Some of these women victims have demonstrated to the world that we should not stop fighting for what’s right. Many wonder why the victims did not complain about Weinstein till 2017. In a career spanning almost three decades in Hollywood, he had produced many more movies centring woman characters and helping many of them to launch to the heights of their maturity and popularity. During those days no one tried to bring to light anything against Weinstein. It simply gives an impression that either both sides were able to work out their plans and these matters once highlighted could have definitely jeopardised the projects. It was then just a matter of convenience! Sadly it shows the complicity of the other side too. That way many of the victims are also a party to the crimes committed by him. At any rate, he could not have done things alone. Some of the victims worked with him for years to advance their professional careers and now coming up with slew of accusations must be blamed equally.

Also some of them who had to undergo all sorts of harassments with the hope of making it big in their lives and eventually could not, also should not have accused him now. Again those who were lured and then exploited by Weinstein must have raised their voices even before. It is well understood that many of the women who had undergone such ordeals may not have the strength and material might to stand up against the Hollywood Moghul in their early careers. And now when they are financially secure and professionally matured, some of them are rising against him. Certainly, some of the women are gathering courage to just highlight what he did to them. In this entire saga of trials, it is only the judges who would be able to find the real culprits and accordingly punish them. While talking about the victims of Weinstein, and their genuineness, it’s not to justify what he did to them. He had simply taken the advantage of his power, position and wealth. Thus he was successful in silencing them for long. His punishment was long overdue. He could not stand the test of the legal trial as he had hardly anything to substantiate in proving him innocent.

106,15-3-20,Children of lesser God,"Life dealt them a bad hand but that didn’t deter these people from fighting all odds and standing tall and proud about what they have achieved today. SHALINI SAKSENA travels to Munnar in Kochi to bring you stories of the specially-abled men and women who are sassy, full of life and always have a smile on their face

Twenty-five years back, a few tea plantation managers’ wives got together to solve a problem that the workers faced — what would happen to their special needs wards once they were dead? But the more pressing issues that some of these families faced was the constant worry that they had left their child all alone at home and locked up. But they had no choice. Both husband and the wife had to work and with no one to look after their child who was autistic or hearing impaired, they had no option but to lock them up.

That is when the ladies stepped in and opened a school for them. Ratna Krishnakumar, founder and managing trustee of Srishti tells you that the journey of the trust started back in 1994 and since then they have grown by leaps and bound. “We started small, with a school that had around six special needs children with one room. Slowly over the years, as more and more kids were brought in by their parents we grew in size and today we have this sprawling facility that houses Athulya, a vocational training centre and recycled paper-making unit, Deli, bakery and confectionery that makes breads, cookies, rolls, and biryanis is run by speech impaired and differently abled bakers, Nisarga, the strawberry unit employs speech and hearing impaired young people who make foodie’s delights like strawberry preserve, Vatika, that uses therapeutic power of nature to rehabilitate physically fit young adults with severe mental challenges and Aranya Naturals, that makes clothes from natural dyes that are designed by the special needs young adults,” Krishnakumar says.

She tells you that from only four to five children, the organisation today has over 63 children who are trained in life skills, basic reading, writing, and the fundamentals of mathematics and arts. “Though physically deprived, these kids are extremely strong in their human values and are very active. Their zeal keeps us all motivated, so much so that every week that I spend with them is absolutely rewarding,” she says.

There is a story how these units that export 60 per cent of what they produce came to be. One is told that once the school was up and thriving, a huge problem was staring at the trust — what to do with them once they turned 18? Going back to the life where they would be locked up once again while their parents were out to eke a living was out of the question. The solution? Making strawberry preserve. “We started in one of our kitchens. The region is known for strawberries. Most household have a kitchen garden and they grow this lovely red fruit. The recipe that we use to make this preserve is ageold — that had been passed on by the English ladies. To begin with, we would keep it in washed and hand labeled Horlicks bottles. That was our beginning. Slowly, we started training a few special needs adults who could work in the unit,” Susan Cherian who manages Nisarga recalls.

She tells you that all the people employed in her unit are hearing impaired, 10 of them. All of them do all the work from sorting the strawberries to removing the stem to washing them to then putting them into big boilers and then bottling them and labeling them. “It is not possible to employ autistic or mentally challenged young people because there is equipment and there are safety standards to adhere to,” Cherian says.

But there were challenges when it came to keeping these people employed all year round. “Strawberry is seasonal. We needed to diversify so we started making pink guava jam, passion fruit sauce, plum jam, the fruit is outsourced, and marmalade. Once the strawberry season is over, the unit gets busy with passion fruit, then comes pink guava. The lean months are July and August. But it picks up once the oranges are in the market. This way we ensure that these people are employed all the year round,” Cherian says and tells you that the unit makes 5,000 bottles a day during the season.

Cherian tells you that these specially-abled workers are dedicated to their work and out of the 10, four of them are extra smart and in fact one of them can speak English and has been to Haryana as part of para-games. Some of these adults today are bread earners for their family and are happily married with children who are totally normal and go to local school. Most of the workers here have been with the unit for over 20 years after they turned 18 and trained in area of their interest.

Meet Ganesh who joined the unit in 1997. He tells you that he is married and has a son who is studying in Tamil Nadu and lives with Ganesh’s sister. The reason why his son is studying there is because in Munnar, the medium of education is Malayalam and he couldn’t cope with the language. He and his wife, who is from TN and normal, live in Munnar, Kochi.

“I sort the fruit that comes in and wash it. I ensure that the fruit is not rotten and there are no leaves and stem. I work six days a week from 8 am to 5 pm. I earn `10,000 a month. I also get bonus when there is a festival. I also send money for my son’s upkeep. I love the work here and don’t want to be shifted in another unit,” Ganesh says. He was born normal and could hear well till he was in Class IV. One day his father, a drunkard, hit him hard on the ear. That is when he lost hearing in both his ears – due to infection and high fever.

Pareselan is the oldest worker at Nisarga. He is the jovial of them all and wants to talk about his wife. He tells you that he came to DARE School in 1991 and joined the unit in 1995. “The best thing I like about this job is that all the bottles that we make get sold like hot cakes. I want to make as money as I can for the trust and the unit in particular. I got married in 2008. My wife works in Aranya and has blue eyes. My daughter also has blue eyes and is studying in local CBSE School. I earn `10,000 a month and so does my wife. With two salaries, we are happy. We also get `1,300 per month from the State Government because of our disability,” he says who also weaves baskets from bamboo in his spare time.

Prakash, is the artist among them and loves to paint and show his work to all those who visit the unit. “I have only three-four paintings left, rest have gone for a competition that I have entered in. My wife Muthukumari works at Aranya and have two beautiful daughters. My wife’s grandmother also lives with us. Both my daughters were born normal and the elder one goes to school. My two-and-a-half-year daughter is very smart. When she speaks with her mother or me, she uses sign language and the next, when she speaks with others, she switches to talking without missing a beat. My day starts with sorting the fruit, I can sort 25 kg in 30 minutes. The best part of the job is production. When we go back home, we talk about our day and what we need to do make our daughters’ lives better. Once I am free from this job, I also work part-time with a florist. He pays me `3,000 a month. From Srishti, I get `10,000, my wife gets the same amount. We also get the dole from the State Government. People understand my disability and over the years, they understand what I am trying to communicate,” he says. When Ratan Tata visited the facility he asked for Prakash by name and hugged him.

Gunashega and his wife Ragina together work at the unit. She is the strong one and is with him all the time. The two of them got married a couple of years back. To begin with, she would find fault with everything and fight but things have improved now. When we got married, we had adjustment problems and would fight. But things are better now. At present, we don’t have any kids but hope to have them some day. When we are out, people do take advantage of me but my wife is smart. She does all the calculation. Some sabziwalas try to fleece me, but now the two of us go together and they can’t fool me anymore. The good part is that everyone in Munnar knows about the trust and the work they are doing. They look at us with respect. We e popular here in Munnar. We don’t have very many friends, not that we need them, we are busy fighting with each other,” Gunashega shares. Ragina’s parents work with a tea estate and so does Gunashega’s mother who lives with his brother. But because he is henpecked, he rarely visits her.

He tells you that the best thing that Ragina makes is beef roast and rice. “While is make beef roast and rice, Gunashega has learnt how to cook as well and makes a great beef fry. In these last couple of years, I have taught him how to cook. He also does household chores like washing the clothes and utensils. We have a small kitchen garden and grow seasonal vegetables. Just the other day, we plucked some beans and cooked it together,” Ragina says who sent to work with Aranya but hated the work and came back.

Ajit Kumar is the 24-year-old athlete among them and has a severe hearing and speech impairment. He lives with his parents who dote on him. His family has several cows and most of the money comes from selling milk. He is called the rich man walking in his unit. His wallet is always full and never shies from helping those in financial need. “I help my parents in taking care of the cattle and have been with this unit for two-and-a-half years. Before that I was in DARE School. I do want to get married but I am young right now. I had gone to Haryana and hated every minute of it. I missed my family so much that I have decided not to participate in the games anymore,” Kumar says.

107,15-3-20,‘I would rather crack a joke on myself’,"Amit Tandon | The stand-up comedian is back with yet another Netflix Original Standup Special — Amit Tandon: Family Tandoncies. He speaks with Shalini Saksena about what this act is all about and how it is different from the half-hour special that he had done for the platform earlier

What is the show about?

It’s called Family Tandoncies and is largely about my family, the coming of age of relationships — whether it is with my wife or the children and the challenges that come when you have two kids. There is a saying: If you have one kid, you become a parent, with two, you become a referee. The show is a mixed bag of things that includes my growing up days and how we coped with our siblings versus how my kids cope with each other.

This is the second time you have a show on this platform, what made you do it again?

The first show that I had done was half-hour show which was part of the series Comedians of the World, where they had shortlisted a number of comedians from across the globe, three were from India. The format was different, they had given us the setup and the audience. We just went there and performed. What I am doing now is a solo show. It is the first Hindi solo of the platform ever. Here, the complete responsibility of the show was on me. To get the production, creatives, stage design and even getting the director on-board was on me. Then there was the writing and the performance as well. This was a bigger challenge. At the same time, I had more creative liberty this time. Plus the style is different, back then I had done 30 minutes, this show is of 70 minutes. This makes a lot of difference when it comes to actual performance.

How much time did it take to put all this together?

It took me around 10 months from start to finish. It takes two to three months to write the show. Then you start performing it, testing the material, tightening the jokes, this takes another couple of months, taking the time period to three to five months. Then I practiced the performance 15-20 times in one month to ensure everything is on my finger tips, this is because I don’t have any cue cards during performance and there are no cuts. I need to have those 70 minutes completely in my mind so that I can do it with my eyes closed. It took another three-four months to get the production house on board, getting the music, creatives, hiring the studio and setting up the entire thing.

How is this live performance different from your other live shows on stage?

While this audience was also live, we got ticketed audience, there was an option to get guests but I didn’t want this. I did a proper ticket show, we did two back to back shows where we got the audience. The challenge here is the immense mental pressure. In a live stage show, if I get something wrong, I can always go back and pick up the thread since people won’t know if I have forgotten a few lines. When I recorded for this show, it was like recording a movie in one take. The challenge was that I performed well and there were no retakes. There is a lot of stress to deliver things properly.

Why use your home name Raju?

There is joke in the show where I talk about myself and say that saare chhotey bhai ke naam ya naukar ke naam Raju hota hai. Hence the name and the joke.

Can you share a few more jokes from the show?

I talk about how relationship with your wife changes over the years — from the time when there is a lot of pressure to be romantic in the first few years of marriage and now we are at the stage, after being married for 17 years, we are not worried what he or she will feel — ab yeh kahan jayega. So you stop putting the efforts to be romantic. You realise that you don’t have to be together 24x7 and need to give space to each other. You start going out for parties with your friends. Then I talk about the days when we had our first kid, the parenting pressure, then you have the second kid and suddenly from taking care of one, there are two. There is much more responsibility.

Do you think that Indians have yet to learn to laugh at themselves?

Yes, a lot. We have very fragile egos in India. It is taking us a lot of time, there is some change but we have a long way to go before we have that sense of humour where we can laugh at ourselves.

How much challenge does this pose while doing a stand-up?

It is a challenge so I don’t interact too much with the audience. I have realised that if I want to do jokes let it be about myself than talking to them and cracking a joke on them and taking offence.

Where do we stand in terms of comedy, are we stuck doing slapstick comedy?

We are getting mature now. If we look at the evolution in India, we had hasya kavi sammelan. We used to have a lot of mimicry-based shows, this was replaced by slapstick comedy. But now the audience wants more. If you see the video content today, you would see how mature the audience has become. This is limited to Tier-I and II cities. Television has slapstick since there is a market for that but it is not as big as it used to be.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/talktime------i-would-rather-crack-a-joke-on-myself----2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/talktime------i-would-rather-crack-a-joke-on-myself---.html
108,15-3-20,Intricacy on canvas,"MUSBA HASHMI catches up with Padma Shree awardee JAI PRAKASH, a self-taught painter who ranks amongst the top contemporary artists, who gives an insight into his journey

Dressed in a light-yellow kurta pyjama with a mehendi green koti, he was patiently sitting in his shop that had myriad paintings on the side. Hair style somewhat similar to that of director Imtiaz Ali, a smile of satisfaction and gratitude and adding to all that charisma a voice as humble as it can be. There was not even the slightest sign of pride in Padma Shree Awardee Jai Prakash’s personality. He recently showcased his work at Crafts Bazaar 2020 through Crafts Maestros, India’s first brand of handicrafts and handlooms.

Born to a train driver, Maliram in Delhi, Prakash was always interested in painting and is known as a self-taught artist. “Painting was my father’s hobby. Although he couldn’t take it up as a profession back in those days but he used to practice often. I was six when I started imitating him. That’s how I got interested in the craft. After completing Class XII, I went to seek admission in College of Art but couldn’t get through. That’s when I thought of pursuing the craft on my own. I looked up to my father for help and did the rest on my own. However, it was only after I got married that I got into the craft full-fledgedly,” he tells you.

Prakash calls himself a quick learner. It was because of this quality and not to mention the hard work that he got so much recognition in very less time.

“It was in 1992 when I started focusing on the craft. I learnt all the tips early and in 1996 received the State award. It didn’t stop there, I received the National Award in 1998. Then in 2016 I was honoured with the Padma Shree,” he tells you.

Prakash’s excellence lies in miniature paintings. However, miniature here doesn’t signify tiny paintings. “Miniature painting is just a style of painting. They can be as huge as to fit on a big wall. They didn’t derived their name because of their size but because of the minute details that they have. There is a lot of minute, intrinsic work done in these paintings. Hence, they are called miniature,” he explains. Natural colours, handmade brushes and papers are used in this form of painting.

“I prepare the colours on my own using all natural ingredients. The paper which I use is from the good old days. It is the same paper which was used by munshis (accountant) to keep a record of everything,” he adds.

The shelf life of miniature paintings is greater as compared to the normal ones because the natural paper absorbs the colour. While on the normal paper the colour remains only on the top and act as a layer on the paper. This way it can fade out easily after some time.

His inspiration comes from what he sees around and the people whom he meet.

“An idea can strike you in the middle of nowhere. I can be attending a party and would get to see something that I think is worth painting, I don’t sit specially to make a painting. It comes naturally,” Prakash says.

The price of the paintings depends upon the craftsmanship. “The more detailed the painting is, the higher its cost will be,” he says.

The minimum time to make a painting is around four days. However, if it’s a masterpiece, it would take as long as four months.

“Masterpieces are nothing but pure hardwork of an artist. An artist pours all the talent and expertise into that one painting. There is no boundation of time. Maybe the artist have to sit for 12 hours straight to complete a portion or it may be as less as 30 minutes,” Prakash says.

The idea of taking up painting as a profession didn’t sit too well with his family initially. “They used to say ‘yeh kya chitrakaari mein laga hai, kya hoga isse’. Par jab kaam aur daam dono milne laga, then they realised that art and crafts is a profession for real,” he says.

Prakash’s focus is to make three paintings in a year. “I want to give time to my creations. I don’t want to make anything in a hurry,” he says.

There is nothing like a favourite painting for Prakash as he has made all of them with the same enthusiasm. “But to name one it is Company Period,” he tells you.

Prakash has spent the most time in making Marriage Procession. “It took me 18 months to complete the painting. There was a lot of detailing and lot of figures in it. It was of 3 by 6.5 feet,” he tells you. It costed around `5 lakh.

Not only in India, Prakash has showcased his work in 34 countries. “I have represented India in different competitions in 34 countries around the globe,” he tells you. He is also invited by different colleges and universities around the work to teach students the craft.

Prakash has a message for all the aspiring artists. “The key in this profession is to adapt to changes. We have to keep in mind what the market requires. Our paintings should be in trend. They should resonate with the people. One who fails to do this loses his value and essence. Try to touch upon the subjects and trends that are prevalent in the society instead of what was liked years before from now. Also one should not solely depend on the Government for work. The Government does its bit by giving you a platform, rest is up to you. One has to make their way ahead and you cannot run away from struggle. Work doesn’t come to you, you have to search for it,” he says.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/intricacy-on-canvas-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/intricacy-on-canvas.html
109,15-3-20,‘I am the black sheep of my family’,"Playback singer, actor and TV host Khushboo Grewal speaks with Shalini Saksena about her journey and how she is still the lead vocalist for Meet Brothers

You don’t have a professional training as a singer. How tough has it been?

I had a long gap professionally — from the time I was VJing and acting. I lacked the discipline that is required to do riyaz. I had got used to a relaxed life where I was getting up when I wanted to. Music requires a lot of dedication. This was something that I had not realised till I started singing for Bollywood. I still have a long way to go before I have that kind of drive. I am still a big cheater. Once I started training and understanding my weakness, I finally realised how flawed I was. Earlier, I would just land in at a party and start singing when I was asked. That’s when I had a new found respect for all the singers out there. The more you learn, the more you realise, it requires a lot of years before one can master it. Hence, my status is that of a performer.

Are you still the lead singer for Meet Brothers? Doing playback, live performances, singing and acting, is your plate full now?

Yes, I am still the lead vocalist. I am also a workaholic so I don’t think that my plate is full. I am the kind of person who can work 24x7 for 30 days and not complaint. I never turn down work. At present, I have picked up a Punjabi show— Hasdeyan De, Ghar Vasde — which is on the lines of Comedy Nights with Kapil Sharma. I am doing this with Gurpreet Ghuggi. It is a show about husband and and wife where Ghuggi and I play the characters and we have different guests on the show.

Does being a performer makes it easy to do such diverse things at the same time?

Acting, singing, being a host or doing live performances are a different aspect of a performer. If you see an actor, they must have basic skills to dance and basic knowledge of taal which means that they have basic sense of music. When I am in front of the mic and it is a sad song, I have to have that in my voice. If I have to sing a dance song, my expressions are different. We are somewhere using all these traits but are lying dormant and don’t bring it at the forefront. It’s not difficult to switch.

You belong to family of doctors. What was their reaction?

I always consider myself as the black sheep of the family. My father is a anaesthetic, my mother is gynaecologist, my sister is a dentist and my jiju is an accident and trauma specialist. My sister-in-law is a clinical psychologist and here I am— what do I do? I entertain them. Somebody has to do it, they are all very serious. But while nobody was from the performing arts background but mother would sing and my sister was a great dancer. I would try and do what she did. I took to stage at a young age to get exposure. Whatever opportunity that came, I would take it up and it laid the foundation to me being a professional many years later.

Is there is a lot of competition for women playback singers?

Not just for women, for men too. There is competition everywhere. There is so much access to music, there is YouTube and other platforms. People living in smaller cities can make it big which is great. It is good that youngsters are getting a channel to showcase their talent.

What kind of music do you listen to?

I listen to all kinds of music. I have playlist — a combination of punjabi songs or acoustic or the latest dance numbers. I love dancing, a lot of songs on the list are peppy numbers. But when I am driving I listen to acoustics.

What next?

I have a dialogue from one of my films — when one makes plans, someone up there is laughing. This makes so much sense. When I came to Mumbai, the first year I made so many plans but none materialised. So I stopped planing. I live in the moment. I don’t make long term unrealistic plans but I do make short term goals. For all I know I could be picking strawberries in a London countryside in a small little farm growing organic stuff and running a small little cafe. I do plan to do some great music this year. I am happy to get back to the Punjabi space — doing films and songs.",sunday-edition,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---i-am-the-black-sheep-of-my-family----2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sunday-edition/---i-am-the-black-sheep-of-my-family---.html

The 64-year-old stopped being involved in day-to-day operations at the firm more than a decade ago, turning his attention to the foundation he launched with his wife, Melinda. Gates served as chairman of Microsoft’s board of directors until early in 2014 and has now stepped away entirely, according to the Redmond-based technology giant.

“It’s been a tremendous honor and privilege to have worked with and learned from Bill over the years,” Microsoft chief executive and company veteran Satya Nadella said in a release.

“Bill founded our company with a belief in the democratizing force of software and a passion to solve society’s most pressing challenges; and Microsoft and the world are better for it.” Nadella said Microsoft would continue to benefit from Gates’ “technical passion and advice” in his continuing role as a technical advisor.

“I am grateful for Bill’s friendship and look forward to continuing to work alongside him,” Nadella said.

Gates left his CEO position in 2000, handing the company reins to Steve Ballmer to devote more time to his charitable foundation.

He gave up the role of chairman at the same time Nadella became Microsoft’s third CEO in 2014.

Regularly listed among the world’s richest people, William H Gates was a geeky-looking young man when he and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975.

MoU signed between CRPF, Aditya Mehta Foundation

New Delhi: The values that emerge from out of the confluence of the civil society and the Forces carry a lot of heft for the Force personnel. These humanitarian values of mutual care and support go a long way in re-engineering an enabling eco-system for the next-of-kins of the martyrs and also for those who get unfortunately disabled in the line of duty. Sharing his mind on the occasion of the signing of an MoU between CRPF and the Aditya Mehta Foundation to enable the ‘Divyang Warriors’ lead a self-esteem driven productive life in Hyderabad today, AP Maheshwari, DG CRPF said the world does throw up immense opportunities for us to grab. The only thing needed to gainfully harness these opportunities is to re-orient our psycho-behavioral dispositions accordingly. Making a reference to the innovative project envisaged in the MoU, Maheshwari said that the differently-abled personnel of CAPFs could explore myriad possibilities being offered through cyber platforms, artificial intelligence-driven digital platforms, para-sports and other artistic activities. He expressed the hope that such Force personnel will make the most of the re-skilling opportunities being opened up through the MoU.

114,15-3-20,Durable industry to be in red zone if component supply does not improve,"Appliances and consumer electronics industry, which source components mainly from China, may be in the “red zone” if the supply of materials impacted by coronavirus pandemic does not improve by next month, according to an industry body.

Prices of consumer durables products as airconditioners, televisions and refrigerators, are being revised by the manufacturers due to supply constraints, the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA) said.

According to the CEAMA, though factories in China have started operating but they are still operating at around half of their capacity. Moreover, if the availability does not improve by April, then the industry would be in “red zone”.

“The coronavirus attack had a negative impact on consumer durables sector due to its dependency on imports from China - be it for finished goods or components. We have received reports that plants in China are operating at 50-60 per cent capacity, but production has begun now,” CEAMA President Kamal Nandi said.

“Prices for consumer durables, especially in categories like ACs, televisions and refrigerators, are being revised by industry players,” he said adding, “As of now the finished goods are available but the industry will be in the red zone if things don’t improve by April.”

The Indian appliances and consumer electronics industry is largely dependent on China for the sourcing of components and some of the finished goods.

According to a joint report by CEAMA and Frost & Sullivan, the industry had a total market size of Rs 76,400 crore in 2018-19, in which Rs 32,200 crore was contributed from domestic manufacturing. While, Nandi who is also Godrej Appliances Business Head and Executive Vice President, said that it is increasing the prices of its range of Acs from 2 per cent to 3 per cent.

“Godrej will be taking a 2-3 percent price hike in ACs in the second half of March,” he said.

“The short supply of components, increase in customs duty and higher logistical cost of air lifting components are key triggers for the price hike. Given the high seasonality of cooling categories like ACs and refrigerators, the shortage of stocks is bound to hit revenue for summer,” he added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/durable-industry-to-be-in-red-zone-if-component-supply-does-not-improve.html
115,15-3-20,6 pvt banks join SBI to rescue Yes Bank,"As the Government on Saturday notified the reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank, major private banks have come out with investment commitments for the crisis-hit bank. Federal Bank on Saturday announced that it would invest Rs 300 crore in Yes bank by subscribing to its 30 crore shares of Rs 2 each for cash, at a premium of Rs 8 per equity share.

With this, six private banks have now committed investment of Rs 3,700 crore in the cash-strapped private sector bank. On Friday, ICICI Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd announced that they will be investing Rs 1,000 crore each in Yes Bank’s equity. Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be investing Rs 600 crore and Rs 500 crore respectively, while Bandhan Bank will be investing Rs 300 crore.

Both ICICI and HDFC Bank are likely to have five per cent shareholding each in the restructured Yes Bank. In its regulatory filing, HDFC Bank had said its investment of Rs 1,000 crore would be completed by March 31.

In a regulatory filing on Saturday, Federal Bank said the Bank has issued an equity commitment letter to invest Rs 300 crore in Yes Bank Ltd.

The banks will acquire equity shares of Rs 2 each of Yes Bank Limited, at a premium of Rs 8 per equity share, which means they would buy shares at Rs 10 each under the proposed Scheme of Reconstruction of Yes Bank Limited under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

On Friday, the Union Cabinet approved the Reserve Bank-proposed reconstruction plan for Yes Bank that got notified the next day. Under the terms of scheme, State Bank along with other private investors would pump in equity.

While SBI will be anchor bank with investment upto 49 per cent equity of Yes Bank, it will have to hold at least 26 per cent stake in the private bank for a minimum period of three years. Similarly, the other investors, including the private banks and existing shareholders of Yes bank holding more than 100 shares will also be mandated to have a similar lock-in period for 75 per cent of their investment in the bank.

The authorised share capital of the Yes Bank will be revised upwards from Rs 1,100 crore to Rs 6,200 crore.

Sources said that Radhakishan Damani, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Azim Premji Trust may also pick up some equity in Yes bank. However, this could not be independently verified.

As per experts, Yes Bank would require over Rs 20,000 crore to avoid a collapse. So far the committed investment amount stands at over Rs 11,000 crore, which is just about half of the initial assessment.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/6-pvt-banks-join-sbi-to-rescue-yes-bank.html

The industry is witnessing about 70-80 per cent cancellation in bookings following the coronavirus outbreak, according to the association.

“A complete GST holiday for tourism, travel and hospitality industry for the next 12 months till the time the recovery happens,” TAAI president Jyoti Mayal told PTI, detailing the suggestions submitted to the minister on Friday.

The association also demanded six to nine months’ moratorium on all principal and interest payments on loans and overdrafts, besides deferment of GST and advance tax payments.

They also asked the minister for removal of fees for any upcoming licenses, permits renewal, excise exemption for liquor for the hospitality and travel industry across the country. The association also sought interest reduction or subvention on term loans and working capital loans.

Mayal said the industry apprehends large scale job loss owing to the restrictions from the outbreak.

119,15-3-20,China used Military Medical Response Strategy to contain spread,"After the detection of first Covid-19 case on December 20 in Wuhan, China resorted to Military Medical Response strategy and reversed the disease spread trend in over two months with the comprehensive disease management system.

Under MMRS, role and responsibility of each and every administrative unit/communist party offices at various levels were clearly outlined.

Shaking hands has been declared as a Penal offence, quantum of punishment yet to be decided.

Beijing roped in two million doctors and classified four types of quarantine facilities-Community, Medical, Intensive case and Critical care and also subjected the quarantined individuals to engage in yoga and other games in order to keep them active, according to specialists tracking health intelligence in the region.

However, initially the disease was assessed to be normal viral disease/fever and antibiotics were prescribed to the patients for three days but the post mortem report revealed the severity and realizing that there was no medical protocol available to treat the disease, China informed the entire world on the outbreak of Covid-19 and sought their cooperation, sources said, adding 160 countries are cooperating with Beijing in various ways to contain the pandemic. . As a first step, China constructed a 1000-bed hospital in Wuhan and subsequently,13 more hospitals of similar strength were erected and adopted Emergency Medical Response Strategy but switched to Military Medical Response Strategy in view of the severity of the outbreak, they said. Single party rule in China obligates each citizen to undergo communist party training and take military training for 30 days, making them obliged to follow SOPs for such situations, a reason why China was able to reverse the trend.

India and Pakistan have general proclivity to disobey rules and it will be more difficult to contain the outbreak in these countries, a source said.

SOPs included surgical masks, clothing for countering pathogens provided to doctors and paramedic as 10 per cent medical staff got infected during the course of treatment of patients. Patients were kept busy with exercises like yoga and other indoor games developed for inmates of quarantine facilities.

As part of the MMRS, entire country was mapped in terms of intensity of outbreak and medical resources were mobilised accordingly.

Streamlined response system helped in reversing the trend. As on March 3, fresh cases in China were lower than Europe and other Asian countries. On March 3, 206 cases were reported in China and 386 cases were reported in Europe/Asia (minus China), sources tracking the developments in China said, adding large quarantine facilities with clear strategy defining the roles and responsibilities at each level.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/china-used-military-medical-response-strategy-to-contain-spread.html

Having rushed from Qatar, one among the coronavirus affected nations, on March 8, Abel wanted to be with his father who had been hospitalised following a fall from his bed.

However, having travel history from a COVID-19-hit country and having mild cough, he immediately reported himself to the health authorities and was admitted to the isolation ward of the medical college hospital here.

The condition of his father worsened after he suffered a stroke and he passed away on March 9.

Though Abel was in the same hospital, he could not see his father for one last time as he was in the isolation ward. As the ambulance carried his father’s body, he took one last glimpse from the window of his room.

He saw the last rites of his father through video call.”If I had not reported myself, I could’ve seen my dad for one last time. But I did not, because I decided not to spread the disease in case I was affected. The expats here please report to the health authorities. If you can spare a few days, you can spend rest of your time happily with your family,” he wrote.

“Isolation ward is not a concentration camp”, Abel wrote in his Facebook page on March 12 in which he describes his plight but points out at the importance of expatriates self quarantining themselves to protect their families.

The decision of Abel to quarantine himself despite reaching the state to visit his hospitalised father was praised by many, including chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, for his (Abel’s) social commitment.

“It was an extremely sad situation. The youth travelled all the way to visit his father at hospital.

Though he reached here, he was unable to meet his father. He showed exemplary courage and social commitment and responsibility by getting quarantined on his own,” Vijayan had said on Friday.

In the Facebook post that has become viral, Abel says he reached Kerala to spend time with his father who was hospitalised and had developed internal bleeding following a fall.

“I filled the necessary forms at the airport and reached the hospital. I kept a distance from everyone, even though my temperature reading was normal. I developed a slight cough and irritation in my throat. I thought about my family and friends and decided to meet the doctor,” Abel wrote.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/gulf-returnee-watches-dad---s-funeral-from-hospital.html

133,15-3-20,"‘GST hike to make mobile phones costly, hit sales’","With the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, increasing the GST on mobile phones from 12 per cent to 18 per cent on Saturday, industry experts feel it would hit the industry and the consumers hard. Brands are in no position to absorb this impact. “They will, most certainly, decide to pass it on to the consumer, at least in case of high-selling models,” said Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) stressed that the move would stymie consumption.

“The 6 per cent GST increase will be detrimental to the vision of ‘digital India’. Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of $80 billion (Rs 6 lakh crore) by 2025 will not be achieved. We will fall short by at least Rs 2 lakh crore,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, ICEA Chairman.

In a letter to the Finance Minister on March 12, the ICEA had said the mobile handsets sector was in deep stress because of the supply chain disruption due to coronavirus outbreak. It was the most inappropriate time to consider GST hike on mobile phones, the industry body said.

It also said the GST hike on mobile phone might adversely affect localisation of manufacturing as well as popularisation of the country’s digital payments objectives.

According to ICEA, 31-32 crore Indians who buy phones in the country will be impacted by the move.

Terming the move counter-intuitive and detrimental to the ‘digital India’ vision, the IDC India Research Director said, “This is a textbook case of missing the wood for the trees. This will stunt any hope of growth in the near-term, which anyway looks challenging now due to coronavirus issue at both supply and demand ends,” Singh told IANS.

The coronavirus outbreak, which has hampered global tech giants’ 2020 plans leading to cancellation or postponement of global flagship conferences, is set to hit supplies of smartphone components from China to India at least till the second quarter of this year.

Demand for more skilled manpower, better hardware to enhance capacity has been agreed to by the Council, she said. The GST Council has decided that a completely enhanced capacity, a leaner system of GST Network with capacity enhance, staff response, better solutions, which were envisaged and proposed by Nilekani by January 2021, should be completed by July 2020, Sitharaman said.

With regard to GST rates, the minister said there are four sectors — footwear, textiles, fertiliser and mobile phones — which face inverted duty structure wherein inputs are taxed at a higher rate than finished products.

“It was decided by the Council to raise the GST rate on mobile phones and specified parts which presently attract 12 per cent to be taxed at 18 per cent.

“For all other items where there is duty inversion, if there is a need to calibrate the rates for removing inversion, it was decided in one of the future meetings we will take up the issue,” she said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gst-council-raises-tax-on-mobile-phones-to-18--2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/gst-council-raises-tax-on-mobile-phones-to-18-.html

Overseas investors pulled out a net sum of Rs 24,776.36 crore from equities and Rs 13,199.54 crore from the debt segment between Mar 2-13, depositories data showed.

This translates into a total net outflow of Rs 37,975.90 crore during the period under review.

Prior to this, foreign investors were net buyers for six consecutive months since September 2019.

""The spread of coronavirus outbreak, which has now been declared a pandemic, and continued slowdown in the global economy, has created a vicious cycle which is consuming investors worldwide,"" said Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research, Morningstar Investment Adviser India.

Global markets reeled last week after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, and expressed deep concern over the ""alarming levels of inaction"".

Given the ongoing scenario, foreign investors have taken a flight to safer investment options, such as dollar denominated asset classes and gold as against fixed income securities of emerging markets like India, he added.

Going forward, as coronavirus crosses boundaries and affects other countries, it may have a more serious impact on the already slowing global economy and on foreign flows into emerging markets such as India, Srivastava said.

""The markets have been very volatile all over the globe. Many countries are expected to announce stimulus packages and tax breaks to support various industries as they deal with the effects of this virus' outbreak. When such announcements are made, investors' sentiments are expected to change,"" said Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/corona-scare--fpis-press-panic-button--withdraw-rs-37-976-cr-from-indian-mkts-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/corona-scare--fpis-press-panic-button--withdraw-rs-37-976-cr-from-indian-mkts.html
136,15-3-20,"Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea must disclose workings used to arrive at govt dues: Report","Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd, whose self-assessed dues to the government are less than half of what the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) estimates, must disclose workings highlighting areas of difference as minority shareholders deserve to know, an analyst report said.

While Bharti Airtel has pegged its dues arising from a Supreme Court ruling that asked for non-telecom revenues to be included in calculating spectrum charges and licence fee at Rs 13,004 crore, the DoT puts the estimate at Rs 35,000 crore.

In case of Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL), the DoT is seeking over Rs 53,000 crore, while the company estimates its dues are Rs 21,533 crore.

""While we appreciate the matter is still sub judice, once the legal chapter is over, Bharti and VIL could (and should) disclose their self-assessment workings highlighting the areas of difference versus the DOT math. Even as this isn't a statutorily mandated disclosure, we believe the minority shareholders deserve to know,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a March 9 report.

Stating that there is a case for better disclosures on the math from both the DoT as well as the operators, it said a detailed explanation of the calculations post the closure of the legal proceedings is a must. ""It would go a long way in inspiring confidence among the minority investors.""

VIL has so far paid Rs 3,500 crore out of its self-assessed liability of Rs 21,533 crore, while Bharti Airtel has paid Rs 13,004 crore to the government in two installments. It had also deposited an additional Rs 5,000 crore as an ad-hoc payment to cover any reconciliation differences.

Similarly, Tata Teleservices has paid Rs 2,197 crore in dues, and more recently an additional Rs 2,000 crore to cover reconciliation differences, while the DoT estimates the liabilities to be about Rs 14,000 crore.

""At some level, it is baffling that something as basic and critical as the base of revenues on which as much as 12-13% of sector revenues are paid as regulatory levies stayed a matter of dispute on principles and calculations more than two decades after NTP-1999 (the telecom policy that established revenue share as a mechanism) was introduced and implemented,"" Kotak said.

It hoped that for the sake of minority investors, the telecom policy hereon leaves little room for such material disputes, and even when such disputes arise, they are settled (in or outside courts) in a more time-bound and reasonable manner.

""Regulatory certainty, at the very least confidence in no regulatory shocks, is a must for healthy investor sentiments in any regulated sector,"" it noted.

Total adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, including interest and penalty, as per the self-assessment exercise done by various telcos are 34.5 per cent of the DoT assessed provisional dues for Bharti, 40.6 per cent for VIL, and 16 per cent for TTSL.

""We do not have sufficient details to be sure of why the divergence. We do believe, however, that operators would have been extra cautious in their math given the Supreme Court's tough stance on the matter,"" the report said.

Kotak said Bharti and VIL made higher provisions for the dues in their Q2 FY20 earnings as they many not have had enough time post the Supreme Court's October 24, 2019 order to complete their self-assessments and adopted a conservative stance.

""They extrapolated the DOT's then-latest demand and made conservative provisions. We note that the companies were providing for certain amounts in their books even though the case was in various courts for past many years and the telcos had been given a favorable verdict from the TDSAT earlier.

""However, there is a large difference in the amounts, which is surprising. We suspect the telcos stayed confident of winning the case and never verified the earlier demands of the DOT or went into its detailed assessment,"" it added.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bharti-airtel--vodafone-idea-must-disclose-workings-used-to-arrive-at-govt-dues--report-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bharti-airtel--vodafone-idea-must-disclose-workings-used-to-arrive-at-govt-dues--report.html

Earlier on Saturday, Federal Bank had committed to investing Rs 300 crore in Yes Bank for subscription of its 30 crore shares.

The Centre on Saturday notified the YES Bank Limited Reconstruction Scheme, 2020, a day after the Union Cabinet approved a reconstruction plan proposed by the RBI for bailing out fund-starved Yes Bank.

The authorised capital of Yes Bank has been increased to Rs 6,200 crore, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.

As per the reconstruction scheme, moratorium on the troubled lender will be lifted on March 18.

Under the plan, state-run SBI will infuse Rs 7,250 crore in the crisis-ridden bank and take 49 per cent equity.

138,15-3-20,"Biden virtual town hall, new campaigning way","Joe Biden held a town hall in Illinois — or at least tried to — from 800 miles away in Delaware. Bernie Sanders is staging daily news conferences from Vermont, instead of his usual rallies around the country with thousands of supporters.

The global coronavirus pandemic has sent the 2020 presidential campaign into a virtual phase.

Big rallies and handshakes are out. Virtual phone banks and town halls are the new normal. Political parties and groups are canceling in-person gatherings.

States holding primaries in coming weeks have urged more voters to cast ballots by mail and extended hours for early voting centers in an effort to avoid election day crowds. On Friday, Louisiana’s Governor said he planned to postpone his state’s April 4 primary to June.

The Biden campaign scrapped plans for a Chicago rally ahead of Illinois’ on Tuesday primary due to warnings from public and health officials against large gatherings. Instead, the Democratic front-runner was supposed to take questions on Friday in a virtual town hall via Facebook live.

But it was a rocky start. The livestream started after Biden had begun speaking, cutting off his introduction, and at one point Biden — holding a cell phone in his hand — turned and walked partially off camera, so viewers could no longer see his face. The stream lasted less than five minutes before wrapping up, with the campaign apologising for “technical difficulties.”

“I’m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,” Biden said after answering a question about protecting endangered species. “There’s a lot more to say but I’ve already probably said too much to you.”

Sanders, Biden’s rival for the Democratic nomination, has been holding daily press briefings from his home state, where he has blasted President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the virus. Biden did the same in an address Thursday.

Speaking to reporters Friday, Sanders was subdued — the emotional opposite of the big rallies that have helped fuel his support at the polls. He drew over 10,000 people at a Chicago rally on Saturday, before officials starting warning against large events. Sanders said his team has mastered the use of internet campaigning, livestreaming almost all of its events already.

COVID-19 causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people. It can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with existing health problems. Most people recover from it.

142,15-3-20,New B’desh ODI skipper Tamim pleads for time,"Newly-appointed Bangladesh one-day international cricket captain Tamim Iqbal on Saturday pleaded for time in order to make a difference in his role.

Tamim was appointed last week replacing Mashrafe Mortaza, who stepped down following a three-match series against Zimbabwe.

“You have to keep patient. Our fans also have to keep patient. I will try to do whatever it takes for the best interest of the team,” Tamim told reporters in Dhaka in his first public interaction following the appointment.

“I am taking over from someone — it’s tough to go to his level straight away. I know it very well. He led us for so many years. We achieved many things under him. It will be unfair if you expect me to go to his level,” he said.

Mashrafe has a cult status in Bangladesh for his role taking the team from being international underachievers to a respected limited-overs side. He led Bangladesh to 50 wins in 88 matches, making him the country’s most successful one-day captain.

Tamim captained Bangladesh in three ODIs against Sri Lanka in July last year in the absence of the injured Mashrafe, but failed to inspire the team, with Bangladesh losing all three matches.

“If in six months, one year or one-and-a-half years I cannot do anything for the team I will not keep the captaincy,” he said.

His fresh tenure as the ODI captain will start with a one-off match against Pakistan on April 1.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board appointed Tamim as part of a plan for World Cup 2023 but the left-hander said he was not thinking that far ahead at the moment.

“If the team does well, I do well, I will start thinking of 2023. At the moment my concentration is on doing a few things right,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/new-b---desh-odi-skipper-tamim-pleads-for-time.html

148,15-3-20,"New rockets target Iraq base where US, UK troops killed","A fresh spate of rockets targeted an Iraqi base north of Baghdad on Saturday where foreign troops are deployed, Iraqi and US security sources told AFP, in a rare daytime attack.

It was the 23rd such attack since late October on installations across Iraq where American troops and diplomats are based, with the latest rounds growing deadlier.

None of the attacks have ever been claimed but the US has blamed hardline elements of the Hashed al-Shaabi, a network of armed groups incorporated into the Iraqi state.

At least 33 rockets hit Iraqi air defence units at the Taji air base on Saturday, the country’s military said, in one of the largest such volleys yet.

“The initial toll is two wounded Iraqi Air Defence personnel who are in very critical condition,” said Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for Iraq’s Joint Operations Command. The US-led coalition said three of its members were also wounded in the attack.

Iraq’s military said it had found another 24 missiles at a nearby launching site and had detained the owner of the plot of land as well as security forces from an adjacent checkpoint for questioning.

The US-led coalition’s surveillance capabilities have been impaired by cloudy weather in recent days, which a US official said may have contributed to the attackers’ readiness to launch the rockets during the day instead of under the cover of night. Taji is overcrowded with members of the US-led coalition helping Iraq fight jihadist remnants, after units were moved to the air base from other installations.

It came three days after a similar attack on the base killed two American military personnel and a British soldier -- the deadliest such incident at an Iraqi base in years. The US responded Friday with air strikes on arms depots it said were used by Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-aligned faction within the Hashed.

At least five members of Iraq’s security forces and one civilian were killed, none of them members of the Hashed, according to Iraq’s military. Iraq has long feared it would get caught in the spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, its two main allies.

They dramatically spiked in late 2019 when a US contractor was killed in a rocket attack on a separate base in northern Iraq, leading to retaliatory American strikes on Kataeb Hezbollah.

Days later, a US drone strike killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

Iran launched ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq while the Iraqi parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from its soil, a decision that has yet to be implemented.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/new-rockets-target-iraq-base-where-us--uk-troops-killed.html
149,15-3-20,Muslims still feel unsafe a year after NZ massacre,"Aliya Danzeisen rises before dawn every day to hear the news so she can prepare her school-age daughters for any harassment they may face for being Muslim.

“We don’t feel any safer,” the Muslim community leader says, reflecting on the 12 months since the Christchurch mosque attacks, in which a self-declared white supremacist killed 51 Muslims at Friday prayers. The abuse experienced prior to the attacks on March 15 last year died down immediately after the killings, Danzeisen said, adding: “It felt the entire New Zealand population was rallying behind us.”

But she says it is now on the rise again, a year on from the killings that rattled the normally peaceful South Pacific nation, with unease among the Muslim community amid ongoing vitriol and threats.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern -- who received widespread praise for her handling of the aftermath of the massacre -- admitted Friday there was “much more” her country could do to tackle white supremacists.

“I wouldn’t say it’s specifically just us, but we’re feeling it.” Muslim women who wear headscarves were targeted “because they think we’re vulnerable and can’t fight back”, she said.

Sparked by deadly repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests, the conflict has drawn in outside powers in a complex war involving rebel factions, jihadist groups and foreign interests.

As the war enters its 10th year, the government of President Bashar al-Assad now controls more than 70 percent of Syrian territory, thanks to the military support of its allies Russia, Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

The conflict is the “worst man-made disaster since World War II,” the United Nations human rights chief declared in 2017. The war has destroyed the economy and caused more than 11 million Syrians to flee their homes.

According to the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources in Syria, the latest death toll includes about 22,000 children and 13,000 women.

At least 129,476 Syrian soldiers, allied forces and militiamen have died, according to the Britain-based war monitor, including 1,697 members of Hezbollah.

Nearly 57,000 rebels have died, as well as 13,624 members of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which spearheaded the US-backed campaign against the Islamic State group, the Observatory said.

The Observatory tallied 67,296 deaths among jihadists loyal to IS or to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance led by a former Al-Qaeda affiliate that dominates the last rebel enclave in the Idlib region in the northwest.

The death toll included 421 unidentified victims.

After recent government advances, Idlib province is the last battleground between government forces, and the jihadists and their rebel allies.

Damascus launched an offensive to take the region in December, causing close to one million people to flee, according to the United Nations, before Ankara and Moscow negotiated a ceasefire earlier this month.

NGOs continue to denounce human rights abuses by the Syrian government, including lethal chemical attacks, torture and arbitrary arrest.

Tens of thousands of people have been subject to forced disappearances by the government or a myriad of armed groups, NGOs report.

The war has destroyed infrastructure and crucial sectors of the economy including the oil industry.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/syria-death-toll-3-84-000-after-nine-years-of-war--monitor.html

153,15-3-20,Oly to go ahead despite virus havoc: Japan PM,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday resisted pressure for changes to the Tokyo Olympics schedule even as sporting events worldwide fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic.

Abe pledged Japan would host the Games as planned in July and said he had no immediate intention to declare a state of emergency over the virus outbreak.

His comments come two days after US President Donald Trump suggested the Japanese capital postpone the Games for a year as the spread of the virus wreaks havoc on the sporting calendar.

“We will respond by closely coordinating with officials concerned, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee). There is no change in this,” Abe told news conference.

“We want to hold the Olympics as planned without any trouble by overcoming the spread of infections,” he said.

Organisers, Japanese government officials and the IOC have insisted preparations are on track and there will be no postponement or cancellation.

On Friday, Abe and Trump spoke on the phone about the outbreak and Olympics after Trump proposed a delay.

“We agreed that Japan and the US will cooperate and closely coordinate for success in the Olympics,” Abe said, adding they had not discussed any postponement.

The Japanese parliament on Friday approved legislation that gives Abe the power to declare a state of emergency to combat COVID-19 but Abe insisted such a declaration was not yet necessary.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/oly-to-go-ahead-despite-virus-havoc--japan-pm.html
154,15-3-20,ATK clinch record 3rd title,"A rampaging ATK claimed an unprecedented third Indian Super League title triumph with a 3-1 victory over arch-rival Chennaiyin FC in a summit showdown that was played behind closed doors in Goa on Saturday.

Javier Hernandez (10th) and Edu Garcia (48th) put ATK in the driving seat but Nerijus Valskis (69th) reduced their advantage to set up a tense end to the contest.

Hernandez scored another in injury time (90+4th) to confirm a record third title.

ATK drew first blood with their first major sight of goal in the 10th minute. John Johnson’s cross-field ball found Roy Krishna on the left flank who delivered a good cross towards the edge of the box.

Javier Hernandez, who was left unmarked, smashed a half-volley into the ground and beat goalkeeper Vishal Kaith to give ATK the lead.

The contest remained open but Chennaiyin suffered an injury setback midway through the first half. Midfielder Germanpreet Singh had to be replaced and Edwin Vanspaul took his place.

ATK went close to doubling their lead in the 23rd minute out of utter chaos inside the box which produced three back-to-back attempts. Krishna cut in from the right and unleashed a powerful strike which was saved by Kaith.

Javier Hernandez then had the ball at his feet twice, but on both occasions, his shot was blocked.

The scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of ATK at the break, but the Kolkata side had a concern of their own as Krishna had to be replaced by Mandi Sosa due to an injury.

ATK scored the all-important second goal and doubled their advantage two minutes into the second half. Williams picked up the ball in midfield and fed Edu Garcia into the box. The Spanish midfielder beat Kaith with neat finish from acute angle to make it 2-0.

Chennaiyin found a way past the ATK defence in the 69th minute. Laldinliana Renthlei played a neat one-two with Anirudh Thapa on the right before sending a cross into centre of the box.

Pritam Kotal’s headed clearance fell to Jerry Lalrinzuala who passed the ball to Valskis in the centre. The Lithuanian striker found the net with a powerful strike to score his 15th goal of the season and give Chennaiyin a lifeline.

ATK got their third goal of the night and struck the final blow in the last minute of injury time. Substitute Pronay Halder lifted the ball over the Chennaiyin defence into the path of Hernandez who slotted the ball home.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/atk-clinch-record-3rd-title.html
155,15-3-20,No one knows when IPL will start: feel owners,"A curtailed Indian Premier League was one of the options discussed at Saturday’s meeting between BCCI and the eight IPL franchise owners in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic even as Kings XI Punjab’s Ness Wadia said that he doesn’t know when the T20 event will commence.

“We cannot and no one, you know, is in a position today to say when it’s going to start. We will review the situation after two to three weeks. And hopefully by then the cases will reduce,” Wadia told reporters after IPL owners’ meeting with BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah.

A Board source, however, stuck to listing the options that were discussed at the meeting.

“There were six to seven options discussed during the meeting between team owners and BCCI including a curtailed IPL,” the source said.

“The second option right now is that teams could be divided into two groups of four and then top four go into the play-offs. The third option is increase of double headers (played on weekdays),” the source informed.

The fourth option is holding all matches in just a couple of centres with restricted movements of players, support staff and TV crew.

Another option is to play behind closed doors and have all the 60 games in a shorter time frame which will ensure that the stakeholders do not lose out truckloads of money.

The source also confirmed that shifting the tournament abroad was not discussed at all in the meeting.

Wadia said: “BCCI, IPL and (official broadcaster) Star (Sports) are clear that we are not looking at financial loss.”

“At the meeting everyone agreed that human beings come first and finance comes second. We are here to adhere to governments directives. I don’t see anything being decided before the end of the month. We have to wait and watch and hope situation improves,” Wadia further said.

“No decision can be taken until there is clarity. Clarity will only be in two three weeks. As far as your next question is will foreign players come on? I don’t know. There is a ban till the April 15 and then we’ll see. So if IPL happens, great if it doesn’t happen, so be it,” Wadia further added.

Delhi Capitals owner Parth Jindal tried to downplay the discussion on options and said that there will be another meeting later to discuss other modalities.

“As things progress and evolve, BCCI will call for another meeting to discuss all the options. Today’s meeting was to tell us that they are watching the situation, all of us are watching and we will take a call in due course,” said Jindal.

Asked whether there will be more double-headers the season, Jindal said, “We didn’t discuss anything, we need to assess the situation and the health and safety of public is most important consideration. “Ones the situation comes under control all the options can be discussed.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-one-knows-when-ipl-will-start--feel-owners.html

In his opening address, Prime Minister Modi said the South Asian region has reported less than 150 coronavirus cases, but ""we need to remain vigilant"".

""Prepare, but don't panic"" has been India's guiding mantra in dealing with coronavirus outbreak, he said.

""We started screening people entering India from mid-January itself, while gradually increasing restrictions on travel,"" Modi said.

162,15-3-20,Palm reader told me SP will win 350 seats in 2022 UP elections: Akhilesh Yadav,"SP president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said a palm reader had recently predicted that he will win 350 of the 403 seats in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections and asserted that if voted to power, his government will hold a caste-wise census.

Speaking to reporters here at the party office, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, ""While going to Delhi on a flight, a person saw my palms and told me that if I work hard, I will form the next government by winning 350 seats.""

""I have decided that we will win one seat more than 350... Together we will win 351 seats in the 2022 Assembly elections,"" he added.

Hitting out at the ruling BJP, Yadav said if the saffron party can win 300 seats in the state by spreading lies, the Samajwadi Party can win 351 seats by working honestly.

""If the BJP can spread lies and win 300 seats, then we through our honest hardwork can win 351 seats. We will definitely achieve this,"" he said.

In the 2017 Assembly polls, the BJP-led NDA won 325 seats with 48.7 per cent votes, the SP won 47 seats with 21.8 per cent votes and the Bahujan Samaj Party won 19 seats with 22.2 per cent votes.

Yadav further said if the Centre does not go for caste-wise census, then the SP will conduct it in Uttar Pradesh after winning the 2022 Assembly polls.

""What is reason that they (BJP) are not going for caste-wise census. A number of problems in the society will be resolved if it is done... We will devise a way so that every community is allotted resources according to its population size,"" he said.

Attacking chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Yadav said, ""Yogi does not like the country's Constitution which secures the rights of Dalits and those belonging to the deprived and backward sections of the society. The BJP is attacking the Constitution.""

On the upcoming third anniversary of Adityanath government, Yadav claimed Uttar Pradesh was lagging behind in terms of providing quality education and health services, while corruption was rampant in the mid-day meal scheme.

The SP chief also declared that his party will not contest the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, and will only support the winning candidates.

As far as West Bengal election is concerned, the strategy will be prepared in consultation with party vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda, he said.

On this occasion, several BSP leaders including former MP Balihari Babu, former minister Tilak Chand Ahirwar, and former MLAs Feran Lal Ahirwar and Anil Ahirwar joined the SP.

The leaders claimed that due to the wrong policies of the BSP, they felt insulted and therefore decided to quit the party.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/palm-reader-told-me-sp-will-win-350-seats-in-2022-up-elections--akhilesh-yadav-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/palm-reader-told-me-sp-will-win-350-seats-in-2022-up-elections--akhilesh-yadav.html

The Indian Cricket Board on Friday postponed the start of this year’s IPL from March 29 to April 15 in wake of the pandemic, which has caused massive upheaval across the globe.

Asked if the cash-rich event could be a curtailed one, Ganguly said, “It will happen, because if it is April 15, then, in any case 15 days are gone, it has to be truncated. How truncated, how many games, I can’t say at the moment.”

Ganguly was speaking to reporters after the end of the IPL Governing Council meeting here.

The Board’s top boss reiterated that safety is their top priority, a day after the IPL was postponed and the three-match ODI series between India and South Africa called off.

“We will monitor further. Safety is most important and with the current situation with what is going around the world and in India, with government directives, we have even postponed the remaining domestic matches.”

In the meeting between the franchise owners and the BCCI brass, six to seven options were discussed, including a curtailed IPL “We met with the owners, to tell them how it can happen and where do we stand at the moment. At the moment, it is just postponed. We will assess the situation,” Ganguly said.

“It will be reassessed every week. I can’t say at the moment (about any deadline). I has to be worked around. As much as we want to host the IPL, we also need to be careful about the security.”

165,15-3-20,"We were better side, paid price of poor finishing, says Chennaiyin FC head coach Coyle","Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle rued his side's missed chances in their 1-3 defeat against ATK in the Indian Super League summit clash that cost them a third title.

Chennaiyin failed to give their magical turnaround in this ISL the desired fairytale ending, and Coyle minced no words that his side played better than ATK in the final held here without spectators on Saturday due to COVID-19 pandemic.

""Goals change games. We had a few easy chances in initial phase but could not take them. No one should tell me they (ATK) were the better team. My disappointment is for how much my team put into the game. But ultimately if you don't take your chances, you give away soft goals,"" he said.

""We were the team that played all the football. To be fair to them they stuck to their task. They made it tough for us by banging the ball forward. The spoils went to ATK so all the very best to them. We were the team who kept pushing on, but they were clinical and we were not,"" Coyle added.

The 53-year-old Irish coach said ATK must be relieved to have won the final and the title given that Chhenaiyin had more possession and goal-scoring chances.

""We had almost 70% possession but ultimately if you don't take your chances, it will come back to haunt you. There were two things from our perspective. One, we were not clinical enough with our chances and second, I felt ATK's last two goals were certainly avoidable,"" he said.

""I think ATK will be very relieved to get away with the trophy given what we brought to the game. But that is how football is at the highest level.""

Coyle praised ATK goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja despite he was being the thorn in Chennaiyin's flesh by saving some crucial saves.

""However, I have to say ATK's goal in the first half was a wonderful finish and credit to them. The man of the match for me was their goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja. He was truly outstanding. I have to give credit to ATK for winning,"" he said.

Despite the disappointing stumble in the final hurdle, it has been a season to remember for the Marina Machans who made it to the summit clash after languishing near the bottom of the table midway into the season.

Coyle took up the reigns of the team in December last year after John Gregory was sacked for winning just one game out of the first six -- against tail-enders Hyderabad FC. Under Coyle, Chennaiyin FC suffered only two defeats in 14 matches before the final against ATK.

""My feelings go out to my group of players, because those players, particularly the young players, they have done so much. They have been a joy to watch. I really feel for them. They love their club. I feel disappointed for them. It is a tough night to lose and it is important to recognize the players who have done very well.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/we-were-better-side--paid-price-of-poor-finishing--says-chennaiyin-fc-head-coach-coyle-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/we-were-better-side--paid-price-of-poor-finishing--says-chennaiyin-fc-head-coach-coyle.html
166,15-3-20,I respect BCCI's decision and accept it as professional: Manjrekar,"Dropped from the BCCI commentary panel for the South Africa ODI series, former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar on Sunday said he always considered commentating a privilege and accepted the decision as a professional.

One of the most accomplished voices among Indian experts, Manjrekar, who got embroiled in controversies in recent years for some of his views on air, was axed from the BCCI's commentary panel for the South Africa series recently.

""I have always considered commentary as a great privilege, but never an entitlement,"" the 54-year-old wrote on his twitter handle.

""It is up to my employers whether they choose to have me or not & I will always respect that. Maybe BCCI has not been happy with my performance of late. I accept that as a professional.""

Manjrekar, who played 37 Tests and 74 ODIs for India, had courted controversy during last year's World Cup when he termed Ravindra Jadeja a ""bits and pieces cricketer"", something that didn't go well with the Saurashtra all-rounder, who questioned the Mumbaikar's cricketing credentials.

Manjrekar later admitted that he was off the mark with his unsavoury analysis of Jadeja's cricketing prowess.

He was also panned on social media for his on-air comment about fellow commentator Harsha Bhogle during the 'Pink Test' when he questioned the latter's credibility since he hasn't played at the highest level. Manjrekar had to apologise for that also.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-respect-bcci-s-decision-and-accept-it-as-professional--manjrekar-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/i-respect-bcci-s-decision-and-accept-it-as-professional--manjrekar.html

170,15-3-20,"J&K to get domicile policy, says Amit Shah","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday announced that the government will formulate a domicile policy for Jammu & Kashmir, a demand many have made since the revocation of its special status last year.

He gave this assurance to a 24-member delegation of the newly formed Apni Party led by Altaf Bukhari in New Delhi.

The Home Minister assured the delegation that Jammu and Kashmir will have a better domicile policy than other states in the country and a reasonable economic development policy will be drafted soon after widespread consultation, official sources told IANS.

The government, Shah said, will not discriminate in the implementation of Central laws in J&K.

Sources said Shah discussed around 40 different issues raised by the delegation and reassured them that the government had no intention to change the demographics in the region. ""All such talks have no basis at all,"" Shah told the group of Kashmiri politicians.

Sources said the Home Minister also revealed that an industrial policy for rapid economic development will soon be announced. A land bank has already been created, he told the delegation, adding he was hoping that J&K will draw three times more investment than what the state drew in the last seven decades.

""In the last 70 years, J&K received around Rs 13,000 crore investment. That will solve the problem of unemployment in the region,"" he said.

Shah also said that a commission for reservations for nomadic and tribal communities will be set up soon in J&K. The Home Minister assured the delegation that he will direct the Lieutenant Governor of J&K to appoint a nodal person to meet the aggrieved people twice a week.

Reiterating Prime Minister Modi's statement that the government will work with all sections of the society to realize the hopes of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir at an early opportunity. He recalled that Prime Minister had made the commitment in his address to the nation after abrogation of Article 370 and he, himself repeated it in the Lok Sabha on August 6, last year.

Referring to freeing the detainees from preventive detention, restoration of internet, relaxation in curfew, Shah said: ""Even political prisoners will be freed in times to come as the main objective of the government is that not a single person should die, be it a common Kashmiri or security personnel.""

On J&K Bank, Shah assured the delegation that he would personally look into the problems and that the issues on the bureaucratic front and loopholes in general administration will be resolved on a fast-track basis.

Shah said he will also ask the LG to appoint a nodal person to meet the people twice a week. He also asked the delegation to provide feedback on the problems and their redress and said that his government is open to suggestions.

The meeting was attended by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and other senior Home Ministry officials.

After the meeting Altaf Bukhari said his party came here with a message from people of Jammu and Kashmir to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. ""We did share our difficulties and apprehensions,"" he said.

The outfit, including political leaders from a wide spectrum, but all considered traditionally close to New Delhi, was launched on March 8.

At the launch in Srinagar, the Apni Party said it was willing to move beyond Article 370 and engage with New Delhi.

Mainstream politics in the Valley has been in a state of paralysis since August 5, when the Centre scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, and split it into two Union territories, and put the top leadership in detention.

172,15-3-20,‘Need to be extra careful with kids’,"He is known for rib-tickling dialogues and one of the pioneers to introduce comedy in hosting. MANIESH PAUL speaks with MUSBA HASHMI about what attracted him to Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L’il Champs Season 8

What made you say yes?

I have had a long relation with Zee TV. I started my career with the channel and have done some amazing work. This time when I got a call to host Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L’il Champs, I had no reason to say ‘no’. I thought that it’s a good platform to be on. Also, I have never hosted any season of the show. Adding to that, it is one of the longest running shows — running for 25 years now. These are some of the reasons why I came on board the show.

Do you have to be extra careful while hosting kids based shows?

Absolutely. Whenever I host, I make sure that none of my jokes are cheap or below the belt. That’s one of my plus points. And obviously, when kids are around, I have to be extra careful because they do look up to us. Whatever we do, they repeat. Not only me, everyone on the sets are extremely careful. We always try that kids should learn something good from us. Another thing that we take care of is to teach kids that it is not only about winning or losing. Not everyone will be the winner but everyone can learn something good here.

Were you always interested in hosting?

I always wanted to get into the entertainment industry. But I had no idea that I would end up becoming a host. When I came to Mumbai, I took whatever that was offered to me that time. Some people tell me that they never thought that I would reach such heights and I tell them ‘ki aap bol rahe ho toh ho sakta hai main yaha tak pohocha hoga, par mainey iss bare me kabhi socha nahin hai’. I don’t think about such things, I just want to focus on my work and do better everyday. I love what I do.

A lesson learnt in the industry?

One needs to be extremely patient and have to work with the same dedication each and every time. There is no scope of taking any day lightly. You have to be very sincere. I have done so much of work and explored different mediums but there was not even a single day when I thought of relaxing or being insincere towards my work. I still wake up with the same passion that I had when I first came to Mumbai.

Any challenges that you have to go through?

I don’t see anything as struggle. I call it the learning period. I came to Mumbai without having any support or clue of what I will be doing next. But God has been kind to me that I gradually made my way.

The audience has been kind to me. They loved and appreciated my work. I have seen days when I had no work and I have seen those days too when I had a lot of work. It’s all a part and parcel of life.

How supportive was your family of your decision of being a part of the industry?

My family has been extremely supportive throughout. I come from a family where no one has ever been in the entertainment industry. My father is a chartered accountant. A lot of people asked him what am I doing and why. But he was firm in his opinion that I should pursue what I want to. It is their love and support that has got me here.

Some best moment from your journey.

There are many. But to name one, meeting Amitabh Bachchan in the initial days of my career. I was hosting an award show when I met him. Then I went on hosting an episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati with him. Apart from that, working with Salman sir, Shah Rukh sir and Akshay sir has been some of my big achievements. I had never thought that I would meet these superstars someday.

What is your approach towards comedy?

There is no such approach. I don’t think about it too seriously. Only thing that I keep mind is to do the kind of work that my mother can watch proudly. I don’t want to do anything that would make my parents feel ashamed of me or my work.

Are you similar to what we get to see on screen?

Yes. I am more or less the similar person. Main ekdum mast aadmi hoon. When I am with my family — my wife and two children, I am like a family man. When I am working, I am very serious about it. I like keeping everyone around me happy because that gives me a lot of positive vibes.

What is there in the pipeline?

I have just finished shooting for a film Vijaynagar for an OTT platform. It is my web debut. I am also in talks for a lot of projects for some other OTT platforms. Apart from that I am doing Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L’il Champs. There are couple of more projects in the pipeline and people will get to know about it soon.",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/---need-to-be-extra-careful-with-kids----2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/---need-to-be-extra-careful-with-kids---.html

I would like to work with him in future projects as well.”

ankit to play grey character

Sony Entertainment Television's thriller drama Beyhadh 2 is not going off-air and the audiences can’t be more happy. Like its previous season, this time too the show is getting tremendous response from the audience. The show has become a topic of discussion due to its gorgeous sets and superb presentation of the characters. As the show is taking so many unexpected twists and turns, to add to the suspense and thrill, there is a new character that is going to be introduced in it. This character is going to change the whole plot and will give a new turn to Maya’s play of taking revenge from MJ.

To add more spice to the show, actor Ankit Siwach, will soon be making an entry in the show. He will be seen playing a negative role for the first time; Vikram Jai Singh, opposite Jennifer Winget.

Talking about his role Siwach shared: “Vikram happens to be one of the pivotal parts of Maya’s life when she was going through the trauma 10 years ago, caused by MJ. Vikram and Maya share a past which didn’t turn out well and now Vikram has come back in to Maya’s life. He is hurt and has returned for revenge. He is in immense pain brought upon him by Maya, which he is now going to channel against her. Vikram is a sorted character but as he is quite engrossed in seeking revenge, there are layers of grey in him. My character will add to the drama and make the show spicier.”

He further added: “I am quite excited to play this character as for the first time, I am playing a grey character which is completely negative with no signs of positivity. The show is a brand in itself and I will be sharing screen space with Jennifer, about which I am really excited and happy. Every character in the show is defined and it gives immense space for creativity and it’s interesting to play along with it.”

It will be interesting to see what turns the show is going to take with this new entry.

shweta suffers burns

Television’s one of the most popular names, Shweta Tiwari, has been winning hearts with her portrayal as Guneet Sikka in Sony Entertainment Television’s show, Mere Dad Ki Dulhan. While she had a lot of fun shooting with Fahmaan Khan for the bad date ritual scene, where she recreated the scene from Jab We Met, she burned her hands while doing that.

To forget about No Drama Please standing her up for the date, Randeep (Fahmaan Khan) suggested Guneet that she should let out her frustration by burning the saree and scarf she wore for the date. While shooting the sequence, they sure had a lot of fun recreating the scene from Jab We Met, where Geet makes Aditya burn her ex’s photograph and flush it. However, while shooting the scene, the fire went blazing partially burning Shweta’s hands. The fire caught on to the curtains and Shweta in an attempt to curb the fire, ended up getting burns.

After shooting the scene, Fahmaan said: “It was fun doing the bad date ritual scene with Shweta ma’am. It was quite a stress buster for us. But the sad part is, she ended up burning her hand a little while ceasing the fire. Everyone thought she was improvising in the scene, but she had partially burned her hands in the process.”",show-time,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/tellytale-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/show-time/tellytale-tellytale-2020-03-15.html
175,15-3-20,Heavy stress may shorten our life expectancy,"If you are taking too much stress, read this carefully. Researchers have found that life expectancy is influenced not only by the traditional lifestyle-related risk factors, but also by factors related to a person's quality of life, such as heavy stress.

The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, was based on data collected from men and women aged 25 to 74 in the Finnish National FINRISK Study 1987-2007 through questionnaires and measurements. The rate of mortality was followed until the end of 2014.

For the findings, the researchers calculated the effects of multiple risk factors, including lifestyle-related ones, to the life expectancy of men and women.

""Before, life expectancy has usually been assessed based on only a few sociodemographic background factor groups, such as age, sex, and education. In this study, we wanted to assess the impact of several different factors to a person's life expectancy, so we could compare their effects,"" said study researcher Tommi Harkanen from National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland.

The researchers calculated the life expectancies by changing the values of each risk factor at a time and keeping the values of other factors constant.

Only the BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels were allowed to be changed when the values related to lifestyle factors were changed.

They found that the biggest causes for shortened life expectancy for 30-year-old men are smoking and diabetes. Smoking takes 6.6 years and diabetes 6.5 years out of their life expectancy.

Being under heavy stress shortens their life expectancy by 2.8 years, the study said.

The research also revealed that a lack of exercise strongly reduced the life expectancy of 30-year-old men -- by 2.4 years.

On the other hand, things such as the consumption of plenty of fruits and vegetables could increase life expectancy: eating fruit by 1.4 years and eating vegetables by 0.9 years.

The same factors impacted the life expectancy of both men and women.

For 30-year-old women, e.g. smoking shortened the life expectancy by 5.5 years, diabetes by 5.3 years, and heavy stress by 2.3 years. The effects to the life expectancy of older people were similar but smaller than in younger age groups.

Differences between the life expectancies of men and women largely due to risk factors that can be changed, according to the researchers.

""What was interesting about the study was how small the difference in the life expectancy of 30-year men and women was based on the same risk factor values -- only 1.6 years,"" said study researcher Seppo Koskinen.

The lifestyle choices that increase mortality, such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise, are most common in the population groups whose social position is the weakest, the study said.

177,15-3-20,"China reports 10 new deaths due to coronavirus, 'imported' cases rise to 111","China on Sunday reported 10 more fatalities due to the novel coronavirus, taking the death toll to 3,199, while the imported cases rose to 111 amid sharp decline in the number of domestic cases.

China's National Health Commissions (NHC) said 20 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 10 deaths were reported from all over the country on Saturday.

Only four new domestic cases were detected, all in Hubei province's capital Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged in December before growing into a national crisis and a pandemic.

All the 10 deaths were in Wuhan, bringing the national toll from the disease in mainland China to 3,199.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,778 by the end of Saturday, including 3,199 people who died of the disease in the last three months, 10,734 patients still undergoing treatment and 66,911 patients discharged after recovery, it said.

Sixteen imported cases were reported on the mainland Saturday. Among them, five were reported in Beijing, four in Zhejiang Province, three in both Shanghai and Gansu Province, as well as one in Guangdong Province. By the end of Saturday, 111 imported cases had been reported, NHC said.

By the end of Saturday, 141 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in Hong Kong Special, 10 confirmed cases in the Macao and 53 in Taiwan including one death.

China's Ministry of Education has announced that though the COVID-19 is slowing down, schools won't resume until local authorities put the virus outbreak under control and roll out necessary containment measures.

Wang Dengfeng, director of the ministry's working group on epidemic control, said local authorities shall consult experts before reopening schools and safety of the faculty members should be ensured.

Resumption would be prioritised for the graduating classes in middle and high school, as they were supposed to sit for the high school or college entrance examination in about 80 days, he was quoted as saying by China Central Television.

Wang said that the ministry is seeking advice from related departments as well as representatives of students and parents on whether to postpone the college entrance exams and the decisions will be made soon.

Local authorities are entitled to decide whether to postpone the exam for high school candidates, state-run China Daily reported on Saturday.

178,15-3-20,"Now, corona to be treated as disaster","Virus cases rise to 84; 2 dead, 10 discharged so far

Against the backdrop of increasing coronavirus cases that reached 84 and a couple of resultant deaths, the Centre on Saturday decided to treat the viral infection as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

However, it did a flip-flop on the issue with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) first announcing a payment of Rs 4 lakh as ex-gratia to the family of a person who loses life due to coronavirus or is involved in relief operations or associated in response activities, only to come up with a “partially modified” notification later with no provision at all for any monetary compensation to individuals.

“Grants earmarked under the State Disaster Response Fund can be utilised to procure essential equipment and take measures to quarantine people in order to combat the coronavirus outbreak,” said the two-page modified directive to all States, specifying list of items eligible for SDRF and norms of assistance. The total number of 84 confirmed cases includes 17 foreigners — 16 Italian tourists and a Canadian with two deaths from Karnataka and Delhi having been reported.

A 71-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia and was suspected to have coronavirus infection died during treatment in Maharashtra’s Buldhana district on Saturday afternoon. The Government is waiting for his lab reports to confirm the death due to the virus infection. He was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure.

Taking no chance, the Lok Sabha Secretariat suspended issuing public gallery passes and entry for show around in Parliament while the Padma Award ceremony, scheduled to be held on April 3 at Rashtrapati Bhavan, has been postponed. The next date and time will be announced in due course, said the Government.

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter to share the Health Ministry’s guidelines on home quarantine, a medical officer was placed under suspension for allegedly refusing surveillance duty to monitor suspected coronavirus cases placed under home quarantine in Jammu & Kashmir’s Poonch district. But there are also cases of COVID19-affected patients being discharged after their treatment and recovery. In all, 10 patients, three from Kerala earlier, have been treated and discharged so far.

Sajneeva Kumar, Special Secretary in the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday that seven persons who tested positive, including five from Uttar Pradesh and one each from Rajasthan and Delhi, have been discharged after treatment. As for cases, Delhi has reported six positive cases and Uttar Pradesh 11 so far. Karnataka has six coronavirus patients, Maharashtra 14 and Ladakh three while Jammu and Kashmir reported two cases. Besides, Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab have reported one case each.

Kerala has recorded 19 cases, including three patients who were discharged last month after they recovered from the contagious infection.

Similarly, two persons who had returned from Dubai have been found to test positive for coronavirus in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal. However, the Centre is yet to confirm.

The Special Secretary said all essential facilities like community surveillance, quarantine, isolation wards, adequate PPEs, trained manpower, rapid response teams are being strengthened further in all states and UTs while evacuation process of citizens in other countries is going on.

He informed that a Mahan Air flight bringing back Indian passengers from Iran will land in Mumbai on Saturday midnight. A special Air India flight is also being sent to Milan in Italy on Saturday to bring back Indian students.

With rise in cases, more and more States came forward to intensify precautionary measures to contain the virus’ spread. For instance, if West Bengal sealed its border with Bhutan and closed all its educational institutions till March 31, Himachal Pradesh on Saturday announced closure of all educational institutions and cinema halls till March 31. Kerala and Haryana governments on Saturday imposed restrictions on visitors entry at malls, gyms and beaches and warned people not to venture out of their homes unless necessary. Goa joined the bandwagon in shutting down public places like shopping malls, casinos and pubs till further orders.

Similarly, a day after closure of all educational institutions in the state till March 31, the Punjab government on Saturday ordered a shut down of cinema halls and banned public gatherings including cultural events till further notice to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Aligarh Muslims University suspended all classes, including sessional tests, till March 22 while the Infosys in Bengaluru evacuated one of its satellite office buildings following reports of its employee coming in contact with a suspected coronavirus patient.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/now--corona-to-be-treated-as-disaster-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/now--corona-to-be-treated-as-disaster.html
179,15-3-20,"450 returnees missing in Punjab, Andhra","In a matter of serious concern and one that could pose a grave public hazard, nearly 450 persons with travel history to Covid-19 affected countries are untraceable in just Punjab and Andhra Pradesh.

Reports of affected patients escaping from hospitals have also come in from Nagpur and Ludhiana even as the authorities tracked down the affected Google employee’s wife, who had fled Bengaluru, to Agra. She, too, has since tested positive. “As many as 335 passengers with travel history to the coronavirus affected countries are untraceable,” said Health and Family Welfare Department of Punjab on Saturday.

In Andhra Pradesh too, the medical and health department officials are on the lookout for 102 persons, who came in contact with people with suspected Covid-19 infection and are traceless.

Of the 666 people in the State with a travel history to coronavirus-affected nations, 102 are ‘untraceable’, officials said, adding that of the 564 persons under observation, 233 have crossed the observation period of 28 days.

“A total of 6,011 passengers have been traced till March 13,” as per the statement issued by the State which also shared that around 90 people have been screened for the virus out of which one has been tested positive and 85 have been tested negative. The result of the remaining four people is still awaited. The State police, on Friday marked seven people, suspected of having the coronavirus, as missing after their whereabouts remained unknown.

As of now, 331 persons are still under observation, 12 persons are admitted to various hospitals in the state, and the remaining are under home observation, said KS Jawahar Reddy, special chief secretary (health), Andhra Pradesh.

As many as 55 samples were tested, of which 47 came out negative while one turned out to be positive. The test results of the remaining seven are pending.

“We are making extra efforts with support of other departments to trace them. The untraced cases are due to either not having phone numbers or residential address. Medical and health officials are also collecting data from airport authorities, ports and a few others departments to trace the 102 ‘missing’ persons,” Reddy added.

However, much to the relief of the authorities, in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram, a couple from the United States who had symptoms linked to the deadly infections were traced to Kochi international airport and put under isolation after they had fled the Alappuzha Medical College.

The couple, US citizens who live in London, reached Kochi on March 9 and stayed at a resort in Varkala. Their flight was from London to Doha and then Kochi. The couple also used private taxis to commute.

However, when they developed symptoms of viral, they arrived at the hospital. The couple was told they would have to undergo a test for coronavirus but they managed to give the staff the slip.

Similarly, in Nagpur too, four persons admitted to a government-run hospital in Nagpur for suspected coronavirus infection, returned home without informing the authorities. They, however, returned later and tested negative for Coronavirus.

Special Secretary in the Union Health Ministry, Sanjeeva Kumar acknowledged that there have been cases of people not willing to be quarantined despite coming in contact with people testing positive. Kerala’s Pathanamthitta District Collector PB Nooh noted that “if even a single person under observation goes out, it is a threat. This is a public hazard.

“This is the time to behave in a very socially responsible manner,” the Collector had said after a man under observation for suspected coronavirus infection in the isolation ward of the district hospital fled, but was tracked and brought back within hours.

Taking exception to people making bid to evade treatment, the State government has warned that stringent action would be taken against those flouting the directions of the health department.

Health Minister K K Shailaja has warned that those coming from COVID19 affected nations should report to the authorities on arrival in the state, failing which a case would be registered against them under the Public Health Act.

180,15-3-20,"Trump: Will be likely tested for virus, displayed no symptoms","US President Donald Trump has said he will most likely be tested for the coronavirus, stressing that he had displayed no symptoms.

“I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested … Most likely, yeah,” Trump said on Friday.

His remark came after he was repeatedly asked at a Press conference at the White House Rose Garden as to why he was not undergoing tests given that he had last weekend met a Brazilian official who was found positive for the virus later. Trump had met Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and his communications chief Fabio Wajngarten at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago.

Wajngarten tested positive for the virus, while Bolsonaro tested negative. “Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway,” Trump said, two days after the White House said there was no need for the president to undergo tests for the coronavirus.The US president said the tests would be conducted “fairly soon”. “We’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule,” he said.

To a question, Trump said he has “no symptoms” of the virus.

“We have no symptoms whatsoever. We had a great meeting with the president of Brazil, Bolsonaro, great guy, very, very tremendous. He’s doing a fantastic job for Brazil. He tested negative, meaning nothing wrong this morning,” he said.

“We got that word too because we did have dinner with him. We were sitting next to each other for a long period of time,” Trump said, adding that he sat with Bolsonaro for probably two hours, “but he’s tested negative, so that’s good”.

Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham had said, “The President has not received COVID-19 testing because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms.”

“President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,” the press secretary had said.

The White House Medical Unit and the United States Secret Service has been working closely with various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the first and second Families, and all White House staff healthy.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump--will-be-likely-tested-for-virus--displayed-no-symptoms-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/trump--will-be-likely-tested-for-virus--displayed-no-symptoms.html
181,15-3-20,Doctors oversee 68-year-old woman’s cremation in Delhi,"Under supervision of the medical authorities, a 68-year-old woman, who died in the national Capital after being infected with the coronavirus, was cremated at the CNG crematorium in Delhi’s Nigambodh ghat on Saturday.

Doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital here and from MCD oversaw the funeral after the crematorium staff reached out to the authorities seeking directives on ensuring that the infection didn’t spread from the body.

“The Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti, which manages the operations at the crematorium, delayed the last rites by a few hours and approached municipal authorities to seek directives in view of the coronavirus outbreak,” said the official.

“The situation is sensitive across the world. We had to seek instructions first from MCD and medical authorities. They said the cremation will be done using CNG and the officials have come to supervise the process,” Suman Gupta of the Samiti said.

India reported its second casualty due to coronavirus on Friday with the Union Health Ministry confirming the death of the woman who had tested positive for the contagious viral disease after coming in contact with her son who also acquired coronavirus after travelling abroad recently.

The death was caused due to comorbidity (diabetes and hypertension), the ministry said, adding that she had tested positive for COVID-19 following which she was admitted to the RML hospital.

The woman, a resident of west Delhi, became the second person to die of novel coronavirus infection in the country. The first and only other COVID-19 casualty so far was a 76-year-old man in Karnataka who died on March 10. He had recently returned from Saudi Arabia.

The second victim came in contact with her son, who became the fifth coronavirus case in Delhi after travelling to Switzerland and Italy between February 5 and 22.

“She had history of contact with a positive case. The son had returned to India on February 23. He initially was asymptomatic, but developed fever and cough after one day and reported to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on March 7,” a Health Ministry statement said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/doctors-oversee-68-year-old-woman---s-cremation-in-delhi.html
182,15-3-20,Modi to lead India at SAARC video conferencing today,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Sunday “lead India” at the video conferencing session of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations to chalk out a joint strategy to fight coronavirus.

“Coming together for common good! On March 15 at 1700 IST, Modi will lead India at the video conference of all SAARC member countries, to chalk out a strong common strategy to fight COVID-19 in the region,” Raveesh Kumar, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson tweeted.

Earlier, in a delayed response, Pakistan on Saturday acknowledged the need for “coordinated efforts” to fight the coronavirus pandemic as suggested by Modi to the SAARC nations on Friday and promptly agreed upon by Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan and Nepal. Afghanistan too welcomed India’s initiative.

In other developments related to the pandemic, while Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Modi and requested him to allow export of masks and pharmaceutical raw materials to his country, the US Embassy and Consulates in India cancelled the immigrant and non-immigrant visa appointments from March 16 onward.

Itamar Grotto, deputy director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry, said Modi agreed to allow the export of materials for medicines to Israel, but there was no decision yet on the masks. Calling on SAARC members to set an example for the world, Modi had reached out to the eight-member regional grouping and pitched for a video conference among the leaders to chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said the threat of COVID-19 requires coordinated efforts at the global and regional levels. “We have communicated that SAPM (Special Assistant to Pakistani Prime Minister) on Health (Zafar Mirza) will be available to participate in the video conference of SAARC member countries on the issue,” she said.

Afghanistan Embassy’s Chargé d’Affaires here Tahir Qadiry said, “In response to the timely call of Prime Minister Modi to create a robust strategy for SAARC aiming at tackling COVID2019, I would like to acknowledge his call. United we stand, divided we fall!”

On Friday, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and Bhutanese premier Lotay Tshering responded to Modi’s suggestion.

For his part, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested Modi to approve and allow the export of masks and pharmaceutical raw materials to Israel during his telephonic conversation with his Indian counterpart this week, according to a media report from Jerusalem.

Israel’s Channel 13 on Friday reported that Netanyahu made the request after India decided to stop the export of these items to meet its own domestic requirements in view of the rapid spread of coronavirus.

At a press conference on Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister had mentioned about reaching out to Modi, among other leaders, hinting at Israeli efforts to maintain and stabilise “supply lines” of essential materials in view of the massive disruption caused by COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the US Embassy and Consulates in India have cancelled all visa appointments from March 16 in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.

185,15-3-20,"Trump tests negative for coronavirus: White House physician ,","US President Donald Trump has tested negative for the novel coronavirus, the White House physician said, hours after his administration declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency on Friday.

Trump, 73, had taken the coronavirus test on Friday night. The results came out in less than 24 hours.

""Last night, after an in-depth discussion with the President regarding the COVID-19 test, he elected to proceed. This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative,"" Dr Sean Conley, the presidential physician, said in a memorandum to White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham on Saturday.

""One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free,"" he said.

""I have been in the daily contact with the CDC (Center for Disease Control) and the White House Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation,"" Conley added.

Trump had resisted being tested for the virus that has killed at least 51 Americans and infected over 2,500 others.

The deadly novel coronavirus has claimed over 5,300 lives and infected more than 142,000 people across 135 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday.

As part of the precautionary measure to stop the deadly disease from spreading, doctors are advising people to avoid shaking hands.

Trump considered to be a germophobic and not a good supporter of shaking hands over the past few days has been seen shaking hands with people.

""Why are you shaking hands, sir?” a reporter asked Trump during a White House news conference Saturday afternoon.

President Trump defended his habit of shaking hands, saying this is a cultural habit that is tough to be done away with.

""Because it almost becomes a habit, and you get out of that habit. And, frankly, I was a non-hand-shaker, for the most part. I've never believed that shaking hands - once you become a politician. And I notice it too: Political people walk up to me, they want to shake my hand. I said, 'Well, you know',"" he explained.

""People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out. It's sort of a natural reflex, and we're all getting out of it. All of us have that problem. Somebody comes up to you, they put their hand out -- you probably tend to just shake it. And we're all getting out of that,"" he said.

""Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree. But people put their hand out. Sometimes I'll put the hand out. You don't think about it. People are thinking about it more and more. We have to think about it; it's important,"" he said, referring to the age old cultural practice which is tough to die down.

""Getting away from shaking hands is a good thing, and possibly that's something that comes out of this. Maybe people shouldn't be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things,” Trump said.

The World Health Organisation has advised people to stay at least three feet away from someone who is sick or potentially contagious. The US Centre for Disease Control or CDC recommends maintaining a six feet distance.

France is now discouraging cheek-kissing and shaking hands has been suspended in Germany.

Early this week, Trump used the traditional Indian greeting of namaste' when he met the Ireland Prime Minister in the Oval Office of the White House.

186,15-3-20,Coronavirus fear is mind killer: Elon Musk,"SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk who thinks the new coronavirus (COVID-19) debate is just 'dumb,' on Sunday said that the unnecessary fear over the pandemic is not good for the humanity.

""Fear is the mind-killer,"" Musk tweeted.

Amid the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the world, Musk appears to be dancing to his own tune, underplaying the danger from the threat time and again.

""Please tell your 32 million followers to listen to social distancing recommendations,"" reacted one Musk follower.

Another tweeted: ""Hospitals are going to need help, they will be overwhelmed soon. Instead of this horse shit, help spread that message and mobilise resources for our healthcare workers who will desperately need them in coming days.""

In a memo to SpaceX employees last week, Musk said that they were far less likely to die from COVID-19 than car crashes.

Musk added in the email that he does not think COVID-19 is ""within the top 100 health risks in the United States"".

In the US, over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported, while more than 40 people have died due to the disease caused by the virus.

According to a report in The New York Times that cited an estimate by health officials, if the spread of the novel coronavirus is not contained soon, between 160 million and 214 million Americans may become infected in the worst case scenario.

This is not the first time Musk has underplayed the danger from COVID-19.

In a tweet last week, he said that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb.""

""Virality of CoV-19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe,"" the tech billionaire reasoned.

""Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not.

Clear sky, bright sunshine and soaring temperatures will be witnessed, said the IMD.

While the rain on weekend brought a surprise for Delhiites, it also caused perennial waterlogging and traffic snarls.

According to private weather forecast organisation Skymet, western disturbance is main reason behind the rain and hailstorm activities in the national Capital and adjoining areas. “Since March 3, the national Capital has been receiving on and off rains. These rains have been occurring due to the region being approached by successive western disturbances,” the Skymet said.

“The chances of moderate showers are almost over as the western disturbance is moving away eastwards. Moreover, the trough which was extending from Punjab to Bihar has also shifted northwards over foothills of Uttar Pradesh.

196,15-3-20,"Denmark announces first coronavirus death, closes borders","Denmark on Saturday recorded its first coronavirus death as it closed its borders to foreigners in order to slow the spread of the disease.

The fatality ""was a person aged 81 years who was hospitalised for other serious illnesses,"" said officials at the hospital where the patient was treated. The death is the fifth COVID-19 fatality in the Nordic countries. Two people have already died in Sweden and two in Norway.

Denmark also became the latest country to take dramatic steps to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease, closing its borders to all non-resident foreigners for a month.

""All tourists and foreigners who cannot prove that they have a valid reason to come to Denmark will not be allowed to enter,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday when the ban was announced.

Police said that around 20 people were refused entry after the measure came into effect at noon Saturday (1100 GMT).

199,15-3-20,"Al-Aqsa mosque, 3rd holiest in Islam, closes over virus","The Islamic endowment overseeing the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, says the mosque itself and other buildings will be closed over concerns about the new coronavirus.

Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the mosque, said Sunday that prayers will continue to be held outdoors. The closure is to continue indefinitely.

Iran's official leading the country's response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. Sanctions.

Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases and more than 600 fatalities. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government's transparency.

“If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency.

Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed.

Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly.

The Health Ministry released figures showing that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

Most people recover in a matter of weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by individuals with no visible symptoms.

The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected.

In Iran, the virus has even infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials.

Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open.

The country has also struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after it withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. Last week, Iran asked the International Monetary Fund for a USD 5 billion loan, the first time it has sought help from the international lender since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The US says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it. Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, cancelled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks.

In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month.

Dubai Parks & Resorts announced it would be closed through the end of the month. The sprawling amusement park, built at a cost of USD 3 billion, has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since opening.

Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi.

The UAE's central bank announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan.

Tiny, oil-rich Kuwait meanwhile shut down malls, salons and barbershops to slow the spread of the virus. Authorities allowed coffee shops to remain open, but said no more than five customers can wait in line at a time and must be a meter apart from each other.

Dalia Samhouri, a senior official with the World Health Organization's regional office, urged countries to take further steps to aggressively track those who have been in contact with confirmed cases and to impose strict quarantine measures.

“It's not too late to control the situation or to contain the situation,” she said. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings.

Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/al-aqsa-mosque--3rd-holiest-in-islam--closes-over-virus-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/al-aqsa-mosque--3rd-holiest-in-islam--closes-over-virus.html

It features an advanced 64MP main camera, 8MP Ultra Wide lens along with the 123-degree field of view making, 5MP Macro lens for close-up shots and 5MP depth camera for portrait shots with live focus.

While using features like, Photo, Live Focus, Video, Slow-mo, Super Slow-mo, Pro, Panorama and Night and Food, the camera produced good and sharp images. As the device captured detailed images in bright light, however, in low light photography, the images produced were not sharp.

The device offers video capability with 4K recording, hyper-lapse, slow-mo and super-steady modes. While recording videos, the device did produce some good videos.

Despite packing in a mega battery, the smartphone is just 8.9mm thick and weighs only 191 grams, making it lightweight and comfortable to grip.

While the right edge of the device has the volume rocker and power buttons, the left one hosts a dual-SIM slot.

The lower edge of the phone houses a 3.5mm headphone jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port, and speaker.

On the front, the M31 has a punch-hole camera in the top centre of the screen with a 6.4-inch FullHD+ AMOLED display and has a Gorilla Glass 3 for protection.

The smartphone offers 32MP front camera and also supports 4k video recording and slow-mo selfies. The front camera managed to capture decent selfies in the proper light but lacked in low lights.

Powered by Exynos 9611 chipset, the device comes with Samsung's own UI 2.0, on top of Android 10 OS.

The device performed smoothly during daily usage, daily apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram worked well.

Thanks to the 6000mAh battery, the smartphone comfortably lasted for over three days on normal usage.

With the massive battery, the smartphone offered decent performance. Basic tasks like playing games, watching videos, switching between apps, using multiple social media applications were smooth.

While playing games like PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty, we didn't find any problem. The Galaxy M31 ran without glitch or slowdown. The quality of graphics while gaming was also good.

Conclusion: We did not find any major flaw in the Galaxy M31. With a huge battery and quad-camera, this device can be a good choice for youths. Like the M30s, the M31 is capable of creating a distinguished place.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/samsung-galaxy-m31--huge-battery--upgraded-camera-2020-03-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/samsung-galaxy-m31--huge-battery--upgraded-camera.html
