|

After stressing to increase testing for COVID-19 in Uttar Pradesh, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expressed concern over the shortage of testing kits in the state.

She also referred to tests reports of five persons who tested positive for coronavirus after their deaths.

Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Priyanka posted: “I wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and requested to increase testing. Reports of five people have come positive for coronavirus after the death of patients in UP. Testing is still poor. Make the testing system rapid and orderly. Maximum testing can only give us correct picture.”

Earlier on April 10, Priyanka had written to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to increase capacity of testing and treatment of COVID-19 patients in the state. Two days later, she again reminded the government on the shortage of testing kits.

Meanwhile, UP Congress celebrated the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar in a sombre manner, distributing food and safety kits to safai karmacharis, poor and Dalits in Lucknow on Wednesday.

Slamming the ruling BJP at the Centre and UP, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar `Lallu’ said that the marginalised sections were the worst sufferers of lockdown as the government had failed to cater to their food and other basics for survival. While welcoming the lockdown extension, Lallu said that the prime minister once again did not disclose any plan for helping daily wagers, poor and Dalits, who were now left with no money and food.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/priyanka-concern-over-shortage-of-testing-kits.html

Amidst coronavirus scare, a good news trickled in from Siddharthnagar on Indo-Nepal border where as many as 16,724 quarantined people were released on Tuesday.

Siddharthnagar officials disclosed on Tuesday that 19,710 persons arriving from other places and metro cities were quarantined as precautionary measure. Of these, 12,329 had been quarantined in their houses, 7,351 in isolation centres and 40 in government hospitals.

While 2,986 persons were still quarantined, the remaining 16,724 were released from after they did not show any symptoms of the virus.

So far no individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the district.

Meanwhile, Basti range IG Ashutosh Kumar was directed to work in Siddharthnagar till Thursday next and ensure that no one crossed over from Nepal and entered India. The porous Indo-Nepal border has been sealed by the government.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Balrampur, 10 persons were detained for violating safety norms to avert spread of coronavirus.

Superintendent of Police of Balrampur, Dev Ranjan Verma, said that social distancing was being strictly enforced in the district.

Apart from medical stores, ration shops and petrol pumps, gas agencies and seed stores were directed not to sell items to customers who came without masks.

Verma said that action was being taken against those coming out of their homes without masks and in this process, Kamlesh, Suraj, Ramesh Kumar, Ranjit Kumar and Sanjay Kumar were arrested in Rehra Bazaar police station area.

On the other hand, Mohammad Adnan, Ram Gopal, Haider Ali, Manoj Kumar, Ehsanullah and Dhokhe were arrested in Sadullah Nagar area.

Verma said that the hands of the arrested were sanitised and they were made to put on masks.

2,15-4-20,Lockdown forces many to change occupation,"



e |

The lockdown has forced people to go for occupational change. Roadside carpenters, scrap dealers and barbers left jobless in recent weeks due to lockdown have now opted for hawking vegetables in residential colonies, giving a stiff challenge to routine hawkers.

Chunnu was a carpenter before lockdown was enforced. He worked from a roadside shop and used to fix sofas, repair chairs and other furniture and earned between Rs 400 and Rs 500 per day. But things changed after the lockdown was imposed.

“After being told that I cannot open my shop, I stayed home for a few days. After I exhausted my savings, my friend suggested that I should sell vegetables in residential colonies as people were afraid to come out. That is what I am doing now,” he said.

Chunnu now earns Rs 200 per day but pays Rs 50 as rent for the cart. “Still, I am earning something which can take care of my family of two kids, wife, mother and two younger brothers,” he said.

Similarly, Rafiq was a scrap dealer before March 25. He used to visit colonies, purchasing old newspapers and scraps, including coolers, machines etc.

“I have been in the scrap business for more than a decade. After lockdown, I opted for selling fruits and vegetables on a cycle-cart. From the savings I purchased vegetables and now I sell them in the same colony where I used to buy scrap,” Rafiq (27) said.

Even Mudassar, a barber working from a roadside shop in Bhoothnath market, has opted to sell vegetables in the nearby residential colonies.

But goings have not been easy for them and problems have now started cropping up.

Hawkers, who have been in the business and selling in the area, have started objecting to this ‘intrusion’ by ‘outsiders’. They even complained to the local corporator and the police.

“These people have switched to this business as the state government has announced financial help for hawkers and roadside sellers. Recently, Rs 1,000 each was sent into the accounts of daily wagers and these guys have been eyeing this money,” said Mahipal, a regular vegetable vendor.

He admitted that their daily business had suffered due to the newbies.

The second problem the new vendors have been facing is that majority of buyers distancing themselves due to their faith. Majority of the new vendors are Muslims and they say that non-Muslims are avoiding them as videos have gone viral showing Muslim sellers spitting on vegetables and fruits.

“Many Hindu buyers hesitate to purchase fruits and vegetables from us. It is not the case with all Hindus but some ask our name before making the purchase. Some start conversing with a ‘Ram Ram’ salutation and when we do not respond, they ask ‘Musalman hai kya’ and then walk away,” said Rafiq.

A video has gone viral asking vendors to come with their identity cards while in another video, people are seen discussing purchase of goods only from Hindu vendors.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-forces-many-to-change-occupation.html
3,15-4-20,Maya backs Centre on lockdown-02 with rider,"



|

Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the lockdown to fight coronavirus pandemic across the country till May 3, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, while paying her tributes to Dr BR Ambedkar on his 129th birth anniversary, said that her party would support the prime minister’s decision on the condition that it does not create problems for the citizens.

“The BSP will support if the Centre extends coronavirus lockdown while keeping in mind the interest of the public. The government must consider the condition of the poor, labourers, farmers and other working class and provide help during lockdown,” the BSP chief said in a statement issued on Tuesday.

On the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti, Mayawati also said, “I pay respects to Dr Ambedkar on behalf of the BSP and crores of his followers. He spent his life ensuring that Dalits, tribals and marginalised communities lived with self-respect. The BSP was established on this day in 1984 to fulfil his dreams.”

In her address, the BSP chief also slammed the government, alleging that due to lockdown, Dalits and most backward communities were in pain and their condition had only worsened.

“Most of the Dalits and most backwards were among those who had to flee different parts of the country during lockdown. Of the migrant labourers fleeing due to lockdown, 90 per cent were Dalits and backwards,” she said.

Mayawati said that the government did not make arrangements to provide transport to migrant labourers and now several thousands such workers were on the verge of starvation at shelter homes.

Demanding that the government make arrangements for daily wagers, she said that caste discrimination was making life difficult for Dalits and most backwards.

The BSP chief also hit out at the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, alleging that they did everything to get votes during elections but failed to provide respite to daily wagers during lockdown and instead ferried them to Delhi-UP borders, rendering the situation grim.

“This kind of behaviour meted out to Dalits and backwards could only be avoided in future if the key of power was with the Dalits,” she said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/maya-backs-centre-on-lockdown-02-with-rider.html
4,15-4-20,Decision to restart development work put on hold,"

Pending development works which were to re-start from Wednesday after the completion of lockdown period, have once again been put on hold after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced phase two of lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Earlier on Monday, head of the construction committee set up by the government and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had announced to start construction work across the state from Wednesday.

“The decision to resume construction works from April 15 in UP stands cancelled in view of the prime minister’s announcement to extend the lockdown till May 3,” Maurya said on Tuesday.

Talking to media persons, the deputy chief minister said that the date for starting work would be decided after studying the guidelines to be sent by the Centre on Wednesday.

However, Maurya appealed to the people to follow the lockdown norms strictly, ensure social distancing and stay indoors.

Earlier on Monday, the committee had decided to start construction work on Purvanchal and Bundelkhand expressways, Gorakhpur Link Expressway and other important projects of the Yogi Adityanath government from April 15.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/decision-to-restart-development-work-put-on-hold.html

Abiding by the lockdown, political leaders of varied hues paid floral tributes to Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar on his birth anniversary with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath taking the lead and paying homage to the Dalit icon at his 5, Kalidas Marg official residence in Lucknow on Tuesday.

Bharatiya Janata Party state president Swatantra Dev Singh also paid tributes to Dr Ambedkar at his residence while party general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal paid tribute to the Dalit icon at BJP state headquarters.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, Swatantra Dev Singh said that party workers would follow the lockdown-02 in toto and help the poor and needy during this period.

“As decided earlier, party workers distributed food and other essentials like soap among the poor in Basti to mark the party’s commitment to helping the poor and needy,” he said.

6,15-4-20,CM asks people to follow lockdown,"



|

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of nation-wide lockdown till May 3, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered enforcement of the second phase of the lockdown with full force across the state, maintaining that it was necessary to ensure health and future of the citizens.

He also exhorted people to follow the lockdown restrictions seriously.

In his directive to the COVID Team-11 on Tuesday, the chief minister said that as the harvesting season was underway and crop procurement would start from April 15, officials should ensure that farmers did not face problems in transporting their produce to markets.

The officials were also directed to start emergency medical services, protect health workers during their duty and alert them against infection.

The chief minister also asked officials to impart training to nursing and paramedical staff, NCC cadets and NSA volunteers at district level.

“There is no shortage of food grains in the state. Since the second phase of lockdown begins on April 15, availability of free ration should be reviewed at the state level. Besides, officials should monitor the supply chain seriously in the hotspots,” he said.

Later, in his press briefing, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said that the state government had identified 149 coronavirus hotspots in 15 districts, affecting a population of over 10 lakh, in the first phase.

He said a total of 443 coronavirus positive cases had been reported from these areas.

“Apart from the government, the district magistrates have also worked for identifying hotspots in their jurisdiction and their number has also increased. In this way, 68 hotspots under different police stations of 45 districts have been identified. Till Tuesday, 80 coronavirus positive cases were reported from these hotspots,” the additional chief secretary said.

“The chief minister has appealed to citizens to download the Aarogya Setu app which has been downloaded by millions of people in Uttar Pradesh. He specially appealed to the youth, government officials and employees and doctors to use this app,” he said.

Awasthi said that till date 17,585 FIRs for lockdown violation were lodged while 404 FIRs against 506 people were registered under Essential Commodities Act.

“Taking action against fake news, 12 accounts of TikTok, one of Facebook, two of Tweeter and one of WhatsApp have been blocked,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cm-asks-people-to-follow-lockdown.html
7,15-4-20,Globalise the policy narrative,"The pandemic has reinforced the need for inclusive policy-making where countries think internationally and act locally during a crisis

On February 23, Italy recorded around 150 positive cases of COVID-19. Within a week, that number touched 3,000 and four days later it had surpassed 7,000. What happened in Italy after that was surreal as the numbers and deaths mounted exponentially. It was the same with the US which has turned into a hotspot after President Donald Trump ignored repeated warnings by scientists, doctors and experts to act in time and impose a lockdown. The businessman in Trump prevented the President from paying heed and he chose the economy over lives and at one point even considered letting the Coronavirus “wash over” the US in keeping with the “herd immunity” theory that many experts were propounding.

Worldwide, too, the numbers are going up each day with the cases touching 19,31,261 and 1,20,134 casualties. What is even more worrying is that China and South Korea have seen cases resurfacing, giving this nightmare another dimension altogether. The World Health Organisation (WHO), which had declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, and has come under fire for allegedly covering it up initially on China’s behest has now announced that the Coronavirus is 10 times more dangerous than the Swine flu . But, despite the world health watchdog’s warning in early March, it had taken over two weeks for world leaders to take comprehensive action to curb the spread of the Coronavirus. By that time it was too late and too little. Now, as the number of cases is spiralling, countries across the world have receded into a lockdown. India, which began its shutdown from March 25 for 21-days, has now extended its lockdown till May 3.

It is now more than ever that the world is looking up to its policy makers for tackling the spread of COVID-19. However, as more countries across the world impose heavy restrictions on their citizens and stress upon the urgent need for social distancing amidst this growing pandemic, there are still many countries that haven’t completely acknowledged the impact of this virus. Such inward and self-centered policies of nations have severely limited the global consistency of action in such a trying time as this.

A global health crisis like COVID-19 goes beyond borders and the need of the hour is unanimity across the world. In a short span of time, the virus has spread rapidly through the world and with each passing day, the pandemic lays bare the inadequacies of healthcare systems and crisis unpreparedness across the globe.

From infrastructure and medical technology to resources and administration, there are glaring insufficiencies in the healthcare industry. European countries with developed healthcare systems have failed to battle the enormity of this pandemic. The UK took a different approach towards dealing with the problem by experimenting with the “herd immunity.” However, this approach backfired on the UK as the number of cases in the country soared while their National Health Service struggled to keep up. Even though now the UK has imposed a full-fledged lockdown, a crucial period when the spread of the virus escalated was spent without active administrative action. This existing introversion of ideologies to tackle global health emergencies has led to an unsynchronised response of countries in tackling the crisis. There has not only been a delay in action response but also a failure in delivery of productive action making it extremely difficult for countries to — at this stage — flatten the curve. In an era of such populist inward-looking ideologies, there is a need to revamp our crisis management strategies and look outward to avoid a situation where the internal machinery reaches the edge of a collapse.

In India, the COVID-19 pandemic has gradually been exposing the neglected state of healthcare. WHO executive director J Ryan recently referred to India as a country with immense capacity when it comes to eradicating epidemics. His reference was in line with India’s contribution in eradicating polio and smallpox. In addition to that, Dr Roderico Ofrin, WHO’s Regional Emergencies Director, commended India on its comprehensive and robust action-plan to tackle COVID-19. However, healthcare in India has for most part remained an ignored industry. Less than three per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is allocated to healthcare and the country is perpetually dealing with a shortage in medical resources and infrastructure.

According to the Government, India has about one doctor per 1,500 citizens while the WHO recommends one doctor per 1,000 residents. In rural areas, where two-thirds of Indians live and rely almost solely on Government hospitals, the ratio is one doctor to more than 10,000 people.

These statistics are haunting when evaluating the action response required to tackle a pandemic such as COVID-19 which is growing by the minute. Moreover, India faces a problem of plenty within an informal sector of residence and profession where crowd control is difficult.

For instance, 49 people from the famous Dharavi slum in Mumbai were tested positive for COVID-19 and there have been five deaths till now. This slum could turn out to be India’s biggest hotspot. The nationwide lockdown that India is currently experiencing is one step in ensuring social distancing and breaking the chain of transmission of the Coronavirus. However, in a slum like Dharavi, social distancing cannot be practised and contact-tracing is very difficult. The challenge is manifold without adequate resources to know the extent of spread of the virus.

Until a couple of weeks ago, India had only 52 official testing centres for COVID-19 but now that number has gone up slightly. In Tuesday’s address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured people about the arrangements to fight the Coronavirus pandemic in India. “It is said that around 1,500 beds are required for 10,000 COVID-19 patients. In India, we already have made arrangement for one lakh beds. More than 600 dedicated COVID hospitals too are there. These facilities are being expanded speedily,” he said. For a population of 1.3 billion, that number still falls way off the mark. We are at a point where the nation is entirely dependent on internal policies to drive the health market. On the other hand, a coordinated global lockdown could have avoided panic and given countries time to strengthen healthcare systems.

Another point of worry that has emerged amid this crisis is the supply-chain disruption especially in the health sector. Countries which have been severely affected by the pandemic have resorted to sealing borders and enforcing complete lockdowns, which is an entirely unprecedented situation. Most nations don’t have a support system or infrastructure to manage such large-scale disruptions in the supply-chain of essential goods, especially pharmaceutical and medical device companies. International collaboration on delivery of essential services like medical equipment and pharmaceuticals could go a long way in ensuring availability of these services during a crisis.

India is popularly known as the pharmacy of the world. In this regard, India could particularly look at expanding its pharmaceutical industry into a more robust operation that caters not only to domestic but also international needs in the time of crisis. The recent decision to allow export of anti-malarial drugs chloroquine to other nations in need is a step in the right direction. The Government needs to rope in experts in the industry from the world-over to develop policies that expand the market significantly and also make it self-sufficient during a time of crisis. This could create a mutually beneficial global platform wherein all agencies can be timely brought in to effectively tackle a public health emergency. For long, India’s protectionist economic tendencies have prevented this from happening which emphasises upon the need for a policy revamp even more.

If COVID-19 has taught us anything, it is that we need to initiate an active united response where world bodies come together to develop long-lasting policies which can be played out during public health emergencies. It has become imperative to incorporate globalisation in policy narratives and work actively towards providing comprehensive solutions to world problems.

A simple case study of the turn of events in Italy would clarify the importance of preparing a comprehensive strategy of testing, tracking and self-isolation to fight COVID-19. While Italy wasn’t prepared, it gave other countries the time to do so. Unfortunately, the lack of coordination in dealing with this crisis on a global level has slowed down the fight against COVID-19 today. Even though ultimately countries have resorted to a lockdown to curb the spread of the Coronavirus, the action response in the interim has been lackadaisical.

Significantly, Modi roped in SAARC leaders to develop a strategy to deal with the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion revolved around creating a global fund to tackle COVID-19 in the region and also to be better prepared for the future. Taking a cue from that, steps need to be taken at the stakeholder level to develop more inclusive strategies for when disasters hit. East-West collaboration lies at the core of this strategy. One way to move forward in this regard is for policymakers to think globally and act locally. There is a need to break out of existing traditional practices and align with the global viewpoint while thinking of implementation on the grassroot level. We live in a world with extensive cross-country interaction and movement. It is essential now to be aware of possible health threats that might require a coordinated policy narrative to deal with. Countries should focus on policymaking at a local level while integrating and defining these policies at a globalised macro level.

8,15-4-20,The edutech advantage,"Technology is playing a critical role in the dissemination of content and is turning the tide in the COVID-19 affected educational landscape

These are trying times for not just the education sector but also the entire human race. The unprecedented pandemic that hit the world towards the fag end of 2019 has altered all our lives and forced us to take drastic measures. The rapid spread of the Coronavirus within weeks across Europe, South Asia, Australia, West Asia, the US and India forced governments to take swift and decisive action to mitigate the impact of a full-blown pandemic and avoid its community transmission. Thus shutdowns became a startling reality and changed the course of action in the public sphere. In order to keep students safe and stem the spread of the Coronavirus among the young, schools and higher education institutions were shut down as a precautionary measure. This challenged the education sector and broadened the horizon of learning and teaching. It became a catalyst for educational institutions worldwide to search for innovative solutions in a relatively short period of time. According to a recent report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the education of over 290 million students across 13 countries is expected to get interrupted because of the Coronavirus outbreak.

Thankfully, technology is playing a critical role in the creation and dissemination of educational content and is turning the tide in the COVID-19 affected global educational landscape. Amid the unprecedented ongoing lockdowns, schools, colleges and universities across the world have started a bouquet of online offerings to continue coursework. Due to these online learning organisations, big or small, the impact on the education of students can be minimised globally and ensure that learning never stops. In fact, technology has the potential to completely alter the education sector even after COVID-19 is long gone.

In fact, in recent years, universities like Stanford, Yale and Oxford have been providing online courses accessible all over the world through platforms such as EdX, Coursera and Udemy. However, online education and educational technology (edutech) in India are still not a part of the mainstream education system. Hence, it is vital to introduce investments in this sector to integrate edutech with mainstream education, because a report by KPMG says that the Indian online education industry will grow from 1.6 million users in 2016 to a whopping 9.6 million users by 2021.

In a move in the right direction, the Central Government’s Department of Higher Education has undertaken the ‘National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology’ (ICT) to leverage the potential of ICT in providing information to learners free of cost.

Similarly the Amity Future Academy (AFA) has come up with solutions for both corporates as well as colleges and the edutech player is now running a “Free Learning Month” where one can get free access to all the programs designed by industry specialists in partnership with Ivy League universities like Harvard Business School Online for Product Management Program, Wharton Online for Digital Marketing Program and so on. Many edutech players are providing Industry 4.0 online courses in areas like Data Science, Blockchain Technology, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Security, HR Analytics, Product Management and Fintech to help students improve their skill-sets and become prepared in disciplines that will shape the economy of tomorrow. Such offerings aim to plug the gap of learning experienced by institutions or working professionals amid the shutdowns caused by COVID-19. With a slew of institutions being present online and powered with courses in collaboration with foreign universities of repute, these educational solutions will bridge the gap in the education and corporate landscape being created by the global pandemic.

India Skills Report 2018 reflected that about 47 per cent of future jobs in India will be in the areas of Analytics, AI and Robotics. Educational institutions in India have embraced Education 4.0 and designed courses to rationalise the concept of knowledge for tomorrow. Such programmes aim to get the future leaders ready, making them contribute to the vision of seeing India as the knowledge superpower. From digital classrooms to collaborative learning, these programmes are offering a platform and exposure to students and industry professionals to skill-based learning. The need of the hour and of the future is to create programmes in collaboration with premier global institutions and industry experts and follow the concept of “to, by and for the industry” to create a workforce of tomorrow. Subject domains including Data Science, Business Analytics and Intelligence, Digital Marketing Strategies, ML and AI, Blockchain Technology and Management, Big Data Architecture, HR Management and Analytics, Cyber Security, Fundamentals of Python, Search Engine Optimisation, Deep Learning, Content Marketing, Ethereum, Basics of Java, Mobile App Marketing, Social media Marketing are needed to grow with the changing realm of education.

With education on the go becoming a new reality, subject domains like AI can make learning adaptive and personalised while Augmented Reality (AR) can help in contextual learning along with AI-aided chatbots that enhance the student’s learning experience. Messaging services like WhatsApp and popular social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook are also being used for interactive and informal learning by education institutions. Online learning will certainly help the education sector tide over the current crisis and also prepare the next generation to become tech-enabled global citizens.

9,15-4-20,Humanity must adopt conscious consumerism,"As of now, mankind’s exploitative forays into nature’s domains have resulted in the release of harmful pathogens that were hitherto unknown to mankind

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has instilled a new-found respect for the environment among the people of India and the world at large.

As people stay barricaded inside their homes, the value of taking a simple walk in the park, soaking in the sun and the greenery, admiring the flowers and listening to the chirping of the birds, is driven home like never before.

What was taken for granted earlier has become a shockingly difficult task to accomplish. Given the considerable health risk involved in stepping out of the house due to possible exposure to COVID-19, and, of course, the additional risk of inviting the ire of the policemen tasked with the job of keeping citizens indoors during the nationwide lockdown, it is well nigh impossible to enjoy this simple pleasure of life. However, as we ponder over mankind’s behaviour in hindsight (during this enforced break from activities), taking nature and the environment for granted seems nothing short of a sin now.

This respect and value being accorded to nature is new-found, because as recently as the first week of February, all the nations of the world continued to turn a blind eye to environmental well-being. They went on mindlessly exploiting natural resources, guzzling fossil fuel, carelessly disposing plastics and other non-biodegradable waste in landfills, rivers and polluting ground water and even the oceans and mountains.

Even as one nation after another fell prey to COVID-19, other Coronavirus-free countries did not comprehend the danger ahead and people went about their routines unperturbed, powered by greed and consumerism. Now, the Coronavirus has brought almost the entire world to a standstill and our crimes against nature are staring us in the face. In more ways than one, this crisis had been in the making for quite some time. Rising levels of consumerism paved the way for the environment to be exploited and compromised on a systematic scale for long.

Interestingly, according to a pan-India study commissioned by the Mahindra Group in 2019, Indians are very well aware of the human impact on the environment. The study saw four out of five Indians confirming that they were aware of the consequences of their actions on the environment and climate change. The study further revealed that 83 per cent of the respondents evinced interest in making lifestyle changes towards a more sustainable living, while 70 per cent displayed sufficient awareness of water conservation. However, despite the awareness, the respondents could not elucidate how they were going to take steps to reduce/prevent the negative impact of their lifestyles on the environment. So, all the awareness regarding climate change and the state of the environment is unable to alter human behaviour and ensure that people try to lead a low carbon foot-print lifestyle. For this to happen there needs to be a major change in attitudes, wherein conscious, environment-friendly consumerism replaces the current pattern of consumerism which is self-serving and oblivious to environmental consequences.

As of now, mankind’s exploitative forays into nature’s domains have resulted in the release of harmful pathogens that were hitherto unknown to mankind. The hunt for exotic animals that can be sold for a premium in wet markets has put man in the crosshairs of virulent viruses searching for a host. The Coronavirus pandemic is a result of this form of mindless consumerism.

This cavalier attitude towards nature and abject consumerism have made the world shoot itself in the leg and this has to stop now.

Consumerism that spells doom for humanity has to be urgently replaced by alternativism, where sustainable lifestyles become the norm rather than the exception. Governments across the world must provide sustainable alternatives for humans to adopt so that the livelihoods and lifestyles that result in compromising the environment are phased out.

This not only means changing one’s buying behaviour by shifting to green products but also means that sufficient efforts must be made to prevent wastage, be it of food, water, electricity or any natural resources. For instance, there is need to ask all the five-star hotels across the world to not throw unused food at the end of a business day and instead give it to the poor. This act alone will feed millions of hungry people and will also lead to saving of trillions of litres of water that is used in growing more food.

According to EcoBusiness, currently 25 per cent of the food that passes through global five-star kitchens is eventually thrown out, this is the hallmark of irresponsible consumerism and it needs to be replaced with a conscious one. Lastly the mindless exploitation of natural resources has to stop. Else, we should prepare for a grim future where overexploitation of food resources leads to depletion, forcing humans to look for other, more unconventional sources of food. Then pandemics like the Coronavirus will become a routine affair.

10,15-4-20,A post-Corona world,"India’s role in restructuring the ideology of progress, development and growth to create a new world of peace is immense. It must remember what its ancestors had said

The third decade of the 21st century has begun with a challenge of immeasurable magnitude. Practically, the entire productive human activity has come to a screeching halt as nations have been under lockdown, forced as they are to confront an invisible enemy that makes no distinction between the rich and the poor, colour or creed, national boundaries, religious distinction or any other aspect of diversity/similarity. For the Coronavirus, every human being is just a target, nothing more, nothing less.

For the first time, nations across the world are on the same side in the war against Coronavirus. Never before in contemporary times of great scientific and technological advancements had human beings found themselves so inadequately prepared to tackle an unprecedented situation. Never before, the daily routine of the people changed so much as the compulsory social distancing, which has been necessitated to curb the spread of Corona, has done. Children find it so restrictive, people are worried, concerns and apprehensions are being shared. Helplessness is even being experienced among mature and seasoned people. While nations have come together to confront the disease, we have not been able to arrive at a universally applicable counter strategy.

History may not record the Corona war as World War-III but its debilitating effort may be far higher than the combined losses and sufferings inflicted by WW-I and WW-II. Though everyone is busy struggling for survival and minimising the losses and impact, realisation is already dawning upon the concerned and knowledgeable that it’s time to have a fresh look on the epistemological strategies being implemented in the human pursuit of “progress, growth and development” in the post-colonial era. It ushered the era of globalisation, concentration of wealth among the top few, enhanced measures of violence and wars among nations and gave rise to an unprecedented armed race. The outbreak of Caronavirus has made sensible people realise that no nuclear arsenals, no weapons of deterrence, military agreements or defence treaties are of any use in every war.

The Corona interlude has created an environment of tension, turmoil and turbulence across the globe. The only ray of hope is that finally, human ingenuity would triumph over the venomous virus intrusion but the world after this victory shall no more be the same, nor should it remain the same. Learning from these times, nations and people must think of alternative strategies. Interestingly, spending rare undisturbed kinship with close ones in the confines of their homes, people are already pondering seriously over the shape of a post-Corona world. One could be sure that after the return of normalcy, new ideas and thoughts would emerge at the national and international level. The world must realise that the relationship between man and nature stands shattered; that man has failed in discharging his/her responsibility to maintain this sensitive life-giving bond with care and caution.

Instead, it indulged in wanton destruction of natural resources. Clear warning signs appeared in terms of climate change, rising pollution levels and temperature, environmental degradation, depletion of the ozone layer, among others. These issues were never seriously responded to. And now, there is no way out but to devise long and short term strategies to restore the vital link. It should be a survival strategy to ensure the very survival of human race on earth and also of the planet itself.

After WW-II, it was realised that brutality is no answer to human advancement. Consequently, global organisations like the United Nations (UN), United Nations Security Council (UNSC), UNESCO, International Labour Organisation (ILO), the World Health Organisation(WHO) besides others were created. All of these institutions were supposed to derive their ethos and ethics from the Preamble of the UNESCO, which said, “Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.” It is very well known that in spite of appreciable contributions, the structures so created could not construct “the defences of peace in the minds of man.” In essence, the crux of the challenge before the nations, which are under the clutches and claws of the enemy, is: How should we restructure the ideology of progress, development and growth to create a world of peace? This, to ensure equality of access and success to one and all and bestow human dignity on each human being without any distinction or diversity.

But what would be the role of India, its people, traditions and its ancient civilisation in accepting this global challenge? Expectations would be very high from our country as we are the only civilisation which conceptualised/comprehended the criticality in sustaining the man-nature relationship and the role in reshaping human life. Mahatma Gandhi was convinced that India is essentially a land of duty and not mere that of enjoyment. This articulation is very relevant in a globalised world that has played havoc with nature and continues to do so with unscrupulous plundering of natural resources only to satiate its greed of accumulation.

Here again, it was MK Gandhi who summarised the essence of Indian philosophical perception when he wrote that nature has sufficient resources to meet the needs of everyone but not the greed of anyone. The hope for a future beyond Corona emerges from another visionary statement, “I feel that India’s mission is different from that of others.”

He elaborated further, “India is fitted for the religious supremacy of the world. There is no parallel for the process of purification across the globe that this country has voluntarily undergone. India is less in need of steel weapons; it has fought with divine weapons… History supplies numerous instances to prove that brute force is nothing before soul force.” Is this not the time for a global resolve that weapon of steel and brute force may just be of no consequence in some of the toughest situations? Something more may be necessary. Can India take a lead?

First, it must accept this as its moral and ethical responsibility, as the inheritor of a culture and the most illustrious civilisation in the world. To ascertain its emerging global role in evolving new global strategy it must revert to Gandhi, who gave a “call for adventure” in the Young India of May 6, 1926, which very clearly articulates how to proceed ahead: “If we are to make progress, we must not repeat history but make a new one.” We must add to the inheritance left by our ancestors. We must ask: If we may make new discoveries and inventions in the phenomenal world, must we declare our bankruptcy in the spiritual domain? Is it impossible to multiply exceptions so as to make them the rule? Must man always be brute first and man after, if at all?

The UN was created after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a classic example of “brute force.” The sincerity of purpose and commitment to the cause was not there at any stage. It needed a spiritual bent of mind, a genuine desire to stick to the word and spirit of the global resolve. We must learn from history of the recent past.

One may like to recall why such expectations emerge from different groups within India and also from those abroad who “know our country.” The ancient Indian civilisation earned global appreciation for some of its philosophical foundations of eternal nature. These include Yavadjeevait Adhiyate Viprah; Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu; Sarva Bhuta Hite Ratah and several others. Once one internalises the basic import of ancient Indian civilisation, the aspects of essential unity of all human beings, in spite of visible diversities and variations of numerous kinds, emerge very clearly in practical terms.

This universal vision paved the way for acceptance — not mere tolerance — of all religions and faiths, respect for the faith of others. It was also realised very early in the Indian civilisation that human beings must establish a lasting kinship based upon the basics of respect for otherness and resolve to move ahead together, to live and let everyone else also live a better, decent, dignified and satisfying life.

To comprehend universal human obligations, three debts that every human being were destined to repay were articulated in clear terms: Debt to the parents and ancestors; to the learned and knowledge creators; and to the forces of nature.

Human beings have persistently faltered on all the three. Hence, they are forced to face the fury of the nature. This is the right time that India, the originator of these eternal values, relearns its lessons, accepts global responsibility to make others comprehend it and create a new world in which spiritualistic pursuits would determine the extent of materiality acquisition that human beings need, not greed.

11,15-4-20,"Dear PM, we need more","Lockdown extension was inevitable but without specifics of a bailout, Modi’s speech remained anodyne

There is a visual that is far more telling than that of our pater familias Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking to his family of soldier citizens whose sacrifice, pain and toil he acknowledged. What was unacknowledged was the destitution of a man and street dogs licking the milk off the tarmac that had spilt from a tanker on a road in Agra. Nobody is disputing the fact that given India’s particularities — clustered populations, frail healthcare systems and a resource-starved management — a lockdown was necessary, even its extension. But this in the end is just a holding out operation. As the spiral of cases continues with increased testing, though it is not at the aggressive pace as is required, there is a spread that even lockdowns may not be able to prevent all too much. Yes, we have been slow in acting against the Coronavirus pandemic, we should have suspended international flights at least two weeks ago, the screening of passengers was limited to just thermal scans (the quarantine condition came much much later), the lockdown was imposed abruptly without preparation and because of still low testing, our disease burden is difficult to fathom. Although Modi countered such claims, all of which are by the way based on official data, saying India had acted much earlier than any other country, this is not the time for comparatives. There will be more deaths due to job losses, food riots and prolonged suspension of economic activity. This is anyway India’s lost year and lost opportunity. It is appreciable that Modi knows a nation ardently waits to listen to his words of wisdom in times such as these and he plays to the gallery. But he ought to have acted more like a father figure and given us an economic package that everybody was looking forward to, talked of a plan B of living with the virus till a vaccine is found, mentioned fund disbursement from all the PM’s relief funds that have been set up overnight to close gaps in the COVID-19 war room and given a directive on supply-chain management that would ensure the food reaches the beneficiaries it is intended for rather than being wasted on a hot summer day. In short, he had to be more specific than asking us to look after the old and the poor. The civil society knows what it has to do, the PM does not have to remind us of that but he needs to give us a direction that we do not know about.

The point is there was no mention of an increased GDP allocation to aid liquidity and working capital for industries that have already gone under. Other countries have done it and some experts have even suggested borrowings. Although the Opposition Congress doesn’t have much political or emotional heft now, it did raise the right questions about “targetted monetary injections; Keynesian spending, loosening the FMRB and so on.” Also, by saying that districts that do well in containing the spread might see lockdown relaxation from April 20, Modi spelt out no plan for those that are worst-hit. Are people living here to be condemned for their geographical choice or are they to be tested aggressively, treated and the infection-free made to sign up for zonal work permits with given protocols? But there was no such assurance or even interest for those locked out indefinitely. They almost seemed like being a test subject under surveillance in China. While rural harvesting and agricultural work have been resumed in places, industrial units and infrastructure projects need to be started in uninfected areas immediately. Zoning and phasing production with certified staff need to start as well. You may hold fleeing migrant labourers and daily wage earners in camps but things are not so welfarist there either. There are complaints of inadequate rations, cramped conditions and common toilets which they want to escape in the absence of gainful employment. They would rather be healthy in the subsistence economy of their village homes than risk it in alien cities and towns that were the first to turn them out. Job losses are not only about the unorganised sector, they are happening in the organised sector, too. Be it hospitality, tourism, retail majors or media, the vapourisation of visible products has meant that companies are slashing salaries, furloughing employees or retiring those on the cusp of their sunset years. Small businesses have all but wrapped up. And this is just three weeks. If indeed the spiral merits an extended lockdown, then an economic package must be in place. It cannot come in a piecemeal manner or a measured way to gain political mileage later. Modi, the PM, has to appear as everybody’s benefactor, not of his constituents. A pan-India TV speech is the best platform to do it, rather than telling employers not to sack people.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dear-pm--we-need-more-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/dear-pm--we-need-more.html
12,15-4-20,Media in distress,"The media is a tertiary industry and as a result will face more trouble before things improve. Which may take years

News about salary delays, cuts and outright layoffs are rampant on groups of journalists. The seemingly heavy-handed cutbacks, which are being blamed on the Coronavirus, have affected both veteran journalists and rookie reporters. Lest it be upon us to judge the decisions made by other media groups, every single media entity is in a spot of financial trouble, including this newspaper, as revenue sources — be it from the Government or the private sector — have completely dried up during the lockdown. At the same time, costs for printing and distribution as well as salaries have remained the same. Then virulent misinformation about the spread of COVID-19 through newspapers has prevented distributors from giving them out in all areas. Newspapers are still better off than their brethren in the magazine sector, where in many cases, printing presses are shut as news stands, which are the primary source of distribution for many magazines, are empty. In a way, the Indian media is responsible for some of the crisis, thanks to the “price wars” of the 1990s that have driven down the subscriber costs of newspapers, making them more dependent on private sector advertising.

Yet, it is not just the print media that is suffering. Layoffs and salary cuts are taking place in television as well. Flawed distribution strategies by channels and policies by the regulator have meant many news channels are free-to-air and, thus, survive on advertisements. With India’s industry shut, that source of revenue has dried up. While people may believe that the web is a land of milk and honey, much advertising revenues are swallowed up by the likes of Facebook and Google and eyeballs are not equal to revenue. Indeed, the high establishment cost of several start-up media sites will ensure that many might not make the cut once COVID-19 is dealt with, leaving a scarred and empty media landscape. Can the Government do much? For one, supporting the media through advertising as well as relaxing the wage board for print will be a start. Despite that, cutbacks will be brutal, many journalists and managers in the media will be out of a job and almost no journalism graduates will be hired for the next year. Our role in the media will be job preservation and creation and for that, the Government has to think out of the box and cut the industry some slack.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/media-in-distress-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/media-in-distress.html
13,15-4-20,"Protect workers being retrenched, says Akhilesh","



|

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in protection of workers who were being retrenched by employers.

He said that despite assurance by the prime minister and the chief minister, there has been no let up in retrenchment and deduction of wages by employers.

He said that even wages of contractual employees hired by government agencies were being deducted.

“Retrenchment and deduction of wages by employers is inhuman. It is the time of discharging responsibility to fight the catastrophe of COVID 19,” the SP chief said in Lucknow on Tuesday.

Akhilesh added, “Samajwadi Party welcomes the lockdown extension by another 19 days. But now it is the duty of Central and state governments to ensure availability of basic amenities to common man and ensure none slept hungry.”

The SP chief stressed that his party would continue relief works till May 3 as it was the party workers’ moral responsibility that no one was deprived of food and other basic amenities. He said that SP cadre was efficiently discharging its duties in providing aid to the poor, unemployed and needy.

Akhilesh further said that on one hand, the government does its work in a democracy; on the other, the Samajwadi Party also has a duty to serve being the principal opposition party. He said that the government should ensure wheat procurement centres for purchase of wheat from farmers at minimum support price of Rs 1,925 per quintal went on smoothly.

The SP chief had recently said that farmers were anguished over the damage to standing crop due to unseasonal rains and committed suicides in Banda.

Akhilesh alleged that an elderly man who returned from Gujarat was home quarantined for 21 days in Barabanki but no one followed up and as a result he died.

“Thus, one more life was lost due to the failure of state government during lockdown which also exposed the tall claims made by government about relief work carried by it,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/protect-workers-being-retrenched--says-akhilesh.html
14,15-4-20,Corona testing facility begins at MECAHARA,"A sample testing centre for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) started functioning from Tuesday at the microbiology department of the Pt Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Medical College in Raipur.

On first day of its functioning, 22 swab samples were tested, a top official at the medical facility said

Head of microbiology department at the medical college Dr Arvind Neral, said that maintaining all the technical protocol and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, the sample testing facility at the medical college was set up within 4 to 5 days.

The sample testing facility has a real time polymerase chain reaction machine (RT-PCR), three bio-safety cabinets (BSCs), three laminar air flow cabinets, minus 80 degree and minus 20 degree Centigrade refrigerators and other equipment, Neral said.

Based on the ICMR classification of BSL2 Lab, in future, it can also be used for other viral diseases testing, he said.

Dr Neral further said that under the universal protocol, individual security and safety equipment is also being provided to those involved in testing.

“Those who are testing cannot leave the lab until the entire probe is conducted. They will then have to stay for 14 days quarantine, and then go home, he said

A16-member team of microbiologists, scientists, lab technicians and lab assistants have been constituted, to work in two shifts and all the tests are conducted free of cost, he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-testing-facility-begins-at-mecahara.html

17,15-4-20,"‘Waive house rent, holding tax for 3 months'","At a time when people belonging to all categories are facing difficulties due to the corona-induced lockdown, former Ganjam district BJP president Kanhu Charan Pati has urged the Ganjam district administration to waive rents of BeMV houses and water cess for three months.

In a letter to Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange, Pati hailed all measures taken by the district administration for combating the deadly COVID-19.

Mentioning about related appeal of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Pati urged the Collector to direct the Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BeMC) to waive off three months' rent for shop rooms it has let out to small vendors across the city.

Pati demanded that the BeMC should announce waiver of holding tax and water cess for three months for all households in the city.

Pointing out that many poor families are yet to get ration cards, the BJP leader requested the Collector to provide rations and other Government supports for three months in advance to them soon. He too demanded similar support for labourers, who were engaged in malls, garages, travelcagencies, hotels and different business units, but could not return home due to lockdown.

Pati expressed unhappiness that the decision of distributing rations and pentions for three months at doorsteps has not been materalised yet. Rather, the dealers and officials are distributing them at PDS points where social distancing is not being maintained at all. He urged the Collector to do the needful in these regards.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/---waive-house-rent--holding-tax-for-3-months-.html
18,15-4-20,Raman offers suggestions to Baghel,"Former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister and BJP national vice president Raman Singh in a letter to chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday suggested four points that needs immediate action.

Singh in the letter said the urban authorities through an order had stopped social organisations, religious groups, and political party workers providing assistance to the needy and the impoverished people during the period of crisis.

The former CM cited the example of Rajnandgaon, where the local civil administration was not bearing any expenses for food and other relief work for more than 15,000 people, who were being provided relief by civil society organisations.

“In other parts of the country, NGOs are freely working and they should be permitted in the state also,” Singh in his letter said.

The former CM also suggested deposit Rs 1,000 in the bank account from the state Disaster Fund to more than 1 lakh migrant workers from Chhattisgarh who are stranded in more than 15 states across the country, and as they will continue be stranded until May 3 due to the extension of the nationwide lockdown.

“A solution should be found within three days by forming a panel under the chief secretary to coordinate with the different states,” Singh said and added:”Workers are getting rice but no milk, medicines and other materials which is also required and for which immediate and necessary arrangement is made.”

Third point raised by Singh was that of the high court order on opening coronavirus testing centres in all the revenue divisions of the state, and in all the medical colleges, as soon as it is possible.

Immediate procurement of PPE kits, test kits, ventilators was the fourth point of suggestion made by Singh in his letter to the CM.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/raman-offers-suggestions-to-baghel.html

20,15-4-20,"Tribal rights: Maoists issue threats, CG govt refuses to buckle","Even as Maoists have issued death threats against the activists involved in the process of implementation of habitat rights to tribals in Abujhmad in Chattisgarh, the state government has not buckled.

Last week, Maoists of the Mad divisional committee of Communist Party of India (Maoists) pasted leaflets on trees saying that they were opposed to habitat rights. The letter said the party has sentenced Ramji Dhurwa, the chief of Madia Samaj, to death in its court and its execution was pending.

Dhurwa has been working hard to arrange meetings between the members of the tribal community of Abujhmad, the only unsurveyed area of around 4000 sq km in India, which is under the control of Naxals and notoriously known as 'liberated zone' for the implementation of habitat rights.

The Bhupesh Bhagel government has granted habitat rights to 40,000 dwellers of Abujhmad, in Orchha tehsil of Narayanpur district. Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, or Forest Rights Act (FRA), entitles particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) with habitat rights over their entire habitation and ensures protection of their culture and way of life.

Of the 75 tribal groups classified as PVTGs, Abujhmadias living in Dandakaranya forest are one. They can apply for habitat rights as a community for the entire region where the community lives and uses for their habitation. No PVTG in the country have got habitat rights yet.

As per guidelines of habitat rights, a district level committee which constitutes a collector, district forest officer and assistant commissioner tribal welfare should work with the community to apply for the habitat right for the community.

Dhurwa told IANS that he is being threatened because he wants basics like roads, hospitals and educational institutions for the people of his community.

Maoists have also asked all the village elders who attended the meetings to apologize, he said.

Opposing the habitat rights, the Maoists said in their leaflet that they wanted tribals to fight for complete rights -- water, land and forest and not get ""dissuaded by these government traps.""

The Maoists also claimed that habitat rights will give only one or two acres of forest to the tribals and the rest will be given to the industry.

An effort to get habitat rights for Abujhmadia tribals started in last June under the leadership of Sarv Adivasi Samaj, a conglomeration of all tribals groups in the state. The effort was facilitated by the New Peace Process in Central India, headed by tribal rights activist, Shubhranshu Choudhary.

So far four meetings with participants from more than 190 villages of Abujhmad have taken place on habitat rights.

The Maoist threat identified Choudhary as Dhurwa's friend and both of them as agents of the government and corporations.

Choudhary, convener for the new peace process, told IANS, ""Habitat Rights can give rights over the entire Abujhmad region to the Abujhmadia community as some of them are fighting for the same with guns now. The Forest Rights Act is an outcome of a long struggle by democratic forces in the country and I hope the Maoists will respect it for the benefit of the tribals who are fighting with them from many decades now.

In the last several years, a considerable number of Abujhmadias have joined Maoists because the Maoists have persuaded them that they will be deprived of their natural resources (water, land and forest) by the government and corporations.

Advisor to Chief Minister Bhagel, Rajesh Tiwari, said, ""Maoists fear that once the basic rights and necessities of tribals are taken care of, they will become irrelevant and they will have no issues to sell. They realize that the Bhagel government is working for the welfare of the tribals. That is why these threats,"" he said.

He told IANS that the work on habitat rights will continue after the lockdown is lifted.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tribal-rights--maoists-issue-threats--cg-govt-refuses-to-buckle.html

23,15-4-20,Gridco to pay Rs 55 crore a month for surrendered power,"With power consumption coming down due to the lockdown, the Gridco would be forced to pay at least Rs 55 crore per month towards Fixed Cost Liability of surrendered power to the generating plants.

Prior to the lockdown, the daily demand of power was 3,300 MW while it has gone down to 2,700 MW now due to shutdown of industries and market complexes.

The Gridco has signed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with generating companies and the PPAs come in two parts: Fixed Cost and Variable Cost. As the Gridco is not utilising the power and surrendering it, the company would be absolved of Variable Cost. But it has to pay the Fixed Cost of installing power project which includes repayment obligations to lenders.

The Gridco has entered PPAs with nine inter-State generating stations (ISGSs). As it is surrendering power to the ISGSs, it would have to pay the Fixed Cost unless PPAs are cancelled. However, the PPAs cannot be cancelled because after the lockdown is over power requirement would be increased.

So, for the month of March, the Gridco would have to pay Rs 54.93 crore for the surrendered power.

Apprehending such a scenario earlier, Energy Secretary Bishnupada Sethi had brought it to the notice of Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy to flag the issue with the Union Ministry of Power. Accordingly, Tripathy has written to Union Power Secretary Sanjeev Nandan Sahai to consider if the proposal of capacity charge/ fixed charge can be reduced by say 50% which can be worked out by deferment of their capital cost, viz., Depreciation, Interest cost and RoE.

This deferred cost should be allowed to be recovered during the balance five-year tariff period, i.e. in 2021-24 on a case-to-case basis, Tripathy has proposed, stating that this can be done by back-to-back support, relief from the lenders and deferral on the recovery of principal and interest repayments without additional interest charges levied on the deferred payments.

However, the Ministry of Power has not responded in this regard to the State, said sources in the Department of Energy.

In the meantime, the Ministry of Power has requested the NTPC to take a lenient view in case the power distribution companies (Discoms) fail to pay their dues. The NTPC is also facing a tough time due to the COVID-19 impact as the power surrender amount is steadily going up because power consumption is going down.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/gridco-to-pay-rs-55-crore-a-month-for-surrendered-power.html

Two of these girls have come home here from Ranchi and under this lockdown are spending some time for cops in streets as well.

These girls, three of them sisters and one tribal move out in the evening with jeera water, lemon water, cucumber, papaya, water

melon, germinated grams, custard etc which they offer to cops doing duties in the street from Sahitya Samaj chowk to Redma a distance of nearly one and a half kilometer in Daltonganj.

SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta said, “An ASI of our has told me these girls come and offer these little but very precious things to us. We are overwhelmed with their sense of love and concern for us.”

Officer in charge of Town police station Anand Kumar Mishra said, “I have also seen these girls doing this great work and this boosts our morale and we believe there is someone who cares for us too.”

One of these 4 girls Mili Sharan said, “One day during this 21day long lock down I saw a couple of policemen taking water from a road side tube well. They cupped their palms to become a glass. This scene touched me like anything.”

“So much of pains for drinking water these cops were undertaking while we were indoors for fear of coronavirus and this feeling swelled in me to do something for them and then I along with my two sisters Isha Sharan and Molly Sharan and Anshu Tirkey decided to pay our thank you and gratitude to the cops on road doing their duties in a very critical time like this” said Mili Sharan.

She said Anshu Tirkey’s mother Vimla Toppo is a senior nurse and she knows too well what it means to be so exposed on roads in times of coronavirus asking people to stay safe.

None of these girls are any graduate rather two of them Isha has just taken her matriculation examination while Molly is in class VII.

Mili and Anshu are still far away from becoming a graduate but their determination, sense of gratitude and concern for men in uniform are in plenty.

Asked if their moms do not ask them not to go out of their houses when streets are so deserted Mili Shraran said, “Our mom and mom of Anshu Tirkey are too helpful. They encourage us. We feel proud of our mom. Our mom helps us with germinated gram. She arranges many of the fruits for us.”

About dad Mili Sharan said “He motivates all four of us. What we do is just a token of our gratitude to the cops.”

A cop on duty who has once received these goodies from these girls said, “ There are many who have no kind words for us and we are held and blamed

if our baton touches anyone’s legs and hands all for their own safety and good to keep them indoors but these girls just feel so good for us and that makes me feel cops are still not any bad.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/4-girls-say----thank-you-cops----with-papaya--lemon-water-in-daltonganj.html

39,15-4-20,5 lakh India Post employees apprehensive,"While the India Post has been rendering many essential services, including during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, the Government's move to corporatise and privatise the 166-year-old organisation has created many apprehensions among its employees and the common people.

In 2014, the Government had constituted a Task Force on Leveraging the Post Office Network headed by former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramanian. The committee submitted its report in Novemeber, 2014 recommending division of the India Post into six units. i.e. (i) Banking and financial services (ii) Insurance (PLI/RPLI), (iii) Distribution of third party products (Services on behalf of private parties on payment basis), (iv) Management of Government services (v) Parcel and Packets and (vi) communication delivery.

The first five units were designated as strategic business units and sixth unit was left to deliver mails at subsidised rates. Under Department of Posts, a holding company “India Post (Financial and other services) Corporation Limited” was recommended to be formed. The corporation would consist of Board of Members and one Chairman from the Board members. All the five separate subsidiary companies would also have separate Boards. In the course of time, Government might disinvest its part of holding and new corporation would raise fund from share market and thereafter would also be listed in share market in future.

It was stated in the report that five subsidiary companies would make profit and contribute to meet the loss of sixth unit. The Task Force Committee also recommended for amendment of Indian Post Office Act 1898 and to bring another Postal Act, that is, “India Post (Financial and other services)” Corporation Act for reorganisation of the Department of Posts by creating a new corporate structure. In the meantime, the banking and financial sector has been corporatized since September 1 2018 in the name of India Post Payments Bank Limited as the first PSU under Department of Posts with the Certificate of Incorporation from the Registrar of Companies, Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies Act 2013. Now the department has decided to set up an insurance company as another strategic business unit in two years. It is well predicted that the age-old Government establishment is running ahead rapidly on the way of corporatisation.

Notably, the Department of Posts and Telecom was bifurcated in 1986 as Department of Posts and Department of Telecom. Subsequently the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) was incorporated as a telecommunication company in the year 2000. The fate of BSNL and its lakhs of employees and workers during the preceding years is now on headlines. This public sector undertaking which was running with profit till 2014, now running with a loss of nearly Rs 35,000 crore and for the first time in the BSNL’s history, the company has not been able to pay salary to about 1.68 lakh employees. In the meantime, nearly 80,000 employees have already gone on voluntary retirement service.

There are many apprehensions coming to the minds of five lakh postal employees working in 1.55 lakh post offices across the country.

Would the India Post, which is now running with a Rs 15,000-crore deficit (FY 2018-19), not face the fate of BSNL in near future. Is corporatisation of the India Post really necessary and the only way out to make it a profitable organisation? Does not the Government does think it as an essential service department? Besides, would the India Post not lose its true spirit of providing essential services to the common people after being transformed into a corporation?

They got a call about the fire at about 11 am, and soon they had informed Jharkhand fire brigade. He said they had subsequently informed the Tata Steel as well. He pointed out a fire tender from Tata Motors joined the fire fighting later on.

""We are yet to ascertain as to what led to the fire mishap. The cause behind the fire mishap is yet to be known as the market was completely closed but as the fire had started from a saree shop, we assumed that there must be a short circuit or some other reason that caused the fire. We are investigating into the cause of fire by pressing the utility company’s electrical department in service,"" Sinha said.

49,15-4-20,Set up taskforce for migrant workers: Forum,"The Citizens’ Action Group (CAG) on Corona here has called for constitution of a taskforce to help the migrant workers in view of the second phase of lockdown in the country.

The forum is a collective of eminent citizens, civil society organisations and public advocacy groups in Odisha seeking to help in the fight against the pandemic.

“We urge the Prime Minister not lose time and set up a national task force, which could oversee inter-State coordination, monitoring and resolution of issues relating to migrant workers,” said CAG co-convenor Umi Daniel.

According to news reports, there are more than 2.4 million migrant workers who are currently stranded in some 50,000 camps scattered across the country. Most of them were looking to return home with the hope that the lockdown would end Monday. But now with lockdown getting extended by a fortnight, we are not sure how impatience and anxiety will shape the behavior of the stranded workers, said Daniel, an expert on migration.

According to the CAG, the proposed national taskforce should ideally be set up in the Prime Minister’s Office with representations from key Central Ministries such as Labour, Home Affairs, Railways, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs and Health and Family Welfare and the States most affected by the issues.

The taskforce should hold periodic reviews and provide necessary guidelines on handling issues relating to migrant workers. It should advise the labour sending and recipient States to exchange information about the stranded workers and coordinate their smooth movement.

The suggestions of the forum for the Odisha Government are constitution of a special State-level taskforce for coordinating and reaching out to migrant workers both in and outside Odisha; identification of migrant workers living in distress in urban slums, mining clusters and other Government and corporate projects and provision of food, supplies and medical support; consideration of a special employment generation programme for migrant workers in urban areas; immediate release Rs 1,500 to workers registered with the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board; setting up panchayat-level information centers, registration of migrant returnees and linking them up with effective quarantine; designing a special social and economic package for migrant returnees and particularly families undergoing self-quarantine; district-level helplines to educate on quarantine procedures, mental health support and access to Government support; payment of MGNREGA wage in advance to those in quarantine, long-term livelihood and employment support, legal and other support that may be needed for migrants who have been duped in such times of distress and mechanism involving the State Legal Service Authorities, Department of Labour and civil society groups to register complaints.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/set-up-taskforce-for-migrant-workers--forum.html

51,15-4-20,Facemask highly useful to contain Covid-19,"Just a few months ago, no one in India would have imagined people with facemasks on the road, which is increasingly becoming a common sight; and well, one of relief. There have been tens of articles published in the recent days in reputed journals supporting its effectiveness in prevention of spread of novel coronavirus as well as refuting such claims creating a lot of confusion in already scared people in these uncertain times.

But one thing that all the leading experts and scientists agree is that face mask is effective in capturing the droplets containing millions of viruses released in the air following a sneeze or a cough by a patient carrying the virus whether suffering from symptoms such as high fever and cough or an unsuspecting asymptomatic carrier.

The Government of India gave an advisory asking people to wear masks including homemade ones while going out, to fight the invisible enemy of corona pandemic.

Few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the public to use facemasks while going out to prevent its spread and to help others. He reiterated that it does not have to be highly specific facemasks such as N95 masks which needs to be worn by health professionals treating the corona virus infected patients but simple homemade and cloth masks can be effective in eliminating the spread of virus to a large extent. Millions of people followed Government advisory and PM Modi’s appeal and it became a mass movement called out by many organisations.

The Prime Minister’s call to make masks at home and distributing it among the people was taken up by the people from all faiths and political ideologies with lots of enthusiasm. The social media is flooded with people including celebrities making masks and distributing it. Inspired by none other than PM Modi, I made my own little contribution of making a mask from cotton cloth at home and shared the video for public awareness. This noblegesture by millions of Indians will help us all to make up for the deficit of mask in the market as well as helping people to overcome the shortages and the Government can redirect the surgical and other PPE (personal protected equipment) related masks to the frontline workers such as doctors and nurses treating patients with corona virus.

What we know so far about the corona virus is that a significant amount of people infected by it do not suffer from symptoms such as high fever, cough and breathing difficulties but can still spread the virus to others, they may eventually develop the symptoms or may not. By using a face mask, they can prevent the spread of virus through air, this associated with social distancing of two metres will be an effective measure to contain the spread of virus to others.

The homemade cotton masks have many advantages such as they can be sterilised easily at home to be reused again. Meanwhile, the world opinion is changing in favour of mass use of facemask to prevent the spread of corona virus in the community. In some countries such as Japan and South Korea, it is a common culture to sight people wearing masks while going out especially during the flu season to limit its community spread.

One thing is very clear about the corona virus is that the virus droplets containing millions of them linger on for days in the air; so a facemask will surely protect people from getting it. However it is of paramount importance that the facemasks should be properly cleaned everyday while taking care of handling it properly. And people should follow the principle of one facemask for one person and it should never be shared even among the family members.

Coronavirus global pandemic has come as a disastrous surprise for everyone with over 16 lakhs of people getting infected from it and over 1 lakh deaths and numbers are increasing as we speak and scientists all over the world are still trying to figure out its complete course and treatment with only limited success so far. The vaccines and the cure are being worked upon and it might take many months to get a cure or a vaccine. We have no other option other than following the age-old golden advice of “prevention is better than cure”. My sincere appeal to all is to follow Government ’s advisory during the lockdown, maintain social distancing and stay at home to save lives.

CAPT WRITES TO PM REITERATING DEMAND FOR INCENTIVE TO FARMERS BRINGING IN WHEAT AFTER APRIL 30

With Rabi harvesting and procurement season set to start from Wednesday, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reiterating his demand for incentive or bonus to farmers bringing in their produce to the mandis after April 30, to check overcrowding at the markets.

“The Centre should immediately announce a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal over and above MSP to the farmers for bringing wheat for marketing after May 1, 2020, and Rs 200 per quintal after May 31, in order to compensate them for the additional cost for handling the produce for staggering the marketing and the reduction in yield,” said the Chief Minister.

Amid Covid-19, the cost in paying incentive bonus would be offset by resultant saving in the cost of healthcare, which otherwise would have to be incurred in case of spread of this deadly virus, wrote the Chief Minister.

It could not be overemphasized that farmers must be encouraged to follow health advisories in this extraordinary situation the nation is facing, while ensuring the national food security necessary procurement arrangements are in place accordingly, he said.

Capt Amarinder added that in view of the threat of coronavirus pandemic, the state had already made elaborate arrangements for procurement of wheat. “The number of purchase centers had been almost doubled from 1820 last year to 3791 during the current Rabi Marketing Season to ensure social distancing, and staggering of wheat arrivals in these centers has been planned by limiting daily arrivals and extending procurement season up to June 30.

This was also required due to shortage of agriculture labourers on account of prevalent pandemic in the state, which would involve an extra expenditure for the farmer in terms of unloading at home after the harvest, as well as the storage and reloading at the time of marketing,” he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/all-set-for-wheat-procurement-in-punjab.html

80,15-4-20,"Remote-controlled robot to serve food, medicines to patients","Remote-controlled robots will soon provide food and medicine to COVID-19 patients in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand – an initiative taken to ensure safety of doctors and health workers, officials said on Tuesday. Developed by West Singhbhum Deputy Development Commissioner Aditya Ranjan, these robots, called COBOT-Robotics, will be functional in at least one Government hospital of the district, they added.

Thirty-year-old Ranjan completed his engineering from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, and is currently posted in West Singhbum as DDC. With an intent to save lives, he started working on the project after the Coronavirus pandemic hit the world. ""I used to participate in robotics contests back in college. This robot will provide food, medicine and water to the patients so that doctors don't have to enter the isolation ward that often,"" Ranjan told The Pioneer.

Not only this, the robots will also facilitate communication between doctors and patients. Cameras have been fitted on the bots to allow communication between patients and doctors through the machine, said Ranjan. ""For example, if a patient wants water, he can directly say it to the robot, and the doctor will be able to see and hear the patient on his phone through the camera fit on the robot,"" he added.

The robots, Ranjan said, will also prevent wastage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits – a protective cover that health workers wear while visiting isolation wards for COVID-19 patients. In a recent interview, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that Jharkhand demanded 75,000 PPE kits and got only 5000. The entire country is facing a shortage of PPE kits, and the robots might help the Government manage patients better with the limited resources, sources said. ""The robot cannot replace doctors. A doctor has to go to the ward in order to check patients. However, it can do minor tasks that are being done by health workers and also doctors in some hospitals and reduce the risk of transmission of the virus,"" Ranjan said.

As of now, the State has only one such robot. However, Ranjan said that he can make more robots as per the demand. West Singhbhum, the district where the robot will be used for the first time, has not reported any case of COVID-19 so far. However, the number of patients in the State has increased manifold in April.

By Tuesday afternoon, at least 24 cases of COVID-19 were reported in the State. Out of these patients, at least two died in the past one week. While no doctor or health worker has tested COVID-19 positive in the State so far, such incidents have been reported from different parts of the country. The robots created by Ranjan can be used in other states too if there is a need, Government sources said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/remote-controlled-robot-to-serve-food--medicines-to-patients.html

98,15-4-20,Denizens welcome lockdown extension,"Amidst the increasing number of Coronavirus cases across the country, Ranchiites have welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of extending the nationwide lockdown till May 3.

Agreeing to follow the stay home to stay safe mantra for the next 19 days, while on one residents are keen to stay away from public places, malls and movie theatres for some time, on the other hand they also have a ready list of to- do things once this lockdown is over.

I think it was a very wise decision taken by our PM at this stage of the pandemic as the graphs still haven’t stabilized on the number of effective cases. Although this blockage will affect all budding and existing businesses right from the root but on the other hand several lives will be saved and the economy over time can boom both financially and socially for each one’s livelihood.

The PM has taken steps to give value to human life over the economy which shows a lot of strength in his persona. This has taught me to not take things for granted, but in fact appreciate relationships and companionships more than material goods.

Siddharth Bajaj

Travel retail luxury manager

Though the lockdown is essential, I do want things to normalize as soon as possible. I am touched by the daily wagers labourers who are at a total loss to support themselves and their families. Being a pensioner myself, it is going to be difficult to support the daily household help and her family for the rest of the lockdown period. I have been consulting my doctor over the phone all this while, but once this over I would certainly make it a point to go for my routine checkup.

Dr Shantu Chaudhury

Criminologist

I work for a multinational company in Bangalore and thankfully I was able to come home just before the lockdown was announced. Currently am working from the comfort of my home in Ranchi while spending quality time with my parents and grandmother. The lockdown though has severely hampered business, the extension was certainly much needed. Once this is over and the airlines resume functioning, I will return to my job. Am also looking forward to meet my fiancé as it will be close to two months since we last met.

Ridhima

Business Development Manager with an MNC.

India is the first country to impose a nationwide lockdown which is extremely commendable. The effort made by the entire country to make the lockdown successful till April 14 would have been wasted had the PM not extended it. April- May is peak wedding season and being a photographer this is severely hampering my work. I am utilizing this time on exploring new horizons for expanding my business for corporates and advertisements. I am eagerly waiting for this lockdown to end on May 3 so that I can visit my parents who stay alone in Patna.

Prem Singh

Cinematographer and photographer

The lockdown extension till May 3 was much needed. Presently all basic commodities are being made available with home delivery services.

If it ends on May 3, we would certainly be avoiding movie theatres and restaurants for the next few months as well. I would like to take my children out for a drive as they have been house bound since much before the Janta curfew on March 22. I am also looking forward to meeting my family and friends.

Richa Patel

Homemaker

From the hospitality industry point of view the extension is a very good step. It is going to take a while before the full fledged operations can be resumed at the hotel and prior to that the entire property will also have to be sanitized to ensure safety of our guests. The plan is also to not open all the rooms at one go. Banquets will certainly not be functional to avoid any gatherings. I am also looking forward to getting back to my regular routine of going to work everyday.

100,15-4-20,"3 more test +ve, count reaches 27 in State","Three fresh cases of Covid-19 – two in Ranchi and one in Simdega– surfaced on Tuesday in State, health officials said. The two suspects from Ranchi, who tested positive in the latest lab test, are related to coronavirus patients from Hindpiri – a locality that has emerged as a hotspot of the lethal virus in the State capital, they added.

The Simdega patient attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi, and his samples were collected earlier this month. ""This is the first case in Simdega. The number of cases in Ranchi has now increased to 13 – all of them are from Hindpiri,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. ""The two Hindpiri residents who tested positive are youngsters. They must be around 30-year-old,"" he added.

By the time this report was filed, Jharkhand had 27 cases of COVID-19. Out of the 27 cases, 13 are from Ranchi, two from Hazaribag, nine from Bokaro, and one each from Simdega, Koderma and Giridih. The entry of the virus in Simdega –a largely backward district with limited resources– is a cause for concern since the district is poverty-stricken and has a huge population of illiterate people, officials said.

Ranchi, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases among all the districts in Jharkhand, has all its cases saturated in Hindpiri locality. The locality was sealed last month after more than half a dozen cases from the area came to light.

Jharkhand's first coronavirus patient was also apprehended from a Mosque in the area. She had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi – a fact that highlights the impact of the religious gathering on Ranchi. Although only three of the 27 patients here attended the religious gathering, they infected many non-attendees in the State. ""The Malaysian woman who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event was the first carrier of the virus to Hindpiri,"" said a health official in the thick of events here.

The number of coronavirus cases in Jharkhand has witnessed an unprecedented rise in the month of April. The first case here was reported on March 31, and the cases were in single digit by April 5. However, the numbers skyrocketed and neared 30 by Tuesday.

The virus has claimed two lives in the State so far – one each from Ranchi and Bokaro. Meanwhile, the Ranchi district administration is looking for a place where the bodies of Covid-19 victims can be buried. Locals have refused to allow burial of Covid-19 victims in residential areas.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/3-more-test--ve--count-reaches-27-in-state.html

105,15-4-20,Remove 18% GST on ads on broadcast media or reduce it to 5%: NBA to FM,"The News Broadcasters Association on Tuesday urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to remove the 18 per cent GST on advertisements on broadcast media or reduce it and bring it at par with the print media industry at 5 per cent in the wake of the financial constraints being faced by the industry.

NBA president Rajat Sharma, in a letter to Sitharaman, said in order to ensure social distancing and for ensuring the safety of the editorial personnel, the news broadcasters have had to take various steps which have resulted in the operating costs going up exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""You will appreciate that advertisements are an integral and essential part of the business and the main source of revenue for the news broadcasters which has come under severe pressure during this pandemic/lock down,"" Sharma said.

Advertising agencies are putting huge pressure to defer the payments to broadcasters and to allow more time over and above the 60 days credit period, he said, adding that the recovery of bills is going to be hugely challenging, while facing an even bigger task of almost zero or negligible income in the next 30-90 days.

""While the news broadcasters are coping with the financial problems of recovery of dues, we are also faced with serious problems of advertising inventory/release orders being cancelled and inventory bookings being less than 50 percent for even the top-rated news channel,"" Sharma said.

Poor recovery and lack of future income would mean that the news broadcasters would have to weather the storm for two or three quarters and hope for a partial recovery towards the end of the financial year, he said in the letter.

""In these trying circumstances, as part of the stimulus package, we request you to kindly remove the 18 per cent GST on advertisements or reduce it and bring it in par with the print media industry i.e. at 5 per cent,"" Sharma said.

It may also be kept in mind that the news genre has been recognized as an ""essential service"" in various government circulars and advisories and also by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his speech to the nation, he said.

Gadkari, in an official statement, also called upon the industry to look upon the present crisis as a challenge and opportunity, especially as some countries are looking to move away their investments from China, and India can be one of the best options for them.

Gadkari said the highways construction which saw reaching record level in the last fiscal, should increase pace by 2-3 times in coming years to meet growing needs of the infrastructure sector.

He said, Indian industry should look at the current situation as a blessing in disguise and aim towards improving its export potential.

107,15-4-20,"‘Stars, planetary movements warn of another disaster’’","Malayalees all over the world celebrated Vishu, Kerala’s national festival as well as the Malayalam New Year Day. Vishu falls on the first of Medam (Mesham in Sanskrit and Aries in English).

It also marks the beginning of agricultural operations in the State. The day begins with members of the family raising up early in the morning to see the pre-arranged Vishu Kani (the first sight of the day), a picture or statue of Lord Krishna decorated with jewelry, flowers fruits and gold or silver coins.

The family head offers coins to each member of the family with the blessings that the recipient continues to get bountiful of prosperity in months and days to come throughput the year.

Along with human beings, the cattle in the family are worshipped with Vishu Kani and they are fed well. In the course of the day, the family members complete the daily chores and wear new garments popularly known as Vishu Kodi.

Yesteryears used to see the family astrologer coming calling with predictions/forecasts for the remaining part of the year and collect his due from the head of the house. “Pathayam (granary) will be full, there would be sufficient rains, cattle herds would increase, there will be all -round prosperity and no possibility of any hardship,” the astrologer would tell and explain the movement of stars and planets from one position to another to substantiate his claims.

While this year’s Vishu was a subdued affair in the backdrop of the pandemic by name Corona Virus, one had to call on the astrologers to find out what was in store for the country and the countrymen. PM Gopala Menon , Thanthrik and Sanskrit scholar and his son Dr M G Gireeshan, a physicist-turned-astrologer are of the view that bad time is not yet over for the world.

“Those who are born in stars belonging to the three central planets (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius) are in for tough times. This is applicable to persons born under Aswathy (Aswani in Sanskrit), Bharani, Karthika(Krithika), Makam (Magha), Pooram (Poorva Phalguni) , Uthram (Uthara Phalguni) , Moolam, Pooradam Poorva Aashada) and Uthradam (Uthara Aashada),” said Menon.

He said persons coming under the judicature of other nine planets may not have much difficulties. Menon forecasts that there would be a repetition in 2020 of what happened with Jupiter in the last calendar year.

“The pandemic corona virus was because of the transition of Jupiter to Sagittarius. This year also there is a transition of Jupiter to Sagittarius followed by another transition. This does not augur well during the November 2020 to May 2021 phase. We can expect some kind of pandemic or natural disasters like flood or earthquakes during this phase. But life will return to normal after May 2021,” he said.

Dr Gireeshan, a scientist with nearly 200 innovations to his credit ( including anti-piracy technology which could be used in film industry), said we can expect a comprehensive transformation in the education sector this year. ‘There is all likelihood of the Central Government ushering in courses meant for skill development and allowing the entry of foreign universities to open shop in India. Ayurveda is likely to take precedence over others in days to come,” said Dr Gireeshan.

For those who describe astrology as hogwash, the physicist in Dr Gireeshan has this to tell: “Columbia University’s research team used computer algorithms to assess a data base of health records of more than 1.7 million patients from 1985 to 2013 and found that a person’s birth month is related to the development of certain health conditions. This finding has been published in the Journal of American Medical Informatics Associaton,” he said.

We need to wait only till November 2020 to see whether this comes true.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---stars--planetary-movements-warn-of-another-disaster------.html

While on Monday 98 persons were found to be suffering from the virus attack, Tuesday saw the number of persons tested positive coming down to 31. This was announced by Dr Beela Rajesh in her daily press briefing at Chennai.

A visibly relaxed Dr Rajesh said that the reduction in the number of persons tested positive for corona-19 could be the impact of the containment activities being pursued by the Government led by Edappadi Palaniswami. “This is an imported disease which was alien to tamil nadu. We have taken all measures to contain and restrict the spread of the disease and our efforts are paying off,” said the health secretary.

The Central Government must ensure that no starvation deaths occur.

“The financial package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore announced so far is very meager. It amounts to less than 1 per cent of the country’s GDP.

115,15-4-20,Presence of ‘bat Covid' in 2 Indian bat species,"As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, researchers have found the presence of a different kind of coronavirus — bat coronavirus (BtCoV) — in two bat species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, according to a first of its study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

According to the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, there is no evidence or research to claim that these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans, said Dr Pragya D Yadav, Scientist at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and also the first author of study.

Twenty-five bats of Rousettus and Pteropus species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were found positive for BtCoV in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.

""These bat coronaviruses have no relation with SARS-CoV2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Yadav said, adding that Pteropus bat species were earlier found positive for Nipah virus in 2018 and 2019 in Kerala.

""Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats,"" the objective of the study titled 'Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus and Rousettus species of bats from different states of India' stated.

""In the present scenario of changing demography and ecological manipulations, it is challenging to have checks on the encounters of bats with other animals and humans,"" the study stated, highlighting that the need for active and continuous surveillance remains crucial for outbreak alerts for bat-associated viral agents with epidemic potential, which would be helpful in timely interventions.

""Although CoVs in the subfamily coronavirinae do not usually produce clinical symptoms in their natural hosts (bats), accidental transmission of these viruses to humans and other animals may result in respiratory, enteric, hepatic or neurologic diseases of variable severity. It is still not understood as to why only certain CoVs can infect people,"" the study said.

The scientists stressed on the need of proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats.

The detection and identification of such viruses from bats also recommends cross-sectional antibody surveys (human and domestic animals) in localities where the viruses have been detected.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/presence-of----bat-covid--in-2-indian-bat-species.html

India had imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, all domestic and international commercial passenger flights were suspended for this time period.

However, most of the airlines had been taking bookings except national carrier Air India for domestic flights for the period beyond April 14.

“We are in the process of cancelling the affected bookings and we will offer customers free of charge rescheduling to another date until December 31, 2020,” a Vistara spokesperson told PTI in statement.

The customer, however, will have to pay the fare difference, if any, at the time of rebooking, the airline said.

A GoAir spokesperson said that it has already “factored in” these type of scenario and that the airline will review its earlier scheme of providing rescheduling free of cost at a later date while protecting their existing bookings for one year.

117,15-4-20,US OK’s H-1B extension,"In a big relief for thousands of stranded Indian professionals in America due to the coronavirus pandemic, the US Government has decided to accept their H-1B visa applications for an extended stay in the country.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a new notification has said it recognises that there are immigration-related challenges as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The announcement comes at a time when countries around the world have closed their borders and all international passenger flights have been suspended globally.

The travel restrictions have left a number of H-1B visa holders stranded in the US with their visa permits soon to expire. However, the DHS will shortly start accepting applications for the extension of expiring visas.

“We recognise that non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to COVID-19,” the DHS said.

“We continue to carefully analyse these issues and to leverage our resources to effectively address these challenges within our existing authorities. The DHS also continues to take action to protect the American people and our communities, and is considering a number of policies and procedures to improve the employment opportunities of US workers during this pandemic,” it said.

Generally, non-immigrants must depart the United States before their authorised period of admission expires, it said.

Non-immigrants could apply for an extension of stay (EOS) or change of status (COS) permit. Without a visa extension, thousands of students and professionals in the US would have suffered.

If applicants put in their forms within the specified time frame, their presence will not be taken as “unlawful” and where applicable, “employment authorisation with the same employer, subject to the same terms and conditions of the prior approval, is automatically extended for up to 240 days …when an extension of stay request is filed on time,” the notification said.

The US Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) added that it “reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances.”

According to rules, if an employer terminates the contract of an H-1B holder, the employee needs to find new employment within 60 days, in order to retain the visa status. Indian IT workers have been seeking an extension of this 60 day grace period to 180 days.

According to the USCIS, Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/us-ok---s-h-1b-extension.html

128,15-4-20,Kin of departed forced to bid hurried farewells due to lockdown,"The coronavirus lockdown across the entire country it seems has not even spared the dead. It has also affected the crematoriums and cemeteries where people used to gather for the last rites of their loved ones.

Now only a few people are able to attend funerals due to the social distancing and lockdown which has affected the conduct of rituals and immersion of ashes.

Eight to 10 bodies are brought daily to the crematorium at Tajganj in Agra, and more people have started coming in since the last few days for the rituals.

IANS spoke to a crematorium worker here who said that ""only 4 to 5 people are allowed to come in for the funeral procedure. It is the same as before. No change has been made.""

""But earlier we used to give the ashes to the kin in 2 days or used to give it to someone within 3 to 4 hours in an emergency, but now people have to keep the ashes and the main reason is the lockdown as people do not have facilities for cremation and burial.""

On being asked if he observed in any changes in the cremation of people who died due to coronavirus, he said that the bodies are cremated as soon as they arrive. It is done hurriedly and no customs are observed.

Manoj Kumar, who had come to attend the funeral of a relative, told IANS that ""there is a lot of difference due to the lockdown. If there were any deaths in our area earlier, around 200 to 250 people would have gathered and all customs of cremation were followed, but now the situation has changed a lot, as barely 5 to 8 people are joining. According to custom, the head shaving of male relatives has to be done but now it could not happen as the priests are afraid to come here, so we have not been able to do the ‘pooja' properly.""

""Because of the lockdown, the remains cannot be taken to Haridwar. We do not know how to follow the customs now,"" he said. When IANS spoke to a gravedigger at a cemetery, he also said that ""there are no crowds now, just a few people come and when the body is buried, we tell the family members to leave immediately.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/kin-of-departed-forced-to-bid-hurried-farewells-due-to-lockdown.html

Locals protesting the setting up of a quarantine centre in a school hostel at Churulia in industrial district of Burdwan West clashed with the police leaving several men in khaki injured, local sources said adding a massive reinforcement from Jamuria police station in Asansol had to be rushed in to bring the situation under control.

The police even had to fire tear-gas shells and resort to baton-charge to bring the crowd under control. The incident left at least 10 cops injured. The policemen have been hospitalized.

""It was a minor skirmish and has been brought under control,"" a senior police officer said adding.

Similar clashes had earlier occurred at Parui in Birbhum district where two groups clashed with bombs and guns over setting up of a quarantine centre leaving one person dead early this month.

The incident takes place close on the heels of Union Home Ministry dashing off three reminders to the Bengal Government asking it to enforce lock-down more seriously and efficiently.

Elsewhere in Kolkata senior Trinamool Congress leaders have chosen to discount” Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s lockdown jibes at the Mamata Banerjee Government “advising him to stand by the Government and inspire the people instead of taking political potshots.”

The Governor had in reference to the Union Government’s letters to the State Government asking it to properly enforce the lockdown had said that the State was not keeping him in the loop “about measures taken by it in fighting the corona outbreak.

He said that the Chief Minister should “end the lockdown with Raj Bhavan,” adding “officials be held accountable for lapses” in failing to enforce social distancing and allow religious congregations as referred to by the Centre. He also asked the state government to shun politics and take MHA warnings seriously.

Referring to the Governor’s tweet a senior minister in the State Government said “let us discount what he says because we are engaged in dealing with a serious thing like corona.”

Meanwhile, the Medicine Department of the age-old Calcutta Medical College was shut down on Tuesday following reports corona infections.

It was the second such department after the Gynaecology unit having to be shut on Monday following similar reports, sources said.

130,15-4-20,No respite for stranded passengers till May 3,"There was no relief for passengers, either stranded or unable to proceed with their travel plans. Passenger trains as well as domestic and international flight operations will remain suspended till May 3, when the second lockdown period is scheduled to end, the Civil Aviation Ministry and Indian Railways announced on Tuesday shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement regarding the extension.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement, “All domestic and international scheduled airlines operations shall remain suspended till 11.59 pm of 3rd May 2020”.

This means, by May 3 international flights will be barred for a total of 42 days and domestic flights for 40 days.

The domestic airlines have again decided not to refund the customers in cash for their cancelled flights and instead offer them with the option of rescheduling of tickets for a later date without any additional fee.

The Indian Railways, for its part, announced that all train services, barring special parcel trains and freight trains, will remain suspended till the lockdown ends on May 3.

However, there is no restriction on cargo flights. The government has taken the help of passenger airlines like Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet, apart from BlueDart, for transportation of essential medical supplies within the country as well as to Shanghai, Hong Kong and Colombo.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation banned international flights from March 23 and the ban for domestic flights came into effect two days later, on March 25.

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said there were good reasons for the lockdown to be extended till May 3. ""We can consider lifting restrictions on both domestic and international flights thereafter. I understand the problems being faced by people who need to travel and request them to bear with us,"" the minister tweeted.

It remains to be seen if the ministry takes a decision on passengers’ complaints of airlines not offering refunds for cancelled flights and instead giving credit vouchers for future travel for the amount booked. This has been a major issue for the passengers.

While many people wanted to know the status of their flights since there was no update on the respective airlines' websites, several others have been demanding nothing less than a full and immediate refund.

Air India had earlier this month itself stopped taking bookings for flights in April. IndiGo, and its peers including SpiceJet and GoAir, were accepting bookings for travel from April 15.

Several airlines such as GoAir, SpiceJet and IndiGo have given customers the option of creating a credit shell for the amount of their cancelled flight ticket, a sort of coupon which can be redeemed within a year. Meanwhile, cancellation of tickets in many cases would

involve a deduction of charges, which would mean a loss on the part of the customer.

The Indian Railways, however, said that full refund of fare would automatically be provided to its online customers for trains cancelled up to May 3, while those who have booked at the counters can claim the refund till July 31. Customers will also get full refunds of their tickets if they are cancelling their advance bookings for trains not yet cancelled, it said.

It said no advance reservation of trains tickets, including e-tickets, will be allowed till further orders. However, facility of online cancellation will remain functional.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-respite-for-stranded-passengers-till-may-3.html
131,15-4-20,"Trump Admin OK’s sale of missiles, torpedoes to India","Days after India airlifted more that 29 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the US for its battle against the raging coronavirus pandemic there, the Donald Trump administration reciprocated the gesture by giving the nod for sale of missiles and torpedoes worth over 155 million dollars to India. Moreover, this approval on Monday came a few weeks after the two countries inked two deals worth over three billion dollars during the US President’s visit to New Delhi.

India is the biggest producer of the anti-malaria drug HCQ in the world and Trump, who believes that this drug will be the “game changer” in battling the pandemic, had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lift the export ban on it. The restrictions were imposed on March 25 and following request from Trump and some other world leaders, the ban was relaxed last week.

Thanking Modi, Trump had said on Wednesday last week said India's help during this crisis will not be forgotten.

Given this backdrop and also the US President’s assertion during his visit to India that his country is always willing to supply state-of-the-art weapons to the Indian armed forces besides forging closer military to military alliance, the US administration on Monday notified the Congress of its determination to sell Harpoon Block II air launched missiles and lightweight torpedoes worth USD 155 million to India.

The sale of 10 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II air launched missiles is estimated to cost USD 92 million, while 16 MK 54 All Up Round Lightweight Torpedoes and three MK 54 Exercise Torpedoes are estimated to cost USD 63 million, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in two separate notifications to the Congress.

A determination in this regard was recently made by the US State Department following a request for these two weapons systems by the Indian government, the Pentagon said. According to the Pentagon, the Harpoon missile system will be integrated into the P-8I long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft to conduct anti-surface warfare missions in defence of critical sea lanes while enhancing inter-operability with the United States and other allied forces.

The Indian Navy has eight P-8I aircraft and will go in for four more such aircraft to enhance its reach in the strategically important Indian Ocean where growing maritime prowess of China is a matter of concern.

""India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense. India intends to utilize MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes on its P-8I aircraft.

India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces,"" the Pentagon said. While the Harpoon missiles will be manufactured by Boeing, the torpedoes would be supplied by Raytheon, the notification said.

The proposed sale, it said, will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats from enemy weapon systems. The MK 54 Lightweight Torpedo will provide the capability to conduct anti-submarine warfare missions.

In both the notifications, the Pentagon said the proposed sale of these equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. According to the Pentagon, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/trump-admin-ok---s-sale-of-missiles--torpedoes-to-india.html

The forecast will give a clear indication of this year’s monsoon rainfall during June-September. The four-month monsoon season is from June 1 to September 30.

According to the IMD, more definite picture will emerge through second stage forecast in last week of May or in first week of June. June 1 is the onset date for monsoon over Kerala and it is likely to remain the same but the IMD will change the reference dates for some states and cities.

The Japanese and South Korean models have retained their outlook for a reasonably good monsoon for India, with the former betting on a moderately positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) nearer home to continue. One of the strongest positive IOD events had last year driven the 2019 monsoon to a multi-year high, even delaying its withdrawal from the country and delivering rainfall of 110 per cent.

As per the IMD, after 1994 (110% of Long Period Average (LPA)), rainfall received in 2019 (110 % of LPA) is the highest season rainfall received by the country as a whole.

On March 27, the airline had also introduced compulsory leave without pay for up to three days between April 1 and April 14 for the same set of senior employees.

The compulsory no-pay leave will affect around 1,200 employees in senior grades. The remaining 2,800 employees of the airline such as members of cabin crew and ground handling services will be unaffected.

The Vistara chief said in an email to employees, which has been accessed by PTI, that the airline is planning to restart flight operations in a phased manner whenever the government allows it to do so.

""With the announcement by the government of India on extending the lockdown, we continue to suspend all our domestic and international operations till May 3,2020 and this further impacted significantly on our cash flow with no revenue being generated over an extended period of time,"" Thng said.

He said the airline has made ""some progress"" with a few of its key partners and suppliers in ""reducing and/or deferring"" some of its immediate operating expenditures.

Thng added the airline continues to pursue similar measures ""aggressively"" with other partners and suppliers.

He mentioned the airline has to take a ""tough and difficult decision"" on reducing staff costs with the objective to preserve jobs.

""Therefore, for the period April 15 to April 30 we will continue with Compulsory No Pay Leave (CNPL) for all staff, except for staff in Level 1A and 1B, as follows: Staff in Level 4 and 5 to go on three days CNPL, Staff in Level 2 and 3 to go on two days CNPL, Staff in Level 1C to go on one day CNPL,"" he said.

The above CNPL is in addition to what Vistara had implemented for the period of April 1 to April 14, Thng noted.

""While the situation remains fluid, we are planning to resume flight operations in a phased manner whenever authorities allow us to do so,"" the CEO stated.

""For the initial period, we may not be able to fully restore our suspended network and therefore our financials will continue to be adversely impacted. We must continue our focus on cutting expenditures, including continuing some of the measures that we have implemented in April,"" he said.

Reacting on the decision, Vistara spokesperson said, ""The extension of lockdown and suspension of our services till May 3, 2020 further impacts our cash flow significantly. As part of a number of steps we are taking to conserve cash and save costs, we had to make the difficult decision of further reducing our staff costs with the objective of preserving jobs.

""For the period between April 15-30, 2020, about 30 per cent of Vistara's workforce will take compulsory no-pay leave of one to three days, depending on employment grades (three days for senior-most employees). This decision does not impact the remainder 70 per cent of Vistara staff,"" he added.

140,15-4-20,North Korea fires multiple suspected cruise missiles,"North Korea on Tuesday fired several suspected cruise missiles towards the sea, the South’s military said.

The “multiple projectiles” fired from Munchon in the east of the country were believed to be “short-range cruise missiles,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.

The test comes a day before the nuclear-armed North marks the 108th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong Un.

It also comes a day before the South holds parliamentary elections, and at a time when the world’s attention has been largely focussed on the coronavirus pandemic, which Pyongyang insists it has so far escaped.

The North has repeatedly tested ballistic missiles in recent years, which climb high above the Earth, often into space, before being brought down towards their targets at high speed by the force of gravity.

Its arsenal includes ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) that are capable of reaching the whole of the US mainland. In contrast cruise missiles travel at low altitudes — sometimes just a few metres (feet) above the surface, making them hard to detect — and are powered throughout their flight. Sometimes highly manoeuvrable, they need sophisticated guidance systems to bring them to their targets.

Tuesday’s missiles travelled over the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, before coming down in the water, the JCS said. “South Korea and US intelligence authorities are closely analysing related issues,” they added.

The North is subject to multiple UN Security Council sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.

It has carried out a series of weapons tests in recent months, often describing them as multiple launch rocket systems while others have called them ballistic missiles. Pyongyang has fired cruise missiles in the past. In June 2017 it hailed the successful test of a what it called a new type of surface-to-ship cruise missile designed to hit “any enemy group of battleships” that threatened North Korea.

That launch hit targets in the Sea of Japan, it said, and took place the week after two US aircraft carriers, the USS Carl Vinson and USS Ronald Reagan, took part in naval manoeuvres in the area.

Those missiles flew some 200 kilometres, which analysts said was an improvement on a 2015 test that flew only 100 kilometres. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump traded mutual insults and threats of war during 2017, sending tensions soaring.

142,15-4-20,SE Asia leaders meet by video on pandemic,"Forced apart by the coronavirus pandemic, Southeast Asian leaders linked up by video on Tuesday to plot a strategy to overcome a crisis that has threatened their economies and kept millions of people in their homes under lockdowns.

The 10 leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations held further talks later in the day, also through video conferencing, with their counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea, who expressed support in helping ASEAN fight the coronavirus. Vietnam, ASEAN’s leader this year, has postponed an in-person gathering tentatively to June.

“It is in these grim hours that the solidarity of the ASEAN community shines like a beacon in the dark,” Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in an opening speech. Containment efforts have placed the pandemic “actually under control”, he said, warning against complacency, with a number of member countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines, fearing spikes in infections after large-scale testing is conducted.

Founded in 1967 in the Cold War era, ASEAN — a diverse bloc representing more than 640 million people — has held annual summits of its leaders and top diplomats with ceremonies steeped in tradition, protocol and photo-ops.

Derided as a talk shop by critics, the bloc is known largely for photographs of its leaders locking arms at annual meetings in a show of unity despite often-thorny differences.

Diplomats say that unity is now crucial as the region battles COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. All of ASEAN’s member states have been hit by infections, with the total number of confirmed cases reaching more than 20,400, including over 840 deaths, despite massive lockdowns, travel restrictions and home quarantines.

144,15-4-20,India Inc stands by lockdown extension call,"India Inc on Tuesday said the nationwide lockdown extension was necessary to avert a humanitarian crisis, but insisted on the need for a stimulus package to rebuild the economy hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the current lockdown will be extended till May 3, saying it is necessary to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.

He said detailed guidelines on implementation of the new lockdown will be announced on

Wednesday, and some relaxations may be allowed after April 20 in places where there are no hotspots.

The catastrophic effect of the lockdown on the overall economy and livelihoods of lakhs of migrant workers triggered severe concerns following which a number of state chief ministers in their video conference with Modi on Saturday sought some sort of relaxation for a number of sectors.

Late last month, the government announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package aimed at providing relief to those hit hard by the lockdown as well as an insurance cover for healthcare professionals handling virus infected people.

“Estimates show that India may be losing close to Rs 40,000 crore daily due to the national lockdown with an estimated loss amounting to Rs 7-8 lakh crore during the past 21 days,” said Ficci President Sangita Reddy.

Further, it is also expected that close to 40 million jobs are at risk during the period April-Sept 2020. Hence, an urgent relief package is also critical, she said.

148,15-4-20,IMF slashes India’s growth rate to 1.9% in 2020,"The IMF on Tuesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth to 1.9 per cent in 2020 from 5.8 per cent in January, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s

due to the raging coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities across the world.

With this subdued forecast, India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation. But the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its latest edition of the World Economy report, said India and China are the only two major countries, which will register a positive growth rate.

The IMF has projected a growth rate of 1.2 per cent for China in 2020 — the slowest in more than four decades.

However, the two Asian giants are likely to bounce back strongly in 2021 with India expected to grow at 7.4 per cent and China at 9.2 per cent. “We project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 per cent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period,” Indian-American Gita Gopinath, the IMF Chief Economist said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic will severely impact growth across all regions.

The Great Depression was the worst worldwide economic downturn that lasted for 10 years from 1929, beginning in the US when the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street crashed and wiped out millions of investors.

Most countries, in the advanced economy group, are forecast to contract this year, including the US (–5.9 per cent), Japan (–5.2 per cent), the United Kingdom (–6.5 per cent), Germany (–7.0 per cent), France (–7.2 per cent), Italy (–9.1 per cent), and Spain (–8.0 per cent), the IMF report said.

Even with a sharp rebound in the remainder of the year and sizable fiscal support, the Chinese economy is projected to grow at a subdued 1.2 per cent in 2020.

The IMF said several economies in the region were forecast to grow at modest rates, including India (1.9 per cent) and Indonesia (0.5 per cent), and others are forecast to experience large contractions (Thailand, –6.7 per cent).

In January, IMF projected India’s growth at 5.8 per cent in 2020 and 6.5 per cent in 2021.

On Tuesday, the IMF said that other regions are projected to experience severe slowdowns or outright contractions in economic activity, including Latin America (–5.2 per cent) — with Brazil’s growth forecast at –5.3 per cent and Mexico’s at –6.6 per cent; emerging and developing Europe (–5.2 per cent) with Russia’s economy projected to contract by –5.5 per cent.

The Middle East and Central Asia (–2.8 per cent) with Saudi Arabia’s growth forecast at –2.3 per cent, with non-oil GDP contracting by four per cent, and most economies, including Iran, expected to contract; and sub-Saharan Africa (–1.6 per cent) with growth in Nigeria and South Africa expected at –3.4 per cent and –5.8 per cent respectively.

This is a crisis like no other, and there is substantial uncertainty about its impact on people’s lives and livelihoods, Gopinath said. A lot depends on the epidemiology of the virus, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the development of therapeutics and vaccines, all of which are hard to predict.

In addition, many countries now face multiple crises — a health crisis, a financial crisis, and a collapse in commodity prices, which interact in complex ways, she said.

Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, Gopinath said the IMF projects global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 per cent.

This is a truly global crisis as no country is spared, Gopinath said. Countries reliant on tourism, travel, hospitality, and entertainment for their growth are experiencing particularly large disruptions, she added.

The emerging markets and developing economies face additional challenges with unprecedented reversals in capital flows as global risk appetite wanes, and currency pressures, while coping with weaker health systems, and more limited fiscal space to provide support. Moreover, several economies entered this crisis in a vulnerable state with sluggish growth and high debt levels, the IMF chief economist wrote.

According to the World Economic Report, the rebound in 2021 depends critically on the pandemic fading in the second half of 2020, allowing containment efforts to be gradually scaled back and restoring consumer and investor confidence.

Significant economic policy actions have already been taken across the world, focused on accommodating public health care requirements, while limiting the amplification to economic activity and the financial system.

The projected recovery assumes that these policy actions are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, it said. India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation this fiscal year as the coronavirus outbreak severely disrupts the economy, the World Bank said on Sunday.

India’s economy is expected to grow 1.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal which started on April 1, the World Bank said in its South Asia Economic Focus report. It estimated India will grow 4.8 per cent to 5 per cent in the 2019-20 fiscal that ended on March 31.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf-slashes-india---s-growth-rate-to-1-9--in-2020-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/imf-slashes-india---s-growth-rate-to-1-9--in-2020.html
149,15-4-20,"Obama endorses Biden for Prez, says ex-VP has ‘qualities we need’","Former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden in a video on Tuesday, giving the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee a boost from the party’s biggest fundraiser and one of its most popular figures.

“I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,” Obama said in a nearly 12- minute video, touting him as a “close friend” and lauding him for his perseverance and compassion.

Obama and Biden are close friends from their two terms in the White House, when Biden served as vice president. Biden leaned heavily on his affiliation with the former president throughout the Democratic primary, framing his pitch as an extension of Obama’s presidency. In recent weeks, he has told donors he’s been in touch with Obama about his vice-presidential pick.

The endorsement marks Obama’s return to presidential politics more than three years after leaving the White House. He rarely talks directly about his successor, President Donald Trump, and avoided intervening in the Democratic primary. The field at one point spanned nearly two dozen candidates and Obama offered private counsel to anyone who asked it, but but made no efforts to bolster an individual campaign — including Biden’s.

But Obama has been following the Democratic race closely from the sidelines and is eager to take a more active public role in the campaign.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/obama-endorses-biden-for-prez--says-ex-vp-has----qualities-we-need---.html
150,15-4-20,China’s ‘mask diplomacy’ wins support in Eastern Europe,"When China’s first shipment of coronavirus medical aid landed in Belgrade, the president of Serbia was there to kiss the Chinese flag. In Hungary, officials have played down assistance from the European Union and praised Beijing’s help. In the Czech Republic, its president says that only China was there during the virus spread.

While elsewhere China tries to polish an image tarnished by its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has no problem maintaining its hard-won influence in parts of Eastern Europe, where it battles for clout with the EU as well as with Russia.

China was criticized in the West for its early mishandling of the health crisis due to politically motivated foot-dragging while the virus raced through a major province and its capital, Wuhan. Now it is seeking to change perceptions through “mask diplomacy” — a combination of soft power policy, political messaging and aid shipments — to portray Beijing as a generous and efficient ally.

China for years has been increasing its political and economic influence in southeastern Europe through its Belt and Road global investment projects. Its image-polishing after the outbreak found fertile ground in places like Serbia and Hungary, whose populist leaders nurture close ties with Beijing or Moscow.

The aid shipments also drew praise in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, although some virus test kits and face masks purchased from Chinese companies caused a stir because they didn’t meet local standards.

“We must be aware there is a geopolitical component, including a struggle for influence, through spinning and the politics of generosity,” EU’s top foreign policy official Josep Borrell recently wrote in a blog, referring to China. “Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.”

Chinese officials have repeatedly rejected claims that Beijing is seeking political gains by providing medical aid to other countries amid the virus, saying the allegations result from deep-rooted misperceptions of China’s goals in the West.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing is doing what it can “to help those countries and people affected ... to save and safeguard people’s lives and health to the greatest extent across the world.”

In Serbia, a candidate for EU membership, officials and state-controlled media have played down the millions of euros in grants and loans from Brussels while praising Chinese deliveries, donations and sales of supplies. Opposition groups have demanded that the aid from China be disclosed and stacked up against the EU’s apparently much larger assistance, but those calls have been ignored.

The pro-China narrative included billboards supporting Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic routinely describes as his “brother,” as well as suggestions that a monument be erected to honor Belgrade’s friendship with Beijing.

“European solidarity does not exist. Only China can help,” Vucic said last month while announcing a nationwide state of emergency that gave him expanded powers in the health crisis. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, has pledged 15 million euros in immediate support for Serbia’s health sector, plus 78.4 million euros to help with its social and economic recovery.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china---s----mask-diplomacy----wins-support-in-eastern-europe.html

152,15-4-20,Think out of box,"Innovation and entrepreneurship education is in the limelight. Ritesh Goyal lists trending changes that will shape the industry

Over the last two decades, the study of entrepreneurship has expanded from just the study of entrepreneurs and market research to a much broader subject. Now, the study also incorporates entrepreneurial behavior patterns of an individual, a company and the market, start-ups, and scale-ups, the different business partnerships, societal and economic development, and others. Students are showing immense interest in becoming entrepreneurs than working for someone else.

India has become the third-largest start-up ecosystem and numerous start-ups are emerging every day with the hope of rising to the top. Universities are making an effort to bring the right infrastructure in place to enhance entrepreneurship education. The number of universities now offering the entrepreneurship course is slowly rising and soon we will be looking at more reformed programs that also help second-third generation entrepreneurs to help scale their business.

Let us look at the five trending changes that promise to uplift the innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem:

Incorporate entrepreneurial eco-system and learning: The universities and colleges have started acknowledging and providing entrepreneurial courses, and are now focusing on building an advanced curriculum that will form the heart of this unique program. More experiential learning, implementation of innovative ideas, live projects, building business models, facing real-world challenges, outside classroom learning, is what will encourage and prepare the students for what the market has to offer.

Inclusiveness and mass reach: Institutions have started marketing the benefits and learning of entrepreneurial education. Since, when it comes to business, we see more male candidates and also people who have money to invest, the whole marketing strategy is based out on the awareness of investors available for financial support and how women can benefit and make this career choice their own. The whole start-up scenario needs diversity and inclusion, which is now being worked upon and is open to all those who has a mind for business.

Building innovation labs and creative workspace: The next thing institutes are looking forward to is building innovation labs and workspace where the students have the tools, materials, and training they need to create prototypes and play around with innovation. A few colleges have already established such spaces inside their campus for the betterment of the students. We are looking at more communities coming forward and building such an innovative space where the students get to nurture their innovation potential.

Boot camps and competitions: A budding entrepreneur needs the push to do his best. Rigorous training programmes should be conducted frequently that enrich the students with new ideas, techniques, resources, networks, investors, tools, infrastructure, and the right mentor is what will drive them launch their start-ups and make it a flourishing business. Competitions with other budding entrepreneurs over innovative products and services will give them the boost they need to ideate and strategise. The boot camps will help the students grow a business sense, talk to investors and grow their network on a national and global platform.

Going global: Global problems need global solutions. Institutions and Governments have started collaborating on using young minds to think and act globally. Budding entrepreneurs now think of problems from a global angle and are coming up with solutions that may eradicate some major global issues like pollution, global warming, and the availability of clean water. The Government has started grants and is investing in such projects so that entrepreneurs can present them in front of a Global forum.

153,15-4-20,Internships can help,"Companies like to hire those who have interned. Karan Chhabra tells you how internships can give graduates an edge

Internship programmes are a great way for graduates to learn how organisations work in practice. While graduates have a lot of theory under their belts, internship programmes help them translate it into practical knowledge. Internships also present them the opportunity to network with industry peers; often, this very networking results in a full-time job. In fact, an internship is widely regarded as the first step towards working full-time with an organisation.

Here are some ways in which an internship benefits graduates.

Experience first-hand knowledge: Theory and practice are two very different things. What is possible theoretically often fails in practice and vice versa. However, that is not the case when students become interns; it is only then that they are able to translate learnings into practice.

Student have a world of theory under their belt. By joining a company, they will understand how knowledge gained in a university will be applied at a workplace. They will also gauge the workings of an organisation. Interns can test the dynamics of an office environment to understand the kind of people they will work with in the future. They will understand what types of skills they will need to excel professionally. Back in college, they can think over their experience and determine what they need to become successful leaders.

The necessity of a network: Networking plays a huge role in building a successful career. It is fair to say that there is nothing more crucial. Those who learn how to network arm themselves with contacts that will helpful in the future.

Without a secure network, even the most gifted professionals will struggle in their careers. With the help of a reliable system, even an average employee can reach the upper echelons of an industry. After a point in a person’s career, the right mix of talent and network is required to achieve success.

Learn leadership skills: Having excellent leadership skills is almost a prerequisite for success in any domain. In fact, every company needs a good leader. Achieving goals and driving large teams is impossible without excellent leadership skills.

During an internship, graduates get the chance to see leadership in action. They see first-hand the qualities of great leaders. An intern is usually part of a team and is expected to learn and contribute to the collective efforts. They are exceptionally well-poised to gain because they are young and adaptable. By observing the actions of leaders, interns learn how to manage team dynamics.

Build a résumé and improve skills: When it is time to look for a full-time job, where one interned becomes vital. Organisations like to hire people who have interned in leading organisations.

An intern has the advantage of adding the name of the company where they interned to their résumé. They also get to add to their CV the kinds of jobs they did and what they learnt. Recruiters look for those who have demonstrated their effectiveness in internships.

154,15-4-20,Know the difference,"Many students get confused between business and corporate law. However, they are the two sides of a coin, says Dr Sukhvinder Singh Dari

Many students, young professionals, and start-ups confuse business law and corporate law to be one and the same thing; whereas in reality, the two, at most, can be said to be two sides of the same coin. Organisations need advisors who understand the difference between both the laws, to help them make well-informed decisions.

Incomplete knowledge is one of the main reasons why so many people are unable to recognise the distinct nature of the two laws. While it is true that on surface, business and corporate may seem to mean the same thing, people, especially law students and young law professionals need to keep in mind that law is a very vast field, containing several branches. Only by studying the subject in depth, they can understand the complexity and identify the subtle differences.

Varied regulators for the business and corporate law

There is no denying the fact that both business and corporate law are meant to protect various organisations and companies in a number of settings. However, due to the different nature of the two laws, they are governed by different regulatory bodies.

The business law is governed by the central and State Government. But at the same time, the central and State Governments play very different roles in governing the business law. The central Government mainly looks after the laws concerning workplace security and stock purchases. And, the state government regulates any additional laws required to streamline the process.

The corporate law, on the other hand, is administered and regulated by the MCA, aka, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs through the Companies Act (2013). Herein, the Companies Act regulates a number of laws including, incorporation and responsibilities of the company, dissolution of the company, and directors and their roles in the company.

What exactly do business law and corporate law do?

Business law is usually more commonly used than corporate law. It provides a broad range of legal influence to any business. Any laws concerning contracts between directors, employees or clients, or related to employment, tax, or any other transaction are covered under the umbrella of business law.

Mergers, acquisitions, rules for company formation, and shareholder rights are also parts of the business law only. The business law, thus, takes care of the basic legalities required for a company's establishment.

Corporate law, on the other hand, sets and provides the basic guidelines to streamline the purchase, sales, and distribution of goods and/or items in the market. Corporate law also deals with bureaucratic procedures prevalent in the international selling markets.

Many companies tend to overlook the corporate law and thus end up in a legal warfare. This is the sole reason why many multinational companies now hire an in-house corporate lawyer to help them avoid these minor yet significant corporate law breaches while dealing in the marketplace.

Both corporate and business laws have significant effects on companies, and play a crucial role in maintaining a successful business flow. With clear understanding, companies can hire the right attorney, and as far as students are concerned, they can separate each category and choose what step to take further on their career ladder.

158,15-4-20,Trump hints at consequences for China’s misinformation on virus,"US President Donald Trump has hinted that there would be consequences for China’s alleged misinformation to the international community and the WHO on coronavirus, that originated from its Wuhan city last year, and has claimed 1,25,007 lives with nearly two million infections globally.

Trump shot back at a reporter on Monday during his White House press conference on coronavirus when repeatedly asked why there are no consequences for China.

“How do you know that there are no consequences?” Trump asked.

“I wouldn’t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?” Trump replied when repeatedly asked if China was going to face the consequences of the alleged misinformation.

“You’re going to find out,” Trump said as members of the US Congress ramped up their rhetoric and move against China. Senator Steve Daines sent a letter to Trump urging him to end the US government’s reliance on medical supplies and equipment from China and bring back drug manufacturing jobs to America in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Covid-19 pandemic has made clear how relying upon China for medicine or essential medical equipment and components is detrimental to our national security and endangers public health,” Daines wrote.

“It is critically important to ensure that legislation is fully implemented as quickly as possible and that the US continues to be the world leader in biomedicine, pharmaceutical development, and medical innovation,” he wrote.

Four Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a legislation to reduce the reliance on China.

Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act gives companies economic incentives to manufacture pharmaceuticals and medical devices in the US, makes it easier to know which country a drug came from by creating a list of the country of origin of all drugs marketed in the United States, and prohibits federally qualified health facilities from purchasing pharmaceutical products from China, it said.

“Relying on the Chinese Communist Party—whose lies about coronavirus created the pandemic we now face—for essential medicines is dangerous and short-sighted. As with 5G networks, when it comes to medical supply chains, national security must take precedence. China is an adversary that will use any US dependence as blackmail to achieve its nefarious goals,” said Congressman Liz Cheney.

China ran a disinformation campaign to cover up the coronavirus crisis for weeks, putting the rest of the world at a disadvantage in combating the spread, alleged Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

“We have become far too dependent on China, and it is time that we equip our domestic pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to be able to efficiently produce these items here in the United States,” she said. Congressman Mike Gallagher alleged that the Chinese Communist Party’s outrageous threats to withhold life saving drugs from the US endangers public health and should open eyes to the dangerous over-reliance on China in medical supply chain.

“This is a national security imperative that to many Americans, is a matter of life and death. It’s past time for us to develop an aggressive plan to move critical pharmaceutical supply chains away from China,” he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/trump-hints-at-consequences-for-china---s-misinformation-on-virus.html
159,15-4-20,More than 1.2L killed by coronavirus worldwide’,"The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1,20,000 people worldwide, nearly 70 percent of them in Europe.

US: Outside the epicentres of New York and New Jersey, the US coronavirus infection curves were “starting to plateau”, the White House task force indicated even as the country’s death toll has increased to 23,608 and some states on the east and west coasts began collaborating on strategies to reopen their economies.

Of the 23,608 US deaths, New York’s coronavirus death toll alone topped 10,000 but a glimmer of hope emerged as new hospitalisations continued to slow. Monday marked the first time in a week that the daily toll dipped below 700.

Chicago and Boston caseloads were now emerging as new concerns while social distancing measures blanket virtually all of America in varying degrees of stringency.

Britain: The number of people who have died in hospital in Britain from the coronavirus rose to 12,107, according to health ministry figures published on Tuesday. There is an increase of 778 deaths on the previous day and official figures also showed that the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 has reached 93,873.

Spain: Spain’s death toll from the novel coronavirus topped 18,000 on Tuesday, as the rise in new infections dropped to its lowest level since the country imposed a nationwide lockdown last month. The 567 new deaths reported by the health ministry were slightly up from Monday’s death toll and they take the total number of fatalities to 18,056 — officially third in the world behind the United States and Italy. The number of new infections rose by just over 3,045, or 1.8 percent, to 172,451, the smallest increase since the country of around 47 million people imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 14 to curb the spread of the virus.

Iran: Iran said on Tuesday that the number of lives lost in the country to the novel coronavirus dropped to double figures for the first time in one month. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 98 deaths from the COVID-19 disease were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall count to 4,683. “Unfortunately, we lost 98 of our compatriots infected with the disease... but after a month of waiting, this is the first day that the death count has been double figures,” he told a televised news conference.

Sweden: Sweden on Tuesday reported that more than 1,000 people had died from the novel coronavirus, as a group of experts attacked the authorities’ approach to the crisis. Sweden’s Public Health Agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,033 deaths. And it warned that because not all deaths had yet been reported over the four-day Easter weekend, the true number might be higher.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/more-than-1-2l-killed-by-coronavirus-worldwide---.html
160,15-4-20,That’s the spirit! Japan hospitals find way to beat sanitiser shortage,"Strong alcoholic drinks can be used “when absolutely necessary” instead of hand sanitiser in Japanese hospitals, authorities said, as supplies run dry as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Spirits with an alcohol proof of between 70 and 83 percent can be substituted to sterilise hands under new rules set out in a health ministry document obtained by AFP on Tuesday.

Some vodkas are that strong, but traditional Japanese tipples such as sake and shochu do not make the grade — at a maximum alcohol proof of roughly 22 and 45 percent respectively.

But some sake makers have begun producing stronger alcohol products to meet the demand for sanitiser. Japan beverage giant Suntory is already manufacturing sanitiser in the United States, the country hardest-hit by the outbreak. Under Japanese regulations, liquids designed for disinfection should contain between 76.9 and 81.4 percent alcohol content.

Any more than this is less effective and should be diluted, officials say. Japan has so far been spared the disastrous outbreaks seen in Europe and the US, but a recent spike in cases — especially in Tokyo — has raised concerns.

161,15-4-20,Putin may deploy military as cases surge,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the military could be deployed to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic in the country, after the number of cases in the country rose sharply.

On Monday, Russia recorded its largest daily rise in confirmed cases, with 2,558 new infections, taking the total to 21,102, with the vast majority of those in Moscow, the BBC reported.

The death toll currently stood at 210.

“We see that the situation is changing almost daily and, unfortunately, it is not changing for the better,” the BBC quoted Putin as saying during a video meeting with top officials on Monday.

“The number of sick people is increasing, including more and more cases specifically of the severe form of the disease. The next few weeks will be decisive in many respects,” he added.

He also pointed to other European countries, such as Italy, that have utilised the military in their response to the global health crisis.

“We need to use this experience,” he said, adding: “The capabilities of the Russian Defence Ministry, if necessary, can and should be used here.”

Although Russia’ death toll was far lower than in many other European nations such as Italy, Spain and France, experts have warned the country was in the early stages of the epidemic.

Lockdown measures have been introduced in the capital Moscow, the worst-hit area, as well as several other regions.

People have been asked to stay at home unless there was an essential reason for them to go out. Moscow has introduced an electronic system that issues permits to people who need to leave their homes.

But it has been beset by technical issues, which officials have blamed on cyber-attackers, said the BBC report.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/putin-may-deploy-military-as-cases-surge.html
162,15-4-20,Woman fined for taking turtle for a walk in Rome,"An Italian woman who took her pizza-sized turtle out for a walk has been fined 400 euros ($440) by the Roman police for breaking strict coronavirus confinement rules.

Italians need a justifiable reason to be out on the street in the middle of a pandemic that has officially claimed more than 20,000 lives in the Mediterranean country since February. Taking your dog out for a walk is viewed as a good enough reason to leave your home.

But it seems taking your turtle out for one is not. The Roman police said “the 60-year-old woman was caught outside her home without a justifiable reason” and fined. “The woman was walking with a turtle,” the police statement said. Roman police spokesman Nunzio Carbone told AFP that the woman was fined 400 euros because it was “not a justifiable excuse”.

Italian authorities reported issuing a record 16,545 fines on Easter Monday -- a national holiday in the largely Catholic country. Another 13,756 fines were issue on Sunday. Italians have been joking on social media about renting out their dogs to anyone who was going stir crazy and needed a good excuse to go out.

165,15-4-20,‘Plan your higher education overseas smartly’,"Planning for education from an international university has many perks including better job prospects. However, there is a need to plan properly, says ROHIT SETHI

Every year, lakhs of Indian students plan to go abroad to pursue higher education. For them, Canada, the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, France, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany are among the most preferred study abroad destinations. However, higher education in all these countries can be an expensive situation considering the high tuition fees and cost of living.

Moreover, the depreciation of the rupee as well as the new move by the Government to collect 5% tax on any overseas remittances of Rs 7 lakh and above in a financial year, are only increasing the burden on study abroad aspirants.

So, if the plan is still on, get ready to strategiss the entire process starting from making a budget to finding a part-time job to survive in the foreign land. Here is a quick guide that will let you deal with the entire mind-boggling process smoothly:

Choose the course strategically: It is important to skim through various programmes offered by renowned international universities and carefully understand their fee structure as there will be courses that may not fall in the budget of some students. In that case, one needs to consider the second-best option. Once the course has been decided, students can seek for education loans accordingly that comes with flexible EMIs and easy repayment options. Generally, shorter duration courses charge less fee whereas the fees for longer duration courses are on the higher side.

Choosing the destination of the selected course: Students are often more interested in observing the rank of the college rather instead of the kind of opportunities the city/country offers. Since a majority of Indian students are planning to go abroad to enhance their lifestyle with a dream job, the next step after choosing the course is to look at the cities that the universities/institutes are close to and the kind of industries located in that region. Planning in such a strategic way will not just ensure a better set of job opportunities after the course completion but will also let the students adapt to the culture of the region and deliver better job performance.

167,15-4-20,‘MS is greatest finisher of all time’,"A finisher of repute himself, former Australia batman Michael Hussey believes India’s World Cup-winning former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s “unbelievable power” and “self-belief” make him the greatest of all time in that role.

“Dhoni is the greatest finisher of all time that the cricketing world has ever produced,” Hussey told Sanjay Manjarekar on ESPNcricinfo.

“Dhoni can keep his cool and make the opposition captain blink first. Dhoni also has unbelievable power. He knows that when he needs to clear the ropes he can do it. He has that kind of self-belief. Honestly, I didn’t have that kind of belief in myself.”

The 44-year-old Hussey said he also picked up a trick or two about chasing from Dhoni while playing for Chennai Super Kings.

“I tried not to let it reach 12 or 13 runs an over. And I learnt this from MS Dhoni. He is incredible. He believes that he who panics last wins the game. So Dhoni would keep his cool, and keep it longer because the pressure is on the bowler as well.”

Talking about the traits of great players, Hussey said: “They don’t hang on to a defeat for too long. If they lose, they move on quickly. They don’t let a loss or a win hamper their thinking. They are always consistent, and level headed whether it’s MS Dhoni or Ricky Ponting”.

Dhoni led the CSK to three IPL titles besides winning the now-defunct Champions League T20 twice.

Asked what is the reason behind three-time champions CSK’s consistent run in the IPL, Hussey said: “Supportive owners who let the coach (Stephen) Fleming and captain Dhoni decide how to run the team, excellent chemistry between the coach and the captain, Dhoni’s leadership.

“This has built an excellent continuity in the team. And once you have continuity, you build relationships and trust that otherwise takes time to grow.”

However, Hussey believes it will be more challenging for CSK to build a new team once Dhoni hangs his boots.

“I believe the owners would like to keep Dhoni involved in some way or the other. However, whenever the change of guard happens, CSK might want to start all over again, build a brand new team, and use their existing philosophy as they enter the next decade of IPL. It is definitely going to be more challenging in current times,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---ms-is-greatest-finisher-of-all-time---.html
168,15-4-20,Will be interesting to see Kohli adapt to empty stadiums: Lyon,"Cricket in front of empty stands came up for discussion between Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon and pacer Mitchell Starc with both wondering how Indian captain Virat Kohli would adapt to such an atmosphere if their Test series this year is held without fans.

India are set to play a four-match Test series in Australia later this year. But with the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc, speculation is rife that the games could be held behind closed doors.

This led Lyon and teammate Mitchell Starc to discuss how Kohli’s on-field demeanour would change without the backing and noise of the crowd, something the Indian captain thrives on.

“He’s probably good enough to adapt to any scenario. But I was talking to Mitch Starc the other day and we actually said that if we are playing with no crowd, it’ll be quite amazing to see Virat trying to rev up the (empty) seats,” Lyon was quoted as saying by cricket.Com.Au.

“It’s going to be a little bit different, but Virat is a superstar. He’ll be able to adapt to any climate that we’re able to play in,” Lyon added.

Sports calendars have been shredded worldwide, including international and domestic cricket all over.

The 32-year-old Lyon is still excited by the prospect of the series against India.

“I’m excited about the prospect of India coming out to Australia, it’s up there with the biggest series alongside the Ashes. They’re an absolute powerhouse of the cricket world, and to have those guys out here is going to be fantastic,” he said.

Lyon remains hopeful that the home series will go ahead, with or without fans.

“Playing in front of crowds or no crowds is out of our control, we’ve got to follow the advice of all the amazing medical people around the world.

“I haven’t thought about no crowds or massive crowds, it’s just about the opportunity of playing against India again,” he said.

Australia tasted their first Test series loss to India on home turf in 2018-19 when Kohli’s men handed them a 2-1 defeat.

However, with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner, who were under suspension last time, and Marnus Labuschagne, the Australian batting unit seems pretty solid now.

“They had the wood over us last time they came over here but we’re a much stronger Australian cricket side at the moment, and I’m just unbelievably excited about playing them here at home.”

‘Pujara new wall’

Apart Kohli, Lyon also heaped praise on Cheteshwar Pujara and has termed him as ‘new wall’ of Team India.

Pujara was one of the main architects of India’s famous win in 2018-19. He scored three centuries and was the leading run-getter in the four-match rubber.

According to Lyon, Australia need to reassess their approach to Pujara next time around.

“I think Pujara flies under the radar a little bit when you look at the Indian side,” Lyon said.

“Obviously you look at Rahane and Virat and these guys. But Pujara is a wall. He’s the new wall I should say. It helps that he played exceptionally well last time out here. He adapted his game. He had a bit of luck which is what you need when you’re playing at the top level.

“He obviously played his absolute backside off, which for India was good to see but we’re going to have to make sure that come this summer we have to come with some new plans to combat Pujara. As I said, he flies under the radar a little bit — he definitely won’t he flying under the radar come this summer,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/will-be-interesting-to-see-kohli-adapt-to-empty-stadiums--lyon.html
169,15-4-20,Can’t imagine hosting World T20 in empty stadiums: Border,"Former Australia captain Allan Border has given a thumbs down to the concept of Australia hosting the ICC WorldT20 in empty stadiums in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the Australian government has sealed its border for six months till September 30 to deal with the global health crisis.

With the flagship event starting October 18, there are speculations that Cricket Australia might be forced to conduct matches in empty stadiums, something that is not acceptable to the World Cup winning former skipper.

“I just can’t imagine playing at empty stadiums ... It defies belief,” he told Fox Sports News.

In fact, Border said that he doesn’t see the World T20 happening if spectators are not allowed inside the stadiums as the purpose of the sport is lost. “Having teams, support staff and everyone else associated with the game wandering around the country, playing games of cricket, but you can’t let people into the grounds. I just can’t see it happening,” Border said.

For him, it’s an either-or situation for Cricket Australia. “It’s either you play it and everyone just gets on with the job and we’re past this pandemic or it just has to be cancelled and you try to fit it in somewhere else,” said the 64-year-old Border.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/can---t-imagine-hosting-world-t20-in-empty-stadiums--border.html
170,15-4-20,Four-day Tests will not achieve desired results: VVS,"Former Indian batsman VVS Laxman has rejected the idea of having four-day Test matches, saying reducing the length of the game by a day will reduce the chances of it yielding the desired results.

“I am not really a fan of this four-day Test cricket, five days fits perfect because it gets more results and reducing it the four days will not achieve the desired results according to me,” Laxman said while speaking on Star Sports Cricket Connected show.

“Another point aspect is the toss, especially during the overseas tour the captain from the visiting side gets to decide what he wants to choose because we want to see teams travelling and winning matches on away turf which makes it more interesting for spectators,” he added.

The ICC cricket committee is considering having four-day Tests a part of the World Test C’ship from 2023. The ICC’s increasing demand for event windows, the proliferation of domestic T20 leagues, BCCI’s demands for its own sizeable share of bilateral calendar space, and the costs of staging Test series are all said to be the factors contributing to the move.

Meanwhile on the same show, former England captain Nasser Hussain believes that quality of pitches and spectator experience is key to preserving Test cricket.

“The keys areas I can pinpoint to one’s pitches is that if they are flat, like one in Cambridge which years ago when Jimmy Anderson got 90 odd runs from 600 balls. The games on these pitches are boring and old school. Those days have got to go in Test match cricket, 300+ score in first innings where the ball slightly dominates back making it great for viewing and crowd experience. The match gives a value add to the tickets bought and England Test match ticket are not cheap.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/four-day-tests-will-not-achieve-desired-results--vvs.html
171,15-4-20,Neuer extension talks stall at Bayern,"Chelsea and Manchester City are reportedly interested in signing Germany captain Manuel Neuer, whose contract extension talks have stalled at Bayern Munich, according to Kicker magazine.

The goalkeeper’s current deal expires in June 2021 and Neuer, 34, is said to be angry that details of the renegotiations have been leaked to the German press, according to Kicker.

Germany’s top-selling daily Bild claims that Neuer’s agent Thomas Kroth has asked Bayern for a salary for his client of 20 million euros ($22 million) per season.

If the talks fail, club captain Neuer could be free to leave Bayern in June and attract the interest of the Premier League clubs.

Kicker’s chief reporter Karlheinz Wild says the “willingness to resume negotiations” is weak on both sides between Bayern and Neuer.

“It could still take weeks, even months, before a final decision is taken. Positions have so far become too hardened.”

According to Bild, Neuer reportedly wants a contract extension until 2025, but Bayern are only prepared to offer a deal until 2023 — when he will be 37 years old — with the option of an extra year.

The leaking of the details of Neuer’s demands has ‘seriously shaken’ the trust between the player and his club, according to Kicker.

Neuer, who helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup title, has been named world goalkeeper of the year four times.

He has kept 191 clean sheets in 373 appearances for Bayern since joining from Schalke in 2011 and made 92 appearances for Germany.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/neuer-extension-talks-stall-at-bayern.html

A crisis comes with the ability to always leave its impact on education in one way or another. Be it the cloud of choking smoke or the anti-CAA riots and now Coronavirus, educational institutions are always the first to bear the effect in the wake of any forthcoming crisis. But it’s time that today’s educators rethink higher education for a world that’s being overturned by technology.

The unprecedented pace of societal change is proportionately carving the need for reform more urgently than ever. This comes with pressure on higher education as the engine of progress, both in premier as well as mid-level educational institutions, in a knowledge-based economy to urge a seamless transition into the digitalisation of traditional schooling methods.

This begins with embracing stackable, online learning, which is a yielding way that provides both flexibility and affordability which in turn increases access to university curricula while also allowing students to engage in learning. But despite the ample benefits that this innovative concept has to offer, we still think of ways that can improve the learning process and make online education seem seamless?

There was a time when teaching efficiency was typically being determined by the money, time and resources that are crucial for obtaining desired results. Which meant that the learning process becomes better if fewer expenses and less time is involved. If you lack the required finances for developing exceptional online learning method then the good practice would be to seek help from reliable companies, and their solution is affordable in nature.

A digitally-powered ecosystem could seamlessly connect expert educators from academia or industry to deliver all the custom learning programmes for students, even in the state of pandemics at an affordable price point. After all, the whole essence of the state-of-art eLearning system is not just based on the modules but also the amount of money that one is sufficiently willing to spend on making it worthwhile.

All this is because of the fact that pedagogy of online education system is somewhat akin to the giants of the internet and it must finally be treated as a core business, where the educational institutions will need appropriate budgeting along with the potential resources to pull of these demands. So, bringing in the affordability factor deepens the global mandate that online education's potential becomes complementary.

The next in line is to carry a very effective approach which precisely directs every aspect of online education including the teaching, curriculum, practice, administration, technology and even aligns with the institutional culture in order to leave a positive impact on the overall method of learning

No matter how advance or even unique the overall e-learning system might be, it should always be supported by a team of highly skilled as well as competent teachers who are willing to create courses and teaching material according to the requirement of the students — be it comprising of a disciplined schedule or a well-thought assessment and curriculum, this would make the online learning process as seamless as it can get.

We’re fortunate to have the technology at our disposal to create a virtual learning system which cordially allows us to engage and collaborate just as well as we were present in the classroom. It is noteworthy to see the variety of activities that are now possible online and allow through an effective learning environment.

The most formative practice is that the teachers utilise a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous activities, fabricating a thorough blend of online learning styles by using newer and more collaborative video and audio tools. Operating with a mix of these activities will help in making the content more exciting and interesting, ultimately increasing student engagement with both the teacher and the other leaners.

It is only wise to acknowledge the growing importance of mobile learning for online teachers, with students natively getting accustomed to using their mobiles not just for gaming and connecting but also for learning. It is to be administered that mobile learning holds an edge over learners, allowing them to learn on the go and access up-to-date course materials along with all the relevant content anywhere, anytime.

With the bite-sized information available readily which can be digested quickly and at ease, learners can really dig deep to work through the entire course material at their own sweet pace, facilitating both productivity and performance.

To make the transition seamless, make sure that you impart online education in a way that can be easily accessed via mobile phones, laptops, and iPads to maximise your teaching methods and demonstrate to the learners that you are in prior touch with the modern workforce along with its relevant technology.

175,15-4-20,‘PGDM provides better skillsets’,"In a post-pandemic world, once the lockdown opens companies will be looking for managers who will be equipped to deal with the changed environment, says Professor Supriya Sehgal

The PGDM stands for Post Graduate Diploma in Management. It is concerned with the teachings of Master’s of Business Administration on a higher level and a more practical way. In India, where new companies are emerging every day, it is important for companies to hire people of the highest calibre and proficiency. Amidst this pandemic quite a few experts are of the view that the post-pandemic world will see a huge rise in start-ups simultaneously creating a huge demand for fresh management graduates that can stand tall in the changed market scenario.

Unlike an MBA which is pretty common these days, we can see a lot of young individuals moving towards the PGDM programme which is the upgraded and a more relevant version of MBA. Historically speaking a person holding a PGDM degree is more likely to score a higher position in a company because of his practical acumen. This is true because of the skillset imparted and diversified teaching methods used in PGDM curriculum. As soon as the market opens after the lockdown the corporate world will start to look out for managers with diverse skillsets further enhancing the relevance of a PDGM programme because during this programme the graduates develop the right skills that make them more suitable for coping up with the changed environment. Here are five PGDM skills can promote inclusion and diversity in the corporate world.

PGDM is and will always be an industry-oriented programme: Due to the autonomous nature of the institutions that offer PGDM program, the curriculum is always industry oriented and as the industry is changing amidst this pandemic so is the pedagogy of these institutions. An individual holding a PGDM degree will be equipped to cope with the dynamic environment that is soon to come because he will already be in close proximity with the leaders and corporations already riding this change.

Practical approach: The PGDM has been designed for practical usage — the students not only learn theoretical knowledge of the concepts but they get to apply those principles in real-life situations as well. What better course during these changing times.

Preference for higher studies: Companies in India and abroad tend to prefer candidates of PGDM over MBA for managerial positions because of the very nature of the course. The PGDM graduates are more adaptable and dynamic.

Faculty with industry exposure: As PGDM is a PG course, the faculty who teaches these subjects are among the best people in their field of work. Most of the faculty members that you see here would be people with a lot of industry exposure. This breaks the convention of teaching and brings out the best in both the students and teachers as they groom the students using their personal experience and practical knowledge of the industry.

Job-related skills: The practical knowledge received by a student is the most important factor in his journey towards success, a PGDM course ensures just that, and as the times change so will the teaching pattern in a PGDM course. It will be modelled to become more in sync with the market and will prepare the students for actual jobs. The skillsets they have will go a long way in their journey towards success and achievements.",avenues,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/avenues/---pgdm-provides-better-skillsets---.html
176,15-4-20,mindIT,"In the modern age, almost everyone is aware of the term personality development and soft skills training. There are innumerable companies in India that promise to transform individuals into profound personalities.

Still, the companies that are doing well in the market are limited and most of the start-ups fail even after a good start. The reason behind this is the poor execution of the concept. Here are few mantras to boost the growth of your personality development company (PDC):

Generate the need: Before pitching your programme, it is very important to generate the need of the programme in the city. People need to repeatedly be told terms like Spoken English, professional etiquettes, communication skills etc. The city should be flooded with banners and posters that will generate the awareness and increase the need of the programme. Once, people get familiar with such topics, personality development workshops can be conducted to get early enrolments.

You can also invite few experts to deliver talks on alarming issues like gadget and Internet addiction and importance of communication skills. A good public speaker will be able to generate interest and mould parents to join such courses.

Conduct city level contests: Free city level contests work greatly in gathering a large number of students at one place. A two day free of cost aptitude test can be planned to generate interest among students. On the first day, the test can be conducted for students of different age groups in different time slots.

The second day can be the prize distribution ceremony along with a 30 minute presentation of your personality development course. This will help pitching your programme in an effective way and will also help in getting admissions.

If parents register for the programme on the same day, early bird discounts can also be offered to get a good initial number. After few months, a talent hunt contest can be conducted. It will build a culture in the city and your organisation will get the desired identification.

Potent online presence: Today, social media has become the biggest marketing platform. You can promote your programme on these sites by running campaigns on several thought provoking issues. These campaigns help in cracking a deal in different institutions as the chance of getting invitations to conduct workshops on similar issues increases.

One more way through which you can promote and grow your PDC is opinion polls. Run opinion polls to make a strong impact on social media sites. People relate a lot to opinion polls and ultimately you will build an audience that can later be contacted for workshops and other courses.

Local media and CSR: Frequent event reports should be published in the local newspapers so that there is a buzz in the town regarding your business. You can invite the media personnel to different events and can also plan a Press conference discussing the impact of soft skills training in the life of an individual. The presence in the local media will work wonders for your organisation.

Your organisation must have a CSR policy. The idea of having a CSR fund should not be limited to big companies and even smaller organisation must have a CSR policy.

A CSR programme will benefit both your company and the society. You will be able to build a positive business reputation in the market. These methods will only be fruitful if the content of your programme is unbeatable. New companies should first design a power packed curriculum so that these techniques bring maximum results.

182,15-4-20,Lockdown breach:ED seeks cancellation of Kapil Wadhawan's bail,"The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday moved the Bombay High Court seeking cancellation of bail of DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan, who is an accused in a money laundering case, for violating his bail conditions and travelling during the coronavirus lockdown.

Advocate Purnima Kantharia of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) mentioned the application before high court Justice P D Naik.

The court then issued notice to Wadhawan and posted the matter for further hearing on April 23.

Kapil Wadhawan, the 46-year-old chairman and managing director of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), was arrested on January 27 this year by the ED for his dubious dealings with gangster Iqbal, who died in 2013, and was booked under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act IPMLA).

He was granted bail on February 21 by a special PMLA court in Mumbai.

Kapil Wadhawan, his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan and other family members travelled to their farmhouse at Mahabaleshwar hill station in Maharashtra's Satara district last week, in alleged breach of the lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus.

Subsequently, the ED on Friday issued orders for seizure of five luxury vehicles in which they travelled to Mahabaleshwar from Khandala.

The Wadhawan brothers and 21 others, including their family members, are at present in quarantine in Mahabaleshwar.

Kantharia said the ED sought an urgent hearing of its application after it came to light that Kapil Wadhawan violated the conditions imposed upon him by the special PMLA court while granting him bail.

""The accused (Kapil Wadhawan) was directed to appear regularly before the ED to ensure he does not leave the city.

However, it was recently learnt that he travelled outside the city and thus, violated the bail conditions, Kantharia said.

She said this was an added ground for the prosecution to seek urgent hearing into its application requesting cancellation of bail granted to Wadhawan.

According to the ED, Kapil Wadhawan laundered money from DHFL as part of an illegal property deal with Mirchi.

It alleged that Rs 12,773 crore was siphoned off from DHFL on the pretext of providing loans to one lakh fictitious customers.

A part of this loan was used to make payments to Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, the agency claimed.

As per the ED's case, Mirchis properties in Mumbai were sold to Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited, a company linked to Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan.

183,15-4-20,Encouragement to rural activity focus of relaxation from April 20: MHA,"Encouragement to the rural economy is the focus of relaxations given under the consolidated revised guidelines issued by the Home Ministry for the extended lockdown period to contain the spread of coronavirus, a senior official said.

The relaxations to some activities given in the guidelines announced on Wednesday will come into force from April 20 and are only for areas which are not declared COVID-19 hotspots, Additional Secretary in the Home Ministry Govind Mohan said.

Addressing a press conference, he also made it clear that no movement of migrant labourers is possible till the lockdown continues as no public transport is permitted to operate during the period.

The home ministry has provided funds under state disaster relief provisions to extend facilities at relief and shelter camps for labourers and shall continue to extend support, Mohan said.

He said the activities allowed as per the revised guidelines are focussed at providing encouragement to the rural economy.

""Keeping in mind encouragement to rural economy, MNREGA activities have been permitted with conditions of wearing masks and adopting social distancing norms. Priority of MNREGA works should be water conservation and irrigation works,"" Mohan said.

He said the ministry kept agriculture-related activities open in previous guidelines also which have been reiterated in the revised guidelines.

""Besides, states and UTs have been asked to decentralise procurement and marketing in agriculture as much as possible so that farmers do not face any problems in procurement and marketing of products,"" he said.

People involved in animal husbandry, aquaculture and horticulture have been allowed to work, Mohan said, adding that supply chains in animal husbandry and rural industries with focus on food processing have been allowed.

Common Service Centres in rural areas where people can pay their bills and download the Arogya Setu app will now be open, he said.

Addressing a press conference, the official said the relaxations come with two main conditions -- all the directives of the guidelines should be strictly followed and some preliminary action needs to be taken with regard to social distancing in sectors where activities are being permitted.

He said the health ecosystem was fully functional.

Essential goods supply chains, neighbourhood stores, kirana stores can remain open, he said.

All district magistrates have been asked to strictly implement the National Covid Directives issued under the guidelines, like wearing masks, social distancing, prohibition on gathering of over five persons, etc., Mohan said, adding that violations will attract penalty.

""All industrial, commercial and other establishments allowed to function under the guidelines will have a standard operating procedure in conformity with social distancing protocols,"" Mohan said.

""The lockdown will continue, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind,"" he said.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/encouragement-to-rural-activity-focus-of-relaxation-from-april-20--mha-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/encouragement-to-rural-activity-focus-of-relaxation-from-april-20--mha.html
184,15-4-20,Lockdown till May 3 to lock virus out,"Execution more stringent for a week; relaxation from April 20 for some economic activities in ‘safe’ areas after review, says Modi

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Union Government has decided to extend the nationwide lockdown till May 3 cautioning that regulations would be enforced with “greater strictness” for next one week before “limited relaxation” could be considered from April 20 in certain areas for the “poor”.

He said detailed guidelines on relaxation would be issued by the Government on Wednesday.

The Prime Minister, however, did not unfold any economic plan or package for the country even though Chief Ministers have been urging him to provide urgent relief and initiate steps to revive cash flow in the economy.

Modi prefaced the decision to extend the lockdown by claiming that India has done far better than the developed world in containing the pandemic because of the timely measures initiated by his Government.

However, health experts fear that numbers of positive cases are relatively low because of India’s low levels of testing and that the actual penetration of the infection levels could be higher.

Modi said while from an economic point of view the measure looks costly right now, the Government’s foremost priority is to save lives.

Lockdown has put a complete stop on economic activities in the county with economists observing that negative impact of the shutdown measures on several essential sectors, including the mining, agriculture, manufacturing and utility areas appearing, to be much higher than expected earlier.

According to an estimate, India may be losing close to 400 billion rupees daily due to the lockdown with an estimated loss amounting to as much as 8 trillion rupees during the past 21 days.

It was expected that the Government would open up key sectors, including road, transport, reality, and provide relaxations to small and medium business to revive the economy which was already in a slowdown mood in the pre-coronavirus period.

According to sources, the Government was considering a graded approach to opening up of economy and it would be announced it by April 20.

In his fourth address to nation since the lockdown, Modi said relaxations for harvesting seasons would be accorded to farmer to minimise their difficulties on account of the lockdown clamped since March 25 to contain coronavirus. “Till May 3, all countrymen have to follow the lockdown. We have to follow discipline during this period in the same manner that we have been doing so far,” Modi said.

He asked public to implement social distancing sincerely so that “new hotspots” of coronavirus are not developed which would put country “in greater crisis” and set more challenges for it.

The Prime Minister said “greater strictness” would be enforced through the next week at State, district and mandal level and situation would be analysed whether relaxation could be given after April 20.

“Areas which do not develop hotspots will be given relaxation with some riders and if lockdown rules are broken, the same will be withdrawn”, he said warning against “carelessness”.

“Easing the difficulty of poor people, farmers is among my top priorities”, said the Prime Minister.

Modi suggested seven steps for the citizens during the lock down which include taking extra-care of senior citizens, adopt social distancing and wear mask, downloading Arogya app, feed poor and respect corona warriors.

Against the backdrop of large-scale sacking of employees in the country, particularly in the media sector, the Prime Minister also counselled employers to not to resort to retrenchment and advised them to pay salaries to employees during the lockdowon distress.

Modi maintained that early measures taken by his Government had limited the damage done by the pandemic in the country in comparison to some of the developed countries across the world.

“The country has benefited from social distancing and lockdown and that India is in a much better position than many other nations in Covid-19 fight”, Modi said.

Since the first lockdown of three-week, the unemployment rate has almost doubled to around 14.5 per cent, according data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a Mumbai based private think-tank.

Experts feel the Government would need to strike a judicious balance between saving “lives” and ‘livelihood’ and open up economic activities in conjunction with “social distancing” which should be a new normal now.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lockdown-till-may-3-to-lock-virus-out-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/lockdown-till-may-3-to-lock-virus-out.html
185,15-4-20,"Sparse testing, relief for none, rues Congress","But party welcomes lockdown extension

The Congress on Tuesday launched a multi-pronged attack on the Modi Government for its handling of coronavirus crisis, even though it backed the extension of the ongoing lockdown till May 3.

While the party accused the Modi Government of not doing anything for the poor, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said India conducted far less Covid tests than even the poorest of the poor nations.

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the PM’s address was like “Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.” “Amazing PM address. Exhortation, rhetoric, inspiration... yet hollow on specifics! No financial package, no details, no concrete item. Neither for poor nor for middle class, industry, businesses. Lockdown is good but cannot be end in itself! Where is single livelihood issue,” he asked.

“After this: should we pray? We want concrete palliatives for these deprived classes and even for middle class India and MSMEs,” he said.

Former Union Minister P Chidambaram too welcomed the extension of lockdown but added that the livelihood and survival of the poor was not amongst Government’s priorities. In a series of tweets posted on Tuesday, Chidambaram said no money has been added to States after the economic package announced on 25 March.

In an online Press conference, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Manish Tewari told reporters that the Congress understands the inevitability of the lockdown and hence the party supports its extension. “But the Prime Minister did not address the concerns of the nation or said what the people wanted to hear about what the Union Government was doing for the people, Tewari said.

“Those migrants who had left for their hometowns have completed the necessary 14-day lockdown. What are you going to do about them? Are you going to let them go home? Is there a calibrated plan for travel arrangements to reach home,” Tewari added.

Stating that the country has very low level of testing for coronavirus infection, Rahul said with only 149 tests per million population, India is currently in the company of countries like Laos, Niger and Honduras.

“India delayed the purchase of testing kits & is now critically short of them,” Rahul said on Twitter.

“With just 149 tests per million Indians, we are now in the company of Laos (157), Niger (182) & Honduras (162).

“Mass testing is the key to fighting the virus. At present we are nowhere in the game,” he added in his tweet.

Football across the country, which has recorded more than 20,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, has been postponed since March 9 due to the outbreak.

According to local reports the league could begin again at the end of next month, with players returning to training on May 4.

“If I had to give a technical view, sincerely it would not be a favourable one. That being said, it will be of course for the politicians to decide,” said Giovanni Rezza, the head of infectious diseases at Italy’s National Institute of Health.

“I’ve heard certain people propose more strict observations with players tested every few days. But sincerely it seems to me a slightly far-fetched theory. And we’re almost in May already.

“It’s obvious that politics will decide. But it’s a sport that involves contact and that contact could imply a certain risk of transmission.”

The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) is set to meet on Wednesday to discuss the medical protocols surrounding players training again, with lockdown measures in the country extended to May 3.

“We’ll start, I hope, at the start of May with tests to make sure the players are negative and that training can start,” the FIGC’s president Gabriele Gravina told Sky Sport.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/top-italian-doctor-against-may-restart-for-serie-a.html

189,15-4-20,‘No B Plan’ for another Oly postponement,"Tokyo organizers on Tuesday said that they have no ‘B Plan’ in the event the Olympics need to be postponed again because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Masa Takaya, the spokesman for the Tokyo Olympics, said organizers are proceeding under the assumption the Olympics will open on July 23, 2021. The Paralympics follow on August 24.

Those dates were set last month by the International Olympic Committee and Japanese officials after the coronavirus pandemic made it clear the Olympics could not be held as scheduled this summer.

“We are working toward the new goal,” Takaya said on a teleconference call with journalists.

“We don’t have a B Plan.”

The severity of the pandemic and the death toll has raised questions if it will even be feasible to hold the Olympics in just over 15 months. Several Japanese journalists raised the question on the call.

“All I can tell you today is that the new games’ dates for both the Olympic and Paralympic Games have been just set up,” Takaya said.

“In that respect, Tokyo 2020 and all concerned parties now are doing their very best effort to deliver the games next year.”

He did not answer the question directly, but said later that Japanese organizers and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated they “could not manage a postponement beyond next summer at the lastest.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---no-b-plan----for-another-oly-postponement.html
190,15-4-20,Dhoni still has cricket left in him: Raina,"Veteran India batsman Suresh Raina on Tuesday said MS Dhoni was trying to innovate a lot while batting during the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp which got cancelled midway due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a lot of debate about Dhoni’s future if the Indian Premier League (IPL) does not eventually see the light of the day due to the lockdown getting extended till May 3.

“He was batting really well. Cricket is still left in him. He has looked innovative. We played practice games and those sixes are as big as they were. Three hours of batting in the evening, that too, in Chennai heat is not easy and we did that (during the camp). If you ask me, Mahi bhai is batting brilliantly,” Raina said in an Instagram Live session.

“His body is not showing signs of ageing. He was looking different and was trying to do something else, something different, new. So people will get to know when they see him,” said Raina who won the 2011 World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy under Dhoni’s leadership.

Raina further said he is still hopeful of a comeback in the T20 team ahead of the World Cup, slated to be held in October. The 33-year old also slammed the selectors for not providing enough reason as to why he was dropped after the England tour in 2018.

“I have played for 14-15 years. Under Mahi bhai then Dada (Sourav Ganguly)..they always used to tell me what was wrong. Virat (Kohli) also does that but the selectors don’t all the time.

“They should have taken more responsibility (when dealing with) senior players. You need to know the reason why you are not batting in nets one fine morning. Someone has to give us detail where to bat, what to do?” said Raina who has played 18 Tests, 226 ODIs and 78 T20s for India.

Putting his weight behind young wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant, Raina said he is lacking in confidence at the moment and seniors need to guide him.

“Rishabh Pant is very talented. Someone has to step up and guide him. When I used to play, Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) paa used to tell me, ‘you make mistakes and we will guide you’. So Rishabh should be backed. He has hundreds abroad and he is not a fluke player. Somewhere I think he is not getting confidence..he is missing something,” he said.

IPL 2020 postponed indefinitely

The BCCI on Tuesday told IPL franchises that the event stands “postponed indefinitely” after the lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic was extended till May 3, leaving no scope for the league to take place during its designated window.

While the development hasn’t been officially announced as yet but it is learnt that the BCCI has reached out to all the stakeholders, including the eight franchises and the broadcasters, to convey that the event stands “postponed and not cancelled”.

“Yes, the BCCI has intimated us that IPL has been postponed for the time being but they are hopeful of finding a window later this year as and when things normalise,” a veteran franchise official said.

It is understood that BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah were waiting for the government directive and once the lockdown was extended till May 3 on Tuesday, they saw no possibility of holding the IPL during its traditional April-May window.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dhoni-still-has-cricket-left-in-him--raina-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dhoni-still-has-cricket-left-in-him--raina.html
191,15-4-20,Buttler says he is in awe of Rohit''s effortless batting,"England batsman Jos Buttler was effusive in his praise for Rohit Sharma, describing the India opener as an awesome player, who can ""effortlessly"" take down any opposition by scoring big hundreds.

""Rohit Sharma I think is an awesome player,"" Buttler said during an Instagram live session on Rajasthan Royals page.

""Effortless. Quite a lot of Indian players have that awesome style.

""He has been fantastic for a long time and I just like the way he bats and the effortless nature in which he takes people down.""

Rohit is currently regarded as one of the greatest ODI players, ranked only behind India skipper Virat Kohli at the top of the ICC rankings. The Mumbaikar is the only batsman to have scored three double hundreds in the format.

The 32-year-old had equalled Sachin Tendulkar's record for most centuries in World Cup matches when he scored five hundreds at the 2019 World Cup to end up as the highest-scorer with 648 runs.

""One of the things I have seen with Rohit is that if he gets in, he scores big runs and really affects the game. He must have scored 4-5 hundreds in the World Cup last year,"" said Buttler, who had shared the dressing room with Rohit at Mumbai Indians in the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

Buttler feels the Indian players now have become better in negotiating short balls.

""I think a few years ago people used to attack Indian players with the short ball but Rohit smashes them. Then you go fuller and he smashes them right down the ground.""",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/buttler-says-he-is-in-awe-of-rohit--s-effortless-batting-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/buttler-says-he-is-in-awe-of-rohit--s-effortless-batting.html
192,15-4-20,Fight against COVID-19 is mother of all World Cups: Shastri,"India's head cricket coach Ravi Shastri on Wednesday described the country's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""mother of all world cups"".

The coronavirus outbreak has so far claimed over 350 lives and infected more than 11,000 people in India, forcing the government to extend a 21-day lockdown to May 3 to contain the dreaded disease.

Shastri shared a video message on his twitter account, urging people to apply lessons from sports to fight the pandemic.

""Today, the COVID-19 corona have put us in a situation where we have our backs to the walls. To combat this COVID-19 corona is like chasing a world cup, where you give your everything and try to win it,"" the 57-year-old said.

""What's staring you in the face (COVID-19) is no ordinary World Cup, this is the mother of all World Cups, where not just 11 are playing but 1.4 billion are in the playing arena and competing.

""Come on guys, let's do it together. Let's get out there, a brute force of 1.4 billions and beat this corona and get our hands on the world cup of humanity,"" he added.

Shastri praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he is leading from the front.

""Guys we can win this, but for that you've got to observe the basics. We've got a Prime Minister who is leading from the front, ahead of the curve,"" Shastri said.

""You have got to obey the orders that come from the top, be it the centre, be it the state or be it from the people in the front-line who are risking their lives.

""Two orders that stand out; staying home and maintaining social distancing. It isn't easy but to win the game, you've got to go through the pain, to break the chain.""

The disease has killed more than 1.2 lakh and infected nearly 2 million people globally. It has also brought sporting events around the world to a halt.

Last month, Shastri had urged people to stay home at all costs, saying the ""only thing flying around the world like a tracer bullet is this bloody Corona"", using commentary cliche, made famous by him, to convey his message.

193,15-4-20,"Laxman hits back at Clarke, says just being nice doesn't guarantee a place in IPL","Former India batsman VVS Laxman took a jibe at Michael Clarke for his recent claims that Australian cricketers ""sucked up"" to India captain Virat Kohli for protecting their IPL contracts, saying just being nice to someone doesn't guarantee a spot in the cash-rich tournament.

Clarke, a former Australian captain, raised several eyebrows after he claimed that there was a phase when Australian cricketers were so keen on protecting their IPL deals that they felt ""scared"" of sledging India skipper Kohli and his teammates and instead ""sucked up"" to them.

""Just by being nice to someone doesn't get you a place in IPL,"" Laxman, who also mentors IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad told Star Sports on its show 'Cricket Connected'.

""Any franchise will look at the player's caliber and value add to the team, which gives them desired results by winning matches/tournaments. These are the kind of players who get IPL contracts. So just being nice to someone will not earn you a spot in the IPL.""

Laxman, a veteran of 134 Tests, said as a mentor when he is on the auction table, those players are looked at who do exceptionally well for their country.

""If you're friendly with any Indian player it doesn't mean that you are getting IPL contract. As a mentor, I'm on the auction table and we select players, those international players that have played exceptionally well for their country and can add value to the franchise.

""Friendship with any Indian player doesn't ensure entry into the IPL,"" Laxman, who amassed 8,781 Test runs, said without mincing any words.

Former India opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth also shot back at Clarke, terming his comments as ""ridiculous"".

Srikkanth, who was part of the 1983 World Cup winning Indian team, said matches are not won by sledging.

""You do not win matches just by sledging. Aussie's loss is a loss, his statement was ridiculous I would say,"" said 60-year-old Srikkanth.

Srikkanth, himself an aggressive player, said that sledging cannot help in any way.

""If you ask Nasser Hussain or Sir Vivian Richards who are experienced players, you can never score runs or get wickets through sledging. You need to play good cricket and showcase determination; you need to bowl well to get wickets and bat well to achieve targets. Sledging cannot help in any way according to my opinion,"" he said.

Australian Test skipper Tim Paine had earlier hit back at Clarke, saying his team avoided provoking ""any fight"" with Kohli as part of its strategy to keep the Indian captain's bat quiet, not a ploy to save IPL contracts.

While out of 51 fresh cases, 19 patients have foreign travel history or contact, with this addition the total cases under this category have gone up to 396.

Under ‘special operations’ category, only nine fresh cases were reported on Tuesday by the Heath Department but the total cases under special operations category is at 1,080 till Tuesday.

According to the data compiled by the Health department, 23 cases are under investigation while total 30 patients have been discharged and one migrated out.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Government also sealed eight areas where corona cases were reported.

These areas are in and around areas of G-174, Capital Greens, DLF, Moti Nagar, In and around areas of B-1/2, Paschim Vihar, in and around areas of 11/3 IInd floor, Ashok Nagar, in and around area of H N -A-30, Mansarovar Garden, A-1B/75A, Krishna Apartment, Paschim Vihar, 36/4, East Patel Nagar, HN -62, Gali number-4, Shastri Park.

Citing health bulletin report on Covid-19 cases, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said 356 cases in one day is a matter of concern but we will overcome the crisis.

Kejriwal said our country can only progress and win its battle against Covid-19 if all the religions, castes, and States work together and stand united.

He also said he will visit containment zones in city on Wednesday to take stock of the situation.

Under Operation-SHIELD, the Delhi Government also launched massive sanitisation drive with 60 high-tech sanitising machines deployed across Delhi while 14,000 corona foot warrior teams working across Delhi to spread awareness about the pandemic.

The CM said, “Even the most developed nations such as the USA, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, have been affected by Covid-19. Just 3-4 months back, who could have imagined that the whole world would be impacted by the pandemic and nations would be helpless in front of it. We have seen that whenever humans have gone against nature they have always suffered its wrath. Kindness and helpfulness have been inscribed in the Geeta, and when a person goes against these traits, he suffers at the hands of nature. He is working against nature, against God, Allah.”

He said, “It saddens me that in the time of the pandemic, there are still people who are trying to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims. I observe on social media that even in times when the whole world is in distress, people are trying to create a rift between the two communities, by posting hate videos and content. We can only move ahead and overcome obstacles if we stand united. All the anti-social elements who are sowing seeds of hatred in the minds and hearts of the people are not only working against nature but also against our nation. Our country can only progress if all the religions, caste, and states work together and stand united. That is the only way that we can fight against the pandemic.”

Kejriwal expressed concern over the rise in the number of cases in the last few days. “In the last few days, we have seen a considerable rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi. On April 9, only 51 new cases were observed, but on April 10, 183 new cases were observed, on April 11, 166 new cases were observed, and on April 13, 356 new cases were observed. This is a cause of worry for me as the Chief Minister of Delhi, and it is a major cause of worry for the people of Delhi,” he added.

“Delhi is the capital of the country, it has been burdened because a lot of passengers from other nations landed in the city in the last 2 months. Covid-19 had already been spread in other nations, it entered India because of this influx of people from those nations. Another incident related to Markaz also caused an additional burden on Delhi and increased the number of cases in the city. “But, we know and I believe that we will overcome this, as we have done until now, despite a rise in the number of cases,” he added.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/51-fresh-cases-raise-delhi-number-to-1-561--two-deaths-in-24-hours.html
195,15-4-20,"China's recent COVID-19 cases jump to 1,500 amid exodus of Chinese from Russia","

China's has reported 46 new coronavirus cases, including 10 domestic infections, with health experts saying that the increasing number of local transmissions in the country's northeast bordering Russia remained a concern following the return of Chinese nationals from abroad.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday that 46 new confirmed cases mostly from Chinese coming from abroad were reported on Tuesday taking the total number of recent cases to 1,500. This included 10 new local infections.

Health experts said that the Suifenhe city at the China-Russia border might become another Wuhan amid sharp increase of COVID-19 cases following an exodus of Chinese nationals from Russia.

Also on Tuesday, 57 new asymptomatic cases were reported taking their total to 1,023, the NHC said.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

The total death toll in China went up on Tuesday to 3,342 with one death reported from the epicentre Hubei Province.

The overall confirmed cases in China reached 82,295 by Tuesday. This included 3,342 people who died of COVID-19,1,137 patients still being treated and 77,816 people discharged after the treatment.

Also, as of Tuesday 1,012 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 45 in Macao and 393 in Taiwan including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Meanwhile, frontline Chinese health experts coping with soaring cases of COVID-19 at the China-Russia border in China's Heilongjiang province and Suifenhe city which are facing increasing pressure of imported and local cases ruled out becoming China's next Wuhan where virus was reported in December last year.

Concerns were heightened as Heilongjiang province reported 79 new imported infections of Chinese coming from Russia on Monday through border city Suifenhe.

It was the highest one-day rise in imported cases for the city with only 70,000 people, the Daily report said.

Neither Suifenhe nor Harbin, cities near the Russian border, which are in midst of an escalating epidemic, will become the next Wuhan as there are no large-scale domestic cases in the two places and their impact on other regions is limited and under control, Yang Yanjie, deputy head of the expert group for epidemiological investigation of COVID-19 in Heilongjiang told state-run Global Times daily.

Yu Kaijiang, head of the expert group for medical treatment in Suifenhe, said that the situation is stable and controllable, as the Suifenhe port remains closed.

Heilongjiang province announced on Sunday the passenger channel of Suifenhe border port with Russia would remain closed.

""It is normal to have resurgence after a great epidemic as a virus cannot be eliminated completely within a short time,"" Yu noted.

The current medical care situation is adequate to cover the current increase in imported cases, Yu said.

""We are also preparing back-up designated hospitals, ensuring that more beds will be made available,"" Yu said, noting that the testing capability is meeting the demand and reaching 1,000 people per day.

Hao Jun, a researcher from the Heilongjiang authority, said on Tuesday that according to their epidemiological investigation, most of the 366 imported cases from Suifenhe port were infected at the Lyublino Market and Sadavod Market in Moscow, where they worked.

Hao said as returnees from Russia share an enclosed space for a long time during their journeys and have close contact, the risk of infection increased.

He suggested that overseas Chinese in Russia enhance self-protection and not enter China through Suifenhe to avoid the risk of being infected during the journey.

Suifenhe city has 1,479 people under collective quarantine. Local officials said Monday that 15-20 percent of the people may test positive, the Global Times report said.

China has rushed specialised medical teams to border city to deal with an increasing number of COVID-19 cases.

196,15-4-20,New Zealand PM takes pay cut as virus hits economy,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Wednesday she will take a 20 percent pay cut in a symbolic act of solidarity with people struggling financially during the coronavirus pandemic.

Ardern said her personal salary, those of her fellow ministers and of top public servants would be slashed by a fifth for six months.

The move will see Ardern's annual pay fall from around NZ 470,000 (US 285,000) to NZ 376,000, costing her about NZ 47,000 over the six-month period.

""While it in itself won't shift the government's overall fiscal position, it is about leadership,"" she told reporters.

""This was always just going to be an acknowledgement of the hit that many New Zealanders will be taking at the moment."" The centre-left leader said the cut would not be implemented across the public service.

""Many people in our public sector are frontline essential workers -- nurses, police, healthcare professionals,"" Ardern said.

""We are not suggesting pay cuts here, nor would New Zealanders find that appropriate."" New Zealand is in the midst of a four-week COVID-19 lockdown that has paralysed the economy, with thousands of jobs losses already announced.

Economic modelling released by the Treasury department this week predicted unemployment -- currently about 4.0 percent -- could soar to almost 26 percent in a worst-case scenario.

Ardern said her wage cut was a small contribution to easing pay inequalities in society.

""If ever there was a time to close the gap between different positions, it's now,"" she said.

""This is where we can take action which is why we have.""

198,15-4-20,"Virus sends Germany into recession, to last to mid-year","Europe's economic powerhouse Germany plunged into recession in March, with the slump sparked by the coronavirus pandemic likely to last until the middle of the year, the economy ministry said Wednesday.

""Falling global demand, interruption of supply chains, changes in consumers' behaviour and uncertainty among investors"" had all made themselves felt in the export giant, the ministry said.

The economic blow from the virus fell just as Germany was beginning to recover from a 2019 marked by the impact of trade wars and Brexit fears.

Industry in particular had seen rises in new orders and activity as 2020 got underway, the ministry noted.

But ""given the massive demand and supply shock at home and abroad from the coronavirus pandemic, economic developments reversed course"" for manufacturers, it said.

At home, Germany has been in progressively tighter lockdown since mid-March, with Chancellor Angela Merkel set to discuss with state premiers Wednesday whether to extend restrictions beyond the present April 19 cutoff date.

""Even if the first protective measures can be loosened somewhat (after April), growth will remain very muted and only revive bit by bit,"" the economy ministry forecast.

To cushion some of the blow, Berlin has passed a rescue package totalling 1.1 trillion euros, ranging from guarantees for bank lending to business to a state fund that could buy up stakes in stricken companies if necessary.

The federal government also eased access to a scheme that tops up workers' wages if their employer slashes hours.

The BA federal labour agency said some 725,000 companies had applied for the assistance, adding that the number of workers affected will likely be ""significantly"" above the 1.4 million helped in the 2008-9 financial crisis.

The Principality of Monaco has been heavily affected. During this hiatus for the tourism industry, the Monaco Government’s Tourist & Convention Authority is keen to stay in touch with everyone who loves to travel, whether they are already familiar with the Principality or are planning to visit once the crisis is over. Today, the tourist board is rolling out a new communication campaign to let them know just how much they are missed in Monaco!

The Principality is missing everything their visitors bring, from those treasured moments of friendship and fun, to their opinions, their valued custom, their languages, and of course the ‘wow’ factor experienced by everyone who comes to Monaco. All of the things that together make the country so vibrant and alive.

The Tourist & Convention Authority’s usual slogan, “FOR YOU”, a warm invitation to take advantage of all the incredible things the Principality has to offer, has evolved into a simple declaration of affection.

This is a difficult time, with so many of us under lockdown and lacking that most precious of things: social contact.

So today, the message is “MISS YOU”, supported by friendly messages and pictures, to remind us of those precious times that we look forward to sharing again. They show touching snapshots of life, with happy people spending unforgettable moments together in Monaco. We hope they are back in our everyday lives again very soon. Each tactile image inspires a desire to relive those experiences, in these unique places…just as soon as possible.

This campaign is targeted at both leisure and group business tourism, for professionals and private customers.

In addition to front-ranking countries like the US and others, United Kingdom, China, Iran, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, Brazil , Russia, Portugal, Austria, Israel, and Sweden are ahead of India.

Within the country, Maharashtra remain the worst affected State with 2,334 coronavirus cases followed by Delhi (1,561), Tamil Nadu (1,173), Rajasthan (873) and Madhya Pradesh (604).

The other worst affected States which reported three digit Covid cases included Telangana (562), Uttar Pradesh (558) and Gujarat (539).

Of the total 390 deaths, Maharashtra tops the tally with 178 fatalities, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 43, Delhi at 28 and Gujarat at 26, shows the Health Ministry’s figures.

Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, said at a Press briefing here that India has 602 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals having 1,06,719 isolation beds and over 12,000 ICU beds are ready.

In response to a query on the logic behind extending the nationwide lockdown till May 3 as announced by the Prime Minister he explained, “Our major effort is to break the chain of transmission. If there are no cases reported for 28 days from a particular area or the last negative case is reported 28 days ago, then we believe that the chain of transmission has stopped as cases have stopped coming.”

The 28-day period has originated from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s containment plan. According to this, the containment plan would only be scaled down if no Covid-19 case confirmed by a secondary laboratory is reported from the geographic quarantine zone for at least four weeks after the last confirmed case has been isolated and all his contacts have been traced for up to 28 days.

“The containment operation shall be deemed to be over 28 days from the discharge of the last confirmed case (following negative test as per the discharge policy) from the designated health facility, i.e., when the follow up of hospital contacts will be complete,” said the Ministry in a strategy document.

The Cluster Containment Strategy would be to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection of cases and breaking the chain of transmission.

Responding to a query on India lagging behind on the testing front as compared to other countries, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) official said that if somebody is eligible for testing, then he/she will certainly be tested.

“If we are not able to find people to test for the disease, it shows that the number is falling or the number is low. It is difficult to say. We don’t say no to anybody for testing,” the ICMR official said.

Agarwal added that tests are done in accordance to the sampling criteria.

“If we test randomly, then our testing kits would not be utilised for the people who need to be tested. We have also increased our sampling zone -- patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) have been included. We have also introduced rapid diagnostic kits in the field. We have expanded the overall process of testing,” Agarwal said.

He said advanced screening procedures, prior to January 30, have played a major role in managing the deadly infection in the country and that “We are also expanding our testing through rapid diagnostic kits.”

More than 2 lakh Covid-19 tests have been conducted so far, said Raman R Gangakhedkar, senior scientist from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Additionally, we are ordering close to about 33 lakh kits for RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction) and 37 lakh rapid kits are expected to come at any point in time, he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-among-20-worst-hit-nations-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-among-20-worst-hit-nations.html
203,15-4-20,"Restive migrants lose patience, stage protest","Chaos at Bandra Railway Terminus as thousands gather to go home

All hell broke loose on Tuesday evening as thousands of restive migrant workers from other States gathered at Bandra Railway Terminus in a desperate hope that they would able to head back to their native villages and towns, thus throwing social distancing norms to the wind during the extended lockdown period.

Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation extended the lockdown by another 19 days i.e, till May 3, thousands of somewhat distraught migrants, who were expecting Modi to relax the lockdown to an extent that the Government would run some special trains for them to go back their native places, staged a dharna in front of the Bandra railway station for an hour, demanding that they be allowed to return to their native places.

Earlier, around 4 pm, the migrants, who had begun to gather at different places in Mumbai before the PM addressed the nation, began to arrive at the Bandra Railway Terminus, from where several outstation trains depart.

Before long, the crowds swelled to anywhere 4,000 to 5,000 people.

Disappointed by the lack of announcement from the Prime Minister to make available trains for them to head back home, the aggrieved migrants - who are mostly from north-Indian States -- staged a dharna in front of the Bandra railway station, flouting the prohibitory orders banning the assembly of four or more persons enforced all over the State.

In an apparent intelligence failure, the police personnel deployed in relatively small numbers were taken by surprise to see such large crowds arriving at the Bandra railway terminus. However, they called for additional reinforcements to control the crowds. After exhorting the crowds of migrants to disperse, the police resorted to mild lathi-charge.

The senior police personnel also appealed to the migrant workers that it was in their interest that they stayed back in the State. “The State Government has made all arrangements for his stay and will take care of needs like shelter, food and drugs in the coming days,” a senior police officer announced.

At one stage, Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique also tried to calm the migrants down, by appealing to them to disperse and promised to take up their issue with the Maharashtra Government.

The situation began to return to normal slowly. At round 6 pm, Mumbai Police spokesperson and Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranaya Ashok announced that “the crowds had dispersed”. The local police officials also said that the situation in front of the Bandra railway station “is very much under control” and steps were afoot to sanitise the entire area as a precautionary measure.

Significantly enough, the two-hour-long high-voltage drama took place in front of the Bandra Railway Terminus which is barely two kilometres away from “Matoshri”, the private residence of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray at Kalanagar, Bandra (east).

Reacting to the explosive emerging situation at the Bandra railway station, Shiv Sena leader and State Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray swiftly took to twitter, to blame the Modi Government for the situation. “The current situation at Bandra Station, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the Union Govt not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home for migrant labour. They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Aditya tweeted.

Aditya followed it up with another tweet which was somewhat mild in nature. “The migrant labour issue persists everywhere. Even as we house more than 6 lakh migrant labour, with breakfast lunch and dinner, the Union and State Govts are coordinating on further relief for the same. We will continue to ensure the comfort of all migrant labour in our camps,” he said.

In his third tweet put apparently after he was reined by his Chief Minister-father Uddhav Thackeray, Aditya acknowledged that the Centre had taken cognisance of the situation. “The Centre has taken immediate cognisance of the issue and is assisting the State actively. We understand the Catch 22 situation the Centre and the States face. I’m thankful to PM & HM for understanding the situation, while trying to ensure the safety of home States of migrants,” he said.

State Home Minister Amit Deshmukh, who was all fire and brimstone when he reacted to the situation at the Bandra railway station, laid the blame squarely at the door of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who, he said, had let down the migrant workers who were hoping that Modi would make an announcement that would facilitate them to return to their native places.

“Migrant labourers come to Maharashtra in large numbers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and other northern States. Today, they were hoping that the Prime Minister would make some announcement which would give them an opportunity to return to their native places. In that hope, the people had gathered in large numbers in front of Bandra railway station,” Deshmukh said.

“Following today’s decision, the States are being sealed and people are being not allowed to go from one State and another State... The migrants were hoping against hope that the Prime Minister would make an announcement that would facilitate them to return to their native places. But, the Prime Minister let the migrants down badly. That was the reason for the presence of migrants in front of the Bandra railway station,” the State Home Minister said.

Deshmukh and Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh said that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had discussed with Modi the issue of sending the migrants to their homes, but the Centre had announced extension of the lockdown till May 3 without addressing the concerns of the migrant workers.

Former Mumbai Congress president Sanjay Nirupam was matter of fact when said: “This was bound to happen. People have no food to eat. They are being prevented from returning to their native villages. For how long can they remain like this? The Government’s figures are merely on paper… For how long and to how many people can any Government keep feeding freely, is there no alternative?”.

Maharashtra State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that had the Prime Minister given time to the migrants to return home, they would not have come to the streets like in Mumbai, Delhi, Surat and other places.

“The State Government can provide them food, but cannot send them to their homes in view of the lockdown,” Sawant said.

Trade Unions Joint Action Committee Maharashtra convener Vishwas Utagi was equally critical of the Prime Minister. He said that there are over two million migrants stuck in Mumbai since the March 25 lockdown, besides 3,000 fishermen stranded at Gholvad in south Gujarat.

“They have no food, no work, no homes, no transport to go home. How can they survive? The Government machinery is not responding to the challenge and this is a human tragedy in other parts of the country also,” Utagi said.

Meanwhile Opposition BJP MP Poonam Mahajan demanded that the State Government take special measures to look after the migrants in Mumbai. “The State Government has failed on this front. That’s why saw chaos in front of the Bandra railway station,” she said.

Slamming the State Government for its failure to enforce prohibitory orders leading to chaos in front of the Bandra railway station, former MP and BJP State vice-president Kirit Somaiya said: “Whatever happened in front of Bandra railway station is matter of deep concern… What about intelligence? The State Government must take this incident seriously and modify its schemes to provide food to the migrants”.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/restive-migrants-lose-patience--stage-protest-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/restive-migrants-lose-patience--stage-protest.html
204,15-4-20,Stray dogs may have played role in novel coronavirus origin: Study,"Scientists tracing signatures of the novel coronavirus across different species, have proposed that stray dogs -- specifically dog intestines -- may have contributed to the origin of the pandemic.

According to the study, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, many animals, beginning with snakes and most recently, pangolins, have all been put forth as the likely intermediate hosts transmitting the virus, SARS-CoV-2, from bats to humans

However, according to Xuhua Xia from the University of Ottawa in Canada, the viruses isolated from these animals are too divergent from SARS-CoV-2.

""Our observations have allowed the formation of a new hypothesis for the origin and initial transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"" Xia said.

""The ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and its nearest relative, a bat coronavirus, infected the intestine of canids, most likely resulting in a rapid evolution of the virus in canids and its jump into humans,"" Xia said.

With scientists across the world scrambling to identify the species of origin to understand how the new coronavirus first leapt from its animal hosts to humans, the researcher believes the findings highlight the need for monitoring SARS-like coronaviruses in feral dogs.

According to Xia, the current study is based on the battle scars viruses get from fighting off and evading the host's immune system using adaptations found within their genomes.

He said humans and mammals have a key antiviral protein, called ZAP, which can stop a virus in its tracks by preventing its multiplication in the host and degrading its genome.

Xia said ZAP targets a pair of chemical letters, called CpG dinucleotides, within its RNA genome.

However, the viruses can punch back, the study noted.

Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, can avoid ZAP by reducing the CpG, thus rendering the antiviral protein powerless, the University of Ottawa scientist said.

According to the researcher, one implication of this is that the remaining CpG dinucleotides on the viral genome are likely functionally important for the virus.

""Think of a decreased amount of CpG in a viral pathogen as an increased threat to public health, while an increased amount of CpG decreases the threat of such viral pathogens,"" said Xia.

In the study, Xia examined all 1,252 full-length betacoronavirus genomes deposited into GenBank -- an open access database of genetic sequences.

He found that SARS-CoV-2, and its most closely related known relative, a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13), have the lowest amount of CpG among its close coronavirus relatives.

""The most striking pattern is an isolated but dramatic downward shift in viral genomic CpG in the lineage leading to BatCoV RaTG13 which was reported to be sampled from a bat (Rhinolophus affinis) in Yunnan Province in 2013, but only sequenced by Wuhan Institute of Virology after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in late 2019,"" Xia said.

""This bat CoV genome is the closest phylogenetic relative of SARS-CoV-2, sharing 96 per cent sequence similarity,"" he added.

The downshifting in CpG might have served as a warning due to two highly significant implications, the scientists said.

""First, the virus likely evolved in a tissue with high ZAP expression which favours viral genomes with a low CpG,"" Xia explained.

""Second and more importantly, survival of the virus indicates that it has successfully evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense. In other words, the virus has become stealthy and dangerous to humans,"" he added.

When Xia examined the data in dogs, he found that only genomes from canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), which had caused a highly contagious intestinal disease worldwide in dogs, have CpG values similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13.

The known cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell is ACE2 is also made in the human digestive system, at the highest levels in the small intestine and duodenum, with relatively low expression in the lung.

Based on this, the scientists suggested that the mammalian digestive system is likely to be a key target infected by coronaviruses.

Humans are the only other host species Xia observed to produce coronavirus genomes with low genomic CpG values.

Canids are often observed to lick their anal and genital regions, not only during mating but also in other circumstances.

Such behaviour, the scientist said, would facilitate viral transmission from the digestive system to the respiratory system.

Based on his results, Xia presents a scenario in which the coronavirus first spread from bats to stray dogs eating bat meat.

Next, he said, the strong selection against CpG in the viral RNA genome in canid intestines may have resulted in rapid evolution of the virus leading to reduced genomic CpG.

A reduced viral genomic CpG may have then allowed the virus to evade human ZAP-mediated immune response and became a severe human pathogen, Xia said.

""This study suggests that important evidence of viral evolution can be revealed by consideration of the interaction of host defenses with viral genomes, including selective pressure exerted by host tissues on viral genome composition,"" Xia added.

205,15-4-20,"We all would benefit from strong, united voice from UNSC: UN spokesman on COVID-19","As the world battles the deadly novel coronavirus, nations will benefit from a strong, united voice from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to deal with such a crisis, a spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres said days after the powerful UN arm met for the first time to discuss the pandemic.

The UN secretary-general's spokesman Stephane Dujarric replied to a query at the daily press briefing on Tuesday when asked whether Guterres was disappointed about the bare press elements issued by the 15-nation Council last week and if he wanted to see a resolution on the lines that were issued on HIV and Ebola outbreaks.

The UNSC met for the first time last week to discuss the pandemic and underlined the need for unity and solidarity with those affected by the COVID-19 and expressed support for the efforts of Guterres on the potential impact of the pandemic.

The Council, meeting under the Presidency of the Dominican Republic, held a closed video-conference session in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on the issues that fall under the Security Council's mandate. Guterres had also briefed the Council.

All I would say on the Security Council is that we would obviously all benefit in any situation from a strong, united voice from the Security Council, Dujarric said.

In Press Elements issued following the meeting, the UNSC said Members expressed their support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected.

Briefing the Council, Guterres had said that the world faces its gravest test since the founding of the United Nations 75 years ago and there is fear that the worst is yet to come especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict.

Guterres stressed that the engagement of the Security Council will be critical to mitigate the peace and security implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indeed, a signal of unity and resolve from the Council would count for a lot at this anxious time, he said.

The Council was seen as missing in action as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the world.

According to the Johns Hopkins University data, the pandemic, which originated in Wuhan City of central China's Hubei province in November, has so far infected 1.97 million people and killed at least 126,500 people globally.

206,15-4-20,Rio de Janeiro governor has coronavirus,"Rio de Janeiro Governor Wilson Witzel, a leading opponent of President Jair Bolsonaro's calls to relax COVID-19 containment measures, said Tuesday he had tested positive for the new coronavirus.

In a video posted to Twitter, Witzel said he had started feeling unwell Friday, with a fever, sore throat and loss of smell, a key symptom of the virus.

""Today, the test result came back positive... Now, thank God, I'm feeling better, and will continue working while following my doctors' advice,"" said Witzel, 52.

""I ask you once again to stay at home, because this disease, as everyone can see, spreads quickly and doesn't spare anyone.""

Along with Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, Witzel has been one of the leading proponents for closing non-essential businesses and ordering people to stay home to slow the spread of the disease.

On Monday he extended Rio de Janeiro's stay-at-home measures until April 30.

Those policies have been attacked by Bolsonaro, who accuses them of needlessly wrecking Latin America's biggest economy over a disease the far-right president has compared to a ""little flu"".

Witzel fired back last month that Bolsonaro's defiance of guidelines from the United Nations and World Health Organization could be considered a ""crime against humanity"".

Rio de Janeiro state, home to 16 million people, has registered 224 deaths from the virus so far, second only to Sao Paulo.

207,15-4-20,France reports 762 more coronavirus deaths,"France on Tuesday reported 762 more COVID-19 deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, bringing its total toll from the epidemic to 15,729.

The number of confirmed cases in France now exceeds 100,000, health official Jerome Salomon told reporters, adding however that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the sixth day in a row, by 91 to 6,730 Despite the heavy new death toll, Salomon said that the latest data confirmed that France's month-long lockdown was beginning to have an effect.

""We have observed a plateau over the last days... Thanks to your efforts and the lockdown we have managed to limit the spread of the virus,"" he said.

The new toll was released after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said that the epidemic ""was beginning to steady"" in France and added the lockdown could begin to be eased from May 11.

The details of how the lockdown will be eased have yet to be made clear and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner emphasised that the date was not set in stone and depended on positive trends continuing.

""May 11 is an objective,"" he told France Inter radio. ""It is a date that we must achieve by respecting the lockdown,"" he said.

The most controversial announcement by Macron was that schools would open gradually from May 11, even though cafes and cultural venues would stay shut.

""We have found contradictions in this speech,"" Francette Popineau, General Secretary of Snuipp-FSU teachers' union told AFP.

""We understood that there was to be an end to the confinement as of 11 May, but what we did not understand was why restaurants would be closed and why canteens would be open, why cinemas would be closed and why schools would be open,"" she added.

Macron in his speech also indicated that a COVID-19 vaccine would be the only long-term solution, adding there was no evidence of so-called herd immunity among people in France with only a minority of people infected.

Salomon said the estimates based on modelling indicated that around 5-10 percent of the French population had been infected, but it varied according to region.

The official number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in France is now 103,573 but officials believe this is vastly understated due to a lack of testing. (AFP)

As of Tuesday, more than 6,05,000 Americans had tested positive for the novel coronavirus -- more than the other top three countries taken together -- according to Johns Hopkins University.

A record number of 2,129 of Americans died in one single day, the previous highest being 2,074 on April 10. New York has become the epicentre of the country's outbreak with 2,03,020 confirmed cases and 10,842 deaths so far.

In total, 25,981 Americans have died due to the deadly virus, Johns Hopkins University said.

""The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light, US President Donald Trump told reporters during his daily White House news conference on the pandemic.

""We see that tunnel, and at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We are starting to see it more than ever before. We have held our numbers, everything we have done we have been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it, he said.

Trump said the United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain, he said.

There are more than 16,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment, he said referring to the steps he has taken to fight coronavirus in the country.

The US Food and Drug Administration, he said, has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients.

It is the first one. These test can be self-administered by patients in healthcare settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 test daily, he added.

209,15-4-20,Smell-taste loss most pronounced Covid sign,"High fever first symptom: Study

If you have smell and taste loss, you are 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than others, though high fever remains its most common first sign. According to a study published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the sensory return typically matched the timing of disease recovery.

The rate of recovery of smell and taste was high and occurred usually within two to four weeks of infection, said the study.

“Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection. The most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, but fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms,” said Carol Yan, MD, an otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon at UC San Diego Health, lead author of the study.

“We know Covid-19 is an extremely contagious virus. This study supports the need to be aware of smell and taste loss as early signs of Covid-19,” it said.

Yan and colleagues surveyed 1,480 patients with flu-like symptoms and concerns regarding potential Covid-19 infection who underwent testing at UC San Diego Health from March 3 through March 29, 2020. Within that total, 102 patients tested positive for the virus and 1,378 tested negative. The study included responses from 59 Covid-19-positive patients and 203 virus negative patients.

Yan said the study demonstrated the high prevalence and unique presentation of certain sensory impairments in patients positive with the pathogen. Of those who reported loss of smell and taste, the loss was typically profound, not mild.

“Our study not only showed that the high incidence of smell and taste is specific to Covid-19 infection, but we fortunately also found that for the majority of people sensory recovery was generally rapid,” said Yan.

Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70 per cent had reported improvement of smell at the time of survey and of those who hadn’t reported improvement many had only been diagnosed recently.

Interestingly, the researchers found that persons who reported experiencing a sore throat more often tested negative for Covid-19.

In an effort to decrease risk of virus transmission, UC San Diego Health now includes loss of smell and taste as a screening requirement for visitors and staff, as well as a marker for testing patients who may be positive for the virus, said a statement from Eurekalert.

Other known symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, fatigue, cough and difficulty breathing. Respondents in Yan’s study were most often persons with milder forms of Covid-19 infection who did not require hospitalisation or intubation.

The findings, she said, underline the importance of identifying early or subtle symptoms of Covid-19 infection in people who may be at risk of transmitting the disease as they recuperate within the community.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/smell-taste-loss-most-pronounced-covid-sign-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/smell-taste-loss-most-pronounced-covid-sign.html

211,15-4-20,Apple makes Maps users' data available to fight COVID-19,"In a bid to help health authorities further mitigate the impact on COVID-19 globally, Apple has released users mobility data trends tool from Apple Maps.

This mobility data can provide helpful insights to local governments and health authorities and may also be used as a foundation for new public policies by showing the change in volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit in their communities.

The new Apple ‘Mobility Data Trends' website is more like the Google initiative that is now offering user location data via its Maps to help public health officials spot increase or decrease of movement across high-level categories of places, to help them flatten the curve of coronavirus pandemic.

""Maps does not associate mobility data with a user's Apple ID, and Apple does not keep a history of where a user has been,"" the company said in a statement late Tuesday.

Using aggregated data collected from Apple Maps, the new website indicates mobility trends for major cities and 63 countries or regions.

The information is generated by counting the number of requests made to Apple Maps for directions.

The data sets are then compared to reflect a change in volume of people driving, walking or taking public transit around the world.

""Data availability in a particular city, country, or region is subject to a number of factors, including minimum thresholds for direction requests made per day,"" said Apple.

Data collected by Maps, like search terms, navigation routing, and traffic information, is associated with random, rotating identifiers that continually reset, so Apple doesn't have a profile of your movements and searches.

""This enables Maps to provide a great experience, while protecting user privacy,"" said the company.

Among other COVID-19 initiatives, Apple said it has sourced and donated over 20 million face masks for medical professionals on the front lines around the world.

Apple has also brought together teams across the company and its suppliers to design and produce face shields, and is shipping 1 million face masks per week to the areas that need them most.

217,15-4-20,Jasleen Royal: There's a lack of female composers,"Music composer and singer Jasleen Royal points at the fact that there are few female composers in the Indian music industry.

""I want to see more women in key roles in our music industry. I want to see them taking Indian music scene to a higher level. Today, the situation is better -- more female solo singers have come up, but there is still a lack of female composers. I really want to see that change in the upcoming time,"" Jasleen told IANS.

Jasleen, who is the voice behind hits such as ""Love you zindagi"" (""Dear Zindagi"") and ""Nachde ne saare"" (""Baar Baar Dekho""), had created singles like ""Panchhi ho javan"", ""Mai ni"" and ""Din shagna da"" before stepping into Bollywood. She had also appeared in the first season of the reality TV talent hunt show ""India's Got Talent"". One the show, she was given the tag of a one-woman band as she is able to collectively play different musical instruments while singing.

On recalling her journey so far and how she carved a niche for herself, Jasleen got emotional.

""I am really grateful for all the opportunities and for the people who gave me work. It's been a long journey. I got a chance to work with Karan Johar sir and Zoya Akhtar ma'm at such an initial stage of my career. That was really something big for me,"" she said.

Jasleen believes in creating good music and paying less attention to the result. ""There were days when I felt like my songs were not working. I started doubting myself. I remember when 'Din shagna' came out, initially it didn't do well. It hardly reached out to the masses. Then, suddenly a few months later when Anushka-Virat got married, the song was playing in the background of their videos and it became viral! It was playing everywhere. I made a jingle for Paytm and it became viral after demonetisation. So, I believe one should do their best and not worry much about the result.

220,15-4-20,Jordan Peele explains why he didn't direct 'Candyman' remake,"Filmmaker Jordan Peele says he handed over the reins of ""Candyman"" remake to director Nia DaCosta as he would have messed it up.

Peele, who won an Oscar for his directorial ""Get Out"", has co-written and co-produced the new project which will be a ""retelling"" of the 1992 horror film.

The original film featured Tony Todd as the hook-wielding supernatural killer who, according to a legend, appears after his name is called five times. It was directed by Bernard Rose from a Clive Barker's script.

The remake, featuring Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in the lead, has been directed by DaCosta, who is best known for 2018 thriller ""Little Woods"".

In an interview with Empire magazine, Peele explained why he decided against directing the film.

""I was working on 'Us' when this would have happened. But quite honestly, Nia is better to shoot this than I am. I'm way too obsessed with the original tales in my head. I probably wouldn't be any good.

""But Nia has a steady manner about her which you don't see a lot in the horror space. She's refined, elegant, every shot is beautiful. It's a beautiful, beautiful movie. I'm so glad I didn't mess it up,"" the filmmaker said.

The new film has been described as a ""spiritual sequel"" to the original with the story returning to the same neighbourhood where the legend of Candyman began, a section of Chicago where the Cabrini-Green housing projects once stood.

DaCosta said she felt a ""sense of ownership"" in telling ""a Black story about Black people"".

""It was very important for all of us to have our main character be Black, and for this experience to be through the Black lens. Let's make sure we change the lens now,"" she added.

Produced by Peele's Monkeypaw Productions in collaboration with MGM and Bron Creative, ""Candyman"" is scheduled to be released on September 25 in the US.

Addressing the daily briefing to provide updates on coronavirus situation in the country, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said that states have been asked to classify districts which have reported a higher number of cases as hotspots, the districts where cases have been reported as non-hotspots, and green zones where no cases have been reported.

""Hotspots are those districts which are reporting more number of cases or where the rate of growth of COVID-19 cases is high,"" Agarwal said, adding a detailed direction has been issued to states stating consolidated efforts are required to utilise this period of lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.

227,15-4-20,COVID-19 pandemic worse than 2008-09 financial crisis: IMF,"The contraction in the global economy is much worse than the 2008-09 financial crisis, a top IMF official said on Wednesday, urging the governments to take swift concerted action with fiscal tools taking a prime role to contain the COVID-19 spread and limit the damage to livelihoods.

Speaking to PTI ahead of the annual spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank here, Vitor Gaspar, Director of Fiscal Affairs Department, International Monetary Fund, said the COVID-19 pandemic was hitting economies through multiple channels.

""The pandemic outbreak is causing supply disruptions and the social distancing efforts necessary to contain the spread of the virus have imposed a large burden on workers and their families,"" he said.

""The expected speed and depth of the contraction in the global economy is unprecedented, much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. As such, there is no doubt that the government needs to take swift concerted action with fiscal tools taking a prime role to contain the virus' spread and limit the damage to livelihoods of people,"" Gasper said.

The governments can offer emergency lifelines to save lives — by preventing, controlling, treating and containing the virus — help families by protecting jobs and income, and support firms especially to avoid bankruptcies.

Countries are already taking significant fiscal measures amounting to about USD 8 trillion globally. Moving forward, governments can play a role to enable a recovery once the pandemic is contained, he said.

Noting that the coronavirus is having a profound impact around the globe, he said the human cost of the pandemic has intensified at an alarming rate, with confirmed cases in almost every part of the world.

It is affecting the productive capacity of countries as the containment measures implies less people working and disruptions to supply chains.

It is affecting demand, as fewer jobs and less income means less spending locally and globally.

Countries are also affected by the tightening of global financial conditions and some are hit by capital outflows. Finally, the large fall in commodity prices is hurting commodity (especially oil) exporters. What started as a health crisis is now a major global economic crisis, he said.

When asked what steps needed to be taken, Gasper said the first priorities are containment measures and support for health systems should continue.

Defeating the virus and defending people's health are necessary.This requires fully accommodating additional spending on health and emergency services. Global coordination is necessary to support countries with limited health capacity, including by providing medical supplies and expertise, grants, and concessional emergency financing, and to develop universally low-cost vaccines and medicine, he said.

""Meanwhile, large, timely, temporary, and targeted fiscal measures are needed to protect the most-affected people and viable firms, including in hard-to-reach informal sectors. Such support can provide cushion to output and essential consumption because it alleviates income drops for people with limited savings and reduces the likelihood of bankruptcies,"" he said.

As the virus is contained and people return to work, broad-based fiscal measures become more effective. Depending on access to markets and the availability of fiscal space, such broad-based fiscal stimulus could facilitate the recovery.

Monetary accommodation and liquidity facilities will also play an important role in reducing stress in financial systems. Central banks' liquidity support to the private sector, including loan and guarantees, should be transparently managed to mitigate potential risks, Gasper said.

""Our key message for policymakers is to do whatever it takes to save lives and livelihoods, but make sure to keep the receipts,"" he said.

In the near term, the priority for all countries is to accommodate health sector spending needs. They should also provide emergency lifelines to support families and firms affected by the crisis. But these measures can have sizable and long-lasting effects on government budgets and debts, he said.

There are three guiding principles countries should follow. First, target support to households to ensure access to basic goods and services and to a decent standard of living. To avoid permanent scarring, target support to viable businesses to limit layoffs and bankruptcies, he said.

Second, resources should be deployed in a temporary and efficient way and reflect the costs in multi-year fiscal reports. It is critical to ensure good governance in the use of resources. That should include accurate accounting; frequent, timely and complete disclosure of information; and the adoption of procedures to allow for ex-post evaluation and accountability.

Third assess, monitor, and disclose the fiscal risks of all the measures and programs. For example, government guarantees extended on loans to firms may have no upfront impact on the deficit or public debt, but the costs will eventually fall on the government if businesses fail to repay the loans, the IMF official said.

""Another key message is that this is a global crisis and comprehensive and coordinated action is necessary, including to support countries with limited health capacity and financing constraints through grants, concessional loans, and medical aid, as well as to develop a universally low-cost vaccine,"" he said.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-pandemic-worse-than-2008-09-financial-crisis--imf-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/covid-19-pandemic-worse-than-2008-09-financial-crisis--imf.html
228,15-4-20,Iran says world learning US 'kills people' after WHO move,"Iran said Wednesday the world is learning that the United States ""kills people"", after President Donald Trump suspended US funding for the World Health Organization amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Trump has accused the UN body of covering up the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak in China before it spread around the world.

The US president on Tuesday ordered that payments amounting to $400 million be halted pending a review of the WHO's role in allegedly ""severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus"".

The death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic has topped 125,000 around the world, with more than two million people infected by the disease since December.

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif likened the funding freeze to Washington's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against his country.

The United States launched a campaign of crippling sanctions against Iran in 2018 after Trump unilaterally withdrew from a nuclear deal.

""The shameful defunding of WHO amid a pandemic will live in infamy,"" Zarif wrote on Twitter.

""The world is learning what Iran has known & experienced all along,"" he said.

""US regime's bullying, threatening & vainglorious blathering isn't just an addiction: it kills people."" Iran itself is battling the Middle East's most deadly outbreak which has left over 4,700 dead and more than 76,300 infected.

229,15-4-20,Coronavirus in bats affecting humans is rare: ICMR,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday said that coronavirus in bats affecting humans is a rare incident, maybe, once in a thousand years.

Responding to a question asked by IANS at the daily media briefing of ministries about coronavirus pandemic, Head Scientist of ICMR Dr Raman Gangakhedkar said that the incident of coronavirus found in bats was a rare incident.

""Coronavirus is also found in bats. In the research conducted in China, it was found that coronavirus might have originated due to mutation in bats and affected humans. There is another possibility that bats might have transmitted the virus to mammals called pangolin and from pangolins, it got transmitted to humans,"" said Dr Gangakhedkar.

Talking about recent research conducted by the ICMR on Indian species of bats, Dr Khedkar said, ""We also conducted research and surveillance on bats in order to check if emerging infectious diseases are found in bats, we learnt that there are two types of bats, which carry coronavirus. But it was not capable of affecting humans. It's rare, maybe once in 1000 years that the virus gets transmitted from bats to humans,"" said the ICMR chief scientist.

A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) found the presence of a bat coronavirus in bat species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. There have been studies and theories that the coronavirus pandemic which spread from Wuhan in China had originated from bats.

The etiology and most facts still remain unknown about the novel coronavirus which has brought the entire world into a lockdown situation. The scientific community across the world continues to search about its origin.

230,15-4-20,Afghan girls try building ventilator from used car parts,"A team of robot-designing girls in Afghanistan is trying to build a low-cost medical ventilator from car parts, as health authorities look to boost critical-care capabilities for coronavirus patients in the impoverished country.

If the teenagers succeed and can get government approval for their prototype, they say it could be replicated for as little as $300, where normally ventilators sell for around $30,000.

""The team is working with local health specialists, as well as experts from Harvard University, to produce the prototype based on a design by Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"" said Roya Mahboob, who runs an Afghan tech company and sponsors the team of five girls, aged 14-17.

They are part of a bigger group of high-achieving high school girls known as the ""Afghan Dreamers"", from the western city of Herat, where coronavirus is on the rise after thousands of people returned from neighbouring Iran as it experienced a spike in cases.

The girls made headlines in 2017 after being denied visas to take part in a robotics competition in Washington -- before President Donald Trump intervened and they were allowed to travel.

They are taking engine and battery parts from a Toyota Corolla -- ubiquitious on the streets of Afghanistan -- to produce a prototype they started designing after the Herat governor called for more ventilators as coronavirus cases rose.

Central to the ventilator is a self-inflating plastic sac known as an Ambu bag that medical staff use to help patients breathe. The girls' prototype uses a mechanical system to operate the bag automatically and accurately.

""The complicated part is how to adjust the timing and pressure of pumping, as different patients require different volume and pressure of air based on their age and the severity of their condition,"" Somaya Farooqi, the team's 17-year-old captain, told AFP.

With a population of 35 million, Afghanistan only has about 300 ventilators. Wahidullah Mayar, a spokesman for Afghanistan's health ministry, said officials have asked specialists and engineers to help the team.

""We appreciate and encourage these hardworking girls, our sisters, for their efforts to produce ventilators,"" Mayar said.

Any ventilator prototype would have to be approved by the World Health Organization and the Afghan health ministry before the team could start producing more devices, Mayar said.

As of Wednesday, Afghan officials had reported at least 784 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths across the country. The true number of cases is feared to be much higher, as only limited testing kits are available.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/afghan-girls-try-building-ventilator-from-used-car-parts-2020-04-15.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/afghan-girls-try-building-ventilator-from-used-car-parts.html
